      "text": "'Enemy of civil rights': This 'key cog in conservatives' vision' will lead crucial DOJ division\n\nFILE PHOTO: President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon, speaks during the AmericaFest 2024 conference sponsored by conservative group Turning Point in Phoenix, Arizona, U.S. December 20, 2024. REUTERS/Cheney Orr/File Photo\n\nHarmeet Dhillon, a far-right attorne y who was confirmed by the Senate to head the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division on Thursday, has been called an \"enemy of civil rights\" by some commentators.\n\nPicked for the position by President Donald Trump , Dhillon was confirmed by the Senate with a vote of 52-45.\n\nIn the 2022 midterm elections, Dhillon's firm played a significant role in numerous Republican initiatives aimed at challenging election results in critical states, especially in Arizona. There, she was employed by Kari Lake, a former gubernatorial candidate, and Abraham Hamadeh, a former candidate for attorney general, both of whom denied the legitimacy of the election.\n\nAn MSNBC article published Friday argued that this development promotes a MAGA supporter who has aimed to weaken the civil rights of many Americans to a key position that is meant to protect those rights.\n\n\"Dhillon is a key cog in conservatives' vision for 'lawfare' - that is, weaponization of the law against political opponents,\" wrote Ja'han Jones, an MSNBC opinion blogger.\n\nJones noted that she co-chaired the group \"Lawyers for Trump.\"\n\n\"She and her law firm have arguably been as rabid as anyone in attacking Americans' voting rights and pushing bogus claims that Trump was cheated out of victory in the 2020 presidential election,\" the article said.\n\nIn late 2022, Dhillon unsuccessfully attempted to unseat Ronna McDaniel as the chair of the Republican National Committee. Dhillon's primary argument during this campaign was that the GOP should allocate more resources for a larger team of lawyers to support conservatives in their legal battles and limit Americans' access to voting.\n\n\"She is, in a variety of ways, an enemy of civil rights. And if you've been watching Trump's other selections for top government posts, most of whom are antagonistic to the goals of the agencies they now lead, the reason Dhillon was chosen seems clear: to pervert the DOJ's civil rights division and ensure it suits Trump's illiberal ambitions,\" the MSNBC article said.\n\nAnother article published in Democracy Docket Thursday said: \"Dhillon has been a fixture in the GOP and a close ally of Trump since his first administration.\"\n\n\"She served as a legal advisor to Trump's 2020 campaign and, as votes were still being counted in key swing states, went on Fox Business to spread election conspiracy theories, calling on the U.S. Supreme Court to step in and help Trump win,\" the article added.\n\nBefore Dhillon's confirmation, a group of 75 civil rights groups sent a letter seeking opposition to her nomination. Led by the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the letter said Dhillon's track record is \"disqualifying.\"\n\n\"Ms. Dhillon's lack of independence and record of going after the rights of the very people that she would have the duty to defend is disqualifying,\" the letter reads.\n\n\"With the attacks on our multiracial democracy and civil and human rights already underway at the DOJ, it is critical that the Civil Rights Division fulfill its responsibility to vigorously enforce the nation's landmark civil rights laws,\" it added."

      "text": "'Raw animosity': 4 conservatives explain why MAGA voters 'want their opponents to suffer'\n\nIn the 2024, voters who helped put Donald Trump back in the White House ranged from hardcore MAGA Republicans to swing voters and independents - some of them 2020 Joe Biden voters - who blamed the Biden Administration for inflation. The economy was a major concern of Biden-to-Trump voters, and the term \"buyer's remorse\" is being used in connection with swing voters and independents who now regret voting for Trump and are worried about steep new tariffs or possible cuts to Social Security.\n\nBut diehard MAGA voters have no regrets about voting for Trump. In a conversation published by the New York Times' opinion section on March 21, four conservative columnists - David Brooks, David French, Bret Stephens and Ross Douthat - lay out some reasons why those voters continue to be diehard Trump supporters.\n\nThe writers aren't promoting Trump's policies during the conversation - French, in fact, is very much a Never Trump conservative - but rather, are explaining the president's unending appeal to his hardcore MAGA base.\n\nBrooks cited \"brokenism\" as a key reason for their support. The columnist describes \"brokenism\" as \"the idea that everything is broken and we just need to burn it all down.\"\n\nBrooks told his Times colleagues , \"Personally, I think some things are broken and some things are OK, but most of my Trump-supporting friends are brokenists. They get this from media consumption.\"\n\nFrench, who is a scathing critic of Trump but also has major complaints about the left, interjected, \"In addition to the brokenism that David talks about, there's a strong undercurrent of raw animosity in our politics. Republicans and Democrats have very negative views of each other, and many Republicans, sadly, want their opponents to suffer. They're actually happy to see people lose their jobs or to see nonprofits lose funding if those people are perceived as part of the 'deep state' or RINOs. So, yes, Republicans want a disruptive president, but who's being disrupted really matters - and if it's the government or institutions that many Republicans believe are hostile to them, then Republicans are just fine with the pain.\"\n\nFrench added , \"Many Republicans dislike foreign aid. Or loathe elite universities. Or hate big liberal law firms. Students and professors at elite universities have a long track record of targeting the free speech rights of their conservative colleagues, and Republicans are rationalizing their own constitutional violations as fighting fire with fire.\"\n\nAccording to Brooks , diehard MAGA voters enjoy seeing him target institutions they feel excluded form.\n\nBrooks told French, Douthat and Stephens , \"I'd offer up one more word for consideration: 'exclusion.' Progressives really have spent the last few decades excluding conservative and working-class voices from a lot of institutions. Trump has gone after these institutions big time - the universities, the Department of Education, the State Department. Of course, the MAGA crowd feels justified revenge.\"\n\nDouthat alluded to the fact that Trump's strongest support continues to be within the MAGA movement.\n\nDouthat told his colleagues , \"First, I would stress that Trump is not terribly popular, and undoubtedly will become less so if the stock market trends down and recession fears mount. He has a commanding position within his party, but even at his apotheosis, his approval ratings barely got over 50 percent. Second, Americans lived through the first Trump term, when sky-is-falling rhetoric was commonplace, but the average American did not experience a crisis until COVID hit.\"\n\nRead the full New York Times article at this link (subscription required)."

      "text": "'This is a really stark break': SCOTUS conservatives split by 'raging' philosophical debate\n\nEven though the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) has a six-member conservative majority, that majority appears to be fracturing in a significant way.\n\nAccording to a recent Politico report , a philosophical debate has been \"raging\" between two different blocs of SCOTUS conservatives. One bloc includes Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas, with the other bloc consisting of Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh and Chief Justice John Roberts (though Politico clarified that Kavanaugh and Roberts have been more \"cagey\" than Barrett in where they stand).\n\nThe fracture appears to stem from a case the Court decided last week - Vidal v. Elster - concerning U.S. trademark law in a case that involves the maker of t-shirts featuring the phrase \"Trump Too Small.\" Justice Thomas wrote the majority opinion, which was shared at least in part by all other justices. But as College of William & Mary Law School professor Laura Heymann wrote for Bloomberg Law, the case exposed a \"potential rift\" among the majority - including one part of the decision where Barrett sided with the Court's liberal minority.\n\n\"[T]he various opinions in Vidal v. Elster turned out to be less about trademark law and more about the justices' diverging approaches to First Amendment analysis,\" Heymann wrote. \"Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Ketanji Brown Jackson, Elena Kagan, and Sonia Sotomayor agreed that the names clause was constitutional but pushed back strongly on the majority's history tourism, advancing instead a framework focused on trademark law's purpose.\"\n\nAnd according to Politico legal correspondent Josh Gerstein, Barrett unleashed on Thomas' legal expertise in her own concurring opinion. He quoted University of California-Berkeley law professor, who said the current debate \"raging\" among the majority goes beyond just the Vidal v. Elster case.\n\n\"I don't think this is about T-shirts at all,\" she said.\n\n\"Despite the trivial subject matter, Barrett squared off with Thomas in such a confrontational manner that they seemed to be really fighting about something else,\" Gerstein wrote. \"Barrett used unusually blunt terms to skewer Thomas' history-based rationale for denying the trademark. She described his approach as 'wrong twice over,' and she made clear that her gripes went far beyond this case alone.\"\n\nFormer Trump administration official Sarah Isgur - who is now a Supreme Court analyst - told Politico that the infighting between Barrett and Thomas showed \"a really stark break\" between the two conservative jurists. She opined that the source of the rift was about the rigid adherence to the doctrine of originalism versus a more modern view of interpreting the Constitution. To bolster that argument, she pointed to a separate opinion in Vidal v. Elster by Kavanaugh and Roberts.\n\n\"The Kavanaugh/Roberts opinion is really just a shorter version of what [Barrett] wrote,\" Isgur said.\n\nThis fracture could become more apparent in this week's pending decisions, which may include rulings on both former President Donald Trump's claim of absolute immunity from criminal prosecution, and a case brought by a January 6 rioter challenging the legality of a charge he shares with Trump ( Fischer, Joseph W. v. United States ). If the Court rules in favor of the plaintiff in that case, it could strike two of Department of Justice special counsel Jack Smith's four felony counts in his initial indictment of Trump in the D.C. election interference case."

      "text": "Conservatives have a lot to lose in America's 2nd 'Gilded Age': analysis\n\nDuring the 2024 presidential race, Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee (RNC) claimed that then-Vice President Kamala Harris and other Democrats were obsessed with culture-war issues when they needed to be focusing on the economy, inflation and the working class. A GOP ad famously said , \"Kamala is for they/them, President Trump is for you.\"\n\nHarris' campaign pushed back, warning that Trump's economic policies - from aggressive tariffs to tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires - would be terrible for the working class. But Trump's messaging worked: Trump won the popular vote by roughly 1.5 percent.\n\nWhen Trump was inaugurated on Monday, January 20, 2025, however, he was surrounded by tech billionaires - an image that, critics argued, was inconsistent with the message of economic populism he pushed during his campaign.\n\nIn an article published on March 2 , Politico's Joshua Zeitz draws a parallel between \"growing wealth inequality\" in 2025 and the Gilded Age of the 19th Century - and lays out some reasons why conservatives should be worried about this disparity.\n\n\"At his second inauguration, as President Donald Trump promised to usher America into a new 'golden age,'\" Zeitz observes , \"he was surrounded in the Capitol Rotunda by a handful of tech billionaires whose companies account for roughly one-fifth of the market cap of U.S. public equities. It was a not-so-subtle sign that the second Trump Administration will be staffed, advised and led by titans of wealth. Which means that Trump's golden age looks an awful lot like a new Gilded Age.\"\n\nZeitz continues , \"The Gilded Age was the era in the late 19th Century when business and industry dominated American life as never before or since. It was a period of unprecedented economic growth and technological progress, but also, of economic consolidation and growing wealth inequality. Titans of industry enjoyed enormous control over political institutions, while everyday Americans buckled under the strain of change. As the gap between the haves and the have-nots widened, political culture ultimately grew coarse - and violent. Then as now, growing income and wealth inequality opened a rift in American society, with a small group of elites amassing substantial power and influence.\"\n\nThe elites of the Gilded Age, Zeitz notes , included \"industrial magnates like John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie\" - whereas in 2025, they include Amazon's Jeff Bezos (who owns the Washington Post) and Tesla/SpaceX/X.com CEO Elon Musk.\n\n\"Despite Trump's mass appeal among white working-class voters - and the fact that he performed better with working-class voters of other races than ever before - his coziness with billionaires like Musk and his pursuit of an economic agenda that focuses on tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans both suggest that his presidency will be more of a boon to modern-day tycoons than the average working person,\" Zeitz explains . \"That could mean that the coming of America's second Gilded Age carries with it a warning for the GOP.\"\n\nZeitz adds , \"By the 1890s, the pendulum had swung so hard in the direction of wealth and industry that America's brittle social compact threatened to come undone. In response to the extremes of the Gilded Age, a wave of progressive reform swept the nation from the 1890s to the 1910s, fundamentally reordering the social compact between citizens and their government.\"\n\nJoshua Zeitz's full article for Politico is available at this link ."

      "text": "Nearly 54% of extreme conservatives say the federal government should use violence to stop illegal immigration\n\nDonald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric has been a staple of his political career, but his attacks on undocumented migrants turned more ominous during his 2024 presidential campaign .\n\nBeyond disparaging Haitians living in Springfield, Ohio , Trump in September compared undocumented immigration with a \" military invasion .\" And on a radio program in early October, Trump said immigrant criminals have \"bad genes .\"\n\nMany Americans want a more secure U.S.-Mexico border specifically and stricter immigration policy in general.\n\nBut a recent national survey I conducted with several immigration scholars found that many Americans would not stop there. Many respondents said violence would be justified to stop immigrants from entering the United States.\n\nOur survey, conducted in July 2024, asked 2,042 participants with varied racial and political backgrounds several questions regarding the use of violence against U.S. immigrants.\n\nOne question asked whether they thought the U.S. government \"should be allowed to use violence to halt unauthorized immigration.\"\n\nOnly 26% of participants agreed with the idea. But acceptance increased to 47% among respondents who identified as conservative and to nearly 54% among those who identified as extremely conservative.\n\nWe also asked whether \"individuals should be allowed to use violence to stop unauthorized immigration.\"\n\nThough only 11% of the overall participants agreed, 21% of those who identified as conservative and 41% of those who identified as extremely conservative thought vigilante violence against migrants was justified.\n\nFinally, in a question based on some incendiary comments made by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott , we asked whether \"the state of Texas should be allowed to shoot migrants who crossed the border without authorization.\"\n\nIn January 2024, Abbot had implied that Texas would be open to the idea of shooting those crossing illegally if state officers would not be prosecuted by the federal government.\n\nAmong the broader sample, only 12% agreed that Texas should be allowed to shoot border-crossers on sight. However, 24% of conservatives agreed with that statement, while 52% of extremely conservative respondents agreed.\n\nOur survey makes clear that a majority of Americans do not agree with using violence against migrants.\n\nYet, it surprised us that among certain sectors of the country, more than half of the people surveyed said migrants can and perhaps should be shot simply for unauthorized migration.\n\nScapegoating immigrants may be a politically advantageous strategy , but such rhetoric can have tragic implications.\n\nA 2014 study found that a political advertisement with mild violent metaphors was associated with higher support for political violence, especially among young participants. These findings point to a troubling way that violent rhetoric can eventually increase violent attitudes among a portion of the population.\n\nIn March, I traveled along the entire 808-mile Texas-Mexico border from Brownsville to El Paso. At the end of the four-day trip, I visited the Walmart in El Paso where a young man who espoused white supremacist views killed 23 people in August 2019.\n\nIn an online manifesto , written before the attack, the attacker said he was targeting the \"Hispanic invasion of Texas.\" This group, he added, would allow the \"pro open borders, free healthcare for illegals\" Democratic Party to rule the country.\n\nIn many ways, the shooter's language echoed the rhetoric of Trump , who was president at the time.\n\nDuring his 2015 presidential campaign, Trump had frequently referred to immigration as a dangerous foreign invasion.\n\nIn a July post on social media, he warned of \"THE INVASION OF MILLIONS OF ILLEGALS TKING OVER AMERICA!\" That same year, his campaign team wrote on Facebook, \" It's CRITICAL that we STOP THE INVASION .\"\n\nIn July 2018, he talked about the \"infestation\" of violent migrants coming into the country. In November of that same year, he warned that Democrats \"want America to be a giant sanctuary city for drug dealers, predators and bloodthirsty MS-13 killers\" - a reference to an international gang formed by Salvadoran immigrants.\n\nSome Trump supporters have embraced this kind of aggressive anti-immigrant stance.\n\nAt a Florida campaign rally Trump held in May 2019, a participant said the government should shoot migrants. Instead of condemning the idea, Trump joked that they could only get away with that statement in the Panhandle .\n\nI fear that a second Trump presidency full of violent, anti-immigrant rhetoric could drive more bloodshed.\n\nAs Amy Cooter, who studies extremism , points out, several militias with hostile attitudes about illegal immigration stand ready to engage in deportation and border security efforts.\n\nShe points to the example of two militia members found guilty of conspiracy to murder officers and employees of the U.S. government. They had plotted to shoot undocumented immigrants at the border - and planned to kill any Border Patrol officials who attempted to stop them.\n\nHostility toward immigrants is not new. But in the current political environment, my research suggests that another four years under Trump may lead to more anti-immigrant rhetoric. That, in turn, could foment more anti-immigrant attitudes and possibly violence.\n\nWilliam McCorkle , Assistant Professor of Education, College of Charleston\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Michael Vadon, CC BY-SA 2.0\n\nEven conservatives are angry about President Donald Trump's second time in office.\n\nThis according to Angelo Carusone, President of Media Matters, who identified instances where listeners have called into right-wing talk radio to voice their frustrations with the presidency, particularly about mass firings of federal workers by the Department of Government Efficiency. He outlined the findings with Tim Miller, host of the Bulwark Podcast.\n\n\"Usually the right wing is an echo chamber... especially with Trump . But that's not entirely the case - not from the hosts on right wing talk radio, but from the callers,\" Carusone said.\n\n\"Basically what you're saying is listening to the callers... you've got a couple examples of listeners who are calling in and b----ing about DOGE who are obviously conservative listeners,\" Miller said.\n\nCarusone said many of the callers are people who lost their jobs or know people who lost their jobs. \"They are appealing to these media figures to advocate in some way,\" he said. \"They're giving Trump the benefit of the doubt, but they're expressing frustration and they're hoping that people like [Sean] Hannity, or Clay Travis, can set the record straight.\"\n\nFor example , one listener called into Fox News host Sean Hannity's show: \"One of our tenants,\" they said, \"just recently got laid off from the USDA, and he's a stable vet, multiple deployments overseas. And yeah, the guy is without a job now, and I'm just afraid that, you know, stuff like this is going to get out there.\" They added that it's \"just a little concerning that we don't let these guys, you know, fall off the wagon here and get neglected, because they've done so much for our country.\"\n\n\"There's this moment where the callers are sort of putting things out there especially about the job losses and they're either saying it's overly broad, it's inconsiderate, that they're not part of the deep state and they are hoping that these figures will appeal to them,\" Carusone said.\n\nHe added that these callers did not seem to be an \"astroturf\" scenario where people were faking their identities. \"You can kind of tell the authenticity,\" he said. \"They're genuinely not trying to mess with their host. They're really hoping that they will exercise some leadership or maybe clarify for the administration.\"\n\n\"I'm very surprised by how many calls there are,\" he said later, \"because, just to take a step back, these call-in shows... have millions of listeners. People are getting call-ins all the time. They're screened. So if you're letting some of these calls through... it's like when somebody calls a member of Congress, they always assume that there's a certain number that are just like that that didn't actually call. It's the same thing here. If you're a radio host, if you're a show, you're letting some of these calls through, which means you're getting a lot of that topic.\"\n\nWatch the video below or at this link.\n\nThe Backlash Is Here: Trump Supporters Beg Right-Wing Hosts To Stop DOGE Firings by The Bulwark"

And according to The Guardian's David Smith , it is a prime example of \"Red Dawn conservatives\" reaching out to \"Dobbs dads.\"\n\n\"Red Dawn\" (starring Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheen) was a 1984 Hollywood action movie that depicted American teenagers fighting communists after a Soviet invasion of the United States.\n\nSmith describes \"Red Dawn conservatives\" as non-MAGA conservatives who \"value a strong national defense and traditional alliances\" and \"Dobbs dads\" as \"suburban Gen-X and Millennial fathers angered by the prospect of 'big government' making choices for their wives' and daughters' reproductive healthcare needs.\"\n\nThe two, according to Smith , have formed an unlikely pro-Harris alliance in this year's election.\n\n\"It is the latest attempt to find a snappy shorthand to describe the type of voters whose decisions are set to affect the whole of America and the world,\" Smith explains . \"That is because, in the absence of a national popular vote, the result of the presidential election is likely to come down to just tens of thousands of votes in seven swing states....

Tax policy will be among Trump's legislative priorities, but according to The Hill's Alexander Bolton , getting Republicans in the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives to reach an agreement may be challenging in the weeks ahead.\n\nBolton, in an article published on Friday, January 17 - only three days before Trump's inauguration - reports, \"House conservative proposals to raise corporate taxes to offset the cost of President-elect Trump's tax package are going over like lead balloons in the Senate, where Republicans are warning their House counterparts to back off. The Senate GOP argues that hiking corporate taxes could dampen economic activity, lead to foreign takeovers of U.S. corporations and result in job loss.\"\n\nSen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Oklahoma) is among the GOP senators who opposes House proposals to increase corporate tax rates.\n\nBolton quotes Mullin as saying , \"Absolutely not. We were trying to be competitive on the world stage when we dropped it to 21 percent. To raise that is not the way to get an economy going.\"\n\nMembers of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, Bolton notes , have proposed raising the cap on SALT (state and local tax) deductions \"for individuals and families by restricting state and local tax deductions for corporations.\" But Mullin and other Senate Republicans, according to Bolton, are rejecting that proposal as well.\n\n\"To offset SALT,\" Bolton quotes Mullin as saying , \"we don't raise corporate taxes to do that. That's not how we do that. Corporate taxes is the people that employ individuals. It doesn't just affect large corporations.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in the House, Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) - a major budget hawk - is open to increasing the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 25 percent.\n\nRoy told The Hill , \"I'm on the record as saying everything should be on the table, and I'm on the record of having said, 'Why should we just allow corporate taxes to stay in place, or think about lowering them, if.... we're not doing what we need to do on the individual tax rate side or if we're not balancing the budget or being deficit neutral?'\"\n\nRead The Hill's full article at this link ."

(AP Photo/Steve Helber)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Delivering his first address as a reinaugurated president, Donald Trump spoke directly to communities that had historically shunned his party.\n\n\"To the Black and Hispanic communities, I want to thank you for the tremendous outpouring of love and trust that you have shown me with your vote,\" Trump said. \"We set records, and I will not forget it. I've heard your voices in the campaign, and I look forward to working with you in the years to come.\"\n\nTrump, whose inauguration coincided with the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday , promised to \"strive together to make his dream a reality.\" It's a vow that many prominent Black and Hispanic civil rights leaders view skeptically . But among the conservatives of color who surround Trump, the moment was an endorsement of their biggest hopes, years in the making.\n\n\"This room was impossible twenty years ago,\" Rep. Byron Donalds , R-Fla., said Sunday evening during the \"Legacy of Freedom Ball,\" a gala of a few hundred mostly Black conservatives who gathered to ring in the new administration. \"But in 2024 not only are we back, but we're bringing Black people and Hispanic people into the Republican Party,\" Donalds told the crowd.\n\nTrump's comments alluded to the record margins he garnered among heavily Black and Hispanic regions of the country compared to past Republican presidential candidates. At galas preceding Trump's inauguration, conservative Black and Hispanic activists and lawmakers toasted to a new era in which many of them hope to play a larger role than in Trump's first term.\n\n\"There's so much that we expect from the president, and I believe he's going to deliver,\" said Virginia Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, an outspoken conservative who is running to become the state's first Black and female governor.\n\nEarle-Sears listed stricter immigration policies , cracking down on crime and reducing the federal government's role in education as priorities she believed would speak to Black Americans. \"Let's just give him a chance,\" she said.\n\nThe revelry came after a year of bifurcated messaging from the Trump campaign, which invested in appeals to Black and Hispanic voters while at the same time depicting immigrants and communities of color as violent criminals and the country as beset by diversity and inclusion policies that conservatives view as weakening the nation .\n\nBut Trump's divisive messages on \"Black jobs\" and \"Hispanic jobs\" spoke to a view of the economy and society that found salience with some voters, including voters of color , on top of concerns over inflation, rapid technological change and geopolitical unrest abroad.\n\nTrump gained a larger share of Black and Latino voters than he did in 2020, when he lost to Democrat Joe Biden - most notably among young Black and Hispanic male voters - according to AP VoteCast, a nationwide survey of more than 120,000 voters.\n\nOverall, about 16% of Black voters supported Trump in November, while about 8 in 10 voted for Democrat Kamala Harris. But that represented a shift from 2020 when only 8% of Black voters backed Trump and about 9 in 10 went for Biden. Among Hispanic voters, 43% voted for Trump in November, up from about one-third in 2020.\n\nBlack women are largely the exception to this shift - about 9 in 10 Black female voters supported Harris in 2024, similar to the share that backed Biden in 2020.\n\nAt the Hispanic Inaugural Ball the Saturday before Trump's inauguration, GOP members of Congress, state lawmakers and governors mingled with conservative activists and business executives from across the Western Hemisphere.\n\nLatin American leaders like Argentinian President Javier Milei and Paraguayan President Santiago Peña rubbed elbows with Republican members of Congress, including Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, Mexican actors and Hispanic business executives. Vivek Ramaswamy , Robert F. Kennedy Jr . and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott all made appearances.\n\n\"I don't think Trump gets enough credit for listening and tailoring his policies in part to what people want in these communities.\" said Francis Suarez, mayor of Miami. Suarez, who leads a city that is overwhelmingly Hispanic and sits at the nexus of the U.S. and Latin America, said Trump can maintain his support among Hispanic voters \"and grow it again. It just goes back to the basics.\"\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz rallied gala attendees by recounting the November election, in which many majority-Hispanic counties in his home state that had traditionally backed Democrats flipped to Trump. Cruz, who trailed Trump in many of those same counties as he ran for reelection, called the GOP's inroads with Hispanic voters \"unprecedented.\"\n\n\"The Rio Grande Valley has been bright blue for 100 years. Well, I'm here to tell you the Rio Grande Valley flipped red,\" said Cruz, who is Hispanic. \"That is a generational change for Texas, and it is a generational change for America.\"\n\nOther lawmakers took time to pitch a forward-looking vision.\n\n\"I think the biggest thing is that we're beginning to recognize we're Americans first. We have different backgrounds, but always share the same dreams. And that's what's happening across the board,\" said Rep. Burgess Owens, R-Utah, in an interview with The Associated Press. Owens is one of four Black Republicans in the House of Representatives.\n\nSen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, who was born in Bogotá, Colombia, rejected stereotypes of Hispanics as solely laborers or immigrants and asked the crowd to envision the country after the four years of Trump's term.\n\n\"In four years, America will understand the positive impact of the Hispanic community. And we're going to build an alliance between a free South America, a prosperous South America and a strong, free and prosperous United States of America,\" Moreno said.\n\n\"That's what we're going to get done over the next four years and it's going to be the Hispanic community that makes it happen.\"\n\nBlack conservatives are energized as well. The GOP did not add any new Black members to Congress this cycle, but activists are hoping to change that in the 2026 midterms. And Donalds, a Florida Republican and one of the most prominent Black surrogates for Trump on the campaign trail, joked to attendees to \"keep quiet\" about his ambition for higher office - speakers throughout the night referred to him as \"Governor Donalds.\"\n\nThe commingling scenes and aspirations were no accident.\n\nConservative groups like Bienvenido and the Black Conservative Federation, which hosted the balls, had worked for years behind the scenes to build up conservative Black and Hispanic organizing networks. And Trump's orbit has fostered friendly ties with Latin American's political right, most notably in Trump's friendship with then-Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro . Bolsonaro's wife attended Trump's inauguration.\n\nArgentina's Milei \"and I were friends before he was elected president,\" said Roger Stone, a longtime Trump confidant. \"We were pen pals, you know, over the internet. I'm a strong believer in him.\"\n\nSome in Trump's orbit hope Secretary of State Marco Rubio will deepen America's ties to right-wing Latin American leaders in the coming years.\n\nThe exuberance of the night reflected a desire among many Hispanic conservatives to solidify the party's inroads with Hispanic voters and increase their clout in the GOP.\n\n\"We're growing exponentially,\" said Jaime Florez, the Hispanic communications director for the Trump campaign.\n\nAnd who knows? \"The first Hispanic president of the United States might be here tonight,\" he added.\n\n___\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(Robert Franklin/South Bend Tribune via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Americans view college campuses as far friendlier to liberals than to conservatives when it comes to free speech , with adults across the political spectrum seeing less tolerance for those on the right, according to a new poll.\n\nOverall, 47% of adults say liberals have \"a lot\" of freedom to express their views on college campuses, while just 20% said the same of conservatives, according to polling from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the University of Chicago Forum for Free Inquiry and Expression.\n\nRepublicans perceive a stronger bias on campuses against conservatives, but Democrats see a difference too - about 4 in 10 Democrats say liberals can speak their minds freely on campuses, while about 3 in 10 Democrats say conservatives can do so.\n\n\"If you're a Republican or lean Republican, you're unabashedly wrong, they shut you down,\" said Rhonda Baker, 60, of Goldsboro, North Carolina, who voted for former President Donald Trump and has a son in college. \"If they hold a rally, it's: 'The MAGA's coming through.' It's: 'The KKK is coming through.'\"\n\nDebates over First Amendment rights have occasionally flared on college campuses in recent years, with conflicts arising over guest speakers who express polarizing views, often from the political right.\n\nStanford University became a flashpoint this year when students shouted down a conservative judge who was invited to speak. More recently, a conservative Princeton University professor was drowned out while discussing free speech at Washington College, a small school in Maryland.\n\nAt the same time, Republican lawmakers in dozens of states have proposed bills aiming to limit public colleges from teaching topics considered divisive or liberal. Just 30% of Americans say states should be able to restrict what professors at state universities teach, the poll found, though support was higher among Republicans.\n\nA man stands by flyers on a University of California, Berkeley campus bulletin board calling for a protest against right-wing speaker Ben Shapiro in Berkeley, Calif., Sept. 8, 2017. (AP Photo/Jocelyn Gecker, File)\n\nOverall, Republicans see a clear double standard on college campuses. Just 9% said conservatives can speak their minds, while 58% said liberals have that freedom, according to the polling. They were also slightly less likely than Americans overall to see campuses as respectful and inclusive places for conservatives.\n\nChris Gauvin, a Republican who has done construction work on campuses, believes conservative voices are stifled. While working at Yale University, he was once stopped by pro-LGBTQ+ activists who asked for his opinion, he said.\n\n\"They asked me how I felt, so I figured I'd tell them. I spoke in a normal tone, I didn't get excited or upset,\" said Gauvin, 58, of Manchester, Connecticut. \"But it proceeded with 18 to 20 people who were suddenly very irritated and agitated. It just exploded.\"\n\nHe took a lesson from the experience: \"I learned to be very quiet there.\"\n\nA protester shouts down White Nationalist Richard Spencer during a speech at the University of Florida in Gainesville, Fla., Oct. 19, 2017. (AP Photo/Chris O'Meara, File)\n\nRepublicans in Congress have raised alarms, with a recent House report warning of \"the long-standing and pervasive degradation of First Amendment rights\" at U.S. colleges. Some in the GOP have called for federal legislation requiring colleges to protect free speech and punish those who infringe on others' rights.\n\nNicholas Fleisher, who chairs an academic freedom committee for the American Association of University Professors, said public perception is skewed by the infrequent cases when protesters go too far.\n\n\"The reality is that there's free speech for everyone on college campuses,\" said Fleisher, a linguistics professor at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. \"In conversations within classrooms, people are free to speak their minds. And they do.\"\n\nOfficials at PEN America, a free speech group, say most students welcome diverse views. But as the nation has become more politically divided, so have college campuses, said Kristen Shahverdian, senior manager for education at PEN.\n\n\"There's this polarization that just continues to grow and build across our country, and colleges and universities are a part of that ecosystem,\" she said.\n\nMiddlebury College students turn their backs to Charles Murray, unseen, during his lecture in Middlebury, Vt., Thursday, March 2, 2017. (AP Photo/Lisa Rathke, File)\n\nMorgan Ashford, a Democrat in an online graduate program at Troy University in Alabama, said she thinks people can express themselves freely on campus regardless of politics or skin color. Still, she sees a lack of tolerance for the LGBTQ+ community in her Republican state where the governor has passed anti-LGBTQ legislation.\n\n\"I think there have to be guidelines\" around hate speech, said Ashford. \"Because some people can go overboard.\"\n\nWhen it comes to protesting speakers, most Americans say it should be peaceful. About 8 in 10 say it's acceptable to engage in peaceful, non-disruptive protest at a campus event, while just 15% say it's OK to prevent a speaker from communicating with the audience, the poll found.\n\n\"If they don't like it, they can get up and walk out,\" said Linda Woodward, 71, a Democrat in Hot Springs Village, Arkansas.\n\nMike Darlington, a real estate appraiser who votes Republican, said drowning out speakers violates the virtues of a free society.\n\n\"It seems to me a very, very selfish attitude that makes students think, 'If you don't think the way I do, then your thoughts are unacceptable,'\" said Darlington, 58, of Chesterfield County, Virginia.\n\nThe protest at Stanford was one of six campus speeches across the U.S. that ended in significant disruption this year, with another 11 last year, according to a database by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a free speech group.\n\nThose cases, while troubling, are one symptom of a broader problem, said Ilya Shapiro, a conservative legal scholar who was shouted down during a speech last year at the University of California's law school. He says colleges have drifted away from the classic ideal of academia as a place for free inquiry.\n\nAn even bigger problem than speakers being disrupted by protesters is \"students and faculty feeling that they can't be open in their views. They can't even discuss certain subjects,\" said Shapiro, director of constitutional studies at the Manhattan Institute think tank.\n\nAbout three in five Americans (62%) say that a major purpose of higher education is to support the free exchange and debate of different ideas and values. Even more U.S. adults say college's main purpose is to teach students specific skills (82%), advance knowledge and ideas (78%) or teach students to be critical thinkers (76%). Also, 66% said a major purpose is to create a respectful and inclusive learning environment.\n\n\"I believe it should be solely to prepare you to enter the workforce,\" said Gene VanZandt, 40, a Republican who works in shipbuilding in Hampton, Virginia. \"I think our colleges have gone too far off the path of what their function was.\"\n\nThe poll finds that majorities of Americans think students and professors, respectively, should not be allowed to express racist, sexist or anti-LGBTQ views on campus, with slightly more Republicans than Democrats saying those types of views should be allowed. There was slightly more tolerance for students expressing those views than for professors.\n\nAbout 4 in 10 said students should be permitted to invite academic speakers accused of using offensive speech, with 55% saying they should not. There was a similar split when asked whether professors should be allowed to invite those speakers.\n\nDarlington believes students and professors should be able to discuss controversial topics, but there are limits.\n\n\"Over-the-top, overtly racist, hateful stuff - no. You shouldn't be allowed to do that freely,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nThe poll of 1,095 adults was conducted Sept. 7-11, 2023, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nPresident Donald Trump listens as Elon Musk, joined by his son X Æ A-Xii, speaks in the Oval Office at the White House, Tuesday, Feb. 11, 2025, in Washington. (Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nDemonstrators rally in support of federal workers outside of the Department of Health and Human Services, Friday, Feb. 14, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa (AP) - Conservatives who have spent decades promoting deep cuts to government are giving mixed reviews to the Department of Government Efficiency , the Elon Musk-led project to slash the federal workforce and reduce or end disfavored programs.\n\nThe Associated Press interviewed four veteran budget hawks, including some who have worked on Republican presidential campaigns predating Musk or President Donald Trump becoming dominant in GOP politics.\n\nSome say Musk's early targets demonstrate success and show more potential than previous efforts to downsize government due to his unique access and influence. Others say it's too early to tell and argue that DOGE has stoked conservative outrage about specific agencies without going after much bigger pieces of the federal budget, like defense spending or programs with bipartisan support like Medicare and Social Security.\n\nA list of savings provided by the White House last week noted at least $2.2 billion in initial savings identified by the group. The DOGE website has since noted at least $5.6 billion. Any total so far is a tiny fraction of Musk's initial goal of $2 trillion, the size of the federal budget deficit, or even the $1 trillion he has since mentioned more regularly.\n\nHere's what the budget hawks said:\n\nNorquist, whose government-cutting advocacy goes back to the administration of President Ronald Reagan, is famous for having said in 2001, \"I don't want to abolish government. I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.\"\n\nHe cheered Musk's early efforts.\n\n\"When you look at what they found after looking for a few days - I'm not going to second-guess some of the larger numbers they are talking about - this thing has paid for itself many times over now,\" Norquist said. As of last week, DOGE was operating with about $14 million, according to the Office of Management and Budget.\n\n\"Never mind if they find anything more,\" Norquist added.\n\nMusk is succeeding, no matter the final tally of DOGE's work, because he has unfettered access both to Trump and millions of followers on the social media platform he owns, X, Norquist said.\n\n\"You can't bat it down and tell it to go away because X is out there before defenders of allowing Washington to do whatever it wants,\" Norquist said. \"That group can't get over the fact that 10 million people read a tweet by Elon Musk listing five things suggesting Washington is out of control.\"\n\nMusk's early efforts appear to be aimed more at satisfying Trump's culturally conservative base than targeting the biggest government spending sources, said Riedl, a veteran Republican budget analyst who was chief economist for former Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, the conservative Heritage Foundation's senior budget researcher, and the architect of 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney's 10-year deficit reduction proposal.\n\nBy seeking to eradicate racial and gender-based diversity, equity and inclusion spending from the the federal civil service, Musk is succeeding in getting the attention of Trump-styled conservatives with relatively few dollars to show for it, she said.\n\nCancelling so-called DEI contracts across the federal government is akin to cancelling the media subscriptions to national outlets such as The Associated Press, The New York Times, Politico and The Washington Post, she said. They are all regular targets of criticism from Trump's core supporters.\n\n\"So far, DOGE seems more about looking for symbolic culture war savings than truly reducing the budget deficit in any meaningful way,\" said Riedl.\n\nLikewise, Musk's effort to encourage many of the hundreds of thousands of eligible federal employees to accept terms to quit immediately in exchange for months of pay is seen by that same segment of voters as ridding the government of a force seen as thwarting Trump's policy agenda.\n\n\"These really get attention of Trump conservatives as fronts in the culture war, but ultimately do not save very much money at all,\" Riedl said.\n\nA large majority of federal spending is tied up in Medicare and Social Security, veterans benefits, defense spending and interest on the national debt. During his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump insisted he would protect the two politically sacrosanct entitlement programs and expand the U.S. military, making these areas unlikely targets for cuts.\n\n\"If Trump were serious about the deficit, he'd be addressing Social Security, Medicare, defense and veterans benefits,\" Riedl said. \"And that's if the public even cares. I've seen no real evidence that they do.\"\n\nOnly about a quarter of Americans said they were in favor of, as Musk recommended Thursday, eliminating entire federal agencies , according to an Associated Press-NORC poll conducted in January. Likewise, only about 3 in 10 U.S. adults said they favored eliminating a large number of federal jobs.\n\nSo far, DOGE's recommendations read like a public relations campaign aimed at discrediting the federal government, said Nowrasteh, an executive for the libertarian think tank and co-author of a report published in December recommending cuts to Musk's group.\n\nNowrasteh thinks the group may be shoring up its standing with conservative voters before it reaches for further buy-in among more moderate voters.\n\n\"They are trying to take down portions of the government that appear to be liberal or left leaning. And in the process, they are trying to expose some of the sillier aspects of what is being funded,\" he said.\n\nThe Cato Institute called for cutting 10% of the federal workforce - translating to a loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs - and requiring at least 10% compensation cuts for those that remain. Besides the defense and entitlement cuts, they also propose selling all federal land, turning national parks over to states for management, among myriad other dramatic changes.\n\n\"Most of the public is innumerate,\" he said. \"They don't know the difference between a million and a billion. It seems like a lot of money to you and me. But to the federal government, it's nothing.\"\n\nWith Musk's global profile and access in Trump's world, DOGE has the potential to be far-reaching in a way previous efforts at deficit and budget reduction have not, said Madni, who leads a newer conservative budget and spending think tank aimed at working closely with Congress.\n\nThe access that Trump is granting DOGE means Musk's team will have a view into a broad range of the government's spending, she said. And Musk's huge social media following, paired with Trump's election victory, gives the project an air of momentum, Madni said.\n\n\"We see DOGE as an incredible opportunity to address some of the challenges that we have known existed in federal spending for a long time and haven't really had the window to address,\" she said. \"It's making budget cuts, budget review, cool again.\"\n\nShe argued the Republican-controlled Congress would also be more likely to limit its budgets with DOGE's help.\n\n\"I think part of this conversation really has to be that DOGE is doing a phenomenal job already highlighting that there are places to make cuts, to reprioritize and save taxpayers money and reduce the deficit,\" she said. \"But besides that, there is Congress.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Michael Probst)\n\nFollow AP's live coverage of the election in Germany .\n\nBERLIN (AP) - Germany's mainstream conservatives led by Friedrich Merz won the country's national election, ensuring that Ukraine has an even stronger supporter in the European Union's largest country and creating hopes for renewal in an economic powerhouse that has been badly battered in recent years.\n\nThe far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) surged to become the second-largest political force , gaining from a backlash against the high numbers of migrants and refugees the nation has absorbed over the past decade and a string of extremist attacks that has shaken its sense of security.\n\nMerz, who is promising to unite Europe in the face of challenges from both Russia and the United States , is expected to become the country's next leader. He vowed to do everything in his power to continue a good transatlantic relationship with the U.S., even if the Trump administration appears to have waning interest in Europe.\n\n\"If those who really do not just make 'America First,' but almost 'America Alone' their motto prevail, then it will be difficult,\" he told reporters Monday in his first post-election news conference. \"But I remain hopeful that we will succeed in maintaining the transatlantic relationship.\"\n\nHe warned that if the good relationship \"is destroyed, it will not only be to the detriment of Europe, it will also be to the detriment of America.\"\n\nMarkets welcomed the victory of the fiscally conservative party, with stocks in major German companies rising Monday morning on hopes for a stable coalition government that could end policy gridlock and tackle the country's economic problems.\n\nMerz said he wants to immediately begin negotiations with the center-left Social Democrats, who suffered a stinging defeat after their coalition collapsed. But the results were seen a rebuke for mainstream parties as AfD notched its best results ever - and the strongest for a far-right party since World War II.\n\nThe campaign was dominated by worries about the yearslong stagnation of Europe's biggest economy and large-scale migration, with Merz vowing a tough approach that continued Monday.\n\n\"None of us wants to close the borders,\" he told reporters. \"But we need to protect our borders better. We must regain control over those who come into our country.\"\n\nThe election took place against a background of growing uncertainty over the future of Ukraine and Europe's alliance with the United States.\n\nFor the time being, outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz , whose Social Democratic party suffered a major blow, will stay on as head of a caretaker government.\n\nThe results released by the electoral authority showed Merz's Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats winning a combined majority of seats in the national legislature after small parties failed to make the electoral threshold. Scholz has also supported Ukraine with arms and other aid, but some Western partners have said he could have done more, and faster.\n\nMerz said on election night that he hopes to form a government by Easter at the latest. He has ruled out a coalition with AfD and on Monday said he was \"extremely worried\" about the far-right party's historic gains in the election.\n\n\"We have to work together to solve the problems in Germany that are gradually removing the breeding ground for this party,\" he added.\n\nMerz's conservatives won 208 seats in the 630-seat Bundestag, while AfD won 152. The three parties in the former governing coalition lost seats, with SDP falling to 120 seats and the Greens to 85. The pro-business Free Democrats, which triggered early elections by pulling out of the coalition , failed to reach the 5% of the vote required to win seats.\n\nThe Left party got 64 seats, while the left-wing Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance came in just under the 5% hurdle.\n\nAfD was jubilant on Sunday night, with leaders vowing to become the country's main party in the next election as its appeal expands. The party has established itself as a significant political force in the 12 years since it was founded, but it hasn't yet been part of any state or national government.\n\nThat's the result of what is often called a \"firewall\" against AfD. Other parties say they won't work with AfD, which is under observation by the domestic intelligence agency for suspected right-wing extremism, something the party objects to strongly. Its branches in three eastern states are designated \"proven right-wing extremist\" groups, which is particularly sensitive in view of Germany's Nazi past.\n\nYet a growing number of Germans feel that the mainstream parties have failed to manage the large-scale immigration and other problems in recent years, including responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe election took place seven months earlier than originally planned after Scholz's unpopular coalition collapsed in November , three years into a term that was increasingly marred by infighting. There was widespread discontent and not much enthusiasm for any of the candidates .\n\nMerz said Monday that his top priority is to unify Europe in the face of challenges coming from the U.S. and Russia. Both U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Trump ally Elon Musk openly supported AfD.\n\nHe said he remains \"hopeful that the Americans will see it as in their own interests to be involved in Europe as well.\"\n\nStill, he warned that it would be unacceptable \"if the Americans strike a deal with Russia over the heads of the Europeans, over the heads of Ukraine.\"\n\nGermany is the most populous country in the 27-nation European Union and a leading member of NATO. It has been Ukraine's second-biggest weapons supplier, after the U.S, and will be central to shaping the continent's response to the challenges of the coming years, including the Trump administration's confrontational foreign and trade policy.\n\n___\n\nAP journalist Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - With more than a year to go before the 2024 election , a constellation of conservative organizations is preparing for a possible second White House term for Donald Trump, recruiting thousands of Americans to come to Washington on a mission to dismantle the federal government and replace it with a vision closer to his own.\n\nLed by the long-established Heritage Foundation think tank and fueled by former Trump administration officials, the far-reaching effort is essentially a government-in-waiting for the former president's return - or any candidate who aligns with their ideals and can defeat President Joe Biden in 2024.\n\nWith a nearly 1,000-page \"Project 2025\" handbook and an \"army\" of Americans, the idea is to have the civic infrastructure in place on Day One to commandeer, reshape and do away with what Republicans deride as the \"deep state\" bureaucracy, in part by firing as many as 50,000 federal workers.\n\n\"We need to flood the zone with conservatives,\" said Paul Dans, director of the 2025 Presidential Transition Project and a former Trump administration official who speaks with historical flourish about the undertaking.\n\n\"This is a clarion call to come to Washington,\" he said. \"People need to lay down their tools, and step aside from their professional life and say, 'This is my lifetime moment to serve.'\"\n\nThe unprecedented effort is being orchestrated with dozens of right-flank organizations, many new to Washington, and represents a changed approach from conservatives, who traditionally have sought to limit the federal government by cutting federal taxes and slashing federal spending .\n\nInstead, Trump-era conservatives want to gut the \"administrative state\" from within, by ousting federal employees they believe are standing in the way of the president's agenda and replacing them with like-minded officials more eager to fulfill a new executive's approach to governing.\n\nFILE - Former President Donald Trump speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference, CPAC 2023, March 4, 2023, at National Harbor in Oxon Hill, Md. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)\n\nThe goal is to avoid the pitfalls of Trump's first years in office, when the Republican president's team was ill-prepared, his Cabinet nominees had trouble winning Senate confirmation and policies were met with resistance - by lawmakers, government workers and even Trump's own appointees who refused to bend or break protocol, or in some cases violate laws, to achieve his goals.\n\nWhile many of the Project 2025 proposals are inspired by Trump, they are being echoed by GOP rivals Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy and are gaining prominence among other Republicans.\n\nAnd if Trump wins a second term, the work from the Heritage coalition ensures the president will have the personnel to carry forward his unfinished White House business.\n\n\"The president Day One will be a wrecking ball for the administrative state,\" said Russ Vought, a former Trump administration official involved in the effort who is now president at the conservative Center for Renewing America.\n\nMuch of the new president's agenda would be accomplished by reinstating what's called Schedule F - a Trump-era executive order that would reclassify tens of thousands of the 2 million federal employees as essentially at-will workers who could more easily be fired.\n\nBiden had rescinded the executive order upon taking office in 2021, but Trump - and other presidential hopefuls - now vow to reinstate it.\n\n\"It frightens me,\" said Mary Guy, a professor of public administration at the University of Colorado Denver, who warns the idea would bring a return to a political spoils system.\n\nExperts argue Schedule F would create chaos in the civil service, which was overhauled during President Jimmy Carter's administration in an attempt to ensure a professional workforce and end political bias dating from 19th century patronage.\n\nAs it now stands, just 4,000 members of the federal workforce are considered political appointees who typically change with each administration. But Schedule F could put tens of thousands of career professional jobs at risk.\n\n\"We have a democracy that is at risk of suicide. Schedule F is just one more bullet in the gun,\" Guy said.\n\nThe ideas contained in Heritage's coffee table-ready book are both ambitious and parochial, a mix of longstanding conservative policies and stark, head-turning proposals that gained prominence in the Trump era.\n\nThere's a \"top to bottom overhaul\" of the Department of Justice, particularly curbing its independence and ending FBI efforts to combat the spread of misinformation. It calls for stepped-up prosecution of anyone providing or distributing abortion pills by mail.\n\nThere are proposals to have the Pentagon \"abolish\" its recent diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, what the project calls the \"woke\" agenda, and reinstate service members discharged for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nChapter by chapter, the pages offer a how-to manual for the next president, similar to one Heritage produced 50 years ago, ahead of the Ronald Reagan administration. Authored by some of today's most prominent thinkers in the conservative movement, it's often sprinkled with apocalyptic language.\n\nA chapter written by Trump's former acting deputy secretary of Homeland Security calls for bolstering the number of political appointees, and redeploying office personnel with law enforcement ability into the field \"to maximize law enforcement capacity.\"\n\nAt the White House, the book suggests the new administration should \"reexamine\" the tradition of providing work space for the press corps and ensure the White House counsel is \"deeply committed\" to the president's agenda.\n\nConservatives have long held a grim view of federal government offices, complaining they are stacked with liberals intent on halting Republican agendas.\n\nBut Doreen Greenwald, national president of the National Treasury Employees Union, said most federal workers live in the states and are your neighbors, family and friends. \"Federal employees are not the enemy,\" she said.\n\nWhile presidents typically rely on Congress to put policies into place, the Heritage project leans into what legal scholars refer to as a unitary view of executive power that suggests the president has broad authority to act alone.\n\nTo push past senators who try to block presidential Cabinet nominees, Project 2025 proposes installing top allies in acting administrative roles, as was done during the Trump administration to bypass the Senate confirmation process.\n\nJohn McEntee, another former Trump official advising the effort, said the next administration can \"play hardball a little more than we did with Congress.\"\n\nIn fact, Congress would see its role diminished - for example, with a proposal to eliminate congressional notification on certain foreign arms sales.\n\nPhilip Wallach, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who studies the separation of powers and was not part of the Heritage project, said there's a certain amount of \"fantasizing\" about the president's capabilities.\n\n\"Some of these visions, they do start to just bleed into some kind of authoritarian fantasies where the president won the election, so he's in charge, so everyone has to do what he says - and that's just not the system the government we live under,\" he said.\n\nAt the Heritage office, Dans has a faded photo on his wall of an earlier era in Washington, with the White House situated almost alone in the city, dirt streets in all directions.\n\nIt's an image of what conservatives have long desired, a smaller federal government.\n\nThe Heritage coalition is taking its recruitment efforts on the road, crisscrossing America to fill the federal jobs. They staffed the Iowa State Fair this month and signed up hundreds of people, and they're building out a database of potential employees, inviting them to be trained in government operations.\n\n\"It's counterintuitive,\" Dans acknowledged - the idea of joining government to shrink it - but he said that's the lesson learned from the Trump days about what's needed to \"regain control.\"\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show the name of the university is the University of Colorado Denver, not the University of Colorado.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the 2024 election at https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)\n\n▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration\n\nOXON HILL, Md. (AP) - Billionaire Elon Musk appeared at a conservative gathering outside Washington waving a chainsaw in the air, showing openness to auditing the Federal Reserve and accusing Democrats of \"treason.\"\n\nMusk, the Tesla CEO who has become perhaps President Donald Trump's most influential adviser, spoke Thursday about his crusade to cut government spending and downsize the federal workforce with the administration's Department of Government Efficiency .\n\nThe entrepreneur was first announced earlier that day as a speaker, drawing huge cheers from activists gathered at the Conservative Political Action Conference. Before his appearance, he met with Argentine President Javier Milei, who has been frequently praised by Musk and popularized the power tool while campaigning in 2023 and proposing slashing public spending.\n\nAfter Musk appeared onstage, wearing shades and his trademark black \"Make America Great Again\" hat, he said Milei had a gift for him. The Argentine leader then walked onstage with the red chainsaw and passed it to Musk. The chainsaw was engraved with Milei's slogan, \"Viva la libertad, carajo,\" which is Spanish for \"Long live liberty, damn it.\"\n\n\"This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,\" he said.\n\nMusk slammed the previous Biden administration for its immigration policies, specifically naming an app that was used by nearly 1 million people to be allowed into the U.S. on two-year permits with eligibility to work. He accused Biden and Democrats of doing that as an \"investment\" to get more support in swing states.\n\n\"A lot of people don't quite appreciate that this was an actual real scam at scale to tilt the scales of democracy in America,\" Musk said before Newsmax host Rob Schmitt asked him, \"Treason?\"\n\nMusk responded, \"Treason.\"\n\nWhen Schmitt asked him if he would consider auditing the Federal Reserve, Musk responded, \"Yeah, sure, while we're at it.\"\n\n\"Waste is pretty much everywhere,\" Musk said.\n\nThe billionaire joked that Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has told him he is worried about his security and said he was open to ideas on how to improve his safety measures.\n\n\"President Bukele from El Salvador, who managed to put in prison like a hundred thousand murderous thugs, and he called me. 'I am worried about your security,'\" he said the Central American leader told him. \"I'm like, 'Dude, you are worried about my security?'\"\n\nWhen asked to describe what is like inside his mind, Musk replied: \"My mind is a storm. It's a storm.\"\n\nSteve Bannon, a popular Trump ally who once served as his chief strategist, followed Musk's appearance and acknowledged he was not the evening's top attraction as he took the stage to a far less enthusiastic reception.\n\n\"How did I draw the card to follow Elon Musk?\" Bannon asked about a man he has frequently criticized as insufficiently loyal to Trump. \"C'mon man! You bring out the world's wealthiest guy, Superman. I'm supposed to follow it?

(Stefan Rousseau/PA via AP, Pool)\n\nLONDON (AP) - Britain's opposition Conservatives will choose one of two figureheads of the party's right, Robert Jenrick or Kemi Badenoch, to be their next leader as the party tries to rebound from a crushing election defeat.\n\nThe two candidates will face the verdict of party members after a more centrist rival, former Foreign Secretary James Cleverly, was dramatically knocked out of the leadership contest in a tight vote by lawmakers on Wednesday.\n\nBadenoch, a former business secretary, received 42 of the 120 votes cast in a ballot of Tory lawmakers, while former immigration minister Jenrick got 41. Cleverly was eliminated after receiving 37 votes. The result was a shock - Cleverly came first in the penultimate voting round on Tuesday and had been considered likely to make the runoff.\n\nLawmakers have whittled the field down from six contenders in four rounds of voting. Tens of thousands of party members across the country will vote at the end of this month, and the winner will be announced on Nov. 2.\n\nBadenoch and Jenrick both idolize Conservative icon Margaret Thatcher, whose free-market policies transformed the United Kingdom during the 1980s. Badenoch often cites the late leader as her inspiration, while Jenrick gave his daughter \"Thatcher\" as a middle name.\n\nBoth say they can win voters back from Reform U.K. , the hard-right, anti-immigrant party led by populist politician Nigel Farage. Though Reform won only five House of Commons seats, out of 650, in Britain's July election, it came second in many more, and its rapid rise has scared many Conservatives to the right.\n\nTrained as a lawyer, Jenrick, 42, is a former moderate who opposed Brexit in Britain's 2016 referendum on European Union membership but has become more sharply nationalist. He wants to take Britain out of the European Court of Human Rights , scrap the U.K.'s own Human Rights Act, end mass migration, abolish carbon-emissions targets and \"stand for our nation and our culture, our identity and our way of life.\"\n\nBadenoch, 44, was born in London to Nigerian parents and partly raised in the West African country, and would be the first Black leader of a major British political party.\n\nA former software engineer, she depicts herself as a disruptor, arguing for a low-tax, free-market economy and pledging to \"rewire, reboot and reprogram\" the British state. A critic of multiculturalism and self-proclaimed enemy of wokeness, Badenoch recently said that \"not all cultures are equally valid.\"\n\nThe winner will lead a right-of-center party that suffered a drubbing in July at the hands of the Labour Party led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer . The Conservatives lost more than 200 seats, taking their tally down to 121 - the party's worst election result since 1832 .\n\nThe winner's tough task is to try to restore the party's reputation After years of division, scandal and economic tumult , and return the Conservatives to power at the next election, due by 2029.\n\nSome worry that choosing either Badenoch or Jenrick would lead the party away from public opinion.\n\nTheresa May, a former Conservative prime minister, warned last month: \"Elections in the U.K. are won on the center ground, and we abandon that ground at our peril.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Alberto Pezzali)\n\nLONDON (AP) - Outspoken, right-leaning lawmaker Kemi Badenoch was named leader of Britain's opposition Conservatives on Saturday, as the party tries to rebound from a crushing election defeat that ended its 14 years in power.\n\nThe first Black woman to lead a major British political party, Badenoch (pronounced BADE-enock) has pledged to bring the right-of-center Tories \"renewal\" by pushing for a smaller state and rejecting identity politics.\n\nBadenoch defeated rival candidate Robert Jenrick in an online and postal ballot of party members, securing 57% of the almost 100,000 votes cast, to Jenrick's 43%.\n\nBadenoch, 44, replaces former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who in July led the Conservatives to their worst election result since 1832 .\n\nThe new leader's daunting challenge is to restore the party's reputation after years of division, scandal and economic tumult , hammer Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer's policies on key issues including the economy and immigration, and return the Conservatives to power at the next election, due by 2029.\n\n\"The task that stands before us is tough but simple,\" Badenoch said in a victory speech to a roomful of Conservative lawmakers, staff and journalists in London. She said the party's job was to hold the Labour government to account, and to craft pledges and a plan for government.\n\nAddressing the party's election drubbing, she said \"we have to be honest - honest about the fact that we made mistakes, honest about the fact that we let standards slip.\"\n\n\"The time has come to tell the truth, to stand up for our principles, to plan for our future, to reset our politics and our thinking, and to give our party, and our country, the new start that they deserve,\" Badenoch said.\n\nA business secretary in Sunak's government, Badenoch was born in London to Nigerian parents and spent much of her childhood in the West African country.\n\nThe former software engineer depicts herself as a disruptor, arguing for a low-tax, free-market economy and pledging to \"rewire, reboot and reprogram\" the British state. Like her rival Jenrick, she has criticized multiculturalism and called for lower immigration, though unlike him she has not demanded that Britain leave the European Convention on Human Rights .\n\nA self-proclaimed enemy of wokeness, Badenoch opposes identity politics, gender-neutral bathrooms and government plans to reduce U.K. carbon emissions. During the leadership campaign she drew criticism for saying that \"not all cultures are equally valid,\" and for suggesting that maternity pay was excessive.\n\nTim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, said the Conservative Party was likely to \"swing towards the right both in terms of its economic policies and its social policies\" under Badenoch.\n\nHe predicted Badenoch would pursue \"what you might call the boats, boilers and bathrooms strategy .... focusing very much on the trans issue, the immigration issue and skepticism about progress towards net zero.\"\n\nWhile the Conservative Party is unrepresentative of the country as a whole - its dwindling membership of 132,000 is largely made up of affluent, older white men - its upper echelons have become markedly more diverse.\n\nBadenoch is the Tories' fourth female leader, after Margaret Thatcher, Theresa May and Liz Truss, all of whom became prime minister. She's the second Conservative leader of color, after Sunak, and the first with African roots. The center-left Labour Party has a more diverse membership but has only ever been led by white men.\n\nIn a leadership contest that lasted more than three months, Conservative lawmakers reduced the field from six candidates in a series of votes before putting the final two to the wider party membership.\n\nBoth finalists came from the right of the party, and argued they could win voters back from Reform U.K. , the hard-right, anti-immigrant party led by populist politician Nigel Farage that has eaten away at Conservative support.\n\nBut the party also lost many voters to the winning party, Labour, and to the centrist Liberal Democrats, and some Conservatives worry that tacking right will lead the party away from public opinion.\n\nStarmer's government has had a rocky first few months in office, beset by negative headlines, fiscal gloom and a plummeting approval rating.\n\nBut Bale said that the historical record suggests the odds are against Badenoch leading the Conservatives back to power in 2029.\n\n\"It's quite unusual for someone to take over when a party gets very badly beaten and manage to lead it to election victory,\" he said. \"However, Keir Starmer did exactly that after 2019. So records are there to be broken.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

Winsome Earle-Sears, top left, adjusts the lapel of Senate Page Sylvester Powell, of Hampton Va., prior to the session of the Virginia General Assembly at the Capitol, Monday Jan. 13, 2025, in Richmond, Va. (AP Photo/Steve Helber)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Delivering his first address as a reinaugurated president, Donald Trump spoke directly to communities that had historically shunned his party.\n\n\"To the Black and Hispanic communities, I want to thank you for the tremendous outpouring of love and trust that you have shown me with your vote,\" Trump said. \"We set records, and I will not forget it. I've heard your voices in the campaign, and I look forward to working with you in the years to come.\"\n\nTrump, whose inauguration coincided with the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday , promised to \"strive together to make his dream a reality.\" It's a vow that many prominent Black and Hispanic civil rights leaders view skeptically . But among the conservatives of color who surround Trump, the moment was an endorsement of their biggest hopes, years in the making.\n\n\"This room was impossible twenty years ago,\" Rep. Byron Donalds , R-Fla., said Sunday evening during the \"Legacy of Freedom Ball,\" a gala of a few hundred mostly Black conservatives who gathered to ring in the new administration. \"But in 2024 not only are we back, but we're bringing Black people and Hispanic people into the Republican Party,\" Donalds told the crowd.\n\nTrump's comments alluded to the record margins he garnered among heavily Black and Hispanic regions of the country compared to past Republican presidential candidates. At galas preceding Trump's inauguration, conservative Black and Hispanic activists and lawmakers toasted to a new era in which many of them hope to play a larger role than in Trump's first term.\n\n\"There's so much that we expect from the president, and I believe he's going to deliver,\" said Virginia Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, an outspoken conservative who is running to become the state's first Black and female governor.\n\nEarle-Sears listed stricter immigration policies , cracking down on crime and reducing the federal government's role in education as priorities she believed would speak to Black Americans. \"Let's just give him a chance,\" she said.\n\nThe revelry came after a year of bifurcated messaging from the Trump campaign, which invested in appeals to Black and Hispanic voters while at the same time depicting immigrants and communities of color as violent criminals and the country as beset by diversity and inclusion policies that conservatives view as weakening the nation .\n\nBut Trump's divisive messages on \"Black jobs\" and \"Hispanic jobs\" spoke to a view of the economy and society that found salience with some voters, including voters of color , on top of concerns over inflation, rapid technological change and geopolitical unrest abroad.\n\nTrump gained a larger share of Black and Latino voters than he did in 2020, when he lost to Democrat Joe Biden - most notably among young Black and Hispanic male voters - according to AP VoteCast, a nationwide survey of more than 120,000 voters.\n\nOverall, about 16% of Black voters supported Trump in November, while about 8 in 10 voted for Democrat Kamala Harris. But that represented a shift from 2020 when only 8% of Black voters backed Trump and about 9 in 10 went for Biden. Among Hispanic voters, 43% voted for Trump in November, up from about one-third in 2020.\n\nBlack women are largely the exception to this shift - about 9 in 10 Black female voters supported Harris in 2024, similar to the share that backed Biden in 2020.\n\nAt the Hispanic Inaugural Ball the Saturday before Trump's inauguration, GOP members of Congress, state lawmakers and governors mingled with conservative activists and business executives from across the Western Hemisphere.\n\nLatin American leaders like Argentinian President Javier Milei and Paraguayan President Santiago Peña rubbed elbows with Republican members of Congress, including Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, Mexican actors and Hispanic business executives. Vivek Ramaswamy , Robert F. Kennedy Jr . and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott all made appearances.\n\n\"I don't think Trump gets enough credit for listening and tailoring his policies in part to what people want in these communities.\" said Francis Suarez, mayor of Miami. Suarez, who leads a city that is overwhelmingly Hispanic and sits at the nexus of the U.S. and Latin America, said Trump can maintain his support among Hispanic voters \"and grow it again. It just goes back to the basics.\"\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz rallied gala attendees by recounting the November election, in which many majority-Hispanic counties in his home state that had traditionally backed Democrats flipped to Trump. Cruz, who trailed Trump in many of those same counties as he ran for reelection, called the GOP's inroads with Hispanic voters \"unprecedented.\"\n\n\"The Rio Grande Valley has been bright blue for 100 years. Well, I'm here to tell you the Rio Grande Valley flipped red,\" said Cruz, who is Hispanic. \"That is a generational change for Texas, and it is a generational change for America.\"\n\nOther lawmakers took time to pitch a forward-looking vision.\n\n\"I think the biggest thing is that we're beginning to recognize we're Americans first. We have different backgrounds, but always share the same dreams. And that's what's happening across the board,\" said Rep. Burgess Owens, R-Utah, in an interview with The Associated Press. Owens is one of four Black Republicans in the House of Representatives.\n\nSen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, who was born in Bogotá, Colombia, rejected stereotypes of Hispanics as solely laborers or immigrants and asked the crowd to envision the country after the four years of Trump's term.\n\n\"In four years, America will understand the positive impact of the Hispanic community. And we're going to build an alliance between a free South America, a prosperous South America and a strong, free and prosperous United States of America,\" Moreno said.\n\n\"That's what we're going to get done over the next four years and it's going to be the Hispanic community that makes it happen.\"\n\nBlack conservatives are energized as well. The GOP did not add any new Black members to Congress this cycle, but activists are hoping to change that in the 2026 midterms. And Donalds, a Florida Republican and one of the most prominent Black surrogates for Trump on the campaign trail, joked to attendees to \"keep quiet\" about his ambition for higher office - speakers throughout the night referred to him as \"Governor Donalds.\"\n\nThe commingling scenes and aspirations were no accident.\n\nConservative groups like Bienvenido and the Black Conservative Federation, which hosted the balls, had worked for years behind the scenes to build up conservative Black and Hispanic organizing networks. And Trump's orbit has fostered friendly ties with Latin American's political right, most notably in Trump's friendship with then-Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro . Bolsonaro's wife attended Trump's inauguration.\n\nArgentina's Milei \"and I were friends before he was elected president,\" said Roger Stone, a longtime Trump confidant. \"We were pen pals, you know, over the internet. I'm a strong believer in him.\"\n\nSome in Trump's orbit hope Secretary of State Marco Rubio will deepen America's ties to right-wing Latin American leaders in the coming years.\n\nThe exuberance of the night reflected a desire among many Hispanic conservatives to solidify the party's inroads with Hispanic voters and increase their clout in the GOP.\n\n\"We're growing exponentially,\" said Jaime Florez, the Hispanic communications director for the Trump campaign.\n\nAnd who knows? \"The first Hispanic president of the United States might be here tonight,\" he added.\n\n___\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy of Calif., speaks to reporters outside his office on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, June 7, 2023. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - House Speaker Kevin McCarthy appeared Monday to have resolved, for now, an impasse with some of the more conservative members of his caucus who had brought the chamber to a standstill last week.\n\nMcCarthy met with nearly a dozen lawmakers in his office in an effort to quell a revolt and jumpstart various priorities that had stalled last week amid the GOP infighting. He called it a productive meeting where \"everybody's attitude was, 'How do we find where we all work together?'\" McCarthy promised more meetings with last week's holdouts and a focus on reducing federal spending in the weeks ahead.\n\n\"We've got a lot more victories for the American people we want to fight for, and we're only able to achieve it if we stick together,\" he told reporters.\n\nLast week, barely a dozen Republicans, mainly members of the House Freedom Caucus, shuttered House business in protest of McCarthy's leadership. Votes on a pair of pro-gas stove bills important to GOP activists could not be taken. At the heart of their displeasure was a compromise that McCarthy struck with President Joe Biden on suspending the debt ceiling , which they viewed as inadequately cutting spending.\n\nWhile McCarthy expressed confidence the House would take up those bills this week, he also acknowledged he could face similar obstacles in the future in which members of his own party oppose routine procedural votes that prevent the House from taking up various GOP priorities. Last week's procedural rule vote was the first to fail in nearly two decades.\n\n\"Perhaps we'll be back here next week,\" warned Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., as he exited the meeting with McCarthy.\n\n\"You know, each day there's another challenge. I just wake up every morning, pray for the patience of Job and find a solution and move forward,\" McCarthy said of the potential threat from his right flank.\n\nGaetz said there was an agreement from McCarthy to further look at spending on various federal boards, commissions and other entities that could be cut back to save money.\n\nBut the most important message from the holdouts was that they need to see progress from McCarthy and the leadership team each week on spending priorities, or \"the floor will stop, the functions will stop,\" said Rep. Matt Rosendale, R-Mont.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

      "text": "The Terrifying Future of the American Right\n\nWhat I saw at the National Conservatism Conference\n\nR achel Bovard is one of the thousands of smart young Americans who flock to Washington each year to make a difference. She's worked in the House and Senate for Republicans Rand Paul, Pat Toomey, and Mike Lee, was listed among the \"Most Influential Women in Washington Under 35\" by National Journal , did a stint at the Heritage Foundation, and is now policy director of the Conservative Partnership Institute, whose mission is to train, equip, and unify the conservative movement. She's bright, cheerful, and funny, and has a side hustle as a sommelier. And, like most young people, she has absorbed the dominant ideas of her peer group.\n\nOne of the ideas she's absorbed is that the conservatives who came before her were insufferably naive. They thought liberals and conservatives both want what's best for America, disagreeing only on how to get there. But that's not true, she believes. \"Woke elites-increasingly the mainstream left of this country-do not want what we want,\" she told the National Conservatism Conference, which was held earlier this month in a bland hotel alongside theme parks in Orlando. \"What they want is to destroy us,\" she said. \"Not only will they use every power at their disposal to achieve their goal,\" but they've already been doing it for years \"by dominating every cultural, intellectual, and political institution.\"\n\nAs she says this, the dozens of young people in her breakout session begin to vibrate in their seats. Ripples of head nodding are visible from where I sit in the back. These are the rising talents of the right-the Heritage Foundation junior staff, the Ivy League grads, the intellectual Catholics and the Orthodox Jews who have been studying Hobbes and de Tocqueville at the various young conservative fellowship programs that stretch along Acela-land. In the hallway before watching Bovard's speech, I bumped into one of my former Yale students, who is now at McKinsey.\n\nBovard has the place rocking, training her sights on the true enemies, the left-wing elite: a \"totalitarian cult of billionaires and bureaucrats, of privilege perpetuated by bullying, empowered by the most sophisticated surveillance and communications technologies in history, and limited only by the scruples of people who arrest rape victims' fathers, declare math to be white supremacist, finance ethnic cleansing in western China, and who partied, a mile high, on Jeffrey Epstein's Lolita Express.\"\n\nRead: It's a weird time to be young and conservative\n\nThe atmosphere is electric. She's giving the best synopsis of national conservatism I've heard at the conference we're attending-and with flair! Progressives pretend to be the oppressed ones, she tells the crowd, \"but in reality, it's just an old boys' club, another frat house for entitled rich kids contrived to perpetuate their unearned privilege. It's Skull and Bones for gender-studies majors!\" She finishes to a rousing ovation. People leap to their feet.\n\nI have the sinking sensation that the thunderous sound I'm hearing is the future of the Republican Party.\n\nW hen I came down to Florida for the National Conservatism Conference, I was a little concerned I'd get heckled in the hallways, or be subjected to the verbal abuse I occasionally get from Trump supporters. Judging by their rhetoric, after all, these are the fire-breathers, the hard-liners, the intellectual sharp edge of the American right.\n\nBut everyone was charming! I hung around the bar watching football each night, saw old conservative friends, and met lots of new ones, and I enjoyed them all. This is the intellectual wing of the emerging right. Many of them have spent their lives at progressive places like Princeton, New York, Hollywood, and D.C. Their bodies and careers are in the Republican coastal megalopolis-but their minds and mouths are in Trumpland. As one young man told me late one night, \"We'd like to dislike Bill Kristol, but he got us all jobs.\"\n\nThe movement has three distinctive strains. First, the people over 50 who have been hanging around conservative circles for decades but who have recently been radicalized by the current left. Chris Demuth, 75, was for many years president of the American Enterprise Institute, which used to be the Church of England of American conservatism, but now he's gone populist. \"NatCons are conservatives who have been mugged by reality,\" he told the conference. Seventy-three-year-old Glenn Loury, a Brown University economist, was a conservative, then a progressive, and now he's back on the right: \"What has happened to public discourse about race has radicalized me.\"\n\nThe second strain is made up of mid-career politicians and operatives who are learning to adapt to the age of populist rage: people like Ted Cruz (Princeton, Harvard), J. D. Vance (Yale Law), and Josh Hawley (Stanford and Yale).\n\nThe third and largest strain is the young . They grew up in the era of Facebook and MSNBC and identity politics. They went to colleges smothered by progressive sermonizing. And they reacted by running in the other direction. I disagreed with two-thirds of what I heard at this conference, but I couldn't quite suppress the disturbing voice in my head saying, \"If you were 22, maybe you'd be here too.\"\n\nT he Information Age is transforming the American right. Conservatives have always inveighed against the cultural elite-the media, the universities, Hollywood. But in the Information Age, the purveyors of culture are now corporate titans. In this economy, the dominant means of economic production are cultural production. Corporate behemoths are cultural behemoths. The national conservatives thus describe a world in which the corporate elite, the media elite, the political elite, and the academic elite have all coagulated into one axis of evil, dominating every institution and controlling the channels of thought.\n\nAt the heart of this blue oligarchy are the great masters of surveillance capitalism, the Big Tech czars who decide in secret what ideas get promoted, what stories get suppressed. (The NatCon gospel includes great martyrdom stories, such as when Twitter and Facebook suppressed a New York Post story on Hunter Biden's laptop, and when various social-media companies have tried to de-platform The Babylon Bee , the right-wing version of The Onion .) \"Big Tech is malevolent. Big Tech is corrupt. Big Tech is omnipresent,\" Ted Cruz roared.\n\nIn the NatCon worldview, the profiteers of surveillance capitalism see all and control all. Its workers, indoctrinated at elite universities, use \"wokeness\" to buy off the left and to create a subservient, atomized, defenseless labor pool. \"Big Business is not our ally,\" Marco Rubio argued. \"They are eager culture warriors who use the language of wokeness to cover free-market capitalism.\" The \"entire phalanx of Big Business has gone hard left,\" Cruz said. \"We've seen Big Business, the Fortune 500, becoming the economic enforcers of the hard left. Name five Fortune 500 CEOs who are even remotely right of center.\"\n\nRead: How capitalism drives cancel culture\n\nThe idea that the left controls absolutely everything-from your smartphone to the money supply to your third grader's curriculum-explains the apocalyptic tone that was the dominating emotional register of this conference. The politicians' speeches were like entries in the catastrophism Olympics:\n\n\"The left's ambition is to create a world beyond belonging,\" said Hawley. \"Their grand ambition is to deconstruct the United States of America.\"\n\n\"The left's attack is on America. The left hates America,\" said Cruz. \"It is the left that is trying to use culture as a tool to destroy America.\"\n\n\"We are confronted now by a systematic effort to dismantle our society, our traditions, our economy, and our way of life,\" said Rubio.\n\nThe first great project of the national conservatives is to man the barricades in the culture war. These people have certainly done their homework when it comes to cultural Marxism-how the left has learned to dominate culture and how the right now needs to copy their techniques. If I'd had to drink a shot every time some speaker cited Herbert Marcuse or Antonio Gramsci, I'd be dead of alcohol poisoning.\n\nHawley delivered a classic culture-war speech defending manhood and masculinity: \"The deconstruction of America depends on the deconstruction of American men.\" Listening to Hawley talk populist is like listening to a white progressive Upper West Sider in the 1970s try to talk jive. The words are there, but he's trying so hard it sounds ridiculous.\n\nAnother speaker, Amanda Milius, is the daughter of John Milius, who was the screenwriter for the first two Dirty Harry films and Apocalypse Now . She grew up in L.A. and wound up in the Trump administration. She argued that America needs to get back to making self-confident movies like The Searchers , the 1956 John Ford Western. This was an unapologetic movie, she asserted, about how Americans tamed the West and how Christian values got brought to \"savage, undeveloped land.\"\n\nThis is about as dumb a reading of The Searchers as it's possible to imagine. The movie is actually the modern analogue to the Oresteia , by Aeschylus. The complex lead figure, played by John Wayne, is rendered barbaric and racist while fighting on behalf of westward pioneers. By the end, he is unfit to live in civilized society.\n\nBut we don't exactly live in an age that acknowledges nuance. Milius distorts the movie into a brave manifesto of anti-woke truths-and that sort of distortion has a lot of buyers among this crowd.\n\nT he first interesting debate among the NatCons is philosophical: Should we fight to preserve the classical-liberal order or is it necessary to abandon it?\n\nSome of the speakers at the conference were in fact classical liberals, who believe in free speech, intellectual debate, and neutral government. Glenn Loury gave an impassioned speech against cancel culture, the illiberal left, and the hyper-racialized group consciousness that divides people into opposing racial camps. Loury asserted that as a Black man he is the proud inheritor of the great Western tradition: \"Tolstoy is mine! Dickens is mine! Milton, Marx, and Einstein are mine!\" He declared that his people are Black, but also proudly American. \"Our Americanness is much more important than our Blackness,\" he said, before adding, \"We must strive to transcend racial particularism and stress universality and commonality as Americans.\" This is the classical-liberal case against racial separatism and in favor of integration.\n\nBut others argued that this sort of liberalism is a luxury we cannot afford. The country is under assault from a Marxist oligarchy that wants to impose its own pseudo-religious doctrine. If you try to repulse that with pallid liberalism, with weak calls for free speech and tolerance, you'll end up getting run over by those who possess fanatical zeal, economic power, and cultural might.\n\nYoram Hazony, the chief intellectual architect of national conservatism, is an Orthodox Jew who went to Princeton before moving to Israel. He argues that you can't have a society that embraces government neutrality and tries to relegate values to the private sphere. The public realm eventually eviscerates private values, especially when public communication is controlled by a small oligarchic elite. If conservatives want to stand up to the pseudo-religion of wokeism, they have to put traditional religion at the center of their political project.\n\nAnother Israeli political philosopher at the conference, Ofir Haivry, argued that Americans shouldn't delude themselves into thinking that a nation is built out of high-minded liberal abstractions, like the Bill of Rights. A nation is, instead, a cultural tradition, a common language, a set of rituals and beliefs, and a religious order-a collective cultural identity.\n\nThe history of Judaism demonstrates, Haivry argues, that you don't need a state or a political order to be a nation.\n\nFor his part, Hazony argued that the American cultural identity is Christian-and has to be if it is not going to succumb to the woke onslaught. If 80 percent of Americans are Christian, Hazony reasoned, then Christian values should dominate. \"Majority cultures have the right to establish the ruling culture, and minority cultures have the right to be decently treated,\" he said. \"To take the minority view and say the minority has the ability to stamp out the views of the majority-that seems to me to be completely crazy.\"\n\nRead: How voters feel about Josh Hawley's 'attack on men'\n\nThe problem in America, Hazony continued, is that LGBTQ activists today, like American Jews in the 1950s, are trying to expel Christianity from the public square. This threatens to render the public square spiritually naked. Wan liberalism collapses in the face of  left-wing cultural Marxism. \"Eliminating God and scripture in the schools ... was the turning point in American civilization,\" Hazony said. \"Above all else we've got to get God and scripture back in the schools.\"\n\nAnother interesting debate among the NatCons is political and economic. Conservatives have lately become expert culture warriors-the whole Tucker Carlson schtick . This schtick demands that you ignore the actual suffering of the world-the transgender kid alone in some suburban high school, the anxiety of a guy who can't afford health care for his brother, the struggle of a Black man trying to be seen and recognized as a full human being. It's a cynical game that treats all of life as a play for ratings, a battle for clicks, and this demands constant outrage, white-identity signaling, and the kind of absurd generalizations that Rachel Bovard used to get that room so excited.\n\nConservatives have got the culture-war act down. Trump was a culture-war president with almost no policy arm attached. The question conservatives at the conference were asking was how to move beyond owning the libs to effecting actual change.\n\nChristopher Rufo, the architect of this year's school-board-meeting protests against critical race theory , argued that conservatives had erred when they tried to slowly gain power in elite cultural institutions. Conservatives were never going to make headway in the Ivy League or the corporate media. Instead, Rufo argued, they should rally the masses to get state legislatures to pass laws embracing their values. That's essentially what's now happening across red America.\n\nMy old friend Rod Dreher of The American Conservative argued that because the left controls the commanding heights of the culture and the economy, the only institution the right has a shot at influencing is the state. In these circumstances the right has to use state power to promote its values. \"We need to quit being satisfied with owning the libs, and save our country,\" Dreher said. \"We need to unapologetically embrace the use of state power.\"\n\nThis is where Viktor Orbán comes in. It was Dreher who prompted Carlson's controversial trip to Hungary last summer, and Hungarians were a strong presence at the National Conservatism Conference. Orbán, in Dreher's view, understands the civilizational stakes of the culture war; he has, for instance, used the power of the state to limit how much transgenderism can be taught to children in schools. \"Our team talks incessantly about how horrible wokeness is,\" Dreher said at the conference. \"Orbán actually does something about it.\"\n\nThis is national conservatism pursued to its logical conclusion: using state power to break up and humble the big corporations and to push back against coastal cultural values. The culture war merges with the economic-class war-and a new right emerges in which an intellectual cadre, the national conservatives, rallies the proletarian masses against the cultural/corporate elites. All your grandparents' political categories get scrambled along the way.\n\nW ill it work? Well, Donald Trump destroyed the Reagan Republican paradigm in 2016, but he didn't exactly elucidate a new set of ideas, policies, and alliances. Trump's devastation of the old order produced a grand struggle on the right to build a new one on Trumpian populist lines.\n\nThe NatCons are wrong to think there is a unified thing called \"the left\" that hates America. This is just the apocalyptic menace many of them had to invent in order to justify their decision to vote for Donald Trump.\n\nThey are wrong, too, to think there is a wokeist Anschluss taking over all the institutions of American life. For people who spend so much time railing about the evils of social media, they sure seem to spend an awful lot of their lives on Twitter. Ninety percent of their discourse is about the discourse. Anecdotalism was also rampant at the conference-generalizing from three anecdotes about people who got canceled to conclude that all of American life is a woke hellscape. They need to get out more.\n\nFurthermore, if Hazony thinks America is about to return to Christian dominance, he's living in 1956. Evangelical Christianity has lost many millions of believers across recent decades. Secularism is surging, and white Christianity is shrinking into a rump presence in American life. America is becoming more religiously diverse every day. Christians are in no position to impose their values-regarding same-sex marriage or anything else-on the public square. Self-aware Christians know this.\n\nFinally, there is something extremely off-putting about the NatCon public pose. In person, as I say, I find many of them charming, warm, and friendly. But their public posture is dominated by the psychology of threat and menace. If there was one expression of sympathy, kindness, or grace uttered from the podium in Orlando, I did not hear it. But I did hear callousness, invocations of combat, and whiffs of brutality.\n\nFrom the September 2021 issue: How the bobos broke America\n\nOne big thing the NatCons are right about is that in the Information Age, the cultural and corporate elites have merged. Right-wing parties around the world are gradually becoming working-class parties that stand against the economic interests and cultural preferences of the highly educated. Left-wing parties are now rooted in the rich metro areas and are more and more becoming an unsteady alliance between young AOC left-populists and Google.\n\nNatCons are also probably right that conservatism is going to get a lot more statist. At the conference, Ted Cruz tried to combine culture-war conservatism with free-market economic policies-free trade and low taxes. Marco Rubio countered by, in effect, arguing that you can't rally cultural populists if you are not also going to do something for them economically. Cultural populism leads to economic populism. Rubio's position at least has the virtue of being coherent.\n\nOver the past few decades there have been various efforts to replace the Reagan Paradigm: the national-greatness conservatism of John McCain; the compassionate conservatism of George W. Bush; the Reformicon conservatism of the D.C. think tanks in the 21st century. But the Trumpian onslaught succeeded where these movements have so far fizzled because Trump understood better than they did the coalescence of the new American cultural/corporate elite and the potency of populist anger against it. Thus the display of Ivy League populism I witnessed in Orlando might well represent the alarming future of the American right: the fusing of the culture war and the class war into one epic Marxist Götterdämmerung.\n\nSitting in that Orlando hotel, I found myself thinking of what I was seeing as some kind of new theme park: NatCon World, a hermetically sealed dystopian universe with its own confected thrills and chills, its own illiberal rides. I tried to console myself by noting that this NatCon theme park is the brainchild of a few isolated intellectuals with a screwy view of American politics and history. But the disconcerting reality is that America's rarified NatCon World is just one piece of a larger illiberal populist revolt that is strong and rising.\n\nThis article originally referred to a New York Post article about Beau Biden's laptop.

Unfortunately, Americans on each side of the political spectrum believe-incorrectly-that hard-liners dominate the opposite camp.\n\nAfter the killing of George Floyd last year, for example, liberal protesters across the nation pushed for criminal-justice reform, and many of the specific changes they sought enjoyed a lot of popular support. Even recent polls have shown that, regardless of political affiliation, most Americans remain in favor of police-accountability measures (such as body cameras and a registry of police misconduct), the banning of choke holds, and tackling racial injustices head on. Some activists went much further, though, demanding the complete elimination of police departments. Conservative pundits noticed. Soon, the Fox News host Tucker Carlson was p resent ing call after vivid call to abolish or radically defund policing. \"They would like to eliminate all law enforcement for good,\" he told viewers.\n\nRead: America's real 'wokeness' divide\n\nBut supporters of police abolition are the exception, not the rule, on the American left, according to research that my colleagues Matthew Feinberg, Alexa Tullett, Anne E. Wilson, and I conducted. In late October 2020, we asked more than 1,000 people in the United States whether they agreed that \"police departments are irreversibly broken and racist, so the government needs to get rid of them completely.\" Only 28 percent of the self-described liberals even somewhat agreed, indicating that this was not a solid consensus on the left.\n\nAlthough far out of step with what most liberals actually thought, Carlson's sampling of liberal views was emblematic of what conservatives believed about liberals. Conservatives in our sample estimated that 61 percent of liberals-more than twice the actual number-endorsed the abolition of law enforcement. This is a striking example of what plagues our politics: a false polarization in which one side excoriates the other for views that it largely does not hold.\n\nLeft-leaning readers might not be surprised that conservatives would accept as widespread a caricature of the radical liberal, given that they are so clearly blinded by racism or pro-police sentiment that they would excuse even the most unjust excesses of force. But wait-is this portrayal of conservatives accurate?\n\nNo. It isn't.\n\nJust as liberals came to rally around #BlackLivesMatter, conservatives gravitated to #BlueLivesMatter. From the vocal conservatives who made excuses for misconduct or blamed victims, some liberal commentators concluded that the right is dominated by police apologists . In fact, many on the right recognize both the humanity and hardship of police officers and those harmed by them. When we asked conservatives if police were almost always justified in their shootings of Black people, only 31 percent of respondents even somewhat agreed with the sentiment. Liberals, on the other hand, estimated nearly double that number of conservatives-57 percent-gave police a free pass.\n\nSome caveats: Our research, which is available as a preprint , is under review and subject to change. We drew our large samples of respondents from online survey platforms, not from nationally representative polling. We recognize that this sample-and therefore our estimates of the prevalence of liberal and conservative opinions-is not an exact microcosm of the country. Still, other researchers have concluded that these platforms are reasonably comparable to nationally representative polling.\n\nThe gap that we identified between what partisans really think and what their opponents think they think shows up again and again-but only on a particular kind of issue. People have a more accurate view of the other side's position on many standard policy issues, such as taxes or health care. But specifically on culture-war issues, partisans are likely to believe a caricatured version of the opposing side's attitudes. These misconceptions have hardened into enduring stereotypes: liberal snowflakes and free-speech police, conservative racists and \" deplorables .\"\n\nIn reality, just a third of liberal participants agreed even a little with banning controversial public speakers from college campuses, but conservatives estimated that 63 percent of liberals held that view. Only 22 percent of conservatives expressed hostile and unwelcoming attitudes toward immigrants, but liberals thought that 57 percent of them did. Our data suggest that many people are walking around with an exaggerated mental representation of what other Americans stand for.\n\nWhere do these ideas come from? Partisan media outlets have an incentive to stoke their audience's outrage by making extreme views seem commonplace. In our work, we saw that the more people reported consuming partisan news (a category in which, drawing on the work of other researchers, we included Fox News and MSNBC), the more they believed in a caricatured version of the other side.\n\nConor Friedersdorf: America's blue and red tribes aren't so far apart\n\nPeople's perceptions of others are powerful, even when they're wrong. We found that people disliked their opponents primarily for the fringe views most opponents didn't actually hold. Worse still, partisans who disliked their opponents most were least willing to engage with them, which likely forecloses the chance to have their misperceptions corrected through real-life personal contact. Instead, an oversimplified, exaggerated version of the other side's views is allowed to live on inside of everyone's head.\n\nWhat's more, partisans told us they were hesitant to voice their opinions about the most extreme positions expressed by people on the same side of the spectrum. For example, liberals were less keen to talk publicly about the downsides of censoring free speech than they were to talk about the benefits of universal health care. So although a majority of liberals opposed censorship, their reluctance to criticize it openly might have led conservatives to think that most on the left favored it.\n\nSo what should politically minded Americans conclude from our research-that, gosh, their opponents are just like them, and everyone should join hands in the center? Nope. Some policies-and some partisans-deserve forceful opposition, even contempt, from the other side. Vigorous disagreement, both within and between parties, is essential in a functioning democracy. But democracy also requires at least some level of mutual comprehension. No matter where people are on the political spectrum, they ought to know whom they're fighting with and what they're even fighting about."

      "text": "What Conservatives Mean by 'Freedom of Speech'\n\nThey believe that right-wing speech should be sacrosanct, and liberal speech officially disfavored.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nThe \"fire in a crowded theater\" case involved neither a fire, nor a theater, nor a crowd, and resulted in one of the worst Supreme Court decisions ever reached. But the phrase fire in a crowded theater was repeated by both vice-presidential candidates during their debate on Tuesday, demonstrating an ongoing misunderstanding of free speech.\n\nToward the end of the debate, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Tim Walz, pointed out that former President Donald Trump tried to overturn- first by fraud and later by force -the 2020 presidential election, which he lost. J. D. Vance, the Republican who was selected to replace former Vice President Mike Pence on the ticket precisely because he is the sort of quisling lapdog who would participate in such a scheme, retorted that Walz supported \"Facebook censorship.\"\n\n\"You can't yell 'fire' in a crowded theater. That's the test. That's the Supreme Court test,\" Walz said.\n\n\"Tim. Fire in a crowded theater? You guys wanted to kick people off of Facebook for saying that toddlers should not wear masks,\" Vance replied.\n\nRead: J. D. Vance tries to rewrite history\n\nThe equivalence that Vance draws between social-media moderation and Trump trying to stage a coup is ridiculous, but revealing in terms of how conservatives have come to conceive of free speech: They believe that right-wing speech should be sacrosanct, and liberal speech officially disfavored. Walz is simply wrong about the Supreme Court standard for what kind of speech can be outlawed, but the invocation of that archaic test does illustrate how safety can become an excuse for state censorship. It just so happens that social-media moderation is not state censorship, because social media is not the government.\n\nIn 1919, the Supreme Court upheld the convictions of socialist anti-war protesters under the Espionage Act in Schenk v. United States . The accused, Charles Schenk and Elizabeth Baer, had been passing out flyers urging people to resist the draft during World War I. The Court ruled unanimously in an opinion written by Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. that the convictions were constitutional, with Holmes writing , \"The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic. It does not even protect a man from an injunction against uttering words that may have all the effect of force.\" (The next time someone tries to tell you that \"words are violence\" is something left-wing college students came up with, remind them that the U.S. Supreme Court said it first.)\n\nThe cultural context here is as important as the legal one. As the legal scholar Geoffrey Stone writes in Perilous Times , the country was in the throes of the first Red Scare, and the Supreme Court was \"firmly in conservative hands. The values and experiences of the justices led most of them to hold anarchists, socialists, and other 'radical' dissenters in contempt.\" As Stone notes, Schenk and Baer's pamphlets urged political support for repeal of the draft, not even unlawful obstruction of it. The justices, however, did not consider the political beliefs of those they were judging to have value, and therefore they had no problem seeing people thrown in jail for those beliefs, no matter what the First Amendment said. After all, it was wartime.\n\nSo there was no fire, no crowd, and no theater. What actually happened was that some people had unpopular political beliefs and the government wanted to throw them in jail, and the Supreme Court said that was fine. That also happens to be the kind of thing that Trump wants to do as president , the kind of thing that the arch-conservative Supreme Court has decided he should have immunity for doing .\n\nThe Schenk standard, however, was repealed in Brandenburg v. Ohio in 1969, a case involving Clarence Brandenburg, a Ku Klux Klan leader who was convicted under a state law that prohibited advocating political change through terrorism. The Supreme Court-then a liberal court, something that had not existed before and has not since-overturned his conviction, ruling that that government can only bar speech advocating \"imminent lawless action\" that is \"likely to incite or produce such action.\" Stone writes that the Court was trying to tie its own hands to prevent the government from acting under the spell of \"fear and hysteria\" that can be brought on by wartime. It's a much better standard than the kind that gets you imprisoned for handing out pamphlets. (Vance, a Yale Law graduate, is probably aware that Trump's speech working up a mob that went on to ransack the Capitol and try to hang Pence could meet that much higher standard, known as the \" Brandenburg test .\")\n\nBut the fact that the government can put you in prison points to how matters of free speech are different for social-media companies. Social-media companies can't put you in prison, because they are not the government. They can ban users for not adhering to their standards, but this in itself is a form of speech: Just as the right-wing website Breitbart does not have to publish my writing, social-media companies do not have to publish the content of users who violate their rules. Social-media moderation is not state censorship, and it should not be treated as such. Conservatives understand this when the moderation decisions land in their favor, which is why the union-busting billionaire Elon Musk's favoritism toward conservative speech and attempts to silence his critics on the social-media platform X have not drawn the attention of the Republican majority in Congress. Nor should they-he owns the place; he can do what he wants with it. The point is that conservatives fully get the distinction when they want to.\n\nRead: Did Donald Trump notice J. D. Vance's strangest answer?\n\nVance's implicit position is that conservatives have a state-enforced right to the use of private platforms; that the state can and should force private companies to publish speech that those companies disagree with, as long as that speech is right-wing. Such a policy really would be a form of censorship .\n\nImmediately after Trump's disastrous September debate, conservatives, including Trump himself, began calling for ABC News to lose its broadcast license for fact-checking Trump's lies about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio. These threats of state retaliation against media outlets-or anyone who speaks out against Trump -illustrate that what conservatives mean when they talk about free speech is a legal right to use private platforms as venues for right-wing propaganda, whether or not those platforms wish to be used that way. That is a form of censorship far more authoritarian than private social-media platforms deciding they don't want to carry rants about COVID shots putting microchips in your blood that can receive signals from alien invaders.\n\nAs for Walz, he foolishly cited an archaic standard that the Supreme Court has thankfully abandoned, one that in actuality shows how dangerous it can be for the government to pick and choose which speech is acceptable. Walz has previously asserted that \"misinformation\" and \"hate speech\" are not protected, a mistaken belief that is unfortunately popular among some on the left. The flawed standard he cited last night explains why such speech is and should be protected-because the window for state power to police what individual people say should be as small as reasonably possible.\n\nHis opponents Trump and Vance, however, do not think that such an approach is dangerous at all. A government that chooses which speech to punish and which to promote is their ideal situation, provided that they are the ones in charge."

      "text": "The Conservatives Who Sold Their Souls for Trump\n\nThe rage and shame of the anti-anti-Trumpers is getting worse.\n\nThis is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.\n\nToday, Rich Lowry, the editor of National Review (the flagship conservative magazine founded by William F. Buckley Jr.), published an article claiming that Donald Trump could win the 2024 election \"on character.\"\n\nNo, really. But bear with me; the headline wasn't quite accurate.\n\nTrump could beat Kamala Harris, Lowry wrote, not by running on his character but by attacking hers . According to Lowry, you see, one of Trump's \"talents as a communicator is sheer repetition, which, when he's on to something that works, attains a certain power.\" Thus, he argued, Trump could hammer Harris into the ground if he called her \"weak\" enough times-50 times a day ought to do it, according to Lowry-and especially if he gave her a funny nickname, like the ones he managed to stick on \"Crooked Hillary\" Clinton and \"Little Marco\" Rubio.\n\nAll of this was presented in the pages of America's newspaper of record, The New York Times .\n\nWhat's going on here?\n\nMany journalists are reluctant to report on Trump's obvious instability and disordered personality -the \"bias toward coherence\" that The Atlantic 's editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, has cautioned about. But Lowry's article was different. I cannot know the actual thinking at the Times , although I suspect the paper accepted the article to offer a pro-Trump contributor as a way of displaying a diversity of views. The plunge that Lowry and others have taken into the muck of Trumpism, however, is not new, and has origins that are important to consider in the coming months of the 2024 election.\n\nWhen Trump decided in 2015 to run for president as a Republican (after years of being, at various times, a Democrat, an independent, and a Republican), the GOP establishment reacted mostly with horror. At the time, it claimed to be appalled by Trump's character-as decent people should be-and rejected him as a self-centered carpetbagger who would only get in the way of defeating Hillary Clinton. Lowry's National Review even asked some two dozen well-known conservative figures to spend an entire issue making the case against Trump.\n\nThe reality, however, is that much of the conservative opposition to Trump in 2016 was a sham-because it came from people who thought they were safe in assuming that Trump couldn't possibly win. For many on the right, slagging Trump was easy and useful. They could assert their principled conservatism and their political wisdom as they tut-tutted Trump's inevitable loss. Then they could strip the bark off of a President Hillary Clinton while deflecting charges of partisan motivation: After all, their opposition to Trump-their own candidate!-proved their bona fides as ideologically honest brokers.\n\nIt was a win-win proposition-as long as Trump lost and then went away.\n\nBut Trump won, and arrangements, so to speak, had to be made. The Republican base-and many of its heaviest donors-had spoken. Some of the conservatives who rejected Trump stayed the course and became the Never Trump movement . Others, apparently, decided that never didn't mean \"never.\" Power is power, and if getting the right judges and cutting the right taxes has to include stomping on the rule of law and endangering American national security, well, that's a price that the stoic right-wingers of the greater Washington, D.C., and New York City metropolitan areas were willing to pay.\n\nLowry and others in that group never became full-fledged MAGA warriors. Many of them hated Trump, as Tucker Carlson, now a born-again Trump booster, admitted in 2021; they just hated Democrats more. But they also hated being reminded of the spirit-crushing bargain they'd made with a tacky outer-borough real-estate developer they wouldn't have spoken with a year earlier. As Charlie Sykes wrote in 2017 , they adopted a new fetish: \"Loathing those who loathe the president. Rabid anti-anti-Trumpism.\"\n\nNone of this internecine conservative sniping would matter, except that the anti-anti-Trumpers, in order to justify the abandonment of their principles, are driven to poison the well of public debate for everyone else. They never expected having to deal with Trump for this long; they never foresaw themselves doubling and tripling and quadrupling down to the point where they now must politely look away from felonies , attacks on America's alliances, and promises to pardon insurrectionists. Lowry and others are intelligent people who know better, but their decision to bend the knee to Trump-even if only with a very small curtsy-requires them to take to the pages of America's national newspapers and say that Trump might be terrible but Democrats are worse.\n\nFor example, a colleague of Lowry's at National Review , Dan McLaughlin, has for years argued that he could never vote for Trump but that he could not vote for Clinton, Biden, or Harris, either. Harris's sudden upending of the race might change that. McLaughlin posted yesterday on X that \"Harris isn't just as bad as can be on nearly every policy issue-even profound life-and-death questions of conscience-she's a menace to the survival of the constitutional order.\"\n\nThis is a panicky and massive case of projection. McLaughlin might hate Harris's views on abortion (among other things), but Trump is a demonstrated \"menace to the survival of the constitutional order,\" and McLaughlin surely knows it.\n\nThe anti-anti-Trumpers must now define Harris-and all Democrats-as evil beyond words. Otherwise, how would they explain the ghastly compromises they've made? How would they argue against voting to stop Trump? When other conservatives, such as noted retired federal judge J. Michael Luttig, are enthusiastically endorsing Harris, some pretty fancy dancing is required to explain why your principles are more consistent than theirs. Unfortunately, when Trump is out there raising the bar on idiocy, cruelty, and anti-Americanism every day, that dancing looks more like Raygun than Fred Astaire.\n\nFor the MAGA media soldiers-the prime-time lineup on Fox News, the talk-radio hosts, the podcasters, and others-wacky (and hideous) accusations against Harris and other Democrats about \"Marxism\" and \"communism\" and \"after-birth abortions\" come easily because they are aimed at people who are already addled by a steady diet of rage and weirdness. But the conservative intellectuals who once opposed Trump have been reduced to dressing up such bizarre arguments as reasonable criticisms. They often seem to be sighing heavily and regretting having to be on the same side as Trump-but that doesn't stop them from making the risible claim that Trump and Harris are equally terrifying possibilities.\n\nStepping outside of years of partisan tribal affiliations comes with professional and social costs (and for politicians, electoral consequences). But principles are sometimes burdensome things; that's part of what makes them principles. The behavior of the anti-anti-Trumpers continues to be an inexcusable betrayal of the values they once claimed to hold. Many of them spoke, even passionately, against Trump-and then they shuffled into line. And for what? One more federal judge? A few billion more dollars in the account of a donor?\n\nIt's one thing to sell your soul cheaply. It's another to keep taking out second and third mortgages on it until all that's left is debt and shame.\n\nRelated:\n\nHere are four new stories from The Atlantic :\n\nToday's News\n\nDispatches\n\nExplore all of our newsletters here.\n\nEvening Read\n\nYoung Adults Are in Crisis\n\nBy Faith Hill\n\nWhat if I told you that one age group is more depressed, more anxious, and lonelier than any other in America?\n\nYou might assume I'm talking about teens ...

      "text": "Are Reform Conservatives Serious?\n\nA crop of young thinkers trying to steer the right toward the future needs to both vanquish the Tea Party and show it has more than just a marketing campaign.\n\nAfter Lyndon B. Johnson's landslide victory in 1964 and during the rush of progressive legislation that followed, Republicans decided they needed to respond with some proposals of their own. It was the high tide of Great Society liberalism, and Johnson had created a vogue for legislative creativity and for national solutions to public problems. Republicans did not want to be left out, and they hoped that some of their ideas might moderate and ultimately stop LBJ's juggernaut.\n\nThus arose the movement for Constructive Republican Alternatives. Liberals have always claimed that the original idea was for \"Constructive Republican Alternative Policies,\" until someone realized how unfortunate the acronym would be. But in truth, the conservative, moderate, and liberal Republicans (there were liberal Republicans then) who put their minds to formulating new policies were a creative bunch. From the liberals at the Ripon Society to the libertarian wing of Young Americans for Freedom to mainstream members of Congress such as Al Quie, Mel Laird, Mac Mathias, and Bob Ellsworth came a torrent of ideas, including a volunteer military; the establishment of revenue sharing with the states, an idea that can be traced back to Henry Clay and the Whigs; the negative income tax, broached early by the conservative economist Milton Friedman; block-granting programs to the states, still popular on the right; and the vogue for tax credits as an alternative to direct government spending, a method Bill Clinton freely applied when the era of big government had supposedly ended. Republicans were also essential to the enactment of the great civil rights and voting rights acts.\n\nNow the trumpet summons Republicans again-or so, at least, does a loose, informal confederation of conservative thinkers and legislators devoutly hope. These days, they speak of themselves as leading a \"conservative reform project\" and often call themselves \"reform conservatives.\" They are not exactly the Constructive Republicans of old-the absence of liberal Republicans means the intellectual compass of this group points farther right than did the lodestar of those Constructive Republicans two generations ago. But the Reformicons do have ambitions.\n\nSome among them are sharply critical of the Tea Party project. But many keep their criticism implicit, or argue that they are simply trying to fill a policy void on the right created by four and a half years of largely defensive and negative politics directed against President Obama and all his works. Given the power of the farther reaches of the right, most of the conservative reformers don't want to offend them too much.\n\nSeveral have used Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign as an object lesson in what Republicans should not do, pointing especially to how his campaign failed to speak to the vast majority of Americans who are employees rather than entrepreneurs. There are conservative reformers who hint at nudging the GOP to the left of where it is now and specifically highlight the importance of shedding radical anti-government rhetoric. Other Reformicons seem more interested in wrapping the same old libertarian small-government view in warm language about reviving \"civil society\" and relying on local communities to solve problems.\n\nThere are reformers, especially the younger ones, who say that the conservative movement must free itself from Reagan nostalgia and acknowledge that the problems of the twenty-first century are quite different from those that engaged the Gipper and the country in the 1980s. Other reformers see the road to the Promised Land as passing through a re-embrace of Reaganism-properly understood, of course. The Reagan they have in mind is the one who created Reagan Democrats because he could speak to working-class voters, a gift Romney didn't have.\n\nThe reform conservatives can already claim a significant success: Almost all of God's conservative children seem to want to take up the reform banner. This might lead to a certain skepticism as to whether there is any there here. The word \"reform,\" after all, polls very well. It was not surprising to see Karl Rove praise the movement in a March 2014 Wall Street Journal column . It was Rove, after all, who shrewdly rebaptized George W. Bush as \"A Reformer with Results\" to fend off John McCain's 2000 challenge in the Republican presidential primaries.\n\nIt puts the current reform conservatism in context to see McCain as this era's first reform conservative and to note that the positions he took, particularly during his 2000 campaign and in the early years of the Bush presidency, were well to the left of where most of today's reform conservatives are willing to venture. McCain was a passionate campaign finance reformer in a party that is now committed to tearing down all barriers to big money in politics. He acknowledged the human causes of global warming and introduced what would now be seen as adventurous legislation to curb carbon emissions. He opposed the Bush tax cuts with populist language that is very familiar to today's progressives.\n\nToday's reform conservatives are operating in a much more constrained environment. They are reacting against the Tea Party's extreme opposition to government. But they are also limited by an increasingly conservative Republican primary electorate, the shift in the GOP's geographical center of gravity toward the South, and a rightward drift within the business community. As long as these boundaries on their thinking hold, it is unlikely that they will leave behind as many policy monuments as the earlier Constructive Republicans did.\n\nThere is another constraint as well: While it is an article of faith among conservatives that Barack Obama has pursued a left-wing agenda-to keep themselves safely inside the right-wing tent, the reform kind typically pander to anti-Obama feeling as much as anyone-Obama has taken up many ideas that might otherwise be ripe for Reformicon picking.\n\nExample number one is paradoxical: the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the chief object of Republican scorn. Its much-maligned complexity is built around ideas that had their origins on the right and are designed to keep the private market in health insurance intact. Had Obama supported a single-payer system or an otherwise more government-oriented plan, one could imagine reform conservatives endorsing something that looked like Obamacare-which is exactly what Mitt Romney did in Massachusetts. It's something progressives need to think about: In trying to be practical, moderate, and reasonable, liberals themselves may have helped to shrink the philosophical space in which policies are formulated and arguments are carried out.\n\nObama is also a strong advocate of income-supplement plans such as the child tax credit and the earned-income tax credit, which often figure in conservative alternatives to more direct government assistance to the poor and to increases in the minimum wage. And income taxes under Obama are still lower than they were when Bill Clinton was president.\n\nBut reform conservatives would prefer not to acknowledge any of this, about Obama in particular or liberals in general. If Obama is socialism personified, then any idea he supports, no matter its genealogy, becomes suspect by definition. This is the lesson we can learn from the ritualistic attacks on the president for having \"extended the power of the federal government to an unprecedented degree,\" for having engineered \"a federal regulatory takeover of health insurance,\" and for pursuing policies that \"set a high-water mark for the size and reach of the federal government.\" These words came from an otherwise rather adventurous-and at times even scathing- critique of the Tea Party's view of government by two reformers, Michael Gerson and Peter Wehner, both former Bush administration officials. Writing last year in the Washington Monthly on what he called the \" Reformish Conservatives ,\" Ryan Cooper noted that members of this tribe seem inclined to produce \"about three articles bashing liberal statism for every one questioning Republican dogma.\"\n\nSo what is serious here, and what amounts to repackaging? David Frum , a true conservative heretic, argues that many on the right know that their product is not selling as they would wish. He uses the analogy of a failing pizza chain to ask the key question: How much are they willing to change the pizza, and how much are they merely changing the box?\n\nThe answer turns out to be complicated. At times, reform conservatism does seem more concerned with the box than its contents-more infatuated with the idea of new ideas than with new ideas themselves. But it's also true that the Obama years produced such a large lurch to the right within conservatism that many Reformicons accept the need for readjustment and for something that looks like a governing agenda.\n\nMichael Strain , an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, thus speaks of an \"unemployment crisis,\" particularly for the long-term jobless, and is willing to entertain Keynesian remedies. It is a sign that progressive arguments about inequality have gained sufficient purchase that Senator Marco Rubio is willing to acknowledge, as he did in a speech earlier this year, that \"from 1980 to 2005, over 80 percent of the total increase in income went to the top 1 percent of American earners,\" and that \"70 percent of children born into poverty will never make it to the middle class.\" That these realities are familiar to liberals does not diminish the importance of a conservative acknowledging them. Some on the right, such as Gerson and Wehner, have taken the Tea Party's anti-government attitudes head on, pointing to \"the inadequacy of the oppositional and negative approach to the question of the government's purpose and role.\" And a few have broken with conservative conventional wisdom altogether, as columnist Josh Barro has done in supporting the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAlthough McCain's maverick years suggest that some conservatives have long been aware of the need for new departures, the reformist impulse blossomed in the final years of the Bush presidency, when many on the right and within the Republican Party came to see it as a failure. In political terms, the results of the 2006 and 2008 elections made this conclusion inescapable. The early reform conservatives saw an opening for a less fierce approach focused on problem-solving. They hoped to speak to the less well-off voters who rejected the right and Bush. But their early efforts were buried under the Tea Party insurgency.\n\nBookish types were important to the early rumblings of reform conservatism. And some of the earliest books on the need to rethink conservatism quickly put their authors on the Index of Forbidden Thinkers.\n\nDavid Frum might be seen as a \"premature reformer,\" in the manner of those whom parts of the left once labeled as \"premature anti-Communists\" because they broke with the Popular Front before others decided it was fashionable to do so. Frum's searing criticisms of his own camp (beginning with his open disgust at McCain's choice of Sarah Palin as a running mate in 2008) made many conservatives unhappy enough to excommunicate him. Although the story is told differently by different sides, Frum's dissidence had something to do with his departure from (or his being asked to leave) the American Enterprise Institute in 2010. His break with AEI happened to come only a few days after he lambasted the Republican Party for its failure to negotiate with the Obama White House over the Affordable Care Act. Frum's heresy included acknowledging that the ACA had \"a broad family resemblance to Mitt Romney's Massachusetts plan,\" building on \"ideas developed at the Heritage Foundation in the early 1990s that formed the basis for Republican counter-proposals to Clintoncare in 1993-1994.\"\n\nAgainst Republican cries that Obama was leading the nation to socialism, Frum insisted (correctly, as it happens) that \"the gap between this plan and traditional Republican ideas is not very big.\" He also earned the opprobrium of many a conservative talk show host-and coined a highly useful term-by declaring the bill's passage \"a huge win for the conservative entertainment industry.\" Their \"listeners and viewers,\" he wrote, \"will now be even more enraged, even more frustrated, even more disappointed in everybody except the responsibility-free talkers on television and radio.\"\n\nAn even earlier apostate was Bruce Bartlett. A founder of the movement among conservatives toward supply-side economics, he rebelled against the Bush administration's budget policies. The title of his 2006 book explains why he became persona non grata among Republicans (and also why he was fired by the National Center for Policy Analysis, a generally pro-Bush think tank): Imposter: How George W. Bush Bankrupted America and Betrayed the Reagan Legacy . Ironically, this summarizes rather well the views that many Tea Party Republicans were to come to a few years later. Bartlett got there too early, and he has subsequently moved away from the right altogether.\n\nIf Frum and Bartlett were rebels, two younger men who published a reformist book in 2008 are among the Founding Fathers of Reform Conservatism. Ross Douthat and Reihan Salam (both born in 1979) have managed to stay a few steps ahead of the reform curve while still remaining inside the conservative family. Appropriately for their generation, both were influential bloggers. Douthat later became the youngest-ever New York Times columnist, and Salam has written for a variety of publications and is a senior fellow at the free-market R Street Institute. Their Grand New Party carried a subtitle that accurately captured their central preoccupation: How Republicans Can Win the Working Class and Save the American Dream .\n\nLike Frum, Douthat and Salam committed the apostasy of acknowledging the challenges and problems created by globalization. Most distinctive about the Douthat-Salam thesis was its criticism of the Republican Party for having relied for many years on white working-class voters without delivering many tangible benefits to a constituency that had reason to \"feel more insecure.\" Working-class voters had flocked to Reagan in the 1980s and to Newt Gingrich's revolution in the 1990s, they noted, but quickly became \"disillusioned with conservative governance and returned to the Democratic column\" because Republicans had failed to address their concerns. Republicans ruined the courtship, they charged, \"by confusing being pro-market with being pro-business ... and by shrinking from the admittedly difficult task of reforming the welfare state so that it serves the interests of the working class rather than the affluent.\"\n\nTheir prime policy antidote served as a prototype of the stance later reformers would come to. Republicans always like to fiddle the tax code downward, and the duo proposed a large expansion of the child tax credit to $5,000 (a policy that, as we've seen, that alleged socialist Obama embraced in a more modest form) as well as pension and tuition credits for stay-at-home parents. They argued that means-testing of Social Security benefits (a longstanding conservative goal) should be linked to payroll-tax cuts for lower-income workers (a direct, immediate benefit for the working class). They pushed a version of expanded charter schools and, in a bow to Bill Clinton, proposed federal help to assist communities in hiring a lot more cops. Some of their ideas were altogether outside the box, including a suggestion that farm subsidies be scrapped in favor of \"subsidies for carbon removal and other environment-friendly agricultural ventures.\"\n\nBut in all this, their cardinal concern was the breakdown of the working-class family, a catastrophe that aggravated inequality and stifled mobility and opportunity. This worry about the actual state of the American family-quite different from an obsession with opposition to gay marriage-might be seen as a Reformicon growth stock. At its worst, blaming \"culture\" for inequality can become an alibi for avoiding any confrontation with injustices within the economic system and a way to beat back proposals that challenge existing privileges. But the best of the reformers (Douthat and Salam among them) are willing to flip the causal arrows and acknowledge that the economic struggles of the working class have made the task of forming and maintaining stable families more difficult-thus their emphasis on new tax benefits keyed to parents.\n\nIn their concern over the state of the family, they are joined by National Review writer Ramesh Ponnuru, who originally advocated the large child tax credit, and New York Times columnist David Brooks. Ponnuru has long been willing to point out weaknesses in conservative arguments and was one of the first on the right (within days of the 2012 election) to score Republicans for a narrow focus on the greatness of entrepreneurs (those \"job creators\") to the exclusion of voters-the vast majority, in fact-who worked for wages and salaries. Brooks has long been a conservative dissident (Charles Krauthammer, speaking only partly in jest, once labeled Brooks his favorite \"liberal columnist\") and he frequently invokes the Whig tradition of Henry Clay and Abraham Lincoln to defend large-scale federal investment in infrastructure, research, development, and education.\n\nTwo other early ventures in reform conservatism are worthy of note. Yuval Levin is a 36-year-old University of Chicago Ph.D. who founded National Affairs , a quarterly journal that has become an intellectual meeting place for reform conservatives and intellectuals and policy specialists who represent many other brands of the creed. His recent book The Great Debate: Edmund Burke, Thomas Paine and the Birth of Right and Left ( reviewed in Democracy 's Winter 2014 issue ) chides \"today's conservatives\" for being \"too rhetorically strident and far too open to the siren song of hyperindividualism.\" He suggests that conservatives could learn from \"Burke's focus on the social character of man,\" his \"thoroughgoing gradualism,\" and \"his emphasis on community and on the sentiments.\"\n\nIn an important 2006 article for The Weekly Standard prefiguring these arguments, Levin acknowledged, as few conservatives are willing to do, the deep tensions between the market and the family:\n\nLevin acknowledged that the policy fixes he proposed (they included healthcare portability, long-term-care insurance, and school choice) were \"barely a start\" to what needs to be done for those in what he calls \"the parenting class.\" This admission points to an ongoing problem for the Reformicons: Even when they face up to the contradictions in conservative ideology and acknowledge the market's shortcomings, their solutions rarely challenge the market's priorities and are thus much smaller than the problem they're addressing. Nonetheless, Levin deserves credit for treading where many conservatives fear to go.\n\nMichael Gerson's 2007 Heroic Conservatism was partly a defense of George W. Bush, for whom Gerson had been chief speechwriter. But it was also an early marker for reform conservatism. An evangelical Christian himself and one of the pioneers of \"compassionate conservatism,\" Gerson mourned the decline of the alliance between evangelicalism and the cause of social justice. \"Where does someone belong who is pro-life and pro-poor?\" he asked.\n\n\"If Republicans run in future elections with a simplistic anti-government message, ignoring the poor, the addicted, and children at risk,\" warned Gerson, by then a Washington Post columnist, \"they will lose, and they will deserve to lose.\"\n\nHe turned out to be right about 2012. Yet in 2010, Republicans did run on \"a simplistic anti-government message\" that did ignore \"the poor, the addicted and children at risk.\" And they won. What mattered, declared Representative Mike Pence of Indiana-he was elected governor in 2012-was steering the Republican Party \"back to the principles of limited government, fiscal discipline and traditional moral values.\" The key word was \"back.\" The Tea Party's call for a \"constitutional conservatism,\" based on a remarkably skewed reading of the Founders' intentions, was, for a while, the only \"reform\" conservatism that counted.\n\nThe hard-line conservatives and libertarians who animated the Tea Party rebellion differed fundamentally from most of the early (and later) Reformicons in their explanation of the Bush presidency's failure. The Bush project imploded, they insisted, primarily because Bush represented \"big government\" conservatism. He ran up the deficit. He centralized control over education through the \"No Child Left Behind\" law. He created a large new entitlement through the prescription-drug benefit in Medicare. He preached a \"compassionate conservatism\" whose very name implied that the regular kind was cruel. And to top it off, he sought and won a $700 billion bailout of the banks during the 2008 financial crisis. The solution to what ailed Republicanism, the Tea Party partisans insisted, was a return to the true faith of small government, low taxes, and states' rights.\n\nThis explanation downplayed a great deal that actually mattered to the voters who turned away from Bush: the Iraq War, his handling of Hurricane Katrina, the economic collapse, and more. But it had the virtue that all good alibis have: It got those who might be accused of failure themselves off the hook. The only problem with conservatism, in this view, was that it had not been tried in a pure enough form.\n\nThe Tea Party attitude began to take hold before Obama became president and before the movement got its name. But the Obama ascendancy reinforced its approach among Republican congressional leaders. Urged on by the conservative entertainment complex, Republicans decided to erect a wall of opposition to virtually everything Obama proposed. This had two broad advantages for the GOP. The strategy was the only one acceptable to the party's conservative base. And by undercutting Obama's promise to be a unifying leader, Republicans could mire his presidency in gridlock, bring down his approval ratings, and declare him a failure.\n\nNone of this was particularly appealing to the conservative reformers, but most of them, as loyal conservatives and Republicans, fell into line behind criticisms of the stimulus and the healthcare law-to which many of them had objections anyway. And an increasingly conservative Republican primary electorate enforced the hard line and left little space for any compromise with Obama. The 2010 defeat of respected moderates such as Representative Mike Castle of Delaware and the threats to staunch conservatives like Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, who had once worked closely with Democrats, sent a chill through the reform cause.\n\nThe net effect was to leave the Republican Party in a parlous intellectual state as the 2012 election approached. Mitt Romney, a moderate conservative, may have defeated his more hardline rivals, but they defined the discourse during the primaries. Romney ran away from his record as governor of Massachusetts rather than touting it. Some of his most important mistakes-particularly his comments on the \"47 percent\" and his decision to offer \"self-deportation\" as his immigration solution-were rooted in his party's moral and ideological commitments and in his political need to embrace them.\n\nThe \"makers\" and \"takers\" idea had been introduced into the political lexicon by Representative Paul Ryan and promoted by respected conservative intellectuals such as Nicholas Eberstadt and Arthur Brooks of AEI. The moral elevation of the \"job creators\" over everyone else and the party's hard opposition to government made it difficult for Romney to offer material benefits (other than tax cuts) to the working-class voters whose support he badly needed in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere. Thus did the ideological positioning of the two parties put Romney at a disadvantage from the beginning.\n\nThis has enabled reform conservatism's comeback. In the wake of the 2012 defeat and then the strategic fiasco of the Republican shutdown of government in the fall of 2013, reform conservatives were in a position to say, \"I told you so.\" Tea Party slogans would not be enough.\n\nOne sign of the shift is a strategic repositioning by Republicans and conservatives who had once broadly accepted the \"job creators\" and \"makers and takers\" formulations but now embrace something more, well ... compassionate. Arthur Brooks published an article in the February 2014 issue of Commentary titled \"Be Open-Handed Toward Your Brothers\" in which he called on conservatives to accept the idea of a social safety net, support increases in the earned-income tax credit, and favor new ways of helping the unemployed, including subsidies to help them move to better job markets.\n\nOnce again, Republicans were thinking about the working class. One of the most creative Reformicon thinkers, Henry Olsen of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, was devastating in his description of the 2012 campaign:\n\nRepublicans lost the debate they never really joined because they forgot a core constant in American politics that involves, Olsen argued, \"the willingness to use government power to help individuals advance in life.\" He concluded, rather devastatingly to the Tea Party's champions: \"If American principles simply require hands-off government, then American principles have not been part of our politics for a very long time. A hands-off approach is not what American politics and principles require; it is a parody of what America and American conservatism mean.\"\n\nMost progressives would cheer this. But Walter Mondale's old question stands: Where's the beef? Do the ponderings of the Reformicons have any resonance among Republican politicians who write budgets and pass laws?\n\nMarco Rubio has received credit and attention for being willing to face some of the facts about inequality and obstacles to mobility, as he did in his January speech. Rubio said flatly: \"Our modern-day economy has wiped out many of the low-skill jobs that once provided millions with a middle-class living. Those that have not been outsourced or replaced by technology pay wages that fail to keep pace with the cost of living.\"\n\nFair enough. Then what? He dismissed the importance of raising the minimum wage, arguing that \"having a job that pays $10 an hour is not the American Dream.\" Perhaps not, but it's $2.75 closer than $7.25 an hour. We need to foster more growth, Rubio said, and what he offered was material that is in every Republican's speeches these days: concern about our \"dangerous and growing national debt,\" support for a \"tax code that incentivizes investment,\" and criticism of \"regulations that prevent employers from expanding.\" Not much new here.\n\nThe speech also reflected the ongoing Republican focus on culture and family issues. A child born into a broken family, living in a bad neighborhood, and attending a dysfunctional school \"is, in all likelihood, not going to have the same opportunity to succeed as a child growing up in a stable home, in a safe neighborhood and attending a good school,\" Rubio said. Again: sure.\n\nReally, Rubio's big speech came down to two major ideas. The first was to \"turn Washington's anti-poverty programs-and the trillions spent on them-over to the states,\" creating a \"revenue-neutral Flex Fund\" out of the proceeds. The second was the replacement of the earned-income tax credit (EITC) with a federal wage enhancement for qualifying low-wage jobs that \"appl[ies] the same to singles as it would to married couples and families with children.\"\n\nIt's hard to get excited about either of these ideas, and there are reasons to be skeptical of both. Rubio's \"Flex Fund\" idea is just a super block grant, hardly a breathtaking innovation. Moreover, as Sharon Parrott of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) pointed out , the Florida Republican's approach threatens to obliterate the role of various entitlements as automatic stabilizers during economic downturns. She also noted that as a general rule, it's easier to cut a big block of money than to win support for, say, throwing large numbers of children off food stamps. So Rubio's innovation could be an invitation to reductions in programs for the needy down the road.\n\nAs for Rubio's plan to replace the EITC, it's good to see Republicans endorsing programs along these lines in the wake of GOP efforts in Congress to cut them. And Rubio is right that the EITC is insufficiently generous to single workers without families. But one person who agrees with him on this is President Obama, who has included an expansion in his budget . Will Republicans work with Obama on this?\n\nRubio needs to respond to another concern: How is he going to pay for his program? As Parrott contends, unless Rubio plans to spend much more on his wage program than we now spend on the EITC, \"his proposal would have to dramatically cut the earnings supplements that the EITC now provides to low-income working families with children.\" Thus do Rubio's policy contributions raise the classic question that progressives will keep asking their reformist friends on the right: Even when Reformicons recognize there are problems that only government can solve, are they willing to put the money behind their solutions required to make a material difference?\n\nA second speech in the Reformicon canon is Representative Eric Cantor's \"Make Life Work\" address in February 2013. Cantor, the Republican House Majority Leader, is quite explicit in recognizing government's responsibility \"to ensure [that] every American has a fair shot at earning their success and achieving their dreams.\" He was concrete in describing the specific aspirations of so many American families and the kinds of questions they are asking:\n\nCantor's solutions, for the most part, followed a safe conservative script. He endorsed school choice, including both private and charter schools for low-income children. For higher education, he argued that parents and students be supplied \"with reliable information on the unemployment rate and potential earnings by major.\"\n\nHe also proposed allowing employees to \"convert previous overtime into future comp-time or flex-time\" and praised the child tax credit. And he tried to put his party's ongoing efforts to undermine the ACA in a pro-worker context by endorsing the repeal of \"the new taxes that are increasing the costs of healthcare and health insurance, like the medical device tax.\" This, of course, was just an effort to undercut the ACA's funding base. He proposed \"ending the arbitrary division\" in the Medicare program \"between Part A, the hospital program, and Part B, the doctor services,\" increasing spending for cancer research, and immigration reform focused on DREAMers.\n\nTo a large degree, Cantor was just recasting the existing Republican agenda in the language of what might be called \"solutionism.\" In one sense, this was progress, since Cantor was implicitly recognizing that Republicans had been asking the wrong questions, talking about the wrong issues, and limiting the range of voters they were addressing. While his education initiatives were old stuff-the voucher debate has long been with us-it's fair enough to challenge progressives on school reform. And Cantor's Medicare reorganization (unlike longstanding GOP proposals to voucherize the program) is a wonkish fix worth debating.\n\nBut it was also clear that Cantor was more engaged in rebranding than rethinking. The Republican \"flex time\" proposals may sound like an advance, but they reflect a longtime effort by businesses to avoid paying compensation for overtime. The \"choice\" for workers would not be entirely \"free,\" since they could come under pressure from their employers to take time rather than money when they worked beyond 40 hours.\n\nTwo months after Cantor gave his speech, he brought to the floor one of his policy alternatives, an effort to transfer money out of the ACA's disease-prevention account and into a separate endeavor to create high-risk pools for Americans who had difficulty obtaining regular insurance. He lost. Conservative Republicans did not want to cast any votes that might be seen as even indirectly endorsing Obamacare. Cantor's failure-even on an idea that, by any fair reading, was an anti-Obamacare move-raised again the fundamental problem facing Reformicons: They can come up with all the new policy they want, but if the congressional GOP remains locked in obstruction and opposition, then repackaging, let alone genuine rethinking, will remain an isolated project championed primarily by a few intellectuals and journalists but ignored by lawmakers.\n\nStill, the lure of reform conservatism is strong, and even the Tea Party now wants to put its mark on the movement. This helps explain Senator Mike Lee's April 2013 speech at the Heritage Foundation. Lee is a source of Tea Party pride as one of the first of its 2010 candidates to knock out a very conservative politician, former Utah Senator Bob Bennett, for being insufficiently pure. Right off, Lee's speech accepted a central rhetorical theme of reform conservatism: To be successful, the right needed to be positive. \"The left has created this false narrative that liberals are for things, and conservatives are against things,\" he said. \"When we concede this narrative, even just implicitly, we concede the debate before it even begins.\" He added: \"We conservatives seem to have abandoned words like 'together,' 'compassion,' and 'community' as if their only possible meanings were as a secret code for statism.\"\n\nIt was an astute rhetorical move, and Lee's quest for community took him to every form of human togetherness-he praised \"husbands and wives; parents and children; neighbors and neighborhoods; volunteers and congregations; bosses and employees; businesses and customers; clubs, teams, groups, associations, and friends.\" He insisted: \"Collective action doesn't only-or even usually-mean government action.\"\n\nWith government playing so small a role in Lee's effort to fuse libertarian practice with communitarian theory, it's not surprising that almost all his policy reform ideas focused on cutting back the state.\n\nThus did his \"new conservative reform agenda\" focus on attacks on \"corporate welfare,\" including what he called \"venture SOCIALISM\" (the capital letters were in his text) involving \"politicians funneling taxpayer money to politically correct businesses that cannot attract real investors.\" Invoking a series of conservative hobbyhorses, he called for ending public support \"to supposed non-profits like Planned Parenthood, public broadcasting, agricultural check-off programs, and the Export-Import Bank.\" He backed broad devolution of policy-making to the states. His list of problems that should be solved outside Washington included \"transportation, education, labor, welfare, healthcare [and] home mortgage lending.\"\n\nLee peppered his speech with references to \"reform,\" but what he had in mind were cutbacks and repeals. He did, however, offer one idea where libertarianism and liberalism coincide: sentencing reform. Progressives can credit Lee and other libertarians (such as Senator Rand Paul) for opening political space on the one issue that may yet allow Obama to find the trans-ideological concord he has been seeking since his presidency began. Nonetheless, Lee's speech and a subsequent critique of Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty serve primarily as a cautionary tale: As the ideas of the reform-conservative intellectuals gain traction, many elected officials on the right will try to recast program cuts, block grants, deregulation, and states' rights as embodying the next new thing in public policy. The promise of reform conservatism is that it will move the right to more moderate and practical ground. But many hope to use the buzz it has generated as an opportunity to stamp the words \"new and improved\" on the box containing the same old pizza.\n\nIt's important to recognize what the Reformicons are not . They are not the Creative Republicans who, in the mid-1960s, were responding to an intellectual and political world in which liberalism was at its zenith.\n\nNor are the Reformicons quite like the \"Atari Democrats\" or the \"New Democrats\" of the 1980s and '90s. Some in their ranks do, indeed, look back to Bill Clinton's project and the Democratic Leadership Council as models for remaking their party and their movement. But the 1980s Democratic moderates were responding to the ideological jolt of Ronald Reagan's resounding electoral victories. Obama's rise has not had the same impact-partly because his reelection in 2012 was far narrower than Reagan's in 1984. As some Republicans acknowledge privately, it will take a third presidential election loss in 2016 to open the space required for a thoroughgoing renovation on the right.\n\nAnd the Reformicons are not 1960s and '70s neoconservatives who, in their original form, were actually liberals \"mugged by reality,\" as Irving Kristol famously put it. In many though by no means all cases, the neoconservatives eventually became disillusioned with liberalism. With a very few exceptions, the Reformicons show no signs of defecting because most of them do not share the degree of alienation from their creed and their old allies felt by Kristol and those who drifted with him toward the Republican Party and the conservative movement.\n\nThe neoconservative movement is instructive in another way. In the lead-up to Reagan's 1980 victory, there was a genuine hunger on the right for ideas. The neoconservatives around The Public Interest and Commentary were welcomed by traditional conservatives of the National Review variety because the right was-certainly compared to now-in an expansive, optimistic mood. Today's right is a much gloomier movement more inclined to condemn heretics than to seek out converts. It has a remarkably pessimistic view of the country's future.\n\nConservatism has also been deformed by flights of irrationality about Barack Obama, egged on by Frum's conservative entertainment complex. The Reformicons are not the authors of the attacks on Obama as a socialist, a \"Muslim,\" a \"Kenyan anti-colonialist,\" or the bearer of a false birth certificate. Yet those who do launch such attacks have power in the Republican Party and their nasty inventions require much stronger resistance from a serious conservative intellectual movement.\n\nIn the short run, the Reformicons seem destined to let progressives down, partly because, as Salam has observed, \"Conservative reformism is conservative.\" This simple observation, Douthat argues, explains why the movement \"(understandably) strikes many liberals as disappointing, counterproductive or woefully insufficient.\"\n\nProgressives can welcome Reformicon efforts to correct the GOP's sharp tilt to the right, to reduce its overt hostility to government, and to rejoin the policy debate across a broad range of issues. Reform conservatism is better than the conservatism we have had.\n\nBut the conservatism we have had-and the politics it entails-will make it very hard for members of this movement to be as bold or as creative as our national moment requires.\n\nReform conservatives regularly frustrate progressives by refusing to face up to the problem of growing inequality (even when they acknowledge stalled social mobility). They are far too timid in their approaches to economic injustice and to the structural problems in the economic system.\n\nBecause the conservative movement won't allow them to do it, they refuse to recognize the ways in which Obama has used conservative means-their means-to achieve progressive ends, notably through the Affordable Care Act. Many of them, including Levin, remain passionately committed to Obamacare's repeal. Even when the reform conservatives and liberals agree, as they do on the value of the EITC and the child tax credit, most of the Reformicons (there are exceptions like Salam) are reluctant to make common cause with liberals to expand these programs. And even when they acknowledge the need to spend public money, whether on some forms of the safety net or on infrastructure investments, they often engage in \"rob Peter to pay Paul\" budgeting by calling for sharp reductions in programs progressives see as essential.\n\nThis points to the wide gap between the hopeful pronouncements of the reform conservatives and the behavior of Republicans in Congress, who define themselves by way of Paul Ryan's budget proposals, the latest of which, according to the CBPP, gets 69 percent of its cuts from programs serving Americans of limited means. There is nothing new and improved about this.\n\nThere are areas where progressives and the Reformicons might find common ground, sentencing reform being one of them. But the two sides are still some distance from shared premises. The conservatives are not wrong to point to family dissolution as a genuine problem for low-income Americans. But progressives would lay heavy stress on how economic insecurity (and the mass incarceration of African Americans) has placed unbearable pressures on families even as workplace practices placing market concerns ahead of family life complicate the task of balancing work and family. To the extent that conservatives focus on family breakdown as the primary cause of poverty and avoid examining how poverty causes family breakdown, what could be a useful shared quest for sensible and compassionate policies will be reduced to another shouting match about culture and values.\n\nSimilarly, most progressives value civil-society institutions as much as conservatives do. What they object to, as Mike Konczal argued recently , is the idea that these voluntary forms of community can replace essential government services. As Konczal noted, private charity can respond to social problems \"with targeted and nimble aid for individuals and communities\" but cannot be expected to shoulder \"the huge, cumbersome burden of alleviating the income insecurities of a modern age.\"\n\nHow do we judge the Reformicons by their own standards? Gerson offers a rather modest definition of who they are, calling reform conservatism \"an intellectual movement advocating policy alternatives.\" That is, when you think about it, a quietly devastating critique of recent forms of conservatism that didn't seem to care much about policy at all. It's why the appearance of Levin's National Affairs was an important event. The closing of The Public Interest in 2005 signaled a conservative retreat from open-ended policy debate. National Affairs sought to rejoin the contest of ideas, although the magazine is more determined to hew to the right's party line than was The Public Interest , which continued to publish the occasional liberal even as neoconservatism itself drifted steadily closer to the original brand. This is another symptom of wagon-circling and of how difficult it now is for its thinkers to go too far outside the right's version of political correctness.\n\nDouthat offers a two-part test in the form of principles: First, that while our \"growing social crisis\" can't be solved in Washington, \"economic and social policy can make a difference nonetheless\"; second, that \"existing welfare-state institutions we've inherited from the New Deal and the Great Society ... often make these tasks harder\" by crowding out other forms of spending, hindering growth, and contributing to wage stagnation. So, says Douthat, \"we don't face a choice between streamlining the welfare state and making it more supportive of work and family; we should be doing both at once.\"\n\nFor his part, Frum offers a more demanding standard. He argues that conservatives need \"an economic message that is inclusive where middle-class economic performance is at the core.\" This would include \"various kinds of benefits to middle-class people outside the market.\" One of them, he insists-and here is his Obamacare heresy again-must be \"removing healthcare as a haunting concern.\" Next would come a \"modern cultural message.\" The movement should abandon its insistence on making abortion illegal and replace it with a promise \"to cut the number of abortions by two-thirds over the next ten years.\" In the process, Republicans should be \"just banishing the idea that the purpose of your party is to regulate the intimate behavior of women.\" Frum wants a more environmentally conscious movement and, against the libertarian-leanings of Rand Paul, he insists that Republicans must maintain their position as advocates of military strength and engagement abroad.\n\nForeign-policy issues will split conservatives in the coming years, and they are not at the center of the Reformicon agenda. But a serious reform conservatism needs to take Frum's domestic agenda seriously. His call for an economic approach willing to go \"outside the market\" to ease the struggles of low-income and middle-class Americans is the acid test of the movement's seriousness. A true reform conservatism would move Republicans out of a comfort zone that sees deregulated markets and even more rewards for investors as elixirs for all economic ailments. Throwing more money at rich people is not a social policy.\n\nAnd the Reformicons, who are diverse in their views on social issues, need to be bolder in approaching cultural modernization. To have a future, conservatism cannot view an increasingly diverse and tolerant America as a horror. A Burkean traditionalism honors the gifts diverse communities bring to a nation.\n\nIn responding to the Reformicons, progressives can learn from those on the 1970s right who welcomed the liberal apostasy of the neoconservatives by way of expanding their movement. It is conservatism's current aversion to public intervention in the marketplace that is blocking efforts to grapple with the problems of inequality, slower job growth, and the diminishing prospects of a large number of our fellow citizens. To the extent that reform conservatives are willing to battle the Tea Party's reflexive hostility to government, they will be part of the solution.\n\nBut reform conservatism must still prove itself to be more than a slogan, more than a marketing campaign, more than that new pizza box. The Reformicons can be part of the historic correction the conservative movement badly needs-or they can settle for being sophisticated enablers of more of the same.\n\nThis article originally appeared in Democracy: A Journal of Ideas , an Atlantic partner publication."

      "text": "The Conservatives Dreading-And Preparing for-Civil War\n\nA faction of the right believes America has been riven into two countries. The Claremont Institute is building the intellectual architecture for whatever comes next.\n\nUpdated at 4 p.m. ET on October 5, 2021\n\n\"Let me start big. The mission of the Claremont Institute is to save Western civilization,\" says Ryan Williams, the organization's president, looking at the camera, in a crisp navy suit. \"We've always aimed high.\" A trumpet blares. America's founding documents flash across the screen. Welcome to the intellectual home of America's Trumpist right.\n\nAs Donald Trump rose to power, the Claremont universe-which sponsors fellowships and publications, including t he Claremont Review of Books and The American Mind -rose with him, publishing essays that seemed to capture why the president appealed to so many Americans and attempting to map a political philosophy onto his presidency. Williams and his cohort are on a mission to tear down and remake the right; they believe that America has been riven into two fundamentally different countries, not least because of the rise of secularism. \"The Founders were pretty unanimous, with Washington leading the way, that the Constitution is really only fit for a Christian people,\" Williams told me. It's possible that violence lies ahead. \"I worry about such a conflict,\" Williams told me. \"The Civil War was terrible. It should be the thing we try to avoid almost at all costs.\"\n\nRead: Republicans like Bob Corker have nowhere to go\n\nThat almost is worth noticing. \"The ideal endgame would be to effect a realignment of our politics and take control of all three branches of government for a generation or two,\" Williams said. Trump has left office, at least for now, but those he inspired are determined to recapture power in American politics. My conversation with Williams has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.\n\nEmma Green: What do you see as the threats to Western civilization?\n\nRyan Williams: The one we have focused on at the Claremont Institute is the progressive movement. [Progressives think that] limited government, in the Founders' sense-checks and balances, robust federalism, a fairly fixed view of human nature and the rights attendant to it-all has to give way to a notion that rights evolve with the times.\n\nThe biggest institutional part of [the progressive movement] is this large bureaucracy or administrative state, which is insulated from control by the executive or even, increasingly, by Congress.\n\nI would say the leading edge of progressivism now is this kind of woke, social-justice anti-racism. It's a threat to limited government because it seems to take its lead from scholars like Ibram Kendi, who has proposed a Department of Anti-racism that would basically have carte blanche control over local and state governments. His definition of racism is any policy that results in disparate outcomes for different groups. And we take issue with that. You always have different outcomes between different groups. Human nature is varied. We all have different talents. The pursuit of equal results is only going to be successful in a new woke totalitarianism. I realize that sounds a little hyperbolic, but that seems to be the road we're on.\n\nGreen: We're going to unpack \"woke totalitarianism\" in a second, but I want to make sure I'm understanding your starting point correctly. When you say Western civilization , it sounds like you're not necessarily describing people situated in geography or time but rather a set of ideas that you believe are falling out of fashion or are being actively destroyed by various forces in society. Am I getting you right?\n\nWilliams: You can never really divorce a set of ideas and principles from the people in which it grew up. America is an idea, but it's not just that. It's the people who settled it, founded it, and made it flourish.\n\nGreen: Just to ask the question directly, do you mean white people?\n\nWilliams: No, not necessarily. I mean, Western civilization happens to be where a lot of white people are, historically, but I don't think there's any necessary connection between the two. The ability to believe in natural rights and a regime of limited government the way the Founders did is not reserved only to white people.\n\nGreen: So you believe that there are American citizens of other backgrounds who belong in Western civilization-not just white people.\n\nWilliams: No. I think \"white\" is a pretty arbitrary category-\n\nGreen: People of European descent.\n\nWilliams: Okay, fair enough. No, it's not an exclusive inheritance of that.\n\nGreen: One beef in the Claremont universe is what you all call \"Conservatism, Inc.\": the professional-class conservatives who do panel discussions and run multimillion-dollar think tanks that produce white papers that ultimately don't lead to anything, in your view. You guys are basically a think tank too. Why aren't you just a slightly different version of Conservatism, Inc.?\n\nWilliams: Fair enough. Our target is not to say that good work doesn't go on at the large conservative think tanks. But we think we're in a real regime crisis right now. Our political elites and cultural and corporate institutions seem to believe in a way of doing government that is fundamentally at odds with the original, founding view-or even the view of Lincoln. We disagree on what men and women are; on what human nature is; what rights are. That's a real crisis. We would love if our bigger brethren focused exclusively on what we think are the real threats: identity politics; this ideology of anti-racism and wokeness, which you said we'll get to; the notion that borders are anachronistic and even racist, and that citizenship is global rather than national; that China is our main rival; the rise of big tech.\n\nGreen: Let's talk about identity politics and being \"woke.\" People throw those terms around a lot, and they can obscure more than they illuminate. What do you actually mean when you say you stand against them?\n\nWilliams: There are a few strands. The most ascendant one right now seems to be critical theory, which was born in France in the '60s and migrated to American universities. It has birthed all of these academic centers-gender studies, anti-colonialism, African American studies. It has some core tenets: There's no such thing as truth in politics; it's all about narratives and power, and we can't know truth, fundamentally. There's no such thing as natural rights; politics is making sure discrete identity groups, especially the ones who've been oppressed over time, now have an opportunity to express themselves.\n\nThat means deconstructing and disrupting what was the dominant narrative for a long time, which was the Founders' regime of natural rights. One of the institutional vehicles for it was the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which was meant to fulfill the promise of the Declaration of Independence for Black Americans coming out of segregation. But the courts and administrative agencies quickly turned against the color-blind, equal-opportunity vision of the founding and toward affirmative action-this calculation of current oppressor or past oppressor, and the pursuit of equity and social justice. Now this seems to mean that we're really not going to be where we need to be until all groups are equally represented and have the same outcomes for, say, home ownership, wealth, the proportion of CEOs, or members of Congress. That seems to be the goal of wokeism.\n\nGreen: I take it that you would not disagree with the basic spirit of the civil-rights movement, which was to disrupt the legal regime of racism enforced by the state primarily against Black Americans?\n\nWilliams: No, I don't disagree with that.\n\nGreen: But you do disagree with how you see this manifest on the left today. Do you have an alternative vision of what racial justice or equality-or whatever term you would use-should look like in 2021? How should we address continuing, legally sanctioned discrimination, assuming you think such a thing exists?\n\nWilliams: A true regime of nondiscrimination is when the state cannot disadvantage or advantage any group based on their skin color or ethnicity. That's the original promise of the Declaration of Independence. It is, in many ways, a color-blind Constitution.\n\nThe counter from the left is that there's systemic racism that has built up over years by certain legal systems. I would have to see some real proof of that. The main evidence seems to be that there are disparate results, thus there's systemic racism.\n\nGreen: Let's take one concrete policy example. The prison system in the United States disproportionately incarcerates Black men. Reasons for this include laws around sentencing, such as three-strike rules, or the possession of certain drugs being punished more harshly than others. This is an area of policy where the left and the right disagree, fundamentally, about the role race has played in the creation of the current carceral system.\n\nSo I guess the question is, in your vision of America, is this a problem? And is it a problem caused by racism?\n\nWilliams: It would depend on what is driving the disparate results. We would have to separate out the extent to which sentencing is truly discriminatory-and it ought not to be, if it is-and the extent to which the high incarceration rate of Black Americans is due to their much higher propensity to commit violent crime.\n\nUntil we can talk about that-if we can acknowledge that on the left and the right-it would be a wonderful starting point to try to dig into some of the issues you're talking about, like the different classification of drugs being more associated with one group or another. We have to start, though, with the acknowledgment that a lot more Blacks are in prison because they commit violent crimes at a much higher rate [than Americans of other races]. Whites commit violent crime at a much higher rate than Asians do, so I don't mean to suggest a racial crime hierarchy. But it's just a fact we have to acknowledge.\n\nGreen: But certain crimes are more likely to be seen by the state, right? It's easier to enforce against petty theft than white-collar crime. The other thing you might say is, okay, there are poor Black communities where more crime happens, but there are reasons why that's happening: Those communities have been systematically neglected over time. And we as a society should change that.\n\nI'm pressing you on this because it seems like the people in your orbit spend lots of time opposing the progressive program, but I don't see you articulating a vision of how to appropriately right these kinds of wrongs.\n\nWilliams: To the extent that we can discover real discrimination, solely on the basis of race, we ought to. But we need to reject the notion that different outcomes are de facto evidence of discrimination. There are plenty of examples of poverty, even acute poverty, not leading to crime. I think it has a lot to do with culture, family, and all the rest. I want us to be honest social scientists about the pathologies plaguing America.\n\nRead: What Texas abortion foes want next\n\nGreen: Glenn Ellmers wrote an essay for The American Mind about why the Claremont Institute isn't conservative. One of the things he writes is that some people residing in the United States-\"certainly more than half\"-are not Americans in any recognizable sense.\n\nWhat does it mean to declare that more than half of the people residing in the country are not truly American?\n\nWilliams: Glenn was, of course, being provocative and polemical. But if Claremont thinks real Americanism is a belief in the principles of the American founding, we have to acknowledge that a good portion of our fellow citizens don't agree with our principles and conclusions about what politics is for. If we differ on those fundamental things, we're really two Americas.\n\nEven during the Civil War-I think we're more divided now than we were then. As Lincoln said, we all prayed to the same God. We all believed in the same Constitution. We just differed over the question of slavery.\n\nGreen: This picture you're painting of unity around a certain set of ideas, principles, and beliefs about the nature of man and God doesn't feel accurate to the founding conditions of the United States. America was founded as a place where people who had really out-there ideas could come and live peaceably in geographic proximity to one another, eventually governed under a shared constitution. Lots of religious radicals were involved. America was founded on the principle that people needed to tolerate one another, but no more.\n\nHow is that different from today, when we are continuing to experience turmoil over who we are and what we believe and what our orientation as a nation should be?\n\nWilliams: Well, most of the Founders of America were Christians. There were radicals, to be sure. But there was much more consensus back then on what human nature is-on monotheism, broadly speaking, but really Christianity as well.\n\nOf course, Maryland was a bunch of Catholics who wanted their own place. But there was much more consensus on what government ought to do: to secure the blessings of liberty and natural rights. First among them was freedom of conscience-your freedom to worship as you see fit. I would reject your assertion that pluralism ruled the day in the founding. Pluralism is a term that comes up much later in the American tradition, meaning that the regime is indifferent to the types of groups that are in the country. I don't think the Founders would have maintained that at all. They thought natural rights were the possession of human beings across the globe, but the conditions for securing good government and protecting those rights were often unavailable. It took a certain bit of luck and civilizational tradition and learning and philosophy to get there.\n\nIn many ways, the miracle of America was to solve the problem that had plagued Western Europe for so many years, which was that every religious difference was an existential political difference that led to civil war and misery and depredation. With Madison and Jefferson leading the way, we solved the political-theological problem-that's the fancy term from Leo Strauss. They solved it well enough that we could all live together as fellow citizens.\n\nThat consensus was around for quite a while-broadly speaking, constitutionalism and limited government. We disputed over those things, but everyone thought the Constitution was a good thing and that government ought to protect rights. The glaring problem that plagued us for many years was the obvious contradiction of slavery to the principles of the Declaration. But there weren't really any Founders who defended slavery as a good thing. Maybe a few from South Carolina, but that was about it. There was a moral consensus, even if they lived up to it imperfectly, embodied in our constitutional culture. We've lost that. If we disagree that human biology is a good guide to male- and femaleness, we're a long way from the consensus of the founding.\n\nGreen: Do you think America can hang together in 2021 without Christianity at its core?\n\nWilliams: I'm ambivalent about that question. I think it would be bad for America if that longtime Christian core disintegrated. The Founders were pretty unanimous, with Washington leading the way, that the Constitution is really only fit for a Christian people.\n\nI would modify that a bit and say a majority Christian people could maintain that. But if you don't think your rights ultimately come from a Creator, you're halfway down the road to our modern confusion.\n\nGreen: Writing in the Claremont universe often has a dire tone to it. The essay \" The Flight 93 Election\" is one example of this, or that Glenn Ellmers essay.\n\nThe thing I always wonder is: What's the end game? If you truly have a sense that the American project is in crisis; that our country is not one but two entities; and that what's at stake is nothing less than our ability to be a free people governed under a shared constitution-are you guys, like, stockpiling weapons?\n\nWilliams: The ideal endgame would be to effect a realignment of our politics and take control of all three branches of government for a generation or two. The goal would not be the reconquest of blue America but rather the restoration of the constitutional regime that we think has been lost.\n\nWe have to find some modus vivendi to go forward. If we're two Americas, one of the more perfect solutions might be the return of federalism -the feds laying off in many respects. Let red America be red and blue America be blue. It's obviously more complicated than that, because even in red states you have plenty of Democrats, and vice versa. But we need to restore a robust federalism, one that allows states much more leeway. We've gone much too far into the realm of federal control, arbitrariness, and overreach.\n\nRead: The knives come out for Josh Hawley\n\nGreen: Republicans have lost the popular vote in nearly every presidential election in the last three decades. Do you worry about a project of minority rule -trying to assert your vision upon a country where many, many people do not agree with even your basic premises about what the American republic should look like?\n\nWilliams: I reject the premise that just because the popular vote isn't won, you don't possess a constitutional majority. We have an Electoral College system for a reason. Democracy, for the Founders, was a means to the end of the protection of rights. They set up a republic, not a democracy. The rule of pure numbers was never the touchstone of justice for the Founders. But the persistent inability of the right to win popular majorities-that is a problem. Ours is a project of persuading our fellow citizens, even independents and Democrats, that the current regime is on the wrong track.\n\nGreen: As a descriptive matter, do you think you guys are actually speaking for a silent majority in America that's actually sympathetic to your goals?\n\nWilliams: That's a testable proposition. I hope so. Trump showed the way it could be done. That was just the beginning.\n\nGreen: Many on the right seem to no longer believe in reality. QAnon gets a lot of hype, but many people on the right promote stories and narratives that aren't supported by evidence or facts, especially about the 2020 election.\n\nAre you at all preoccupied with this problem? I've noticed, for example, that one of your Publius fellows this year is a legislative assistant for Marjorie Taylor Greene, whose views certainly do not line up with reality . Does that concern you at all?\n\nWilliams: We believe in truth and reason. The question is whose truth and whose reason. That's part of the contested quality of our national politics. And it's not just the right. A third of the country thinks the election was given to Biden fraudulently. That includes a lot of Democrats.\n\nOur national standard at the elite-media level these days seems to be something far from the truth. We're no Q fans at Claremont. But it should not be surprising that, in our ideologically divided times, we have real division over truth and reality. Our national elites, and especially media elites, seem to be an ideological wing of left America rather than neutral arbiters of truth. It shouldn't be a surprise that a good portion of the disaffected right turns to alternative sources for their political information. Many of those sources are cranks and lunatics, but that's also nothing new. We've always had a robust tradition of firebrands and conspiracy theorists. It's very American, in a way.\n\nGreen: Your answer is strikingly postmodern: You seem to be elevating the existence of multiple narratives, which may or may not hold elements of the truth. It's also mostly a critique of the other side-a lot of people hate the media and think they don't say true things. But if you're trying to articulate what truth is as it relates to the American founding and ethos and mission, I would think you would be singularly concerned with the affairs in your own house. Greene has said she doesn't think 9/11 happened. She thinks the Rothschilds started wildfires using giant space lasers. We are in a fraught time for coming to a shared consensus about what reality is. Are you doing your part to keep your house clean?\n\nWilliams: On the MTG question, it's always been part of our project to educate folks who work in national politics, policy, journalism, etc. So I don't think it's suspect in the least for us to improve the staff of Congress, no matter who the congressperson is. Of course we're concerned in policing our own house and making sure that there are not, in our political and intellectual coalition, people who reject fundamentally what we think is right. That battle is ongoing.\n\nBut I will contest what you said. I didn't mean to elevate the notion of competing narratives. People are increasingly unsure of where to get valid information. A huge contributor to that has been our elite media.\n\nGreen: Do you feel like there is a hopeful future for America, or do you think we are headed toward some sort of generationally defining conflict that could potentially be violent?\n\nWilliams: I worry about such a conflict. The Civil War was terrible. It should be the thing we try to avoid almost at all costs.\n\nA lot of normal Americans just want to go about their daily lives, raise their families, and make sure that our kids are successful. It's really not that ideological, ultimately. I place a huge amount of hope in that. At the national level-the elite level-we have to advance intellectual ideas that we think are true, and the politics that we think will be the most successful. But we underestimate the extent to which we can lower the temperature in America and move forward with a lot more unity.\n\nGreen: I'll look for that the next time I read the Claremont Review of Books -that effort to make sure our temperatures are lowered.\n\nThis piece originally stated that Republicans have not won the popular vote in a presidential election in several decades. In fact, George W. Bush won the popular vote in 2004."

      "text": "Why Conservatives Invented a 'Right to Post'\n\nYou have a right to free speech as long as you are saying what conservatives want you to say.\n\nE arly December might have marked the first time anyone ever asserted a First Amendment right to see the president's son's penis , an argument that the Framers likely did not anticipate.\n\nIn November, the billionaire Elon Musk purchased Twitter, proclaiming himself a \"free speech absolutist,\" in defiance of a rather extensive record of retaliating against speech he opposes. A month later, Musk, citing five tweets that had been deleted at the Biden campaign's request in October 2020, asked, \"If this isn't a violation of the Constitution's First Amendment, what is?\"\n\nThe tweets in question included explicit pictures and video of President Joe Biden's son, Hunter-unambiguous violations of the platform's standards. Nevertheless, the Fox News pundit Tucker Carlson called their deletion a \"systemic violation of the First Amendment, the largest example of that in modern history.\"\n\nDavid French: Elon Musk and Tucker Carlson don't understand the First Amendment\n\nThere are some problems with this assertion. One is that Twitter is not the government and so is not bound by the First Amendment. Another is that the Biden campaign was not the government and was also not bound by the First Amendment. Still another is that there is no constitutional obligation for private actors to host images of a candidate's son's penis, and indeed, rather than a violation of the First Amendment, the choice not to host such images is itself an exercise of free speech.\n\nThe catalyst for these novel interpretations of the First Amendment was a Twitter thread by the journalist Matt Taibbi, which included the recently purchased platform's internal deliberations over whether the Hunter Biden story violated the company's policy on hosting hacked materials. Taibbi wrote in his newsletter that he was granted access to the files under unspecified \"conditions.\" The New York Times said it had requested access to the same files, but did not get a response.\n\nCuriously, as the writer Osita Nwanevu notes, among Taibbi's observations was that requests by the Trump White House for deletions were also \"honored.\" The Trump White House, of course, actually was the government.\n\nNow, those requests for deletions were not necessarily nefarious. Sources attempt to persuade media outlets not to publish things fairly frequently. Sometimes, those sources are in the government. Unless coercion or threats of retaliation are involved, there's no violation of the First Amendment. Of course, the Trump White House did openly threaten to punish tech companies over their editorial decisions, to broad support from people who think the Constitution bars Twitter from deleting Hunter Biden's dick pics .\n\nReconciling that apparent contradiction requires understanding how freedom of speech has been redefined to confer a right to say only what conservatives want you to say. In this particular case, conservatives are outraged that social-media companies limited the reach of a New York Post story published in 2020, which alleged corruption in Hunter Biden's commercial deals with foreign firms that implicated then-candidate Joe Biden. Fearing that the revelations were part of a foreign disinformation campaign, some social-media platforms restricted traffic to the story , or in Twitter's case, banned sharing of the link altogether, something then-CEO Jack Dorsey later acknowledged was a mistake .\n\nThose decisions didn't stop other media outlets from discussing or investigating the allegations. It did not even prevent people from tweeting their opposition to the decision, which was not confined to conservatives. Observers from across the political spectrum raised concerns about both the decision and what it said about the power and influence of tech platforms. As my colleague David French writes , rather than suppress the story, the actions of social-media platforms \"launched a national debate that's still not over.\"\n\nBut that wasn't enough. Conservatives wanted the Hunter Biden story to derail the Biden campaign and pave the way for a Trump victory. They have now convinced themselves that it was somehow a constitutional violation for private companies not to take the bait, and that the state should force them to do so in the future.\n\nThe insistence that social-media companies should not be allowed to make editorial decisions about what is welcome on their platforms, that it violated the Constitution for a publisher to reject a story it saw as unreliable, that a private company is obligated to let you use its platform to hurl racist slurs at strangers from behind the safety of a screen-this understanding reflects belief in a new constitutional right. Most important, this new right supersedes the free-speech rights of everyone else: the conservative right to post.\n\nP at Tornillo wanted to debate. In 1972, after the Miami Herald editorial page called the union leader and congressional candidate \"Czar Tornillo\" and endorsed his opponent, Tornillo invoked a 1913 state law that created a \"right of reply\" for politicians, and asked the newspaper to give him space to respond.\n\nThe Herald refused. Tornillo sued all the way to the Supreme Court, which unanimously struck down the law on the grounds that any law compelling an outlet \"to publish that which reason 'tells them should not be published' is unconstitutional.\" Acknowledging fears that media concentration had placed \"in a few hands the power to inform the American people and shape public opinion,\" and so produced \"a homogeneity of editorial opinion, commentary, and interpretive analysis,\" the justices nonetheless concluded that the First Amendment barred the state from deciding what a newspaper can publish.\n\nDeciding what or what not to publish, the justices concluded, was an essential component of free speech.\n\n\"The choice of material to go into a new paper, and the decisions made as to limitations on the size and content of the paper, and treatment of public issues and public officials-whether fair or unfair-constitute the exercise of editorial control and judgment,\" the justices wrote in 1974. \"It has yet to be demonstrated how governmental regulation of this crucial process can be exercised consistent with First Amendment guarantees of a free press as they have evolved to this time.\"\n\nTornillo, in other words, did not have a right to post on someone else's platform, even if the platform was powerful and influential, or even if it was politically biased.\n\n\"The First Amendment has always been intended to stop government regulation, not private regulation,\" Mukund Rathi, an attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told me. \"It's true that many users are often frustrated by the way that private publishers, including social-media platforms, regulate speech. They're often frustrated when platforms take down their content, or deprioritize, or demonetize their content. But these are all things that platforms have the right to do. And this is something that the Supreme Court has recognized going back centuries.\"\n\nBut that was before social media, and before a right-wing federal judge butchered the First Amendment and assembled a conservative right to post out of its corpse.\n\nGenevieve Lakier: The great free-speech reversal\n\nFor the past few decades, conservatives argued that virtually any restrictions on corporate speech violated the First Amendment. Most infamously, the Supreme Court ruled in the 2010 Citizens United case that restrictions on corporate electioneering were unconstitutional because, as Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote, \"the civic discourse belongs to the people, and the Government may not prescribe the means used to conduct it.\" Justice Antonin Scalia went further, arguing that \"to exclude or impede corporate speech is to muzzle the principal agents of the modern free economy.\"\n\nConservatives have previously classified interfering with editorial control as a form of \"muzzling,\" even when businesses are trying to avoid regulation that has little to do with expression. After Donald Trump took office in 2017, his administration repealed Obama-era net-neutrality regulations on the grounds that telecom companies had a free-speech right to decide what information gets transmitted over the internet, as an exercise of editorial discretion-a much broader power over what people can see on the web than social-media companies have. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has personally intervened in court on behalf of fossil-fuel companies whose First Amendment rights, he has argued, would be violated if the companies were forced to make public their own internal arguments about the reality of climate change .\n\nThe consistency here lies in the belief that corporations and people have freedom of speech as long as they exercise that right on behalf of right-wing causes. And that is where social media and the conservative right to post come in.\n\nThis fall, Judge Andrew Oldham, a Trump appointee on the Fifth Circuit, ruled on a challenge to a law in Texas that bars social-media companies from moderating or deleting users' posts. A district court had originally overturned the law, but the conservative Fifth Circuit intervened and upheld it without explanation, until Oldham's opinion .\n\nRegurgitating popular right-wing legal copypasta on social media, Oldham's opinion compared social-media platforms to \"common carriers\" such as phone lines and railroads-which, coupled with the current conservative position on net neutrality, is a little like arguing that cable television is not a common carrier but individual channels are. Oldham determined that the law was constitutional because \"we reject the idea that corporations have a freewheeling First Amendment right to censor what people say.\" The court, in other words, embraced the idea that the state of Texas has a right to determine what people say. The First Amendment bars state censorship. It does not prevent private outlets from deciding what ideas are worth publishing.\n\nOldham's ruling was, to put it mildly, a departure from not just the right's prior arguments regarding corporations and free speech but a century of legal precedent . \"Just as I decide what to write and what not to write, bookstores decide what books to carry and what not to carry, newspapers decide what articles to publish and what ads they accept. It's a fundamental aspect of content creation and its publication,\" Jennifer Granick, an attorney for the ACLU, told me. \"There's always some kind of selection or curation that takes place. And it is irrelevant that the speech is [the] speech of other people. Newspapers have letters to the editor, but the newspaper doesn't have to publish every single letter.\"\n\nTexas made no secret at the time of the law's passage as to its purpose. \"Social media websites have become our modern-day public square,\" Governor Abbott said in a 2021 press release after signing the bill. \"They are a place for healthy public debate where information should be able to flow freely-but there is a dangerous movement by social media companies to silence conservative viewpoints and ideas.\" A similar law in Florida was announced by Governor Ron DeSantis as a strike against the \"leftist media.\"\n\nThe First Amendment was never meant to prevent private actors from deciding which ideas are worthy of elevation or abandonment. Its purpose is to ensure that the government does not make that determination for them, even when that choice ends up being wrong. Although this particular act of censorship presents itself as a kind of anti-censorship, its overt aim is to impose state control over what speech and which ideas may be disregarded.\n\n\"Both of the laws are, in their central provisions, attempts to override the platforms' editorial judgment,\" Jameel Jaffer, the executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, told me. \"They are attacks that are motivated by the platforms' past editorial judgments, an effort to punish the platforms for editorial positions that some of them took with respect to President Trump's account in particular.\"\n\nThe statute invoked by Tornillo was absurd, but at least it was crafted in an effort to ensure evenhandedness, not to impose state-approved political ideology on private platforms.\n\n\"Conflation of the platforms as a single body also implies they use the same exclusion and censorship criteria, which they do not,\" John Coates, a deputy dean at Harvard Law School, told me. \"If one were to treat all newspapers as a body, then one could easily have said circa 1975 that collectively they occupied the same role as the platforms today, yet in the Miami Herald case the Court rejected the idea that its discrimination based on viewpoint could be made illegal by the state.\"\n\nEven if you think that social-media platforms should be politically \"neutral,\" every platform has a right to decide what that means; a state imposing its own view of \"neutrality\" infringes on the right of an outlet to define what neutrality is. If the government can tell The New York Times what is \"fit to print\" or Fox News what it thinks is \"fair and balanced,\" then the First Amendment offers no protection. As my colleague Charlie Warzel noted , taken at face value, the Texas law would ban editing Wikipedia-any deletion \"could be deemed an act of censorship based on the viewpoint of that user.\" This may sound like a far-fetched hypothetical, but Wikipedia's failure to amplify Taibbi's \"Twitter files\" to right-wing satisfaction is already prompting such complaints .\n\n\"If you have to highlight or promote or repeat certain information, you're being forced to express the idea that all points of view are equally valid to you, and equally worthy of your time and energy and effort. That is a viewpoint,\" Granick said. \"The Court's opinion tries to impose or imposes that viewpoint on platforms.\"\n\nIn Citizens United , the Republican-appointed justices feared that restrictions on corporate electioneering amounted to state control of civic discourse, \"muzzl[ing] the principal agents of the modern free economy.\" But when the justices wrote that decision, they were thinking of corporations as allies of the conservative movement. The moment that perception changed, conservative views on corporate speech changed too. Last year, Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a longtime champion of corporate electioneering, warned of state retaliation if private firms did not \"stay out of politics,\" by which he meant stop opposing Republican interests. It is wrong to \"muzzle\" the \"principal agents of the modern free economy,\" unless they do something Republicans don't like. Then it's fine.\n\nConservative complaints about Big Tech are only superficially distinct from their grievances with the so-called liberal media. That is, those frustrations are really about the failure of large media organizations to uncritically repeat right-wing propaganda, as more conservative media organizations do. A mainstream media outlet may fact-check, verify, or report out an allegation, while all too often, an outlet like Fox News will simply repeat, fortify, or amplify whatever politically convenient falsehoods emerge from the right-wing fever swamp. More to the point, which key stories Fox News withholds from its captive conservative audience is as important to shaping people's worldview as what the network broadcasts. Few Fox viewers, for example, have heard from the network that Trump called for the \"termination\" of the Constitution and his reinstatement as president following Taibbi's tweets.\n\nThe late federal judge Laurence Silberman last year called for the landmark New York Times v. Sullivan decision to be overturned because the Times and The Washington Post \"are virtually Democratic Party broadsheets,\" adding that \"nearly all television-network and cable-is a Democratic Party trumpet.\" The defamation precedent set by Sullivan has nothing to do with objectivity or neutrality; indeed, early American newspapers were vicious and explicitly partisan in nature , and the First Amendment could not have been intended to exclude them. The conservative conception of the \"marketplace of ideas\" has come to resemble conservative views on elections-they are functioning properly only when they provide the desired results.\n\nLike the Texas and Florida laws, Silberman's demand was simply state retaliation against media outlets for being insufficiently conservative. The logic is the same, whether conservatives are applying it to new media or to old: Private companies that are insufficiently right-wing should be disciplined by the state until they change. That is the type of state coercion the First Amendment was intended to prevent.\n\nFox News's large audience and agenda-setting power allow it to influence the decisions made by its mainstream competitors, but right-wing social-media networks are relatively closed ecosystems and cannot serve the same purpose. The allure of controlling Twitter, in particular, is that the platform removes the middleman and allows for the direct dissemination of propaganda without verification to an audience broader than hard-core conservatives, and to bully any opposition, including people who decide what goes on the front pages or leads the evening news. Moderation policies, designed to keep more mainstream social networks profitable for advertisers, interfere with both objectives.\n\nBecause social-media platforms are privately owned, they have their own First Amendment right to editorial discretion. To use them for their own political purposes, including propaganda, disinformation, harassment, and message discipline, conservatives had to invent a new constitutional right: a conservative right to post.\n\nI 'm not entirely sure when the conservative right to post first began to emerge. It was probably around 2015, when Donald Trump used Twitter as the main platform for his presidential campaign, and when the site was pressured to crack down on racist harassment and Islamic State propaganda, particularly after ISIS used social media to disseminate video of its execution of the journalist James Foley. Conservatives urged Twitter to ban ISIS from its platform , but they were far more ambivalent about its subsequent crackdown on white-nationalist accounts, many of which were and remain strongly supportive of Trump's candidacy.\n\nRead: The internet won't be the same after Trump\n\nThe point of these crackdowns, however, was not to promote liberalism or the left but to ensure that the platform remained a profitable advertising space. Twitter's initial \"hands-off approach,\" as USA Today reported in 2016 , had \"contributed to a dramatic rise in abuse, harassment and hate speech,\" after which \"revenue growth stagnated and public backlash increased.\"\n\nSocial-media companies often promise a paradise of unrestricted speech, and then, as they find their platforms being used in ways they oppose, suddenly discover the virtues of moderation. The Techdirt journalist Mike Masnick has called this \"the content moderation learning curve,\" and right-wing \"free speech\" alternatives to Twitter provide poignant examples of the phenomenon.\n\nAs the EFF brief in the Texas case outlines , conservative social-media platforms such as Rumble, Gab, and Trump's Truth Social retain their own moderation policies , in the interest of building and maintaining right-wing political communities and limiting the nature of conversations on their platform. Gettr, a social-media site founded by a former Trump aide, began shutting down comments related to allegations that one of its backers was a spy for the Chinese government. Trump's Truth Social blocked content related to the former president's attempt to stage a violent coup in an effort to retain power after losing the election, and also blocked comments that were in favor of abortion rights. Parler began banning people for posting photographs of excrement or pornography in replies to posts, or for making fun of the website. Rumble's terms of service bar content that engages in \"violence or unlawful acts, including but not limited to Antifa groups and persons affiliated with Antifa, the KKK and white supremacist groups and or persons affiliated with these groups.\" Concisely summarizing the conservative right to post, the right-wing social network ProAmericaOnly promises both \"no censorship\" and \"no liberals.\"\n\nThese social networks, quite plainly, envision themselves not as open forums, but as ideological communities, which is their right. Anyone who logs on to such a site understands this, the same way you know what you're going to get when you open The Nation or National Review or, for that matter, The Atlantic . But because they are owned by conservatives, there is no need for a broad legal theory asserting a right to use a private platform in ways the owners themselves don't want. These right-wing social-media sites are \"free speech\" alternatives not because they refrain from moderating content, but because under the tenets of the conservative right to post, \"free speech\" just means the right controls the conversation.\n\nTwitter is smaller than other social-media networks in terms of users , but retains outsize importance because of its use by elite figures and journalists and, consequently, the ability of other users to influence media coverage. Both left and right use Twitter this way, but the left has not invented a right to post for itself. Judge Oldham's opinion is remarkable not just because of its disregard for the Constitution, but because it is an example of right-wing \"posting law\" migrating from guys with Confederate-flag avatars to the conservative elite.\n\nTrump's use of Twitter also shaped the character of the conservative movement, spawning a legion of feeble imitators who seek fame by catastrophizing about the liberal menace and engaging in thinly veiled murderous ideation against their political opponents. Posting has become the primary means for right-wing personalities and politicians to build brands and followings, in part by showcasing angry liberal responses to their posts. Posting has even supplanted governance for some ambitious politicians, whose policies and proposals become secondary to their performances on social media. Then there are those who are simply hooked on the emotional rewards of posting, and resent the possibility that their supplier may restrict their access.\n\nBut the right-wing fixation on social media wasn't caused just by Trump. It also traces back at least as far as anger over a 2016 Gizmodo article that concluded Facebook had \"spiked\" conservative topics. Years later, John Cook, a former Gawker editor, reflected that the story showed Facebook engaging in \"using human judgment to dismiss false or unreliable or uninteresting news,\" which is \"what news organizations do every day.\" In other words, it showed the site using its constitutionally protected editorial judgment.\n\nThe problem, of course, was that Facebook had originally claimed that its trending topics were curated by algorithm and that people had nothing to do with it. The story sparked a right-wing backlash against social-media companies, which began bending over backwards to placate conservatives and exempt them from their stated rules as much as possible without allowing the networks to become cesspools. This has not mollified conservatives, because the backlash is simply too politically useful to abandon. Social-media companies' documented suppression of liberal outlets and courtship of right-wingers has received much less attention, because liberals do not assert a similar right to post, and conservatives don't care if the platforms suppress left-wing content.\n\nSocial-media companies invited criticism of this nature by claiming to be neutral platforms, rather than admitting that they are curated communities shaped by editorial judgment. Corporate gatekeepers to public knowledge have existed since the emergence of radio and television networks. The distinction is that unlike the social-media titans, those networks understood that their platforms came with a level of responsibility to accurately inform the public, even though they often made mistakes. Despite legitimate fears of social-media platforms' influence, they are presently weak gatekeepers compared with newspapers and broadcast outlets in the past, at least in America. It's hard to imagine something like Woodrow Wilson's incapacitation remaining under wraps today.\n\nThe dishonesty of social-media companies also doesn't alter the First Amendment. As Justice Clarence Thomas has noted, \"Once a court concludes that conduct is expressive, the Constitution limits the government's authority to restrict or compel it.\" Of course, Thomas was talking about a baker's right to turn away gay customers for ordering a wedding cake ; he may be as much of a believer in the conservative right to post as his Trumpist colleagues on the federal bench.\n\nIn October, Thomas, along with Gorsuch and Alito, dissented from the Supreme Court's decision to stay the Texas law, which the Court seems likely to take up at some point. Masnick, of Techdirt, wrote that Alito, in his dissent, \"seems extremely confused about a few important concepts,\" but Alito has never needed to understand an issue to know which side to take.\n\nAfter the suppression of ISIS content on Twitter, the company turned its attention to moderating the flood of racist harassment afflicting the platform. Twitter was trying to crack down on posts that might frighten advertisers, but conservatives felt targeted, because so much of what passed for right-wing political activism on the platform violated the terms of service. Instead of simply altering their conduct to conform to the rules they'd agreed to observe when they joined the site, they began to attack its moderation policies. That cause grew in urgency as Trump's flouting the terms of service-and the obvious exemption from the rules carved out for him-caused Twitter public-relations trouble.\n\nDuring the 2020 campaign, when Trump began attacking mail-in voting as a means to delegitimize a potential election loss, Twitter began affixing labels to Trump's tweets characterizing them as misleading or false. Notwithstanding the fact that no speech is more protected by the First Amendment than the right to criticize government officials, conservatives began howling for Trump-led state retaliation against the platform, in the name of \"free speech.\"\n\nConservative rage against the social-media platforms grew incandescent in the waning days of the 2020 election, when some platforms limited the reach of the Post story about Hunter Biden's laptop. The platforms reportedly feared that the story might have been part of a then-active Russian disinformation operation they had been warned about by federal law enforcement, a perception the Biden campaign encouraged. The Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani called for Jack Dorsey to be imprisoned .\n\nMany observers-again, not just conservatives-criticized the platforms' handling of the Hunter Biden story, and the president's son remains under federal investigation for potential tax crimes . More mainstream outlets found no evidence of the Post 's major insinuation that the president had somehow participated in his son's alleged corruption, a conclusion also reached by an election-year Republican Senate investigation . Such evidence may emerge, but for now only one 2020 candidate owns a business engaged in documented criminal activity , and it's the inveterate poster.\n\nThe decision illustrated both the immense power of these platforms and their importance as conduits for political propaganda. Even though Twitter's actions were protected by the First Amendment, the Hunter Biden episode nonetheless raised troubling questions both about the power of the platforms in the contemporary media ecosystem and about the difficulty of dealing with misinformation and the exposure of private data. But the Tornillo Court was similarly concerned with the \"concentration of control of outlets to inform the public\" posed by corporate consolidation of ownership over television, newspapers, and radio. The justices nevertheless concluded that \"a responsible press is an undoubtedly desirable goal, but press responsibility is not mandated by the Constitution, and, like many other virtues, it cannot be legislated.\"\n\n\"When you have an extremely powerful platform, powerful because it has so many users, the way that the platform exercises that editorial judgment is something that the public has an interest in. It can be a real concern that certain viewpoints are suppressed,\" Granick, of the ACLU, said. \"The answer to that problem, though, is to have a multiplicity of platforms, and to have a multiplicity of outlets.\"\n\nSome free-speech advocates, while agreeing that social-media platforms have broad editorial discretion, are nevertheless nervous about the breadth of the legal claims in these cases. \"If there's one thing the First Amendment protects, it's the right of private speakers to decide for themselves what's worth publishing, and what's not worth publishing,\" Jameel Jaffer told me. \"On the other hand, if you accept the platforms' view, then there's virtually no regulation that will survive First Amendment scrutiny, even very narrowly crafted transparency legislation, or due-process legislation, or privacy legislation, interoperability legislation-all of these things can be characterized as burdens on editorial judgment.\"\n\nFew of Twitter's conservative critics were interested in finding the right balance between these competing considerations. Instead, the main source of the rage on the right was that Twitter's caution kneecapped a last-minute \"October surprise\" that could have thrown the election to Trump. Giuliani told The New York Times that he'd gone to the Post precisely because he did not want the material properly investigated before being published. \"Either nobody else would take it, or if they took it, they would spend all the time they could to try to contradict it before they put it out,\" Giuliani told the Times in 2020. He was not demanding a more responsible press-he was looking for a less responsible one.\n\nTrump's banishment from the platform for using it to attempt to overturn the 2020 election lent further urgency to the search for a legal doctrine that might justify a conservative right to post, part of a broader Trump-era ideological project of restricting rights to those who conservatives believe should have them. After four years of Trump appointments, the federal bench and the conservative legal elite were now full of people who had adopted this doctrine and were willing to write it into the law.\n\nRight-wing objections are not about the platforms' tremendous power, which is a genuine concern with no simple solutions. What the right wants is uninhibited control over platforms where it can influence nonconservatives. If the platforms remained as powerful and influential as they are now, and simply did everything conservatives told them to do, there would be no demands to regulate social media like telegraph wires.\n\nWhich is why the right celebrated when Elon Musk bought Twitter.\n\nI n late October, Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul, was attacked by a disturbed man with a hammer, who police have said was looking for the House speaker.\n\nDavid A. Graham: January 6 never ended\n\nDays after Musk's purchase of Twitter was finalized, the billionaire tweeted a link from a right-wing conspiracy website putting forth a false rumor that Pelosi had been attacked by a gay lover, amplifying a conservative propaganda campaign meant to obscure the motives of the attacker, whose head was filled with the toxic waste that circulated easily on the platform even before Musk purchased it. A week later, Musk urged his followers to vote Republican in the midterm elections.\n\nA group of users flooded the site with racist invective , apparently believing Musk's purchase of the platform meant that the old rules would no longer apply-a foreseeable scenario, but one Judge Oldham had dismissed as \"hypothetical\" and \"imaginary.\" Misinformation about the midterm elections flourished on the platform , which has shed thousands of employees under Musk's leadership. Musk, the self-proclaimed \"free speech absolutist,\" fired staffers who criticized his management in public or in private , and then joined conservative media figures in celebrating the firings as an appropriate punishment for having what they saw as the wrong political views.\n\nThe Tesla CEO reversed bans on many right-wing users, including Trump, but-exercising his editorial judgment-retained a ban on the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, whom he finds personally offensive . Musk offered friendly engagement to right-wing accounts posting Nazi memes , and mocked a Democratic senator who had been impersonated by someone taking advantage of Musk's new verification policy, which no longer provides verification of anything beyond a Twitter Blue subscription. He then began banning left-wing activists from the platform on the direct advice of his far-right fanboys. It was, in short, an auspicious beginning for Musk's right-wing fans. As long as Musk uses his editorial discretion in furtherance of right-wing priorities, they will defend it.\n\nAmid this chaos, advertisers began pausing their ads on the platform. Musk threatened to \"thermonuclear name & shame\" those who had withdrawn their funds, whom he accused of \"trying to destroy free speech in America\" by not giving Musk their money. Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas warned advertisers to \"think carefully\" before \"throwing their lot in with the far left of the Democratic Party\" by pausing their ads. Josh Holmes, a former aide to Mitch McConnell, that great champion of corporate free speech, announced that the advertisers were \"begging to sit in front of a House panel next year to discuss their company's participation in leftist corporate extortion.\" The conservative activist Tom Fitton urged Musk to sue civil-rights groups that were urging advertisers to boycott the platform until Musk adopted moderation policies against \" hate and misinformation .\" Instead of calls to override Musk's editorial judgment with state power, there were demands to use state power to punish those who chose not to support his venture.\n\nBefore Musk purchased Twitter, conservatives had wanted to use the power of the state to control the platform. Once he purchased it, they assumed it would now become a reliable conduit for conservative propaganda. So they threatened to use the power of the state to force private companies to sustain Musk's venture, and to silence activists exercising their First Amendment rights to register their objections. All in the name of \"free speech.\"\n\nRead: The madness of Twitter\n\nDo not mistake my defense of the platforms' First Amendment rights for affection. Despite their virtues, the platforms remain pliant mediums for every manner of scammer, hustler, and propagandist. The ubiquity of cellphones gives social-media sites broader reach than any of their predecessors, including television and radio in the mid-20th century. But they lack a sense of responsibility for how they are used or exploited, because they are vehicles for profit with few sincere civic commitments. I disagree with Musk's editorial judgment and enthusiasm for right-wing agitprop; the legal implications of state control of editorial discretion just happen to be much worse.\n\nBy no means do conservatives have a monopoly on political propaganda, falsehoods, or even bigotry. Indeed, one could imagine a liberal proposal to combat \"misinformation\" that similarly attempted to extend state control over speech online . But neither has the left concocted a preposterous legal theory of freedom of speech that amounts to a requirement that individual platforms host, promote, or fund propaganda or else be subject to state retaliation or coercion.\n\nAcross the varied arguments advanced by conservatives in recent decades, one consistent principle is readily discernible: Where a speaker is engaging in activism on behalf of conservative causes, they have an unfettered right to freedom of speech. Where they are not, or where they actively oppose those causes, their speech is subject to state suppression. This holds true for all of these \"free speech\" controversies: Citizens United , education gag laws, attacks on public libraries, hand-wringing over \"cancel culture,\" and the latest demands for state control of social media. The pattern is so steady that one wonders whether the Court would have reached a different verdict in Tornillo if the ideological positions of Tornillo and the Miami Herald had been reversed.\n\nJustice Kennedy may have meant it when he wrote , \"The civic discourse belongs to the people, and the Government may not prescribe the means used to conduct it.\" But few others in the conservative movement agreed. What they understood was that you have a right to free speech as long as you are saying what they want you to say."

      "text": "Why Conservatives Find Life More Meaningful Than Liberals\n\nIt has nothing to do with Trump.\n\nPolarization has become so severe that what news you read, who you marry , and what kind of car you drive is connected to your political persuasion. And so is, it turns out, whether you see the point in literally anything.\n\nIn a new study of people in 16 different countries, researchers from the University of Southern California and the University of Utah found that conservatives reported feeling there was more meaning and purpose in life than liberals did.\n\nThe authors performed a series of five studies, all of which replicated each others' findings. Conservatives found life more meaningful in data sets from several countries in the early 1980s, in a nationally representative data set of Americans in 2007, and in data collected between 2010 and 2017. In other data sets, conservatives found greater meaning in life when the measures were taken at the end of every day for two weeks. They were also more likely to feel that their lives had \"a clear sense of purpose\" at any given moment.\n\nIn another analysis, the authors found social, rather than economic, conservatives were especially likely to find meaning in life. This was true even when controlling for their \"religiosity,\" which means it wasn't just that conservatives had a more ardent belief in God.\n\nMuch of this data was collected before 2016, and outside of the United States. In other words, says Norbert Schwarz, one of the study authors and a psychology professor at the University of Southern California, \"this is definitely not a Trump effect. But if you did it right now, liberals might find life even less meaningful than before.\"\n\nThe differences, granted, were pretty small. Being a conservative, the paper found, only influences the level of meaning you find in your life a small amount-roughly the same as income and physical health influence your sense of meaning. Think of it this way: switching from being a moderate liberal to being a moderate conservative is similar to making $90,000 rather than $60,000, in terms of how much meaning it adds to your life, says David B. Newman, one of the study's other authors.\n\nThis small effect size means that most people won't be able to predict a person's sense of meaning in life just from knowing that person's political orientation, said Robert Mather, a professor of psychology at the University of Central Oklahoma who has described himself as conservative . But, \"from the perspective of a social-psychology researcher, it is a real effect that should be further studied.\"\n\nThis finding might strike some people as intuitive: \"Meaning,\" similar to \"family\" and \"values,\" seems like kind of a conservative word. Many conservatives, especially social conservatives, see the promise of human life in the smallest bundle of cells. At the height of the culture wars over gay marriage, they believed marriage had sanctity, and they wanted to preserve it.\n\nPast studies have also shown that conservatives tend to be happier than liberals. Republicans are happier in their marriages . Similarly, this current study also found that economic , but not social, conservatives were more satisfied with their lives.\n\nConservatives also tend to do the kinds of things that lead to happiness, like getting married and having children and, yes, going to church. Even though this study accounted for religiosity, social connections like the kind we make at houses of worship make us feel happy .\n\nBut here, we're talking about more than happiness. We're talking about the kind of mind-blowing, double-rainbow-seeing, oneness with the universe that some past studies have found is actually more important than regular old cheeriness. Why might conservatives feel more of this?\n\nAny discussion of \"conservatives\" and \"liberals\" is going to reduce both down to caricatures, so let's just state, for the record, that not all conservatives write \"Christ follower\" in their Twitter bios and not all liberals hate God and love composting. Social conservatives, Schwarz says, tend to think the world is the way it ought to be. They're more resistant to cultural change, such as the transgender-rights movement . Liberals, meanwhile, are often evaluating why things just don't seem right, why the lives of some people aren't as good as those of others. \"Once you start questioning things, a lot of stuff is up for consideration,\" Schwarz says. The world tends to be less meaningful to people who think tradition is unimportant and everything can-and possibly should-change on a dime.\n\n\"If you're a person who has a clear sense of where they belong in society, and you're a person who essentially looks to the past to established ways of living, it seems like a very short step to perceiving life as more ordered and meaningful,\" said Colin Holbrook, a professor of cognitive sciences at the University of California at Merced.\n\nOthers agreed that this, shall we call it, \" the way things ought to be \" hypothesis has some merit.\n\n\"Conservatives are more likely to have the sense that there's an order in their life, and a commitment to order gives people a sense of meaning as well,\" said W. Bradford Wilcox, a sociologist and the director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia. \"To flip it, conservatives might be missing some nuances. For liberals, the capacity to see the gray in life might be valuable in some sense, but also not give them as clear a sense of meaning.\"\n\nConservatives also tend to be more \"self-enhancing\" than liberals are, says Peter Ditto, a psychologist at the University of California at Irvine. They tend to talk up how great their lives are and downplay their struggles. But it's liberals who actually act happier, even if they say they aren't, Ditto says. He found in a study that people affiliated with Democratic causes are more likely to show a genuine \"Duchenne\" smile-a \"smile with your eyes,\" as Tyra would say -and to use positive words in their speech.\n\nThen again, Ditto speculated, \"the bar for meaning-in-life might just be lower for conservatives.\" Ouch.\n\nAnd that's the central problem in studies like these: People start to see them through the lens of their own political views. Any finding can be twisted to make your team seem smarter, better, and more moral, and the other like a bunch of ignorant ghouls. Even the scales that are used to measure traits like authoritarianism or happiness or meaning in life can be colored by the researcher's own political persuasion. \"Political psychology often devolves into something that looks a lot like politics: Which one is better?\" Ditto says.\n\nBut the labels \"liberal\" and \"conservative\" don't actually mean that much right at this current moment. These days, Democrats are rooting for George W. Bush appointee Robert Mueller, and the nation's most prominent conservative is questioning the justice system. \"All these measures are from before everything went upside down and sideways,\" Holbrook says. Holbrook pointed out that even asking someone if they're socially conservative is a somewhat inaccurate measure. It would have been better, he thinks, to ask the participants if they're, say, opposed to abortion.\n\nIf anything, this study seems like a reminder that the traits either party is stereotyped as representing-openness and analysis paralysis, in the case of liberals; sentimental traditionalism, in the case of conservatives-aren't necessarily good things in every context. \"Maybe [liberals] shouldn't be so open to changing things, because a more vigilant attitude might be the better one,\" Holbrook posited. He pointed out that Winston Churchill was by some measures quite conservative; his nationalism, for example, was evident in how he zealously promoted the British empire at the expense of its former colonies. But you have to hand it to him-he knew how to spot a Nazi , long before many others did."

      "text": "America's Most Destructive Habit\n\nEach time political minorities advocate for and achieve greater equality, conservatives rebel, trying to force a reinstatement of the status quo.\n\nAlthough the United States was born of a revolution, one common view maintains that the Constitution tamed our rebellious impulse and launched a distinctly nonrevolutionary political experiment. But throughout American history, an important strand of conservatism has repeatedly championed rebellions-or what are better understood as counterrevolutions.\n\nThey emerge like clockwork: Each time political minorities advocate for and achieve greater equality, conservatives rebel, trying to force a reinstatement of the status quo.\n\nThe term counterrevolution is significant not only because conservatives have regularly employed it, but also because it highlights their own agency, something they often seek to conceal. In order to portray their actions as defensive rather than aggressive, conservatives tend to depict themselves as acted upon and besieged. As William F. Buckley wrote in the National Review 's mission statement in 1955, conservatism \"stands athwart history, yelling Stop.\" Here the agent is history; conservatives are merely making a reply. But such rhetorical gestures discount what any close look at these movements makes clear: Conservatives have done much more than yell. They have fought against equality vigorously, often violently.\n\nDavid Frum: The conservative cult of victimhood\n\nThree historical moments-the revolt against post-Civil War Reconstruction, the mid-century fight against civil rights, and the modern Tea Party and Trump movements-stand out as perfect examples of the counterrevolutionary dynamic. They share certain broad themes: a hostility to racial equality, the invocation of apocalyptic rhetoric-that America is \"under siege,\" as President Donald Trump told the crowd on January 6 prior to the Capitol insurrection-and a deep distrust of democracy.\n\nDuring Reconstruction, conservatives denounced its proponents as dangerous revolutionaries, often comparing them to notorious figures from the French Revolution. \"We do not know of two men who have come up prominently before the world in revolutionary times more alike than Marat and Thaddeus Stevens,\" The New York Herald said in 1866. One Nashville newspaper contended in 1868 that the Radical Republicans in Congress \"aim to abolish the constitution, to destroy public liberty, and to concentrate the power of the country in the hands of usurpers ... embodying the very essence of despotism ... that shocked the world and subjected France to the 'reign of terror' under Jacobin rule.\"\n\nThe \"reign of terror\" that the Nashville newspaper decried was in fact the emergence of multiracial democracy. Many conservatives were entirely frank about this, such as the one featured in Mississippi's The Meriden Daily Republican who wrote , \"The two races cannot and will not rule jointly and coequally ... One or the other must become subordinate. This is the history of all such experiments everywhere.\"\n\nOutlawing racial discrimination, in this view, was grounds for regime change, even violence. Take, for example, an editorial statement of Missouri's aptly named The Lexington Weekly Caucasian from 1872. It began with two demands, \"State Sovereignty! White Supremacy!\" and threatened \"ANOTHER REBELLION\" if they were not acceded to. \"Revolution must be met by CounterRevolution-Force by Force-Violence by Violence-and Usurpation should be Overthrown, if needs be, by the Bayonet!\" Calling white supremacy a counterrevolution could justify nearly anything, bloodshed included.\n\nThe counterrevolutionary politics of this era proved to be extremely effective, as much of the racial progress achieved during Reconstruction was wiped out or even reversed in subsequent decades. By the mid-20th century, the conservative backlash had reinforced white supremacy through Jim Crow laws and intense voter suppression. W. E. B. Du Bois famously called this the \" counter-revolution of property .\" Black citizens in Indianola, Mississippi, for example, constituted a majority of the local county's population but only 0.03 percent of its registered voters. Du Bois reflected on this state of affairs, writing, \"The slave went free; stood a brief moment in the sun; then moved back again toward slavery.\"\n\nWhen the civil-rights movement mobilized against this oppression and inequality, conservatives began to fear that what some were calling the \"Second Reconstruction\" might be as dangerous for them as the first. Barry Goldwater, in many ways the prototypical modern conservative, was among them. In a letter he wrote while running for president in 1963, Goldwater called the civil-rights movement a \"revolution\" and said that he was \"very apprehensive about how far it will go.\"\n\nSo conservatives responded with yet another counterrevolution, one intended to maintain carefully constructed racial, economic, and social hierarchies. As the Black historian Lerone Bennett Jr. wrote in Ebony magazine in 1966, the \"counter-revolutionary campaign of terror\" against Reconstruction was merely \"the first white backlash\"; the United States was living through the second.\n\nThe guiding principles of this backlash had been laid out 10 years earlier in the Southern Manifesto of 1956 . Signed by more than 100 congressmen, the manifesto responded to the Brown v. Board decision mandating school desegregation by issuing a bold defense of the Jim Crow status quo and pledging to fight the \"revolutionary changes in our public school systems.\" As schools became battlegrounds, conservatives, especially those in the South, dug in their heels.\n\nFrom the October 2020 issue: The new Reconstruction\n\nFor many right-wingers, the historical memory of Reconstruction-era radicalism combined with Cold War anxieties. To them, civil-rights activism was the work not only of revolutionaries but of communists. As the Oklahoma minister Billy James Hargis warned in one newspaper column, \"The communists have been urging their followers to bring pressure upon the federal government, to force Reconstruction days upon the Southern states again.\" In a 1965 essay titled \"Two Revolutions at Once,\" Robert Welch, the leader of the far-right John Birch Society, derided the push for civil rights as a \"Negro Revolutionary Movement\" driven by communist saboteurs rather than oppressed Black citizens.\n\nAs was the case during Reconstruction, this counterrevolutionary rhetoric enabled violence-violence against leaders like Martin Luther King Jr., violence against activists like the Freedom Riders, violence on college campuses, violence at the hands of the Ku Klux Klan, violence at the hands of the police. But conservatives frequently accused activists of inciting it. Following the Selma march, a piece in American Opinion , the Birch Society's flagship magazine, claimed, \"The violence in Selma doesn't have to do with voting rights at all ... it has to do with Communist Revolution, with Communists intentionally setting the stage for race war.\" A menacing enemy within justified a violent illiberalism.\n\nAs politicians debated the proposed Civil Rights Act, the fury of white southerners increased. \"If dictatorial planners insist upon ignoring and trampling majority rights in efforts to favor minority groups, they may in time provoke a White Revolution,\" Tom Ethridge wrote in The Clarion-Ledger in Jackson, Mississippi. This so-called white revolution was, in fact, a counterrevolution designed to shore up the racial caste system.\n\nWhen that caste system showed signs of decay some four decades later, a similar backlash came about. Shortly after the election of America's first Black president, the Tea Party exploded into the public consciousness. Its members adopted the iconography and language of the American Revolution, styling themselves \"patriots\" and attending rallies clad in knee breeches and tricornered hats. Despite this getup, the Tea Party was not a revolution but a counterrevolution-a defense of privilege and hierarchy rather than a call for egalitarianism.\n\nRacial resentment played a crucial role in Tea Party ideology. \"Birther\" conspiracies flourished within the movement, whose adherents viewed President Barack Obama more as a fifth-column threat than a legitimate political opponent. Tea Partiers claimed that some people were getting too many handouts or weren't working hard enough to earn their keep; typically those people were \"illegal immigrants\" or other minority groups that were referred to using coded language. As recounted by Theda Skocpol and Vanessa Williamson in The Tea Party and the Remaking of Republican Conservatism , one Virginia Tea Partier asserted that a \"plantation mentality\" prevented \"some people\" from getting off the dole, a racist argument that reflected the counterrevolution's Reconstruction-era origins. The solution, according to the movement, was to dramatically reduce the government-at least the parts of it that benefited the wrong people. This had the added advantage of divesting power from leaders who couldn't be trusted. As one Tea Partier put it to Skocpol and Williamson, \"The people I was looking for back when I was a cop are now running the government.\"\n\nDespite the fact that the Tea Party received heavy funding from right-wing plutocrats, the movement had a populist panache. The counterrevolution had gone mainstream, and all of the aggrievement, mistrust, and racial resentments that had festered within conservatism for generations laid the foundation for the rise of Donald Trump.\n\nAlthough Trump is often described as \"unprecedented\" or \"norm-breaking,\" his rhetoric has deep roots in the conservative movement's counterrevolutionary tradition. He warned us that America was beset by enemies, an often-racialized group of \"others\" who were amassing power too quickly and using it to threaten the American way of life. Obama was a Kenyan-born Muslim imposing radical views on the United States. Immigrants were \"invading\" and taking our jobs. The media were the \"enemy of the people,\" and Democrats were \"treasonous\" and \"un-American.\" Washington, the home of illegitimate majorities, was a swamp that needed draining.\n\nBeyond adopting the rhetoric of counterrevolution, Trump also embraced its most dangerous element: a call for political violence. On January 6, he stood before thousands of supporters and proclaimed, \"We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.\" Just a few beats later, Trump declared, \"We're going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue ... And we're going to the Capitol, and we're going to try and give-.\" He stopped short of issuing a direct instruction, but his assembled supporters understood the assignment, storming the U.S. Capitol in an effort to overturn the election. That the Capitol siege failed-as did subsequent efforts to overturn the election through courts and audits-does not diminish the dangers presented by the counterrevolutionary impulse in today's conservatism.\n\nAdam Serwer: The Capitol riot was an attack on multiracial democracy\n\nIt was not long before the GOP followed Trump's lead. Dan Patrick, the lieutenant governor of Texas, promoted the white supremacist \"great replacement\" theory on Laura Ingraham's show. \"The revolution has begun,\" Patrick said, arguing that, by allowing more migrants into the U.S., the Democrats were \"trying to take over our country without firing a shot.\" And now, at Trump's behest, the state of Texas is auditing the 2020 votes in the state's four largest counties, all of which are Democratic strongholds. The audit ploy may have failed in Arizona, but the counterrevolution continues.\n\n\"If conservatives become convinced that they cannot win democratically, they will not abandon conservatism,\" David Frum, a Never Trump conservative, wrote in The Atlantic . \"They will reject democracy.\" But Frum's warning about the \"dead end\" of Trumpism ignored the illiberalism and minoritarian inclinations baked into the conservative pie. The reality is that the counterrevolutionary mindset is a feature, not a glitch, of modern conservatism, one that offers authoritarian solutions to democracy's right-wing discontents."

      "text": "What Americans Mean When They Say They're Conservative\n\nThe word is invoked to refer to a number of surprisingly diverse worldviews-and politicians take advantage of that.\n\nThe word is invoked to refer to a number of surprisingly diverse worldviews - and politicians take advantage of that.\n\nRoughly two-fifths of Americans call themselves \"conservative.\" What do they mean by the word? It depends. And during a Republican primary, that can be problematic. Every candidate is vying to be the standard-bearer for conservatism, and exploiting the fact that its meaning is variable.\n\nThus the need for this exercise.\n\nWhat follows is an attempt to tease out the many different worldviews Americans are referring to when they invoke the word conservative -and then to figure out which of these worldviews best describe Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, and Ron Paul, the choices before Republicans. Bear in mind that what follows aren't my definitions of conservatism, but what various Americans mean when they use the word.\n\nGranting that any list of this kind is imperfect, I contend the foregoing is sufficient for our purposes. So where do the presidential candidates I've mentioned fall?\n\nAs best I can tell, Mitt Romney definitely shares the attitudes in 2, 3, 5, 6, 16, and 17. There is controversy about whether he in fact believes in 4 or 13. And he may well believe in 15, but if so it isn't a defining part of his worldview.\n\nNewt Gingrich definitely subscribes to 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, and 13. He inconsistently invokes 15 and 16, taking actions contrary to them on many occasions.\n\nRick Santorum is a believer in 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 17, and 19. He claims to believe in 16 but has been inconsistent.\n\nRon Paul subscribes to 2, 5, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 21.\n\nUnwieldy as this approach to grappling with the candidates is, it complicates the conversation about who is \"most conservative\" in a way that increases rather than detracts from clarity. And for that reason, I hope this is the beginning of a conversation, for I'm sure my imperfect product can be improved upon, especially by folks who actually self-identify as conservatives. Are there any significant strains I've missed? Are distinct ways of thinking conflated in a single item? Are the beliefs of the candidates accurately summed up? Is there a more concise way to lay all this out? I'll be checking comments, reading email, and surveying the blogosphere to see how this might be improved. Flickr user Betancourt"

      "text": "We Need to Stop Calling Far-Right Extremists 'Conservatives'\n\nSenior Columnist\n\nWant proof a stopped clock is right twice a day? On Thursday, the right-wing outlet The Federalist published what could only be described as a manifesto aimed at fellow travelers, arguing that \" We Need to Stop Calling Ourselves Conservatives .\"\n\nAs a conservative, I believe the author, John Daniel Davidson, got it 100 percent correct: It is time for right-wing nationalists to stop besmirching our good name!\n\nThose of us who remain consistent conservatives are no longer in sync with right-wingers or GOP faithful- because they changed . By insisting on calling this new MAGA movement \"conservative,\" we (the media, the activists, the politicians) are rendering words useless. To be sure, political movements-like the English language, itself-evolve over time. But calling Trumpist radicals \"conservative\" is tantamount to saying the word \"literally\" means \"figuratively.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDavidson deserves credit for calling bullshit on that bait-and-switch game, and he is keen on the change, primarily (he says) because \"the conservative project has largely failed.\"\n\nAgain, in a sense, he is correct. No conservative nation would elect a vulgarian like Donald Trump. Obviously, something went terribly wrong. Case closed.\n\nStill, I can't help but think that this apocalyptic surrender is dramatically overwrought. Thanks largely to conservatives , America won the Cold War against the Soviets. What is more, after a 50-year struggle, conservative pro-life activists and the conservative legal establishment overturned Roe v. Wade (admittedly with Donald Trump's help ). It's also worth asking: What would America have looked like if conservatives hadn't been there to push back on radical ideas? A lot worse, I suspect.\n\nAmerica is the greatest country in the world, and we are living during a time of relative peace and prosperity. From a personal standpoint, I go to whatever church I want, vote (or not) for whomever I want, publicly criticize the president , send my kids to whatever school I am willing to pay for (thanks school choice), and am essentially left alone. Heck, I can even own a gun if I want. What's not to love?\n\nSure, there are problems. But how many of our perceived problems are merely the result of seeing crazy stuff on Twitter? True, it has always been the case that some weird shit is happening out there somewhere , but I have created a life that largely filters that out (and you can, too). It's the American dream!\n\nComplaining about modern America feels slightly privileged-kind of like a Yankees fan lamenting that it's been over a decade since their last World Series win. I mean, come on.\n\nTo the degree that anything has changed, Davidson (I think correctly) concedes that \"technological change so swift and powerful it fundamentally reordered society, swept tradition aside, and unleashed a moral relativism that rendered the conservative project obsolete.\"\n\nIf you long for some Middle Ages utopia (just don't die of the plague), then technology is a major source of dislocation. There's a reason Russell Kirk called the automobile the \" mechanical Jacobin .\" But change is inevitable, and civilization needs conservatives (here I am specifically referring to people who want to conserve traditional culture) to help manage this change.\n\nBut change happens. The automobile changed us. The birth control pill changed us. God knows Twitter changed us. Smart governments must find ways to adapt to technology, just as wise families and individuals must find ways to simultaneously use innovations and mitigate their downsides. This is a constant struggle, but it beats the alternative.\n\nIs it fair though to blame conservatives for losing the culture if technology is the main driver of change? First, technology often cuts both ways. The same gun that can be used to kill can also be used to protect. Some technologies (such as ultrasound photos ) have had a conservative, or at least, a pro-life impact. Nobody calls it a \"fetus\" when they post a picture of their unborn baby on Facebook or Instagram (or the fridge).\n\nSecond, the idea that we can completely resist technology, as the Luddites tried to do, seems silly and impossible. What if we succeed in tamping down on innovation, only to see China own the future (and possibly us)? Perhaps they want that kind of conservative future.\n\nNow, you might ask, what does this revolution entail? According to Davidson, \"if conservatives want to save the country they are going to have to rebuild and in a sense re-found [America], and that means getting used to the idea of wielding power, not despising it.\" He goes on to add that \"wielding government power will mean a dramatic expansion of the criminal code.\" Again, this sounds more like the Jacobins than Reagan (even if he did lead a political \"revolution\").\n\nWhat if the other side wins, and they get to impose their will on us?\n\nDavidson believes today's right-wingers should \"stop thinking of themselves as conservatives (much less as Republicans) and start thinking of themselves as radicals, restorationists, and counterrevolutionaries.\"\n\nAgain, I couldn't agree more.\n\nThe father of modern conservatism was arguably Edmund Burke, who famously opposed the French Revolution. Today's right-wingers have much more in common with Robespierre than they do with Burke. There is a long tradition of this sort of worldview, but, by definition, it is the exact opposite of conservative.\n\nDavidson is merely arguing for truth in advertising.\n\nSenior Columnist\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Ignoring Bad Faith Right-Wingers Doesn't Work Anymore. Debate or Debunk Them.\n\nFor years, Stephen Colbert dined out on the line \"reality has a well-known liberal bias,\" not just because it's a good turn of phrase, but also because it's true.\n\nReactionary elites know that their arguments can't hold up under scrutiny. It's why Fox News and Newsmax host far fewer left-wing commentators on their debate panels than places like CNN or ABC do with conservatives. But here's the thing about engaging with bad faith actors-they're way more scared of you than you should be of talking to them.\n\nI recently witnessed the right's fear of informed critics first-hand after I boosted a video uncovered by Media Matters researcher Olivia Little which showed supporters of the Christian supremacist group Moms for Liberty cheering the mention of Adolf Hitler during a recent conference. After millions of people had seen the clip, the group's co-founder Tiffany Justice, who had been featured in it, challenged me to a debate on my podcast, Theory of Change .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Have me on your show,\" she demanded in a Twitter response . \"Let's talk. Or are you scared that you can only manage women when you lie about us on social?\"\n\nI accepted and invited her to direct message me on Twitter to work out the details for a live video conversation, suspecting that she would ultimately try to back out. My low expectations were met as she rapidly tried to modify her own proposed debate format by bringing in reinforcements.\n\n\"Let's do a Twitter space,\" she replied after I proposed a time window. \"I'll bring two people, you bring two people. We can have a moderator.\"\n\nI refused, saying that I had no interest in using Twitter's very buggy Spaces feature, which infamously crashed repeatedly during Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' ill-fated presidential campaign launch with the site's owner, Elon Musk-and which continues to crash in heavily attended events. I also didn't want a group debate, where too many voices would drown out the argument on the table.\n\nCo-founder of Moms for Liberty Tiffany Justice speaks at the Moms for Liberty Summit in Philadelphia in 2023.\n\nAfter one more round of replies, she stopped responding. I was not shocked.\n\nI had seen this type of attitude so many times before. My earlier career was as a conservative political media consultant. I spent years trying to get Republicans to think seriously about public policy and be respectful of people who weren't straight white Christians. Finally, I realized it was a doomed effort because the current GOP is more interested in identity politics than in serving the public. I decided to critique Republicans from the outside rather than the inside. I took a major financial hit as a result, but I enjoy having a clean conscience.\n\nSince I left the world of conservative media in 2015, numerous reactionary activists and commentators have refused to debate me. Rather than respond to my pointed critiques of their lies and delusions, many prominent right-wingers like professional senator's daughter Meghan McCain or the recently indicted Rudy Giuliani have simply blocked me on Twitter.\n\nI'm far from the only left-leaning pundit who's witnessed reactionaries cowering away in fear rather than face a hard challenge. Evangelical commentator Steven Crowder demonstrated one of the most hilarious examples of this behavior. After avoiding a confrontation of ideas with progressive YouTuber Sam Seder, Crowder literally ran away from a 2021 livestream when Seder showed up unannounced.\n\nThe fear that Republican pundits have of serious challenge is palpable at Fox News, which court documents show went to extreme lengths to prevent tender viewers from being told the obvious truth that Joe Biden won the 2020 election fairly-and that there was no evidence of large-scale voter fraud.\n\n\"I can't keep defending these reporters who don't understand our viewers and how to handle stories,\" Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott wrote in a Nov. 19, 2016, message to a colleague telling him to rein in reporters who dared to tell the truth. \"The audience feels like we crapped on [them] and we have damaged their trust and belief in us.\"\n\nIt's been this way since the modern American right began emerging in the 1940s. The historical record couldn't be clearer that the reactionary movement that calls itself \"conservatism\" was proudly anti-intellectual. William F. Buckley began his career by railing against atheist professors and, as documented in the new book, Resistance from the Right: Conservatives and the Campus Wars )\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/uncpress.org/book/9781469674490/resistance-from-the-right/__;!!LsXw!XVH7aNGP4ybJkIoLNBcJVRa58hateXQx0rq5avBGtG5eh0r71pvTNNT8z7MdN5LVXGDZeFg5RgZnbs_IxemDz7iVD0iZMwNBzw$\">Resistance from the Right: Conservatives and the Campus Wars , he used his newly formed Young Americans for Freedom (YAF) organization to launch numerous attempts to censor students and professors who dared to disagree with his capitalist-inflected Christianity.\n\nUnable to prove their obsolete views about science, religion, and government in scholarly literature, reactionaries created a parallel universe of self-described \"think tanks\" which were more about applying ideological precepts to governance than they were about actually solving economic or social problems. Unsurprisingly, many of these organizations are still fixated on trying to prove creationism )\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.hoover.org/research/stephen-meyer-intelligent-design-and-return-god-hypothesis__;!!LsXw!XVH7aNGP4ybJkIoLNBcJVRa58hateXQx0rq5avBGtG5eh0r71pvTNNT8z7MdN5LVXGDZeFg5RgZnbs_IxemDz7iVD0i-YqdAWA$\">prove creationism or that America's founders were fundamentalist Christians )\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.rightwingwatch.org/post/david-barton-and-the-evolution-of-lies/__;!!LsXw!XVH7aNGP4ybJkIoLNBcJVRa58hateXQx0rq5avBGtG5eh0r71pvTNNT8z7MdN5LVXGDZeFg5RgZnbs_IxemDz7iVD0hlo_ogSg$\">fundamentalist Christians .\n\nWilliam Buckley and Gore Vidal debate in 1968.\n\nAs fragile and irrational as reactionary beliefs are, however, of late, more than a few people on the center-left have begun deciding that there's no need to rebut the torrent of lies and false beliefs. Some even insist that arguing with them at all is \"platforming\" them, and providing them with an audience they otherwise would not have.\n\nAfter years of witnessing unqualified right-wingers spew nonsense about the coronavirus, many science advocates are uninterested in arguing with idiots. Many transgender activists are also likewise disinclined to hold debates with self-proclaimed \" theocratic fascists .\"\n\nThese are fully reasonable viewpoints, especially since Christian supremacist activists raking in millions of dollars a year are not open to new ideas. But, nonetheless, the center-to-left cannot willingly cede the public discourse to propagandists pushing ideas that are dangerously asinine.\n\nIt makes sense not to waste time arguing with social media trolls or bad-faith preachers, but prominent purveyors of broken thinking need to be challenged in order to protect casual observers from their misinformed notions . That's because the lies that reactionaries tell do not exist in a vacuum and, unfortunately, many of them have far greater reach than many people on the center-to-left realize.\n\nDennis Prager speaks at Politicon at the Pasadena Convention Center on July 30, 2017 in Pasadena, California.\n\nThe Daily Wire, which regularly tells its audience that trans people and Democrats are demon-possessed and whose hosts routinely praise dictators , has a monthly audience of 26 million readers and is often one of the top U.S. Facebook publishers. The right-wing video propaganda factory PragerU has had over 1.7 billion views on YouTube. Joe Rogan, who insists he's a left-leaning independent but is increasingly known to parrot right-wing conspiracy theories, claimed 190 million downloads a month before he went exclusive to Spotify. Right-wing propagandist Tim Pool has 1.2 billion views on YouTube.\n\nI could do this all day, unfortunately.\n\nWithout question, the far-right media ecosystem has grown to such an enormous global size that it cannot be ignored by people who disagree. Obviously, it's not worth engaging with random anonymous trolls, but the biggest reactionary commentators must be challenged on the lies and hatred that they spread daily into the world.\n\nAs progressive media commentator Oliver Willis recently explained : \"Liberals simply can't ignore this information that is in the bloodstream of the right. We don't live in a three-to-four channel universe anymore where bad ideas need mainstream media oxygen to catch on like wildfire. Democrats are continually on their heels because they don't pay enough attention to right wing information networks, and closing ourselves off just makes things worse.\"\n\nIt's fine if you don't want to debate horrible people, but understand that simply letting them spew their toxic lies no longer works. None of the things these propagandists say hold up to scrutiny, and it's important that people on the center-left stop ceding the political discourse to them, especially in places like YouTube where millions of people tune in for news.\n\nDebunk or debate, whichever you prefer.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Conservatives Routed in Worst Election Result for 200 Years\n\nNews Director\n\nLONDON-The Conservatives, the world's winningest political party, were booted out of power in dramatic style on Thursday after 14 years of chaotic and divisive rule.\n\nThe Labour Party had secured a landslide victory, ending an era of Conservative rule over Britain that stretches back to 2010; the year that the iPad and Instagram were launched and Lady Gaga wore that meat dress to the MTV music awards.\n\nIn that time, the Conservatives have cycled through five leaders, each of them dragging the party lower and lower in the polls. It was Rishi Sunak who was finally defeated by a huge margin after running the worst election campaign in living memory. \"Devastating night for the Conservatives,\" said former leadership contender Andrea Leadsom.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nKeir Starmer arrives to vote on the morning of the election.\n\nSunak's campaign ended in similar style to the way it began: with extremely unfortunate optics. One of his local district rivals, independent candidate Niko Omilana, snuck up as he made a generous concession speech, holding up a large \"L\" sign behind his back.\n\nUnaware of the visual diss, Sunak nonetheless accepted personal responsibility for the historic defeat. \"The Labour Party has won this general election, and I have called Sir Keir Starmer to congratulate him on his victory,\" the prime minister said. \"The British people have delivered a sobering verdict tonight, there is much to learn and reflect on, and I take responsibility for the loss. To the many good, hard-working Conservative candidates who lost tonight-despite their tireless efforts, their local records of delivery and their dedication to their communities-I am sorry.\"\n\nThe campaign had got off to an equally awkward start when the prime minister shocked the country-first by announcing a snap general election-and second by doing so standing outside No. 10 in a torrential downpour which left his expensively tailored suit soaked through. His words were also drowned out by an old Labour election anthem being blasted into Downing Street by an enterprising protester.\n\nRishi Sunak got caught in a downpour without an umbrella or an overcoat.\n\nIncredibly, the campaign went downhill from there. Sunak blundered by leaving early from a D-Day memorial event in France where President Joe Biden and President Emmanuel Macron stood shoulder-to-shoulder to salute the final major anniversary likely to be attended by survivors of World War II. Voters were appalled despite Sunak's apologies and, subsequently, Nigel Farage was able to appeal to traditionalists and right-wing voters with his insurgent, MAGA-inspired Reform party. The exit poll suggested a major breakthrough for Farage's party that secured them at least four seats in parliament.\n\nThe exit poll also predicted that Labour would win a whopping 410 seats (eight shy of what Tony Blair won in 1997) and just 131 for the Conservatives, which is the lowest in the party's near 200-year history. Since it was founded in 1834, the Tories have become the most successful party in any competitive multi-party state in the world but this is the lowest ever vote share and number of seats.\n\nAs the recriminations began within the Conservative Party, veteran lawmaker Michael Fabricant said: \"Never in the history of general elections have so many been let down by so few.\" A few hours later, he lost his own seat, along with a record-breaking swathe of Cabinet members who were kicked out of office, some on huge swings to Labour or Reform. Penny Mordaunt, the Leader of the House of Commons, and one of the favorites to replace Sunak as party leader was among those ousted.\n\nThe shocks culminated in Liz Truss losing her own seat less than two years after she was prime minister. She had an enormous majority to defend in her district but the voters turned decisively against her after her disastrous 49 days in office.\n\nRishi Sunak cast his vote on Thursday morning hoping to avoid losing his own seat.\n\nBritain's new prime minister will be Sir Keir Starmer, the former head of the Crown Prosecution Service. Starmer has taken a cautious approach-labeled the \"Ming vase strategy\"-as he tried to carry his delicately assembled coalition of voters over the finishing line.\n\nAfter the party underperformed the polls in elections in 2017, 2010, and, famously, in 1992, when everyone expected them to return to power, Starmer became just the fourth Labour leader to take his party from opposition into power in the century since it was founded.\n\nStarmer spoke at a victory rally at 5 a.m. local time (midnight EDT). \"We can look forward,\" he said. \"Walk into the morning.

      "text": "Pro-Israel Conservatives Are Done With Tucker Carlson\n\nSenior Media Reporter\n\n\"Tucker Carlson, please come back soon.\"\n\nThat was the message Newsweek senior editor-at-large Josh Hammer delivered shortly after Carlson's shocking ouster from Fox News, speaking for much of the American conservative movement at the time.\n\n\"Hopefully, Carlson will retain something approximating his exceptional level of cultural and political influence in whatever role he next serves, because his witness to truth and civilizational sanity has never been more necessary,\" the conservative pundit added in his April 2023 column.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNearly a year later, Hammer's tone towards the former primetime cable-news star has noticeably shifted.\n\n\"Turns out Tucker needed Fox more than Fox needed Tucker. Very sad,\" he tweeted this week.\n\nSo, what changed? Long story short: Gaza.\n\nWhile the seeds of the pro-Israel right's split from Carlson were planted months ago , the situation came to a head earlier this week when the former Fox News star conducted a 40-minute online interview with Reverend Munther Isaac, a Palestinian Christian pastor from the West Bank. Throughout the cordial conversation, Carlson asked how the Israeli government had treated Christians since the launch of the war in Gaza, claiming that \"a consistent but almost never noted theme of American foreign policy is that it is always the Christians who suffer.\"\n\nEven before watching the interview, Carlson's decision to platform Isaac, a pastor at the Evangelical Lutheran Christmas Church in Bethlehem, was already a step too far for many conservative supporters of Israel. The day after Hamas' bloody Oct. 7 attack, the reverend seemed to celebrate the militant group's slaughter of Israeli music festival attendees.\n\n\"One of the scenes that left an impression on my mind yesterday-and there are many scenes-is the scene of the Israeli youth who were celebrating a concert in the open air [the Nova music festival] just outside the borders of Gaza, and how they escaped,\" Isaac said in his Oct. 8 sermon . \"What a great contradiction, between the besieged poor on the one hand, and the wealthy people celebrating as if there was nothing behind the wall. Gaza exposes the hypocrisy of the world.\"\n\nBut it wasn't just Carlson's guest of choice that infuriated many on the right-it was his own comments that were a bridge too far.\n\nWhile taking aim at evangelical leaders and \"self-professed Christian\" lawmakers, Carlson claimed the United States has been \"sending money to oppress Christians in the Middle East.\" He urged Republicans to cut off military aid to Israel. \"It would be pretty easy for Republicans in the U.S. Congress to say we support the government of Israel. But if you touch a single Christian, harm a single church, prevent any Christian from practicing his religion, you're done,\" he declared. \"Not a single dollar will come from the U.S. Congress for you.\"\n\nCarlson then concluded: \"If you wake up in the morning and decide that your Christian faith requires you to support a foreign government, blowing up churches and killing Christians. I think you've lost the thread.\"\n\nNeedless to say, especially since right-wing media and GOP officials have relentlessly bashed progressives over their increasingly pro-Palestinian stance, Carlson's screed went over like a lead balloon with a certain contingency of conservatives.\n\n\"Tucker is cultivating hatred of Israel and Jews based on lies and innuendos,\" Israeli-American conservative journalist Caroline Glick tweeted in response to the interview.\n\nIt also further exposed the deepening rift between traditional conservatives and the openly bigoted alt-right, threatening to tear apart an already uneasy alliance holding the right-wing coalition together.\n\nThe dam may have broken with the Isaac interview, but the leaks had been forming for months when it came to Carlson, once a unifying figure for much of the Trump-era right.\n\nWhile much of the newfound animosity relates to Israel, it also boils down to Carlson's role in a long-simmering feud between two of conservative media's most popular figures: far-right provocateur Candace Owens and Daily Wire co-founder Ben Shapiro .\n\nAs an Orthodox Jew who fervently backs the Israeli government, Shapiro quickly took issue with Carlson's stance on the war in Gaza. Just days after the Hamas attacks, Carlson hosted former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who largely mimics the ex-Fox host's isolationist foreign policy and attributed ongoing military support for Israel to \"financial and corrupting influences.\" Carlson, meanwhile, objected to selective moral outrage over the attacks while calling for more attention to American drug overdose deaths.\n\n\"When it comes to comparing the Holocaust-level evil we just saw in Kfar Aza with people overdosing on the streets of Philadelphia, I have some moral questions. I do,\" Shapiro reacted at the time , accusing Carlson of \"moral blindness\" and \"downplaying\" the Oct. 7 attacks.\n\nOwens, who at the time was still a Daily Wire host, also began to draw Shapiro's ire over her criticism of Israel, much of which crossed the line into overt antisemitism. After their beef exploded out into the open last November, Carlson brought her on to dish. While taking Owens' side in her increasingly fraught back-and-forth with the Daily Wire founder, Carlson also seemed to peddle the antisemitic \"dual loyalty\" trope about Shapiro. \"I'm an American. Our country is being invaded right now. Over 100,000 Americans die every year of fentanyl,\" he exclaimed . \"Those are real tragedies. I've never seen anything like the emotion from any commentator around those tragedies as I'm watching about a foreign tragedy.\"\n\nAnd late last month, with her rhetoric towards Jewish people reaching new lows, the Daily Wire finally kicked Owens to the curb . Her ouster from the ultra-successful right-wing media company, however, prompted explicitly racist and antisemitic edgelords and social-media trolls to rage about the firing by harassing Jewish conservatives with the phrase \"Christ Is King.\"\n\nAfter Daily Wire CEO Jeremy Boreing and others claimed that the use of the phrase was a coded antisemitic dog-whistle, much of \" conservative Twitter \" blew up at Boreing and his allies, prompting many influential figures to admit: \"We have a problem on the right.\"\n\n\"Tucker is cultivating hatred of Israel and Jews based on lies and innuendos,\" one conservative journalist has written.\n\nAmong the ringleaders of the backlash was Nick Fuentes , a white nationalist and Holocaust denier who leads the so-called Groyper movement. (The Groypers chanted this same phrase, \"Christ Is King,\" at the \"Million MAGA March.\") The notorious social-media bigot, who i nfamously had dinner with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago, has become an avowed fan of Owens as she became more explicitly antisemitic. \"Candace Owens has just been on a tear lately,\" he said last month. \"She has been in a full-fledged war against the Jews, and specifically some of these Zionist rabbis. And I've been watching her evolution. It's been remarkable to witness.\"\n\nFuentes, not so coincidentally, was elated over Carlson's interview with Isaac and his comments about Israel and Christians. In a recent broadcast of his online show, Fuentes said , \"I love it\" because \"just like Candace Owens, it is waking people up.\"\n\n\"I think it's much better than almost anything I've ever seen on his show since he left Fox News. I think it's great stuff,\" he added.\n\nWhile most Americans now disapprove of the Israeli military's actions in Gaza, as Palestinian casualties continue to mount, a large majority of Republicans still back the country's efforts. At the same time, that support is slowly eroding, dropping seven points since November, although a robust 64 percent of the GOP still remains firmly behind Israel.\n\nSo, does this mean the pro-Israel wing of the conservative movement is ready to turn its back on Carlson? It sure seems like it.\n\nThe vitriol towards the cable news host-turned-podcaster over his comments this week was fierce and direct .\n\n\"This is who Tucker is: a click-chaser,\" Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) declared on X . \"Tucker's MO is simple: defend America's enemies and attack America's allies. There isn't an objective bone left in that washed up news host's body. Mindless contrarianism is his guiding principle, buttressed by his childish tactic to 'juSt aSK quEsTiOns!'\"\n\nFox gave Tucker guardrails. Looks like he needed them, as well as access to decent researchers. So much of \"being at the top\" is hiring good support staff that don't make a fool out of you. A quick google search would have told Tucker's Fuentes-happy staff that Bethlehem is not,...\n\nCrenshaw's claim that Carlson would \"eventually fade into nothingness\" since his \"veneer of faux intellectualism is quickly falling apart\" was a common theme . Besides Hammer saying Carlson needed Fox more than they needed him, others said that the network \" gave Tucker guardrails \" because \"he needed them,\" citing his shoddy research for this latest interview.\n\nTrump's former ambassador to Israel David Friedman also pushed back on Carlson's claims, noting that Bethlehem has been under Palestinian rule for decades and is now \"80 percent Muslim and Christians are afraid.\" Columns for Tablet magazine and Jewish Insider , meanwhile, accused Carlson of \" whitewashing murderers to set fire to evangelical-Jewish relations \" by platforming \" the high priest of antisemitic Christianity .\"\n\n\"There's no one in American life who thinks less of Christians than Tucker. He doesn't like Jews, but he at least doesn't think we're stupid,\" Commentary senior editor Seth Mandel tweeted . \"Even Trump's Bible selling is transparently transactional. Tucker's entire shtick relies on his belief that Christians are gullible saps.\"\n\nEven one of Carlson's former colleagues called him out on live television. Leland Vittert, a former Fox News anchor who now hosts for NewsNation, likened Carlson to Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels, and accused him of overt antisemitism.\n\n\"Tucker's a smart guy,\" Vittert said on Wednesday . \"Yet, he's taking the side of terrorists. There's no other explanation than his unabashed hatred of Jews.\" (Vittert may also have some personal beef with his former colleague. In a 2020 text made public during Dominion's Fox News lawsuit, Carlson told his primetime cohorts: \"We devote our lives to building an audience and they let Chris Wallace and Leland fucking Vittert wreck it.\")\n\nIn the end, \"a lot of people still want access to Tucker's platform, so [they] are reluctant to burn bridges,\" conservative social-media personality known as AG Hamilton , an outspoken Carlson critic with more than 150,000 X followers, told The Daily Beast. However, he said, it does appear that Carlson's recent comments have opened the door for more conservatives to feel free to openly bash the once-unimpeachable right-wing commentator.\n\n\"I think the combo of the Russia stuff (subway etc), his attacks on Shapiro, the Israel interview has given people (outside of those like me who have always seen him as an inauthentic propagandist) permission to call him out. So to answer, I do think it will lead to some people distancing themselves. I don't think he will lose all or most of his audience, but that's with an already decreased baseline relative to his time on FNC,\" the pseudonymous writer added.\n\n\"But at the very least it will lead some pro-Israel conservatives to ask whether the other information he is presenting on other topics is accurate,\" he concluded. \"Which is a good step.\"\n\nSenior Media Reporter\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Conservatives Flying Freak Flags Embrace 'Being the Villain'\n\nSenior Columnist\n\nThe conservative movement is depraved and decadent . And no, I'm not saying this because of the impending anniversary of Jan. 6 , which does happen to feature the freakish \" QAnon Shaman .\"\n\nMy statement was actually prompted by a mass shooting in Denver last week . The shooter interacted with several alt-right \"manosphere\" authors on Twitter. One name that stood out to me was Jack Murphy , who used to go by the name John Goldman. He was briefly in the news a few years ago, after he was fired for writing some crazy misogynistic stuff like \" feminists need rape .\"\n\nMurphy believes he's been canceled, but he has spent the past year as a Lincoln Fellow at the Claremont Institute . Claremont used to be a highly respected conservative intellectual institution , but now it's Flight-93 all the time-and worse.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn addition to holding this once-prestigious fellowship, this trad Chad also runs a $99-a-month \"private\" men-only community \"the Liminal Order\" whose members supposedly teach each other how to be stronger, richer, and more masculine. It offers dubious advice like : \"The world always needs a villain and today, that villain is the white straight male who knows what he wants and is unafraid to get it. Be the villain. Embrace it.\"\n\nEmbrace it, he has! While he isn't responsible for the revenge killings that a fan of his committed, salacious revelations about Murphy's life resurfaced in the aftermath after those killings, including something he wrote in 2015 about sharing his \"hot young girlfriend \" with a \"stranger from Tinder.\" Just before Christmas, Sydney Watson asked Murphy about it on Blaze TV, and it did not go well. He cursed her and attempted to intimidate her for bringing up the incident.\n\nIt is interesting and ironic that the same types of macho \"alpha\" males who call other people \" cucks \" keep turning out to be literal cuckolds.\n\nMurphy also apparently took part in a low-budget porn film. According to conservative writer Rod Dreher , the film includes \"a sequence in which the super-masculine Murphy impales himself with a plastic phallus, while simultaneously pleasuring himself. This is not a rumor, alas; I stumbled across the image online, and can't unsee it.\"\n\nI also can't unread it.\n\nLook, I'm not here to be a prude, or even to play psychologist , but as recently as a decade ago the conservative movement was (with a few notable exceptions) decidedly square, wonky, and straitlaced to a fault (admittedly, with some weird stuff happening below the radar ).\n\nMy experience, coming of age in the 1980s and '90s, was that almost all of the eccentric weirdos and hippies were on the left. They were the ones railing about the establishment. They were the anti-vaxxers. They were, shall we say, more publicly profane and libertine . This was almost by default, since they sure as heck weren't going to join the right's Christian Coalition-or the more stodgy country-club Republican establishment.\n\nDonald Trump essentially destroyed both wings, for better and for worse, by flooding the GOP's ranks with numerous erstwhile (and apolitical) Democrats. Call it the Roseanne Barr vote . Many of these folks felt aggrieved, left behind, and emasculated. I don't think it's entirely a coincidence that Murphy's book is titled Democrat to Deplorable . This may be the perfect title.\n\nIf conservative libertines were hypocrites before, now they're reveling in deplorable behavior. Murphy's mess is not the result of private footage or of texts being hacked or leaked for revenge. I'm writing about things that he published and filmed. Whether we're discussing Murphy, Jerry Falwell, Jr ., Matt Gaetz , or Marjorie Taylor Greene , we can be assured they are proudly letting their freak flags fly. This is decidedly not your father's Republican Party.\n\n\"All the institutions that gave us meaning and information fell. They have been infiltrated, corrupted, demoralized,\" Murphy rants while selling his $99-a-month \"Liminal Order\" as a \"network to replace those fallen institutions\" since \"without such a network, you are alone in enemy territory.\"\n\nA conservative railing against institutions-all of them!-makes as much sense as an \"alpha\" \"cuck\" but here we are.\n\nBecause conservatism now sees itself as under siege, there are few standards for joining the cause. Because it distrusts information and media reports, it is allergic to vetting. And because Trump has flouted moral conventions, anyone attempting to police the right or impose standards is seen as being un-Trumpy and, thus, unconservative.\n\nThis probably explains why all those august conservative leaders and institutions-you know, the folks who hold all those meetings, own all those buildings, and write all those self-important memos-aren't asking Claremont how this guy won their prestigious fellowship. For that matter, where is Claremont? Is this the kind of person they want representing them? Or did they make a mistake in failing to read (or watch) things he has said or done in the past? (I have reached out to their media team but have not gotten a response.)\n\nThis family values stuff may have been window dressing for many, but a lot of us still believe that traditional family values-even when we fail to fully live up to them-are best for individual human flourishing, as well as a strong nation. By elevating people who don't even aspire to these standards, conservative institutions are sending a message that these values really don't matter. This, of course, is a natural byproduct of having Trump (whom Murphy calls \"unabashedly masculine\") as the head of your movement.\n\nNow, I'm still a conservative because of important issues like the right to life, the size and scope of government, and the necessity of a strong national defense-particularly as China becomes more provocative. And I'm not going to let people who are not conservative force me to redefine my worldview. What is unfortunate is that the so-called \"leaders\" within the conservative movement's institutional infrastructure are allowing their brand to be co-opted. What is obvious is that they are more interested in attracting people like Murphy than keeping people like me.\n\n\"There are people who have been in this movement for decades, have proven their conservative cred, live conservative lives, and deserve large platforms-but never get them,\" writes Megan Fox (no, not THAT Megan Fox) at the conservative PJ Media.\n\n\"Instead, the 'conservative influencers' latch onto people like Murphy-fly-by-night scammers who end up embarrassing all of us. Why is that? Why is there no basic desire to check into someone's background? A simple Google search on Murphy's past articles would have found this. He wrote them in 2015! It wasn't hidden; no one cared to even look! And the end result is that conservatives end up looking like stupid fools.\"\n\nThe Republican party is full of red-pilled freaks, clowns, carnies, scoundrels, perverts, and weirdos. Conservatism has taken on an identity similar to the old Oakland Raiders . The only question that remains is whether Murphy gets cut-or ends up starting next week.\n\nSenior Columnist\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Vance Claims Difference Between Dems and Republicans Is 'No One Has Tried to Kill Kamala Harris'\n\nJD Vance has called for the heat to be taken out of American political debate after what appears to be a second assassination attempt against running mate Donald Trump .\n\nBut the Republican vice presidential candidate still appeared to blame Democrats for the threats to the former president's life, saying Monday that \"the big difference between conservatives and liberals is no one has tried to kill Kamala Harris .\"\n\nThat may be untrue: On Jan. 6 2021, Harris came within feet of a pipe bomb outside the Democratic National Committee offices in Washington D.C. and no perpetrator has been caught.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAppearing in public for the first time since the foiled assassination attempt on his running mate on Sunday, Vance asserted that Democrats need to \"cut this c--p out\" and \"tone down the rhetoric.\"\n\nHe later denied any responsibility for over 30 bomb threats made in Springfield, Ohio, after he and Trump repeatedly pushed false claims about Haitian migrants eating people's pets there.\n\nAuthorities arrested a suspected would-be assassin who fled Trump International Golf Course in Florida on Sunday. FBI officials said a Secret Service agent saw a rifle barrel sticking out of the chain link fence near where Trump was playing a round of golf, leading them to fire at the suspect-they found an AK-47, two backpacks, and a GoPro camera at the scene.\n\nThe Florida suspect, Ryan Routh, is not registered with either party, though he previously made small donations to Democrats after claiming to have voted for Trump in 2016. Thomas Crooks, the man who wounded Trump at a Pennsylvania rally in an assassination attempt earlier this summer, was a registered Republican and, according to FBI officials, may have also wanted to target President Joe Biden .\n\nVance, speaking in Atlanta to the Faith and Freedom Coalition, pledged to \"do my part to tone down the rhetoric\" before adding, \"to the people telling you Donald Trump needs to be 'eliminated,' you guys need to cut it out or you're going to get somebody hurt.\" He was referring to a November 2023 remark made by Rep. Dan Goldman (D-NY), who apologized a day later .\n\n\"We can disagree with one another, we can debate one another,\" said Vance. \"But we cannot tell the American people that one candidate is a fascist and if he's elected it's going to be the end of American democracy.\"\n\nTrump, meanwhile, called America under Biden a \" fascist state \" after he became a convicted felon in July.\n\nShortly after his address ended, Vance tweeted a message to supporters which-while repeating his call to \"tone down the rhetoric\"-proceeded to tell followers to \"reject censorship\" and attacked media organizations for correctly reporting that bomb threats were made to schools and government buildings following his repeated false claims that Haitian migrants in Ohio are abducting and eating pets, even as the state's Republican governor has said there's no evidence to support them.\n\nsean.craig@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Why I Co-Signed the Freedom Conservatism Manifesto\n\nSenior Columnist\n\nSeven years ago, a group of respectable conservatives wrote eloquent essays about why the rise in demagoguery, authoritarianism , nationalism, and hedonism on the right (in other words, Trumpism ) was not the way forward.\n\nI'm referring, of course, to National Review's (in)famous \" Against Trump \" edition (there's a reason why it was Ronald Reagan's favorite magazine). Along with an editorial castigating The Donald, the edition also featured a symposium of more than 20 elite conservatives criticizing Donald Trump . A look back at what they had to say is both stunning and (let's be honest) laughable.\n\n\"If Donald Trump wins the Republican nomination, there will once again be no opposition to an ever-expanding government,\" warned Glenn Beck. \"Conservatives should reject Trump's hollow, Euro-style identity politics,\" declared Ben Domenech, then-publisher of The Federalist.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Trump has made a living out of preying on and bullying society's most vulnerable, with the help of government,\" declared Townhall.com's Katie Pavlich.\n\nAnd-conceding that Trump was currently winning-Dana Loesch, who then worked at The Blaze, asked: \"Popularity over principle-is this the new Right?\"\n\nYes, Dana. It is . Although Trumpism isn't always all that popular outside of the GOP.\n\nYou have probably already guessed that many of those prominent conservative writers subsequently either did a complete 180 on Trump or became so anti-anti-Trump that it was a distinction without a difference.\n\nFast forward to this week, when I was honored to join a group of 82 other Freedom Conservatives who signed a statement of principles . This statement is consistent with what most of those pre-Trump conservatives at least claimed to believe. (Note: Several current and former National Review employees also signed the Freedom Conservatism statement.)\n\nI can't go into every principle in detail, but they include some things you might expect-such as the assertion that \"Liberty is indivisible, and political freedom cannot long exist without economic freedom,\" and that \"The free enterprise system is the foundation of prosperity.\"\n\nBut these principles also take nuanced positions on topics like immigration. For example, we believe that \"Immigration is a principal driver of American prosperity and achievement,\" but we also recognize that a \"sovereign nation, has the right to secure its borders and design a rational immigration policy-built on the rule of law-that advances the interests and values of American citizens.\"\n\nAnd the statement declares that \"We adamantly oppose racial discrimination in all its forms, either against or for any person or group of people.\"\n\nMy interpretation of this sentence (and my opinion is my own) is that we oppose discrimination against minority groups, and we likewise oppose using racial preferences for things like college admissions .\n\nThis is to say that we are neither right-wing nationalists or left-wing progressives. We are conservatives , at least in the sense that this term was understood in 2016.\n\nThe difference is that we signed our names to this statement after knowing how things would shake out on the right, after realizing that Donald Trump would come to define and dominate the party and (largely) the movement, and after realizing that breaking from the right would have consequences that would affect our lives and careers.\n\nMost prominent conservatives eventually saw the writing on the wall and got with the MAGA program. Others drifted leftward.\n\nThe remaining number of Freedom Conservatives has definitely dwindled.\n\nWhy bother doing any of this? I mean, it's obvious that Donald Trump is poised to win the Republican nomination . And even if he doesn't, Ron DeSantis has made it clear that (and I'm being charitable here) he doesn't embrace the full scope of our group's ideas and values.\n\nI don't speak for any of the other signatories, but I don't harbor any delusions that signing some statement of principles will change the world-certainly not today.\n\nTo borrow a page from the name of Jonah Goldberg's podcast (Jonah is among the Freedom Conservatives' signatories), let's call this group the remnant . This is a biblical term , which can be defined as \"What is left of a community after it undergoes a catastrophe.\" (In this instance, Trump's election qualifies as a catastrophe.)\n\nThe Freedom Conservatives who signed this statement are something of a remnant. And the mere existence of this document proves that all hope is not lost. So long as a remnant endures, its ideas and values have a chance at a comeback.\n\nTo the small group of Freedom Conservatives who still care about conserving liberal democracy: we now know who we can trust and who's a true believer.\n\nI hope we will still be around when our country needs us.\n\nSenior Columnist\n\nGot a tip?

The justices are reviewing a decision by Colorado's high court that found Section 3 of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution makes Trump ineligible to run for office because he engaged in an insurrection on January 6, 2021. The Nation 's justice correspondent Elie Mystal responds to the first day of proceedings, saying he was disappointed to hear both liberal and conservative justices casting doubt on the Constitution's application in this case to avoid the political ramifications of keeping Trump from office. \"They decided to lock hands and ignore that because it would be too messy for the country to apply the law to Donald Trump,\" says Mystal, who also explains Trump's far-fetched plan to claim immunity from prosecution until after the presidential election, the scandal surrounding Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis during Trump's prosecution in Georgia, and writer E. Jean Carroll's successful defamation suit against the former president.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Nermeen Shaikh, joined by Amy Goodman.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a historic case Thursday to determine if Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump is eligible to stay on the ballot for the 2024 election. The justices are reviewing a decision by Colorado's high court that found Section 3 of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution makes Trump ineligible to run for office because he engaged in an insurrection on January 6, 2021. A ruling would come within weeks.\n\nBefore a packed courtroom, both liberal and conservative judges expressed skepticism over Colorado's case. This is liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor [ sic ].\n\nJUSTICE ELENA KAGAN : I think that the question that you have to confront is why a single state should decide who gets to be president of the United States. In other words, you know, this question of whether a former president is disqualified, for insurrection, to be president again is - you know, just say it - it sounds awfully national to me. So whatever means there are to enforce it would suggest that they have to be federal, national means.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Meanwhile, liberal justice Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson appeared to agree with Trump's lawyer Jonathan Mitchell's argument that the 14th Amendment's disqualification provision does not apply to all insurrectionists, but only to people who swore to support the Constitution as an \"officer of the United States,\" which does not include the president.\n\nJUSTICE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON : The first argument is we have a list of offices -\n\nJONATHAN MITCHELL : Yes.\n\nJUSTICE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON : - that a person is barred from holding, right?\n\nJONATHAN MITCHELL : Yes.\n\nJUSTICE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON : Under your theory or under the language of - and we see it begins with senator, representative, elector of -\n\nJONATHAN MITCHELL : Elector.\n\nJUSTICE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON : - president and vice president, and all other civil or military officers - offices -\n\nJONATHAN MITCHELL : Offices under the United States.\n\nJUSTICE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON : Offices under the United States.\n\nJONATHAN MITCHELL : How it's phrased.\n\nJUSTICE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON : But the word \"president\" or \"vice president\" does not appear specifically -\n\nJONATHAN MITCHELL : That's right.\n\nJUSTICE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON : - in that list. So, I guess I'm trying to understand: Are you giving up that argument?\n\nJONATHAN MITCHELL : No.\n\nJUSTICE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON : And if so, why?\n\nJONATHAN MITCHELL : No, we're not giving it up at all. You're right: The president and the vice president are not specifically listed. But the Anderson litigants claim that they are encompassed within the meaning of the phrase \"office under the United States.\" And that's -\n\nJUSTICE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON : And do you agree that the framers would have put such a high and significant and important office, sort of smuggled it in through that catchall phrase?\n\nJONATHAN MITCHELL : No, we don't agree at all. That's why we're still making the argument.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : That's Trump's lawyer, Jonathan Mitchell, questioned Thursday by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. And this is conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh challenging Colorado's attorney, Jason Murray.\n\nJUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH : Last question: In trying to figure out what Section 3 means, and kind of to the extent it's elusive language or vague language, what about the idea that we should think about democracy, think about the right of the people to elect candidates of their choice, of letting the people decide? Because your position has the effect of disenfranchising voters to a significant degree.\n\nJASON MURRAY : This case illustrates the danger of refusing to apply Section 3 as written, because the reason we're here is that President Trump tried to disenfranchise 80 million Americans who voted against him, and the Constitution doesn't require that he be given another chance.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : For more on this and other cases Trump is facing, we're joined by Elie Mystal, The Nation 's justice correspondent. His new piece is headlined \"The Supreme Court Is Not Going to Save Us from Donald Trump.\" He's the author of Allow Me to Retort: A Black Guy's Guide to the Constitution .\n\nWelcome back to Democracy Now! , Elie. If you could just begin by responding to yesterday's oral arguments.\n\nELIE MYSTAL : Yeah, it was a disaster. Apparently, the Constitution does not matter, if it makes Republicans sad. The idea - and it's so important that you guys, I think, earlier highlighted the Bolsonaro story, right? Because look at what Brazil is doing when their former president threatened their government, right? They took my man's passport away, right? That's not what we do here, apparently. We don't defend ourselves, apparently.\n\nAnd yesterday's Supreme Court argument involved nine justices, three appointed by Republican presidents, but - sorry, six appointed by Republican presidents, but three appointed by Democratic presidents, kind of locking arms and deciding to ignore the Constitution, ignore the plain text of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which clearly states that insurrectionists cannot run for office. They decided to lock hands and ignore that because it would be too messy for the country to apply the law to Donald Trump. That's what happened yesterday. And it was very disappointing to listen to.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I mean, it's fascinating, Elie, when you look at who Jason Murray is - right? - the lawyer for Colorado that is trying to keep Trump from the ballot as an insurrectionist. He both clerked for Elena Kagan, a liberal justice, and for Neil Gorsuch - right? - the justice from Colorado.\n\nELIE MYSTAL : Mm-hmm, and both Gorsuch and Kagan lit him up yesterday. Kagan was extremely concerned - the first sound that you played wasn't Sotomayor; it was actually Kagan. And as you played, Kagan was extremely concerned with the ability of Colorado to, kind of on its own, exclude Trump from the ballot, and the knock-on effect that would have in all the different states.\n\nThe best way that I can explain the liberal position or why the liberals took the position that they did is that I would say Kagan, Jackson, Sotomayor, to some extent, they were more concerned with a red state, a Republican legislature or Republican governor kicking somebody like Joe Biden off the presidential ballot for bad-faith reasons, that they were willing to stop Colorado from kicking Trump off the ballot for good-faith reasons. And while I get that calculus as a realpolitik method, it is a problem when your legal decisions, when your legal rulings are based on what you think the bad-faith guys will do with it, right? Like, that's a problem if the law gets reduced to, like, \"Oh my god! What will Ron DeSantis do?\" Like, that's not a good way to run a country. But that is the way that we saw the liberals want to play it yesterday.\n\nAnd I think the other point, Amy, that's worth mentioning - you brought up who the lawyer for the Colorado side was. Let's not forget who the lawyer for the Trump side was, right? Let's not forget who Jonathan Mitchell is. He is the former Texas solicitor general who is most famous for inventing Texas's SB 8, the bounty hunter law that allows people to pursue abortion providers in Texas, that effectively overruled Roe v. Wade before the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade . That's the guy the Trump campaign dragged out to make their argument that he should stay on the ballot. And that's the guy that apparently all nine justices found a way to agree with yesterday.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, I also wanted to ask you about the line of questioning of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson and the whole issue of what it means to be an officer in the 14th Amendment. And also, talk about the history of this case, why Colorado invoked it, going back to the Civil War, what it means for an insurrectionist to run for office.\n\nELIE MYSTAL : Yeah, I mean, this is the double-edged sword of Justice Jackson, right? She is fantastic, you know, amazingly smart. And she is a textualist, right? She is an originalist - a liberal version of those words. But she is the person who kind of goes toe to toe with Neil Gorsuch whenever they want to talk about the original public meaning of this or that, right? She is the one who goes right into the Oxford English Dictionary to fight Gorsuch about the definition of what \"is\" is, right? That's who she is. And that's great, most of the time, right?\n\nBut yesterday, those same - that intellectual consistency led her to what I think is a quite tortured place, where she was parsing the word \"office\" versus \"offices,\" \"officer\" versus \"offices,\" to try to find some way to not include President Trump. And problem with that is that it's ridiculous, right? It is just ridiculous as a matter of common sense to think that the people who said that \"You can't be a senator if you raised a rebellion against the government, and you can't be a congressperson if you raised a rebellion against the government, but president, yeah, sure, that's fine. We don't have a problem with it.\" Like, that's a ridiculous argument. But that's how - that's what she talked herself into.\n\nAnd again, I think she talked herself into that, I think the liberals generally talked themselves into that, because they don't like the political reality of what the law says. They don't like the idea of kicking Trump off the ballot. They don't like what that means kind of as a precedential value around the country. And so they twisted themselves into a pretzel to pretend that the law says something that it doesn't.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, Elie, I want to ask you about the long-awaited ruling this week on Trump's claim to be immune from criminal prosecution, which you write about in your piece headlined \"The D.C. Circuit Just Shredded Trump's Immunity Claims.\" \"The court's decision should put to rest the question of whether a former president is immune to prosecution. The question is whether the Supreme Court will allow that,\" you wrote. So, lay out how this three-judge panel unanimously rejected Trump's argument, and what could happen next.\n\nELIE MYSTAL : Yeah, speaking of stupid arguments, the argument that the president of the United States, once he is no longer clothed in power, is free to commit any crime he would like, without fear of prosecution, the idea that if a president of the United States commits crimes while he is in office, he is somehow immune from ever being prosecuted for those crimes, even when he is out of office, that is ridiculous. Nobody reasonable believes that. And the D.C. Circuit panel, the three-judge panel, two judges appointed by Democrats, one by a Republican, unanimously ruled that Trump was wrong on every single level of his argument. It was a total - like, what I called it was a \"bench slap.\" They destroyed that argument, as well they should. It's a ridiculous argument.\n\nBut does that end the issue? No. Because, remember, folks, Trump is not trying to win with this ridiculous immunity argument. He is trying to delay with this ridiculous immunity argument. He was due to be put on trial by Judge Tanya Chutkan and prosecutor Jack Smith on March 4th. Then he started making this immunity argument. Well, then Judge Chutkan ruled that that immunity argument was wrong, because, again, it is obviously wrong. But now he got to appeal, right? So, that appeal took a month - right? - took a month for the D.C. Circuit to write it. We are now - we've moved - Chutkan has already moved back her March 4th trial date, right?\n\nSo, what happens next? Well, he's going to take the D.C. ruling and appeal it to the Supreme Court. Now, again, when he gets to the Supreme Court, if the Supreme Court takes it, he will lose again, because his argument is ridiculous. And I think even after what I heard yesterday, I do not think there are five justices up there who will say that the president is immune from - that a former president is immune from prosecution. That's just not true, right? So I don't think they're going to do it.\n\nBut the question is whether or not they grant the case at all and whether or not they allow him to continue to delay the start of his trial while he makes this ridiculous argument. The court doesn't have to take the case. And if the Supreme Court does want to take the case, it doesn't have to grant a stay. It doesn't have to stop Judge Tanya Chutkan from moving forward with her trial. But if there are four or five conservatives willing to allow Trump to delay, willing to allow him to essentially hack the legal process to try to keep himself out of jail long enough to run for president again, then Trump will potentially be able to delay his trial into the summer, through the conventions, maybe even past the next election - which is his whole game, because the idea that he's actually going to win on this particular argument is never in the cards for him, and he knows it, and anybody rational knows it, as well.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, this week, Donald Trump renewed his request for the judge in his Georgia election interference case to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and dismiss the indictment, saying her, quote, \"egregious misconduct demands\" it. Willis has acknowledged she had a romantic relationship with the prosecutor she hired on the case, Nathan Wade. You have a piece for The Nation headlined \"The Fani Willis Scandal Is Bad - But It Doesn't Change Her Case Against Trump.\" Explain what you mean, Elie.\n\nELIE MYSTAL : Yeah, I don't think Fani Willis should have done what she did, what she allegedly did, what she has admitted to even in some ways. I don't think that's a good look. I don't think she should have done that, right? I think that borders on unethical. But it has nothing to do with her ability to prosecute this case and the charges that she has brought against the 19 co-conspirators who tried to defraud the people of Georgia of their votes, right? It has nothing to - like, her personal, I think, foibles have nothing to do with the prosecution of that case, where, let us not forget, three people have already pleaded guilty to the charges that she brought stop.\n\nSo, we have to understand Fani Willis as a person who has professional responsibilities and a personal life. And her personal life, I think that was a mess. But her professional responsibilities are not in any way implicated by this particular scandal. There are different kinds of ethical, moral quandaries and scandals that potentially would implicate a prosecutor's ability to move forward with a case. This ain't one of them. This is just a bad look, right? So the idea that you can go from this personal issue and overplay it to the point where \"Now you have to dismiss the whole case, and she is racist\" and - it's ridiculous. And I don't think a judge will go for it. But it's a bad look. I wish she hadn't done it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And, Elie Mystal, we haven't talked to you for a while, since the E. Jean Carroll case, which really is significant, a jury voting more than $83 million for Trump defaming E. Jean Carroll, after another civil trial found him guilty of sexually assaulting her, the judge saying, in common parlance, it was rape. But when the - just before the jury found him liable for $83 million, Trump walked out of the closing arguments. Can you just summarize that case for us and where it's headed? Will he be paying this $83 million?\n\nELIE MYSTAL : Yeah, Trump is a bit of a baby, and he threw a tantrum when he had to pay up the money for running his mouth. Like, let's not forget. There was an initial trial. He was found liable for defaming her. He was ordered to pay her $5 million. And then he kept defaming her, and then he kept running his mouth about her, right? And so that's why he had the second trial, and now it's an $83 million payment.\n\nAnd I'll tell you one thing, Amy: He has shut up about her now. He's made a lot of tweets, a lot of all-caps anger tweets - haven't heard her name out of his mouth since the verdict. And that's the point. We, perhaps, finally found the price point that it takes to make Donald Trump shut up, and it's $83 million. I hope we all remember that figure. I hope other judges put $83 million fines on him to keep his mouth shut, because, apparently, that's what it takes.\n\nWill he have to pay it? You know, eventually. I'm not an economist. I don't understand the GDP of Trump Org and how exactly that works. He has to post a bond. I don't know if he has the money. I don't know if he's going to fleece his, you know, MAGA supporters to send them their Social Security checks so he can pay off his legal fees. I don't know exactly how it's going to work, but I do know that the point was that he needed to shut up about her, and he has.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Finally, you know, we haven't talked to you since your debut on SNL , or was that Keenan Thompson? Let's take a look.\n\nBARRY GIBB : [played by Jimmy Fallon] Elie, you write for The Nation . Do you think the media is overstating the negative sentiment of the election to get views and clicks?\n\nELIE MYSTAL : [played by Keenan Thompson] Well, that's an interesting question.\n\nBARRY GIBB : Oh, is it? You say it's interesting. You find it interesting.\n\nELIE MYSTAL : Yeah, I do.\n\nBARRY GIBB : Yeah? Well, I find you interesting, OK? You look like if Don King ate another Don King. I will unhinge my jaw and bite your head off like a goldfish cracker!\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, you made it, Elie! You made it! How are you feeling today?\n\nELIE MYSTAL : I'm obviously a huge fan of Barry Gibb. I feel like he was done wrong by Jimmy Fallon. Look, it was a nice moment for me. And what I've taken from that is that whatever the heck I'm doing, it seems to be working, so I should keep working and keep writing and keep trying to explain how our Justice Department and how our Supreme Court is deciding the rules that the rest of us have to live under.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, next time we're going to look at the Supreme Court, do we have to have Keenan Thompson on?\n\nELIE MYSTAL : Oh, I hope so. If one thing could happen, if that - if I become, in any small way, a way for SNL to cover the Supreme Court a little bit more and to bring some knowledge to bear on its viewers, that, you know, usually aren't listening to me, about how the court actually operates and what it does in secret, then I will take every Don King joke they can throw at me, if that's the upshot.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Elie Mystal, The Nation 's justice correspondent, thank you so much for joining us. We'll link to all your pieces . Elie Mystal is also the author of Allow Me to Retort: A Black Guy's Guide to the Constitution .\n\nComing up, we go to Pakistan for the latest in the country's national elections.

Trudeau had served as Canada's prime minister since 2015. His resignation comes as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is threatening to annex Canada. For more, we speak with Canadian activist and electoral candidate Avi Lewis for the New Democratic Party, who says that, \"like Joe Biden,\" Trudeau \"waited way too long\" to step down from candidacy in upcoming national elections. Lewis calls Trump's aggressive rhetoric on Canada a \"cartoon threat\" that comes out of the real estate mogul's long-running use of \"force\" in his personal and business dealings.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nAfter nearly a decade in power, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Monday he's stepping down as leader of Canada's Liberal Party. His resignation comes amidst rising discontent over his leadership and growing dissent within his government.\n\nPRIME MINISTER JUSTIN TRUDEAU : I intend to resign as party leader, as prime minister, after the party selects its next leader through a robust, nationwide, competitive process.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Justin Trudeau has been Canada's prime minister since 2015 but faced plummeting popular support, as well as opposition within his own party. His finance minister, Chrystia Freeland, resigned last month amidst a public dispute over how to respond to Trump's vow to impose a 25% tariff on Canadian goods. Freeland is considered one of the possible successors to Trudeau, as is the close ally Dominic LeBlanc, who was appointed to replace Freeland in December. Canada is scheduled to hold federal elections this year, and polls indicate Canada's Conservatives would win elections if they were held today. The Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, who's been compared to Donald Trump, has pushed anti-labor, anti-regulation measures and called for expanding oil and gas development.\n\nAt his news conference Tuesday, President-elect Trump, who has repeatedly mocked Canada as America's 51st state, threatened to use economic force to absorb Canada into the United States.\n\nREPORTER : Are you also considering military force to annex and acquire Canada?\n\nPRESIDENT - ELECT DONALD TRUMP : No, economic force, because Canada and the United States, that would really be something. You get rid of that artificially drawn line, and you take a look at what that looks like. And it would also be much better for national security. Don't forget, we basically protect Canada. But here's the problem with Canada. So many friends up there.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Trump continued his push Tuesday evening, posting maps on social media showing Canada as part of the United States, while Trudeau responded, saying there isn't \"a snowball's chance in hell\" that the two countries will join.\n\nFor more on Prime Minister Trudeau, Canadian politics and the future of U.S.-Canada relations, we're joined by Avi Lewis, Canadian documentary filmmaker, activist, also candidate in Canada's upcoming federal election, running for the New Democratic Party in Vancouver Centre.\n\nThanks so much for joining us, Avi. Can you talk about the significance of what's happening, the resignation of Prime Minister Trudeau, and President Trump threatening to absorb Canada?\n\nAVI LEWIS : Amy, it's great to be back with you. It's been too long.\n\nWe've had an eventful series of weeks here in Canada. I think, as of last weekend, I was the last person in Canada who still thought that Justin Trudeau would run in the next election. He clearly still believes he is the only person who can lead his party, but he's been down 10 or 20% in the polls for a year and a half. He's faced, as you said, an uprising in his own party. And just like Joe Biden, he waited way too long, and his - I think his ego got in the way. And now he's finally admitted that he can't do it. And there will be a chaotic scramble and a leadership race, and I think we'll definitely face an election in the spring.\n\nSo, Canada is in turmoil right at a time when we have a very consequential showdown with your president-elect, and our Pierre Poilievre, our polite Canadian Trump in a T-shirt, is way ahead in the polls. And so, we're going to have a very intense and very important debate in Canada about integration with the United States. I mean, the irony here, Amy, as you know and have covered for decades, is that the whole point of Canadian-American so-called free trade, the Canada-U.S. free trade deal first in 1988 and then NAFTA and following deals, have been to integrate our economies, to give the United States unfettered access, particularly to our oil. And, you know, by the free trade - so-called free trade treaties, we're not allowed to reduce oil exports to the United States by any significant way - obviously, a problem in a time of climate emergency. But there's already immense integration between our economies. And obviously, these tariffs that Trump has been threatening would be absolutely brutal for working families on both sides of the border and would make - would reignite the inflation crisis and the cost-of-living crisis. So, that's the political debate we're having now.\n\nAs far as Trump, you know, threatening the usual stuff, it's a little bit of a balancing act. We have to take it seriously, but we can't overreact. That's what a bully wants, to send people running in fear. We don't take the bait here. And I'm proud that the New Democratic Party leader, Jagmeet Singh, is the only Canadian political leader who's talking about retaliatory tariffs in response to this latest cartoon threat, which is how it will have to play out.\n\nBut we should look at how this fits into a pattern with Trump. He's a grabber. He wants to grab Panama. He wants to grab Greenland. He grabs women. For him, the whole point of power is to use it. Using force as an expression of his own power is the way he's conducted his personal life, is the way he's conducted his business life. And now he doesn't understand why he can't use the U.S. military and the U.S. economy the same way.\n\nSo, it is a real threat, and Canadians should get mobilized to fight it, especially to protect our water, because he talked in the fall about turning on this huge faucet and having access to Canada's water. And to get back to the free trade agenda that Conservatives and Liberals have implemented to the immense harm of working people in Canada over the last decades, it was always about water. And both Conservatives and Liberals in Canada were prepared to put water on the table. And only the New Democratic Party and social movements, incredible civil society organizations have risen again and again to stop the sale of our water.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Would you say, if there were an election held today, that the Conservatives would win, but because of what Trump is saying right now, you know, talking about absorbing Canada, and not relenting on this, that that could put the Conservatives at a disadvantage?\n\nAVI LEWIS : I mean, I certainly hope so. They're way up in the polls. But it's an incredibly volatile time in Canada. And, you know, honestly, Amy, that's why I'm stepping up and running for office right now, which is not - you know, it's not an easy thing to do. It's filled with contradictions. But, you know, I think my grandpa said it best. My grandfather, David Lewis, was leader of the federal NDP in the early '70s. And the early '70s were a time much like this, an inflation-driven cost-of-living crisis. Just like today, the right was blaming immigrants and poor folks, people without work or housing who were living on the street, saying it was the welfare bums to blame for our problems. And my grandpa, David Lewis, said, \"You know who's to blame? The corporate welfare bums.\" He said, \"Big business and government are holding hands in your pocket.\"\n\nAnd we're very much in the same place today. Like, every sector of the economy is dominated by a handful of huge corporations, led by billionaire CEOs, and they are shoveling the people's wealth into their own pockets as fast as their soft, lily-white hands can move. In Canada, we've got five big banks making extraterrestrial profits, whether the interest rates are up or down. We've got five big oil companies who have captured government. They were gifted a $34 billion pipeline, that the people paid for, while Big Oil has used its influence and capture of government to block any meaningful climate action. We've got three big telecom corporations, which is why we have the most expensive and crappiest cellphone service and data service in the world. We've got three big supermarket chains, plus Walmart and Costco, who are price fixing, colluding to keep charging 10 bucks for butter even though inflation is down. In the States, you just had Potatogate, where the two big potato companies are the subject of a class-action lawsuit for fixing the price of tater tots. Like, Amy, is nothing sacred in this time of corporate welfare bums?\n\nAnd then there are more and more people who are working for Big Tech platforms in the gig economy, that have turned us, our lives, our intimate lives, and the value we create into a commodity that their algorithms mine for profits, like the big real estate companies use algorithms to jack up the rent, which in a city like Vancouver is just too damn high. So, you've got an Uber driver working 12 or 14 hours in their own car, at their own expense, just working for the app on their phone, and the Big Tech bro behind it to steal more than half the value they create.\n\nSo, the right wing is right. There is a small elite that's responsible for the fact that you work and work and work and still can't afford a decent home, nice food and a vacation once in a while. But it's them. In Canada, the Conservative Party is the party of billionaires, the ultrarich, the corporate welfare bums. But it doesn't have to be this way. And that's the beautiful thing about elections. And as we head into this next chaotic period in Canada, it's important to remember that elections are a time when the people have the power to decide, when we get to throw the corporate welfare bums out.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Before -\n\nAVI LEWIS : But what we vote for - yeah, go ahead, Amy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Before we end, I wanted to ask you about Jimmy Carter. His state funeral is taking place in National Cathedral in Washington Thursday, which President Biden has declared a national day of mourning. He died December 29th at the age of 100. When he was inaugurated in 1977, Carter fulfilled a campaign promise to pardon those who resisted the Vietnam War draft. He issued Proclamation 4483 on his first full day in office. Avi Lewis, many American war resisters fled to Canada, your homeland, among them your father-in-law, Naomi Klein's father. During an interview in 1999, Carter reflected on his decision to pardon Vietnam draft resisters, many of them conscientious objectors.\n\nAVI LEWIS : Yeah, I mean, you know, I think it was a moving - it has been a moving moment in Canada. Obviously, lots of bad things happen under any American president, and we've had a healthy debate about, you know, things that the American Empire did under Jimmy Carter that were not to be celebrated. But, you know, actually turning down the thermostat and putting solar panels on the White House and saying, \"Hey, if it's cold, put on a sweater,\" commonsense forecasting of the climate emergency to come and the energy emergencies that have been serial in the period of climate breakdown and fossil fuel dominance, that was really memorable.\n\nHis pardoning of the war resisters of Vietnam - I mean, that was a generation of 35,000 idealistic young people. There were doctors. There were professionals and others, like Naomi's dad, who came and helped us build our single-payer universal healthcare system. And that's - you know, talking about Trudeau now, part of his legacy is that since the pandemic, the privatization of healthcare in Canada has been absolutely terrifying. You can now pay 150 bucks to get on the phone with a doctor in Canada. And that's what the draft dodger generation and the '70s generation, that nostalgia that we have for Carter, that was when we really built up our public healthcare system. And we have to fight now the corporate welfare bums and the rising right to rescue that vision of taxing the super rich and using that money to build back our universal public services, so that people can go to the doctor, and to complete the dream of - Tommy Douglas's dream of Canadian healthcare, our grandfather, our socialist grandfather of universal Medicare, to include eyes and teeth and mental health and medicine in the vision of universal healthcare.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And we're going to have to leave it there. Of course, Tommy Douglas, the grandfather of the actor Kiefer Sutherland.\n\nAVI LEWIS : There you go.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Avi Lewis, Canadian documentary filmmaker and activist, also a candidate in Canada's upcoming federal election, running for the New Democratic Party, the NDP , in Vancouver Centre.\n\nUp next, the Pentagon has released 11 men from Guantánamo - they're from Yemen - to Oman. We'll speak with two lawyers involved with their cases. Back in 20 seconds.\n\n[break]\n\nAMY GOODMAN : \"Deep Water\" by Ed Askew.

We speak to ACLU national legal director David Cole about what can be done in the face of lifetime judicial appointments to the nation's highest court who often rule counter to majority opinion in the country. \"This is a radical court that is intruding upon our liberties,\" says Cole. \"It's doing it all in the name of a commitment to a historic vision of the Constitution as it was drafted, when it was drafted, and imposing that on the American people, notwithstanding the fact that two centuries have intervened and circumstances are dramatically different today.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org. I'm Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to issue its final two rulings of its current term today, one on climate and the other on whether President Biden can end the Trump-era \"Remain in Mexico\" program, which has blocked asylum seekers from entering the United States.\n\nOn Wednesday, Justice Stephen Breyer informed President Biden he would formally retire at noon today. Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson will then be sworn in, becoming the nation's first Black female justice.\n\nOver the past month, the far-right court has issued a series of rulings which could reshape the nation, from overturning Roe v. Wade to vastly expanding Second Amendment gun rights to chipping away at the separation of church and state.\n\nTo look more at the Supreme Court's rulings, we're joined by David Cole, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, his recent op-ed for the L.A. Times headlined \"The Supreme Court is not accountable to the people. So what can check its power?\"\n\nWelcome back to Democracy Now! , David Cole. Can you start off by just assessing what has taken place, the decisions this court has made? And then we can talk about what you feel can check its power.\n\nDAVID COLE : Sure. So, this has been a real radical turn to the right by the court this term. And if you compare it to last term, last term the court decided almost all of its most controversial cases on narrow grounds, achieving consensus, very few decisions decided 5-4 or 6-3, many of the decisions 8-1, unanimous, 7 to 2. They really were looking to try to achieve consensus. This term, they've thrown moderation out, thrown consensus out, and virtually every controversial decision has been decided by a 6-to-3 or 5-to-4 vote.\n\nAnd the conservative majority has upended the religion clauses, so that where it used to be that there were strict limits on government aid to religious schools, and you couldn't have prayer in schools, this term the court has ruled that the states are compelled to support private religious indoctrination if they also support private secular schools, and that a state high school was compelled to allow a football coach, its football coach, to pray at the 50-yard line at the end of every game. It overturned a 50-year-old precedent in Dobbs , the Roe v. Wade decision overturned, a right, and for the first time eliminated a right that was - is central to the equal status of half of this country, and struck down over a hundred-year-old New York law that restricted people carrying guns in public, and earlier in the term struck down President Biden's vaccine requirement for businesses of over a hundred people.\n\nSo this is a radical court that is intruding upon our liberties, our safety, and it's doing it all in the name of a sort of commitment to a historic vision of the Constitution as it was drafted, when it was drafted, and imposing that on the American people, notwithstanding the fact that two centuries have intervened and circumstances are dramatically different today.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : So, David Cole, could you elaborate on this point that you made that the court appears to be much less interested in reaching consensus on these decisions, and what you think explains that, and then the arguments that you make in your L.A. Times piece on how the Supreme Court's power can be checked?\n\nDAVID COLE : So, what explains the sort of abandonment of consensus, I think, is just that the five justices - and when I talk about the five, it is Justice Thomas, Justice Alito and Trump's three appointments, Kavanaugh, Barrett and Gorsuch - and they've just decided to flex their muscle. And they're no longer interested in reaching narrow resolution.\n\nI mean, the abortion case is sort of a case in point. As Chief Justice Roberts wrote in his separate opinion in that case, in which he did not join the other five in seeking to overturn Roe , all that was required to decide that case was whether a 15-week ban on abortion was constitutional or not. That ban could be upheld consistent with upholding the notion that women have a right to make a decision about whether to terminate a pregnancy, and simply saying, as Chief Justice Roberts said, that 15 weeks is a reasonable time to allow women to make that choice. Now, I disagree with that view, but that is a view that would decide the case without upending 50 years of precedent. The majority reached out and nonetheless decided to take on Roe , take on Casey , and overturn 20-plus cases that the court has decided since Roe that have affirmed the notion that it is a core aspect of women's liberty to be able to control their bodies, control their families, control their lives by deciding when and whether to have a child. The only reason that the court overturned Roe v. Wade was that five justices now have the power to do it. It's not - there's no principled basis upon which they justify that overturning. It's an exercise of raw power.\n\nAnd, you know, they seek to justify it in the name of what they call originalism, this notion that the Constitution should only protect what it was understood to protect at the time it was adopted. Well, if you took that approach, which is the approach they took in Dobbs , not only would there not be a right to abortion, but there wouldn't be a right to contraception. There wouldn't be a right to marry someone of a different race or of the same sex. There wouldn't be a right against forced sterilization. There wouldn't be equal protection for women, because when the Equal Protection Clause was adopted in 1868, there was no suggestion that women were protected by it. Women didn't even have the right to vote. And segregation would be legal again. We would have to overturn Brown v. Board of Education and resurrect Plessy v. Ferguson , because when the 14th Amendment was adopted, it was voted upon by a segregated Congress, and no one suggested that the segregation that was rampant around the country at that time was hereby being declared unconstitutional.\n\nAnd so, this is a truly radical ideology. It's held by five justices, maybe five-and-a- half, because sometimes Chief Justice Roberts joins it, but other times he doesn't. And that's enough to have a majority today on the Supreme Court. But when you look over the course of the history of the court, there have been about 116 justices. About six of them have been originalists, have taken this rigid view that the Constitution doesn't evolve over time. The other hundred-plus justices have all taken the view that, no, the Constitution applies, like any other law, through the application of principles to new circumstances, recognizing changing conditions, so that it can govern the nation for centuries, which is what it has done. If you take an originalist sort of blindered historical approach to the Constitution, you would have to upend virtually everything that the court has decided over the last 200 years. And they - you know, they seem ready to do that, at least in certain cases of this term.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And so, can you talk today about what it means that Breyer is stepping down, Justice Breyer, and, most significantly, that the first Black woman will become a justice of the Supreme Court today, Ketanji Brown Jackson?\n\nDAVID COLE : Well, you know, it's about time on the first Black woman on the court, that's for sure. I don't think it's going to change all that much, in truth, with respect to how the court rules. Justice Jackson will be, I think, a reliable and consistent voice for the vulnerable and for civil rights and civil liberties. Justice Breyer was, as well. There will still be a 6-to-3 partisan divide on the court.\n\nSo, I think what will change the court, if anything changes the court, is public reaction. If the public sort of sits back and says, \"Oh my god! There's nothing we can do. The court - you know, Trump's justices have taken over. It's hopeless. There's no point,\" then they'll continue on their road of remaking constitutional law in a vision that rejects what virtually every other justice before them has taken. If, on the other hand, Americans stand up for the values and principles that we believe in, for values like the right of every woman to have an abortion if she doesn't choose to bring a pregnancy to term, the right of states and local governments to protect our public safety by limiting guns, the right of all of us to keep church and state separate - if we stand up for those rights, if we organize for those rights, if we vote on the basis of those rights, those rights will be protected. And I think the court, if it sees that kind of response, might have some hesitation about continuing on its path. Courts - the Supreme Court rarely departs very far from where the country is. And when it does, there's often a public reaction that sort of pushes the court back into its proper place. The court has departed very far from where the country is on both abortion and guns in its decisions this term. The question is whether we will push back.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Briefly, The New York Times published the result of recent surveys carried out by Harvard, Stanford and the University of Texas on where precisely the public stands on all of these issues that the court has already ruled on. And with the exception of overturning Roe v. Wade , it seems as though the public is almost evenly divided. In other words, there are some cases in which 50 to 53% of the public agree with the court's decision, and others in which the reverse is true. In other words, the difference is very minor. And given that, what can the public do? I mean, what would it mean for the public to act?\n\nDAVID COLE : Yeah. So, that is true about some of the cases that the court decided this term that are not the ones we're talking about today. But that is not true when it comes to the right to abortion. The polls have consistently shown that Americans believe that Roe should have been upheld, not overturned. It is not true when -\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Oh, yes, absolutely, in that case, yes.\n\nDAVID COLE : Yes, well, and that -\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : In the case of Roe -\n\nDAVID COLE : Yes, and it is also not true with respect to the New York gun law. The polls consistently show people support gun control, reasonable gun control, support restrictions on the public carrying of weapons. I think that the polls show that New Yorkers, something like 85% of New Yorkers supported the law that the court struck down. So these are not close calls. This is a court that has really departed from where the country stands.\n\nAnd, you know, I think the abortion case is really - it is the central decision, the most important decision, I think the worst decision, the court has issued in this century thus far. And it is the first time in the history of the court that it has wholly eliminated a constitutional right enjoyed by half of the country. It has overturned precedent in the past, but generally to expand rights, not to eliminate them altogether. And so, this is really a watershed.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We have 10 seconds.\n\nDAVID COLE : And the question is: How do we respond? And we have to respond by standing up and fighting back.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : David Cole, I want to thank you for being with us, ACLU national legal director. We'll link to your Los Angeles Times op-ed , \"The Supreme Court is not accountable to the people. So what can check its power?\"\n\nNext up, Michigan's Supreme Court threw out charges against former Michigan Governor Rick Snyder and other officials for their role in the poisoning of an American city, the Flint water crisis. We'll go to Flint to get response. Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Even among those who voted for the Conservatives this year, Patel, Cleverly and Kemi Badenoch were the only candidates more than half could correctly identify.\n\nOf the candidates who were introduced to the focus groups, which were shown video clips, Badenoch, a former business secretary, performed best with those who switched to the Lib Dems and Reform, with the highest number saying they would be willing to give her a hearing and that she offered something \"new and different and refreshing\".\n\nHowever, the candidate who was most liked by the group was Cleverly, another former home secretary, his ordinary background contrasting with that of the multimillionaire Rishi Sunak. Participants described him as \"friendly, plain-speaking and approachable and [he] seemed to have a laid-back character\", though a few participants were turned off by what they had heard as him having a reputation for off-colour jokes.\n\nThe former immigration minister Robert Jenrick, seen in Westminster as one of the frontrunners to become Tory leader, received a relatively poor reception, described as \"smug\" \"slimy\" or \"wooden\", although some who switched to Reform said they agreed with his messaging.\n\nPatel, though the most recognisable candidate, was also seen as one of the most divisive, with many focus group participants suggesting she had too much baggage, though she was praised by some Reform switchers.\n\nThe former security minister Tom Tugendhat also received a reasonably positive reception, ranked as the most \"prime ministerial\" and as having more gravitas than any of the other candidates. He was particularly popular with those who switched to Labour and the Lib Dems and his military service was popular with Reform voters."

      "text": "'He believes he is the law': anti-Maga conservatives view Trump as threat to constitution\n\nSpeakers at Principles First summit warned of peril Trump and allies posed, urging people 'to be in the streets'\n\nM ichael Fanone, the former police officer who defended the US Capitol on 6 January 2021, looked out at the attendees of the Principles First summit and denounced Donald Trump in the strongest possible terms for pardoning roughly 1,500 people who participated in the insurrection.\n\n\"He pardoned them because he wants people to know that if you commit crimes on his behalf, he's got your back,\" Fanone said on Saturday. \"They are operating under the assumption that, if they commit violent criminal acts on Donald Trump's behalf, that he will pardon them for future violence.\"\n\nFanone's words appeared prescient later that afternoon, when he and three other officers were confronted by Enrique Tarrio, the former leader of the far-right Proud Boys group. Tarrio received a prison sentence of 22 years for seditious conspiracy and other charges related to his role in the insurrection, but Trump pardoned him last month. In a video that Tarrio shared on social media, he taunted Fanone and the other officers - Daniel Hodges of the Metropolitan police department and former Capitol police officers Aquilino Gonell and Harry Dunn - as \"fucking cowards\".\n\nThe intimidation continued the next day at the summit, when an email account bearing the name \"Enrique T\" sent a bomb threat to the organizers of the conference. The threat specifically named several summit speakers, including Fanone, as the targets of four pipe bombs. Tarrio denied any involvement in the incident, which turned out to be a false alarm, but still forced attendees to evacuate the conference room hosting the summit for about two hours as police officers conducted a security sweep.\n\nThe threats underscored a message shared by nearly every speaker at the Principles First summit, which is considered a center-right alternative to the Conservative Political Action Conference. One by one, speakers took the stage to voice their shared belief that Trump represents a fundamental threat to the rule of law and the integrity of the US constitution.\n\n\"President Trump has diminished the rule of law in America,\" Asa Hutchinson, a former Republican presidential candidate, said on Saturday. \"President Trump, because the supreme court gave him immunity, believes he is the law.\"\n\nMultiple speakers cited Trump's recent clash with Janet Mills, the Democratic governor of Maine, as evidence of his autocratic tendencies. In a combative exchange that went viral online, Trump asked Mills, who was attending a White House event alongside other governors, whether she intended to comply with his executive order on transgender athletes.\n\n\"I'm complying with state and federal laws,\" Mills replied.\n\nTrump responded: \"We are the federal law.\"\n\nChris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey who served as a close adviser to Trump before becoming one of the president's most vocal Republican critics, described that comment as \"the most important thing he has said in the last two weeks because that tells you exactly what he thinks\".\n\n\"He believes that the attorney general of the United States is his personal lawyer,\" Christie said at the Principles First summit on Saturday. \"He believes the Department of Justice is to do what he instructs them to do.\"\n\nEven as summit speakers warned of the serious threat that Trump and his allies pose to the foundations of US government, they implored attendees to stand up for their principles.\n\nSign up to This Week in Trumpland\n\nA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\n\"I know these people. They are cowards,\" said Tim Miller, a writer for the Bulwark and communications director for Republican former presidential candidate Jeb Bush. \"Speaking out right now is a good in itself ... Our job is to say no to this, to stand up to them and to not be afraid because they want you to be afraid, and you have no reason to be fearful of these little men.\"\n\nMultiple speakers predicted Trump will eventually violate court orders and they urged any American who supported a robust democracy to protest the president's unconstitutional acts when they occur.\n\n\"People need to be in the streets. People need to be strongly reacting against it,\" said Gregg Nunziata, executive director of the Society for the Rule of Law. \"We really do need conservatives and Republicans to be in that number for this to work.\"\n\nMark Cuban, the billionaire entrepreneur who is considered a potential presidential candidate in 2028, but who told the conference on Saturday he does not plan on running, suggested that the \"chaos\" unleashed by Trump's first month in office may provide an opening for the president's critics to present an alternative vision for the country's future.\n\n\"The opportunity for the Democrats and businesspeople, and you for that matter, is to stand up and look for ways to create calm and order out of chaos,\" Cuban said."

      "text": "Conservatives win German election but far-right AfD doubles support\n\nResults show CDU/CSU will be largest party but success of Alternative für Deutschland likely to complicate formation of a government\n\nThe conservative opposition has won the most votes in Germany's general election, but a dramatic surge by the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) is likely to complicate the formation of a government to help spearhead a European response to growing global threats.\n\nThe CDU/CSU candidate, Friedrich Merz , was preparing on Sunday night to try to form a ruling coalition after clinching almost 29% of the vote from a high turnout.\n\n\"I'd like to express my respect for our political rivals,\" he said, referring to fellow centrists. \"It was a very tough campaign.\n\n\"Now we need to talk to each other and as quickly as possible form a government for Germany that can take action so that we can do the right thing at home, be present again in Europe and make sure the world sees that Germany again has a reliable government.\"\n\nThe AfD, buoyed by anger about immigration, violent crime and high energy costs, got about 21% of the vote - finishing second and nearly doubling its result at the last election in 2021.\n\nThe party's jubilant chancellor candidate and co-leader, Alice Weidel , cheered the outcome with AfD officials including the extremist firebrand Björn Höcke , who has been convicted of using the banned Nazi slogan \"Alles für Deutschland\" (Everything for Germany) in campaign speeches.\n\n\"This is a historic success for us - our best result ever,\" Weidel told the broadcaster ARD. \"We extend our hand to offer cooperation with the CDU. Otherwise change won't be possible in Germany.\"\n\nAll the mainstream parties, however, have pledged to maintain a \"firewall\" barring formal cooperation with the anti-migrant, pro-Kremlin AfD , which attracted high-profile endorsements from Donald Trump's confidant, Elon Musk , and the US vice-president, JD Vance , during the short, intense campaign.\n\nTrump hailed the election's outcome. \"Much like the USA, the people of Germany got tired of the no-common-sense agenda, especially on energy and immigration,\" he wrote in a post on Truth Social. \"This is a great day for Germany.\"\n\nBut Merz struck a blunt tone, saying Trump had made it \"clear that [his] government is fairly indifferent to Europe's fate\" and that Germany would have to wait to see \"whether we will still be able to speak about Nato in its current form\" when the alliance meets for its next summit in June.\n\n\"For me, the absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA\" in defence matters, Merz said.\n\nHe said he had not given up hope that Ukraine would be included in any negotiations with Russia on its future, perhaps with the \"intervention of the US Congress\" on Kyiv's behalf against any attempt at exclusion by Trump.\n\nBritish prime minister Keir Starmer congratulated Merz and welcomed the chance to \"enhance our joint security\". \"I look forward to working with the new government to deepen our already strong relationship, enhance our joint security and deliver growth for both our countries,\" Starmer posted on X.\n\nFrench president Emmanuel Macron offered his congratulations, saying: \"We are more determined than ever to achieve great things together for France and Germany and work towards a strong and sovereign Europe. In this time of uncertainty, we are united to face the major challenges of the world and our continent.\"\n\nThe incumbent chancellor, Olaf Scholz, turned in the worst performance for his Social Democrats since the second world war, with about 16%. He had led a fractious three-way government until it collapsed in November over a dispute on spending priorities - just hours after Trump's re-election - triggering the poll seven months ahead of schedule.\n\nA chastened Scholz called it a \"bitter result\" and a \"defeat\" but struck a defiant tone on the strength of the far right, saying it was \"something that we can never simply accept\".\n\nVoters also punished Scholz's junior partners, the Greens, who slipped three points to 11.6%, and the pro-business Free Democrats, who failed to clear the 5% hurdle to representation in parliament.\n\nThe far-left Linke drew more than 8% after a remarkable late-campaign comeback , while a new populist left-conservative party, the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance , fizzled out after strong showings in European and state elections last year to tally just below 5%.\n\nMerz's conservatives, who fell far short of a majority, will need to seek an alliance to govern, with the goal of having a new administration in place by Easter. His most likely coalition partner is seen as the Social Democrats; together they should have just enough to form a majority, according to a Spiegel projection of seats.\n\nWeidel said a three-way coalition government under Merz would be \"unstable\" and predicted it would \"not survive four years\", at which point the AfD would be waiting in the wings.\n\nThe AfD will become the biggest opposition party even while it is under surveillance by security authorities as a suspected extremist force. It has grown steadily more radical since its launch by Eurosceptic professors 12 years ago.\n\nIt has also taken direct aim at Germany's culture of atonement for the Holocaust. During a televised debate last weekend, Weidel explicitly refused to distance herself from remarks by one of the AfD's founders calling the Nazi period \"no more than a speck of bird poo in over 1,000 years of successful history\" .\n\nMerz, a sharp-tempered corporate lawyer and veteran MP with no experience leading a government, will face a towering in-tray as chancellor, a position he has chased for decades.\n\nJump-starting the sputtering economy, grappling with the breakdown in transatlantic relations under Trump and forging a path forward for besieged Ukraine are just a few of the challenges facing Germany, as Europe seeks stronger leadership in a more volatile world.\n\nThe news weekly Die Zeit said given the new global realities, Merz was now facing \"a mountain of problems of mythical proportions\".\n\nThe mood of the campaign was markedly grimmer than usual, analysts observed, with a sense that the rise of the AfD was keeping the focus on immigration at the expense of other pressing issues such as soaring housing costs and the climate crisis.\n\nMerz did not mention the AfD's strong result as he addressed his own party faithful, but took a more conciliatory tone with left-leaning opponents than he had in recent days.\n\nTo the voters, he added: \"Thank you for the trust you have placed in us and also in me personally - I understand the responsibility and the scope of the task ahead of me and I will face it with the greatest respect. I know it won't be easy.\"\n\nA series of deadly attacks with suspects from migrant backgrounds gave the AfD's Weidel grist for her calls for radical changes to border policy, including mass deportation of immigrants and German citizens deemed poorly integrated, keeping Merz, in particular, struggling to outflank her.\n\nThe latest assault came on Friday, when a Spanish tourist was stabbed at Berlin's Holocaust memorial, allegedly by a 19-year-old Syrian refugee who prosecutors said planned to kill Jews.\n\n\"Migration dominated the campaign and going forward, the new government will have to find policies that comply with German law and don't undermine the EU, which is going to be a huge challenge,\" the political scientist Aiko Wagner of Berlin's Free University told the Guardian.\n\n\"But the biggest challenge of all is going to be forming a stable coalition that also has the strength to cut the AfD down to size.\"\n\nExit polls showed the AfD did well among younger voters, winning in the 25-34 age bracket with 22%, ahead of CDU/CSU at 18%, and the Greens and Die Linke at 16% each. Merz's conservatives ceded legions of support to the AfD compared to four years ago, while the SPD saw heavy losses to the far right among the working class.\n\nAt this month's Munich security conference, Vance denounced the \"firewall\" against the AfD as undemocratic in a brazen intervention into the campaign. His remarks drew a strong rebuke from Merz, who pledged to bar the far right from any government he leads.\n\nMerz has offered an action plan to revive the German economy, the world's third largest, by cutting corporate taxes while expressing openness to reforming the strict \"debt brake\" that limits federal government annual borrowing to 0.35% of GDP.\n\nBut any policy initiatives will have to be agreed by potential partners in what are expected to be protracted coalition talks."

To the barricades,\" she cried, quoting the old leftist anthem in a video watched more than 30m times in its first week online, according to the Linke.\n\nWith Elon Musk and the US vice-president JD Vance openly courting the anti-immigrant, anti-Islam Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), the German election campaign has undergone a dizzying scramble of traditional alliances.\n\nAs hard right populists succeed across much of Europe and incumbents such as Germany's Social Democrat (SPD) chancellor, Olaf Scholz , fail to meet the moment, many leftist voters in particular have said they feel unsure where to turn, creating an opening for the once down-and-out Linke.\n\n\"The explosion of rents in cities has hurt so many people and the Linke is the only party really addressing it,\" said Michael Müllich, 26, at a standing-room-only campaign event last week in the Treptow district of eastern Berlin.\n\nAsked whether a Linke vote may be wasted given its slim chances of entering government, the computer science student said the party's \"tax the rich\" message was crucial. \"And I'm counting on it to stand up to the AfD when it becomes the biggest opposition party,\" Müllich added.\n\nSyrian-born Marah Abo Zraa, who works in administration for the city government, said she was \"excited\" to vote for the Linke in the first national election since she became a German citizen in 2023.\n\n\"The lurch to the right really scares me, although I couldn't be better integrated [into German society],\" said the 19-year-old, who arrived with the 2015 refugee influx . \"The Linke is the one party really rejecting hate and incitement. All the other parties seem to want to fight the AfD by imitating it.\"\n\nThe unpopular Scholz's fractious government collapsed in November but refused to step aside in favour of his defence minister, Boris Pistorius , potentially setting up the SPD for its worst result since the second world war in Sunday's snap election.\n\nWith climate protection slipping from the agenda as the economy, Europe's largest, limps along in recession, the Greens have returned to the low double digits in the polls - kingmakers at best.\n\nMeanwhile, Sahra Wagenknecht , the left's most prominent face before Reichinnek, defected from the Linke and formed her own party a year ago with a nativist call for slashing immigration, increasing social welfare benefits for German citizens and reviving ties to the Kremlin.\n\nAfter a strong run in June's European elections and three eastern state polls in September, however, her BSW party's national campaign has since fizzled amid internal divisions.\n\nRobert Ketel and Sarah Knothe, a couple doing their grocery shopping in Hennigsdorf, a traditional SPD stronghold north of Berlin where the AfD has made significant inroads, said they were both still undecided.\n\nSign up to Headlines Europe\n\nA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\n\"I know I'm going to vote for a leftist party but the SPD with Scholz has been a disappointment in reducing inequality and working with our neighbours. We need new leadership - that's obvious,\" said Ketel, 34, who is unemployed.\n\n\"I was tempted by the BSW and voted for it in the state election [in September] but Wagenknecht just attacks the other parties rather than making the case for her own,\" said Knothe, 35, a teaching assistant. \"It's become more of a cult of personality - it's always about her.\"\n\nThe Linke, the BSW and the pro-business Free Democrats were just weeks ago all teetering on the 5% hurdle to parliamentary representation in opinion polls.\n\nBut the Linke, which has had to hunt for bigger campaign venues in the last two weeks to accommodate the crowds, is now seen as most likely to get over the line after growing to 6-7% support , according to polling.\n\nReichinnek has argued the BSW split allowed the Linke to staunch years of internal squabbling and focus on its core cost of living issues. The party has also softened key foreign policy stances including opposition to Nato, now condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine while calling for a \"diplomatic\" solution to the conflict.\n\nLinke membership has surged to the highest level since the 2009 financial crisis and pollsters say that some of the ground lost to the far right in the former communist east has been regained among west German intellectuals, particularly students.\n\nMerz, who has positioned his CDU/CSU bloc far to the right of where it was under the former chancellor Angela Merkel , has ruled out forming a coalition with the AfD, which is polling in second place with about 20%.\n\nBut many voters say they were unsettled by Merz's gambit to solicit far-right votes for a tougher border policy in response to the arrest of an Afghan asylum seeker after a deadly knife attack . Analysts say the drive to the right may have in turn reinvigorated the left, with the Linke best placed to benefit.\n\nJust as the AfD's strength has alarmed the conservatives, the far-left renaissance may serve as a wake-up call to the weakened SPD and the Greens that they risk losing touch with younger voters.\n\nA mock election held among the under-18s last week showed the Linke coming in first place with more than 20%, followed by the SPD on 18%, the CDU/CSU and the AfD nearly tied at almost 16% each. The Greens came in a distant last place among the main parties with just over 12%."

      "text": "Americans die younger in states run by conservatives, study finds\n\nMore liberal policies on environment, gun safety, labor, economic taxes and tobacco taxes associated with lower mortality\n\nAmericans die younger in conservative states than in those governed by liberals, a new study has found.\n\nThe authors wrote : \"Simulations indicate that changing all policy domains in all states to a fully liberal orientation might have saved 171,030 lives in 2019, while changing them to a fully conservative orientation might have cost 217,635 lives.\"\n\nThe study was published on Plos One, \"an inclusive journal community working together to advance science for the benefit of society, now and in the future\".\n\nThe authors are from Syracuse University in New York, Harvard in Massachusetts, Virginia Commonwealth University, the University of Washington, the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Western Ontario, in Canada.\n\nThey wrote: \"Results show that the policy domains were associated with working-age mortality.\"\n\nBucking the trend, the study found that \"more conservative marijuana policies\" were associated with lower mortality rates.\n\nBut it also found that \"more liberal policies on the environment, gun safety, labour, economic taxes and tobacco taxes in a state were associated with lower mortality in that state\".\n\nThey added: \"Especially strong associations were observed between certain domains and specific causes of death: between the gun safety domain and suicide mortality among men, between the labour domain and alcohol-induced mortality, and between both the economic tax and tobacco tax domains and CVD [cardiovascular] mortality.\"\n\nAccording to the National Council of State Legislatures , as of June this year Republicans controlled 61% of state legislatures and Democrats 35%. In terms of whole state governments, Republicans controlled 46% and Democrats 12%, with 12 states divided.\n\nThe study authors also noted that American life expectancy as a whole is lower than in most high-income countries, \"fall[ing] between ... Cuba and Albania\".\n\nThey wrote: \"The rise in working-age mortality rates in the US in recent decades largely reflects stalled declines in cardiovascular disease mortality alongside rising mortality from alcohol-induced causes, suicide and drug poisoning; and it has been especially severe in some US states. Building on recent work, this study examined whether US state policy contexts may be a central explanation.\"\n\nWith federal and state midterm elections less than two weeks away, increased social spending in legislation passed by Democrats in Congress and the Biden administration has become a key issue in voters' minds.\n\nJoe Biden and other senior Democrats have sought to emphasise the success and necessity of such measures. But Republicans, who have presented such measures as irresponsible and contributing to inflation, are poised to retake the House and perhaps the Senate.\n\nThe study authors wrote: \" One study found that US life expectancy could increase by nearly four years if the country matched the average level of social policy generosity offered in 17 other high-income countries.\n\n\"More recent research has turned attention to policies and politics at the US state level, given the federalist structure of the US political system and the large size and geographical spread of the population. This new work suggests that changes in state policies and politics may have played a contributory role in producing the troubling US mortality trends.\""

      "text": "Some Conservatives Keep Awkwardly Calling Trump 'Daddy.' Experts Weigh In On What's Behind It.\n\nSenior Reporter, Life Trends\n\nA number of prominent conservatives have made it a point to publicly refer to President Donald Trump as \"daddy.\" While the nickname has been derided by many as cringey and weird , it might actually tell us something about Trump's political style, how his supporters view him and how people overall may at times assess political figures, according to experts.\n\nOn Friday, actor Mel Gibson was asked during an appearance on the Fox News show \"Hannity\" to weigh in on Trump's recent visit to California amid the wildfires (Gibson, a California resident, lost his home in Malibu) when he bizarrely said, \"I'm glad Trump's here at the moment. It's like daddy arrived, and he's taking his belt off, you know?\"\n\nAnd conservative lawmakers such as Reps. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) and Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) have also readily given Trump the moniker. During an appearance on Fox News last week, Donalds listed off things he expects Trump to do during his second term, saying that the country will get the \"stability that we were asking for.\"\n\n\"Daddy's back,\" he said. \"And that's what you're going to see.\"\n\nBoebert similarly leaned in on the parental figure theme in a post she shared on X , formerly called Twitter, the day before Trump's inauguration.\n\n\"Daddy's home!!\" she wrote in the post, which featured a Time magazine cover showing an illustration of Trump.\n\nThe list goes on. Musician Kid Rock added the lyrics \"daddy's home\" to his \"We the People\" song during Trump's pre-inauguration event, and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson notably delivered an unsettling speech at a Trump rally in October, in which he compared the U.S. under Democratic leadership to a \"hormone-addled 15-year-old daughter,\" before referring to Trump as a \"dad\" coming home to restore order and \"spanking\" a \"bad little girl.\"\n\nPeople have widely criticized these daddy nicknames and metaphors - and for several reasons. While parental metaphors have been thrown out and placed on other candidates before, including Democratic ones , Trump's \"daddy\" nickname - and analogies associated with discipline - have been ramping up lately, and people are dumbfounded by it. Many have taken to social media to condemn these \"daddy\" remarks, calling them creepy . And some have wondered what all this says about the way Trump's supporters perceive him.\n\nRuth Ben-Ghiat, a professor of history and Italian studies at New York University who writes about fascism, authoritarianism and propaganda, told the \"Pivot\" podcast in April that resentment over social progress fuels much of Trump's appeal.\n\nShe said that Trump \"models himself for that environment\" and that \"strongmen\" like him know how to \"read the marketplace\" and \"understand what is wanted.\"\n\n\"They model themselves and will be whatever they need to be to get to power, because they have no morals,\" Ben-Ghiat said. \"They're just about getting control.\"\n\n\"He also told these people that he loved them - that they were the forgotten,\" she later added. \"There's a sense that he's not just going to represent them, he's going to protect them and take care of them.\"\n\nRead on to hear more on what experts have to say about the \"daddy\" nickname.\n\nSome political scientists have described Trump's political style as authoritarian populist. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley's Othering and Belonging Institute describe authoritarian populist leaders as those who are effective at stoking fear and division by \"capitalizing on anti-establishment sentiment to paradoxically support their illiberal ideas.\"\n\nJacob Neiheisel , associate professor of political science at the University at Buffalo College of Arts and Sciences, told HuffPost that he also believes Trump has a \"nationalist/populist element to his presentation. ... Coupled perhaps with a willingness to flout political norms and conventions.\"\n\nNeiheisel said that he does think Trump's political style plays into an image and expectation the president has created - at least according to his supporters - that he will be tough on \"all that ails the country.\"\n\nHe said that the recent development of his supporters calling him \"daddy\" interestingly taps into a broader conversation and past research on family models and American politics, in which liberalism is thought to be associated with a nurturant parent worldview , while conservatism is more aligned with a strict father worldview.\n\nJane Junn , a professor of political sciences and gender and sexuality studies at the University of Southern California Dornsife College, told HuffPost that patriarchy, overall, has fueled a \"longstanding concept in societies around the world that men should rule.\"\n\nShe said the thinking is often that men should be \"strong,\" \"tough and aggressive,\" and \"authoritative.\"\n\nAs it relates to Trump, Junn said that his rhetoric is \"consistent\" with the idea that he wants to be seen as a leader who \"knows best.\"\n\nJunn pointed out that Trump's real-life history as a father and husband doesn't fit traditional or conventional views of what a \"family man\" is, so she doesn't think his personal life is what's driving his supporters to call him \"daddy.\"\n\n\"I think the origin for his supporters is probably more [about] an authoritarian control, by a man, a single man,\" she said.\n\nNeiheisel said that he's \"concerned to an extent\" about what this says about how well people will hold elected officials accountable.\n\n\"'Strict' fathers are to be obeyed without question in this worldview,\" he said. \"I am also worried, however, about retribution against political rivals, as there may be an expectation that a strict father disciplines dissent and metes out punishment.\"\n\nJunn said that she believes Trump's supporters who use the familial moniker for the president might want to \"throw back to a traditional time where daddy was in charge and you just did what he said and everything will be OK.\"\n\nShe said that, while she thinks it's too early to make predictions on what this all may mean for the future of the country, the parental nickname \"signifies something broader\" nonetheless.\n\n\"What it signifies is the desire among a lot of his supporters to have the politics be about the man and not about the party platform or not about his policies per se,\" Junn said.\n\nNeiheisel said that presidents, or any political figures, can \"easily be turned into folk heroes.\"\n\nHe pointed to what's known as a \"beer poll,\" in which voters are polled to find out which candidate they'd rather get a drink with.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Written By Stephen A. Crockett Jr.\n\nIllustration by Jianan Liu, Photo: Getty Images, YouTube\n\nJan. 11, 2023\n\nI'm sure there was a tipping point, you know, a moment where conservatism ― the kind that former President Ronald Reagan championed ― called the police and claimed that some egregious act was preventing it from thriving. But we missed it, whenever it was. Now, the party of fiscal responsibility and limited government regulation has turned into the oppressive party that can't stop crying about how badly it's being trampled on.\n\nBecause conservative white people love them some wars.\n\nI'm not just talking about those grown men and women who dress up to recreate the war that they lost ― I'm talking about all of those who keep moaning about how they're losing the war that only they are fighting. To hear them tell it, America is under siege. Conservative whites are at war for their guns and their freedoms and their classified documents from inside Mar-a-Lago, which is the closest America will ever come to a lair. They are at war against \"wokeism\" and \"cancel culture\" and the dissolution of the white race. They are obsessed with the idea of oppression, and they're willing to create it when it doesn't exist.\n\nTake the Jan. 6 insurrectionist exhibit at the Conservative Political Action Conference in August, where a white man ― Brandon Straka, a former hairstylist turned Trumpish influencer ― was locked away in a fake jail cell of his own creation. That's not a metaphor. This was Straka's contribution to the movement: an artistic installment of sorts that featured Straka, barefoot in an orange jumpsuit, pacing around and weeping as onlookers prayed for his release.\n\n\"At this CPAC booth you receive a silent disco headset that plays harrowing testimony from the people arrested for participating in J6,\" journalist Laura Jedeed tweeted. \"Instead of dancing, you stand around and watch this guy cry.\"\n\n\"What I need you to understand is that I stood here for about half an hour yesterday and this guy NEVER broke character,\" she noted. \"He wept sitting on the bench. He wept sitting on the floor. He tallied days on a chalkboard set up for the purpose.\"\n\nAnd what no one yelled out is, \"Dude, stop crying! You aren't in jail! What are all you people praying for? This isn't real!\" If the entire conservative movement could be summed up in one artistic expression, it would be a white man crying in a phony jail cell inside a Dallas Hilton conference space.\n\nThe reality is that Straka was at the Capitol grounds during the 2021 insurrection, he participated in the failed coup attempt to overthrow the government, and when caught, he snitched on his fellow insurrectionists as part of a plea deal to avoid jail time .\n\nBut we cannot get stuck in the truth; it will merely muddy the waters. It's far more important to pay attention to the tears. That's the point of all of this: white tears. They are precious like butterfly wings and unicorn horns. They are paramount to the plight. They are what \"Karens\" use as both their first weapon and a last resort, and don't think for a second that the fake prisoner is not a Karen. He totally is.\n\nKarens have the duplicitous narrative of being both perpetrator and victim. They are the people who busy themselves trying to figure out why you are existing in \"their space,\" and they're deputized by their whiteness. They can stop, question, harass, condemn anyone who doesn't look like them, and when all else fails, they call the cops and cry. They literally are the people who lock themselves in a prison and weep because they can't get out. That's the Karen playbook, and sadly, the game ― which used to be a battle between \"Do good Democrats\" and \"Conservatives for Christ\" ― has become a battle of \"Maybe we're moderates?\" and \"Magical realism.\"\n\nThe Republican Party has moved so far away from reality that Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) became a rebel for merely acknowledging that then-President Donald Trump caused the insurrection at the Capitol, and for voting for his impeachment. She tried to steer the party away from the darkness, or at least from this particular form of it. Instead, the three-term congresswoman from one of the reddest states in the country lost the primary for her seat.\n\n\"I will do whatever it takes to ensure that Donald Trump is never anywhere near the Oval Office, and I mean it,\" Cheney said as she conceded the race. \"I love my country more.\"\n\nShowing up without a hat in a room full of people wearing tinfoil fedoras doesn't make you a martyr. It doesn't even make you just, or right. It only makes you the woman at the foil-chapeau meetup who forgot her headgear. But that's how far the Republican Party has fallen off the grid. Never forget that before her groundbreaking pivot to being a person who acknowledges the obvious, \" Cheney voted with Trump 93 percent of time . And when she broke with the former president, it was often to take more extreme positions ,\" John Nichols noted last year in a piece for The Nation .\n\nNichols continued: \"As a political operative and more recently as a leading Republican in Congress, Cheney established herself as a neoconservative warmonger whose crude attacks on immigrants, Muslims, and progressives carried the same venom as those of the most extreme members of her caucus - and of the 45th president, whose election in 2016 and reelection bid in 2020 she enthusiastically supported.\"\n\nSo she's been ousted for Harriet Hageman, an attorney who was heavily supported by Trump and all those who believe in his evil brand of governing. This is the Republican Party, where rational thinking is suspended for disbelief.\n\nWhen you say things like \"They're coming for our guns!\" it makes a way better rallying cry than the truth, which is: \"Too many guns are getting into the wrong hands, and we've got to create better gun laws to prevent this.\"\n\nConservatives have turned the push for commonsense gun laws into a war against the Second Amendment. Oh, how they yell and scream about their right to bear arms and how they won't let America stop them from carrying their assault weapons. After a number of mass shootings, President Joe Biden failed to ban the AR-15, a weapon created for times of war. Instead he \"signed into law the first major gun safety legislation passed in decades,\" which \"failed to ban any weapons, but... includes funding for school safety and state crisis intervention programs,\" as CNN put it.\n\nFor those keeping score, it looks like this:\n\nWhite Tears - 1\n\nAmerica - 0\n\nRemember when COVID-19 came through, ruining everything like a parent home early from vacation right when the party you weren't supposed to be having was in full swing? Well, one of the restrictions was that we had to wear a paper-thin mask over our faces or we'd run the risk of keeping this disease around longer than it needed to be. Conservatives made a joke out of the whole \"science\" thing. Professional full-time antagonizer and ostensible Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) showed up on the House floor wearing a gas mask . Conservatives pounced on Dr. Anthony Fauci, only the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, as if he were spouting conspiratorial misinformation. Ultimately, America loosened the mask mandate early because conservatives didn't like it. Hell, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and state Attorney General Ashley Moody filed a lawsuit claiming that Americans should travel without masks. In the end, white tears won, again.\n\nCurrently, conservatives are at war against what they call \"critical race theory\" - or as I like to call it, \"the fallout from all that hate that is left behind\" - being taught in schools. It makes Karens uncomfortable to hear that systemic racism, woven into our country's approach to things like housing and the criminal justice system, plays a huge part in the disenfranchisement of Black people in America today.\n\nKarens would have you believe they're currently at odds with a large group of minorities who don't get much sleep, and who keep talking about the ill effects of slavery. The Karens call them \"woke.\" Conservatives hate woke people. They want them admonished and persecuted for the crime of pointing out injustices in the Black community. Basically, conservatives are an all-white dinner party, and CRT and woke folks aren't their kind of conversation. It's trite and passé. And whatever you do, don't get them started on cancel culture. Oh, they will wax on about how they're unafraid of being canceled. They will stand up to the mythical tribe ready to unsubscribe to their brand of thinking. They will paint themselves as rebels willing to fight against the campaign to remove them from the American memory.\n\nWhat is conveniently missing in all of this, in all of these trumped-up \"Wag the Dog′′ scenarios, is that there would be no talk of critical race theory or wokeism or cancel culture if there had been no slavery, or if the U.S. justice system didn't lean so far to the right that it's a mystery how it stays up at all. But that would be like telling the white man who snitched on his Jan. 6 compadres, and then locked himself in a fake jail cell so he could play the role of the imprisoned, that he could simply walk out at any time because none of this is real. That would be breaking the illusion of injustice and the cosplay of oppression, and if that happens, then what would a Karen have to cry about? And more importantly, who would they fight against?\n\nBack To Hub Page"

      "text": "Trump Gets Brutal Fact-Check From Conservatives As Markets Tank Due To Tariffs\n\nDeputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a sweeping set of tariffs on nearly every other nation on the planet, causing markets to plunge in after-hours trading and triggering fears of inflation and a recession .\n\nAnd he was called out over it not just from his usual critics on the left, but even many conservatives, who spoke out on social media against the move.\n\nMany pointed out the tariffs were actually tax increases ― including Mike Pence , who served as Trump's vice president during his first term.\n\nHe wrote on X:\n\nThe Trump Tariff Tax is the largest peacetime tax hike in U.S. history. These Tariffs are nearly 10x the size of those imposed during the Trump-Pence Administration and will cost American families over $3,500 per year. Check Out\"Spoiling America's Golden Age\" @AmericanFreedom 👇 pic.twitter.com/2NghyDc8c1\n\nPence also tweeted:\n\n69% of Americans in this @FoxNews Poll are Right. Tariffs on imports will make products you buy more expensive. For more facts on Tariffs and Trade, check out this helpful summary by @AmericanFreedom 🇺🇸 https://t.co/DfjjfBSOvP pic.twitter.com/aKnwXxhFqs\n\nOthers on the right also put Trump on blast over the policy, which they noted would be paid for by American consumers:\n\nTariffs are taxes https://t.co/6lpQ15mCPF\n\nEven if you think Trump is right about this spectacular exercise in economic self harm, if you're a Republican politician, odds are strong that you disagreed with what he's claiming 10 years - and in some cases 10 hours - ago. Maybe you've been studying the flimsy protectionist...\n\nOne of the largest tax increases on Americans and done by fiat. Just wow.\n\nAre y'all seeing what's happening with overnight markets? Futures are signaling a rude awakening for #WallStreet and your 401(k) in the morning. So much for all that juiced up BS about \"the markets are getting certainty\" on this \"Liberation Day\". The only certainty is Congress... pic.twitter.com/u0RHYvS5og\n\n3.4% market plunge during the Trump's announcement of the largest peacetime tax hike in U.S. history.

Tariffs are taxes. pic.twitter.com/oeBcwkHJ5s\n\nThis was done in the name of working class populism, but there is no way in hell the working class voted for this. https://t.co/8R2sMyr4fb\n\nThe Republican Congress could end this nonsense tomorrow by simply yanking back *their* tariff power that previous congresses stupidly handed over to the president.

      "text": "Revisiting The Historical Ignorance Of Conservatives\n\nOne thing about having conservative friends: They sure do peddle a lot of ignorant nonsense. I shouldn't complain. It inspires me to write something, though I've been down this block before. Still, it's a subject worth revisiting.\n\nOn Monday, on the Juneteenth federal holiday, my friend sent me this tweet :\n\nFriendly reminder that #Juneteenth only exists because white Union soldiers had to go to Galveston, TX (two and a half years AFTER Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation) to ENFORCE freedom for slaves because democrat slave owners wouldn't have freed them otherwise.\n\nHere's a friendly reminder: \"Democrat\" is not an adjective; it's a noun. The correct word is \"Democratic,\" and it is capitalized. Most adjectives and nouns referring to the ideas, actions, documents and members of specific political parties, movements and groups are capitalized.\n\nRush Limbaugh popularized this grammatical blunder to suggest that Democrats are undemocratic. Conservatives should stop it. The attempt to score political points makes you sound more ignorant than you already are.\n\nTo no surprise, the author of the tweet describes himself as a member of the MAGA faithful and claims to be the founder of some right-wingnut YouTube channel. Great. Yet another platform to hawk his ignorance. He adds the aphorism, \" If God is for us, who can be against us? \" Well, ain't that deep, and said by no countryman of any country ever in the history of countries. EVER!\n\nAnd though he adds that his \"opinions are my own,\" the sad part is that plenty of people are stupid enough to think that anything he says is factual.\n\nWell, here's a friendly admonishment, buddy: Your historical account is crap. At best, it's inaccurate. Worse, it's flat-out wrong. Worst of all, it reinforces the sort of ignorance that conservatives might as well patent into a cottage industry. It's also the sort of ignorance that ultimately undermines a democratic society.\n\nLet's start with the holiday. Juneteenth honors the 1865 emancipation of about 250,000 slaves in Galveston, Texas, who had been unaware of the Emancipation Proclamation that President Abraham Lincoln had signed two years earlier, declaring freedom for all slaves.\n\nGen. Gordon Granger, who was white, led Union troops to the Galveston harbor on June 17, 1865. Those troops included more than 10,000 Black soldiers of the U.S. Colored Troops, as they were called then.\n\nTwo days later, Granger issued what is known as General Order No. 3, notifying the people of Texas that all slaves were free, declaring \"absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves.\" That is what Juneteenth celebrates.\n\nIf you believe in our nation's founding principles, if you respect the contributions of Lincoln, considered by many to be our nation's greatest president, then you would agree that Juneteenth is not just African American history, it is American history.\n\nAs an aside, it's ironic that Lincoln, so instrumental in pursuing \"absolute equality,\" no longer has his own holiday. I have always been puzzled by combining his and George Washington's birthdays into a single holiday.\n\nJuneteenth became a federal holiday in 2021. But the holiday, now behind us until next year, is not my primary focus here.\n\nHow many times have we heard a conservative disparage Democrats by pointing out that they were the party of slave owners and that Republicans were the party of freedom?\n\nLike many of today's Republicans with a limited grasp of history, our tweet author doesn't get it. Or maybe he gets it too well. By describing the slave owners in Texas as Democrats who \"wouldn't have freed them otherwise,\" he's taking a cheap shot at the Democrats of today.\n\nHe mistakes the name for ideology. What he misses, or what he intentionally refuses to explain, is that the Democrats of that era were the conservatives of that era. The Republicans of that era were the liberals.\n\nDemocrats in the South continued to harbor these racist tendencies that grew out of the Civil War South until the 1960s, when President Lyndon Johnson, a Texan, steered the Civil Rights Act into law. Longtime Democrats who were always conservatives inevitably switched parties and became Republicans, something exploited by Richard Nixon when he ran for president in 1968, what political scientists refer to as the Southern Strategy. Party philosophy didn't change; only the name did. You're going to tell me you'll be a different person after you legally change your name?\n\nIt's the ideology that matters, and that has never changed. Conservatives were always of the ideology that fought to keep slavery, and while many conservatives today are not racists, if you are a racist, you are likely conservative in your ideology and Republican in your party allegiance. Liberals were always abolitionists, opposed to slavery and for the Civil War Amendments, the 13th, 14th and 15th. Liberals are not perfect and never were, but in the broadest sense, the only prejudice they harbor is prejudice toward ignorance and liars. Especially the manipulative liars whose only purpose is to continue fostering ignorance.\n\nVariants of the \"history repeats itself\" theme are as common as debates about its attribution. \"Those who don't know history are destined to repeat it.\" Irish statesman Edmund Burke is often misquoted as having said that. British statesman Winston Churchill also is often miscredited with writing, \"Those that fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.\" Spanish philosopher George Santayana is actually responsible for the famous saying \"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it,\" having written it in the closing section of \"The Life of Reason.\"\n\nSadly, today's Republican lawmakers are trying to whitewash American history and reality itself by censuring Advanced Placement courses , banning books or rewriting high school and middle school studies to create a history they like rather than a history that is. The most recent effort is occurring in Idaho , which is introducing a new curriculum for students starting this fall.\n\nIn a news release , Gov. Brad Little described the program as \"a picture of America that aligns with our Idaho values of embracing patriotism and a sense of pride about the success of our great country and it teaches American history in a fair and factual way.\"\n\nThat's a lot of words for whitewashing. Stuff like this is why the only thing I worry about from Idaho is potatoes.\n\nHow did this come about? Lawmakers traveling the state during the 2022 election season said they heard from voters concerned that an anti-American ideology they felt they were seeing nationally might make it into Idaho classrooms. They were unhappy with American history \"not being portrayed in a respectful way.\"\n\nRespectful? How about honest? How about an honest rendering of our history? Is that too much to ask?\n\nApparently it is. An honest rendition of history \"hurts my feelings.\" Once again, the true snowflakes in our society are these wimpy conservatives. They love to talk tough but constantly prove they're a bunch of pansies. As Jack Nicholson's character said in \"A Few Good Men\": \"You can't handle the truth.\"\n\nBeyond that, how idiotic is it to give credence to people with no professional background in education, let alone an honest grasp of history, the power to determine how we're going to educate our children?\n\nAll nations have had their share of awkward and regrettable moments in history. Honorable nations accept and acknowledge their past, including the less flattering parts, so they may learn from their mistakes. However, Idaho seems to be avoiding this practice by replacing history with propaganda to mask its fear of the truth.\n\nAre the people offended (or just annoyed) by the idea of a Juneteenth holiday analogous to those who might oppose observing Holocaust Remembrance Day?\n\nIn Germany, each of the 16 federal states set their own curricula, but they are uniform in their teaching of the Holocaust. It is mandatory in history and civics classes and typically gets covered in literature and religion lessons. It can even turn up in biology, art and music classes. At some point, most schoolchildren will visit a concentration camp. In Germany, understanding that history is seen as necessary to prevent such horrors from happening again.\n\nBut if we applied the mindset of your typical conservative American snowflake to that curriculum, imagine the outrage. Parents would revolt, screaming at school board meetings that such a visit would be inappropriate. They'd cry to lawmakers running for reelection that it was anti-American and not portraying American history in a \"respectful way.\" It's too negative! It makes our country look bad! It hurts my feelings! And, of course, spineless lawmakers would cave and force educators to change the curriculum.\n\nSo, is blissful ignorance a better path?\n\nA 2018 survey found that 1 in 20 Europeans had never heard of the Holocaust. A third said they knew \"little or nothing\" about it. One-quarter of millennials in France said they had not heard of it. More than half of Austrians didn't know that the Nazis exterminated 6 million Jews in the Holocaust. In the United States, a similar survey found that two-thirds of millennials did not know what Auschwitz was.\n\nCan you imagine a survey 75 years hence finding two-thirds of Americans unable to explain 9/11? We made many mistakes before the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Would it have been better to ignore those mistakes, pretend they didn't happen, risk missing warning signs and suffer another attack?\n\nBut we have done so regarding slavery's place in American history. Our failure to acknowledge it has played a significant role in formulating American public policy. Juneteenth is a microcosm of that failure. For two years, slave owners failed ― more likely refused ― to acknowledge the dictates of the Emancipation Proclamation, thus maintaining the defunct policy of legal slavery.\n\nOhio State University history professor Hasan Kwame Jeffries writes :\n\nWhen slavery ended, white Southerners carried the mindsets of enslavers with them into the post-emancipation period, creating new exploitative labor arrangements such as sharecropping, new disenfranchisement mechanisms including literacy tests, and new discriminatory social systems, namely Jim Crow. It took African Americans more than a century to eliminate these legal barriers to equality, but that has not been enough to erase race-based disparities in every aspect of American life, from education and employment to wealth and well-being. Public policies tend to treat this racial inequality as a product of poor personal decision-making, rather than acknowledging it as the result of racialized systems and structures that restrict choice and limit opportunity. Understanding American slavery is vital to understanding racial inequality today.\n\nWhy should we consider it anti-American to acknowledge that our Founding Fathers were also slave owners? Our acknowledgment presents an opportunity to ponder the complexities, moral dilemmas and contradictions of men who crafted the Bill of Rights, a document that by its very nature condemns the lifestyles of its crafters.\n\nWhat compromises did the delegates of the Several States have to make to establish and enshrine the 10 Amendments in the Bill of Rights, not only to each other but also to themselves?\n\nWe complain, rightly, that today's lawmakers behave hypocritically. They couldn't hold a candle to the Framers, yet the behavior of those Founding Fathers, steeped in the writings of Greek philosophers and Enlightenment thinkers, could just as readily be called into question. Imagine asking James Madison, \"Dude, you practically wrote the Bill of Rights; how could you also be the same guy who owned slaves?\"\n\n\"The point is not to teach American history as a chronicle of shame and oppression,\" writes Yale University history professor David Blight, but \"to tell American history as a story of real human beings, of power, of vast economic and geographical expansion, of great achievements as well as great dispossession, of human brutality and human reform. The point is also not to merely seek the story of what we are not, but of what we are.\"\n\nAnd often, who we are is who we were, but acknowledging who we were, both the good and the bad, allows us the chance to be better at who we are and who we can be.\n\nHistory is complicated, just as people are complicated. And rarely do either fit neatly into the comfortable pigeonholes some of us create for ourselves. The ugly parts of our history may sound anti-American to the thin-skinned among us, but our insistent fondness for a sanitized history will lead us to continue the mores of our past or repeat the mistakes of the past, be it the crafting of bad public policy or bad public (and private) behavior.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Conservatives Plot To Dismantle U.S. Government, Replace With Trump's Vision\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - With more than a year to go before the 2024 election , a constellation of conservative organizations is preparing for a possible second White House term for Donald Trump , recruiting thousands of Americans to come to Washington on a mission to dismantle the federal government and replace it with a vision closer to his own.\n\nLed by the long-established Heritage Foundation think tank and fueled by former Trump administration officials, the far-reaching effort is essentially a government-in-waiting for the former president's second term - or any candidate who aligns with their ideals and can defeat President Joe Biden in 2024.\n\nWith a nearly 1,000-page \"Project 2025\" handbook and an \"army\" of Americans, the idea is to have the civic infrastructure in place on Day One to commandeer, reshape and do away with what Republicans deride as the \"deep state\" bureaucracy, in part by firing as many as 50,000 federal workers.\n\n\"We need to flood the zone with conservatives,\" said Paul Dans, director of the 2025 Presidential Transition Project and a former Trump administration official who speaks with historical flourish about the undertaking.\n\n\"This is a clarion call to come to Washington,\" he said. \"People need to lay down their tools, and step aside from their professional life and say, 'This is my lifetime moment to serve.'\"\n\nThe unprecedented effort is being orchestrated with dozens of right-flank organizations, many new to Washington, and represents a changed approach from conservatives, who traditionally have sought to limit the federal government by cutting federal taxes and slashing federal spending .\n\nInstead, Trump-era conservatives want to gut the \"administrative state\" from within, by ousting federal employees they believe are standing in the way of the president's agenda and replacing them with like-minded officials more eager to fulfill a new executive's approach to governing.\n\nThe goal is to avoid the pitfalls of Trump's first years in office, when the Republican president's team was ill-prepared, his Cabinet nominees had trouble winning Senate confirmation and policies were met with resistance - by lawmakers, government workers and even Trump's own appointees who refused to bend or break protocol, or in some cases violate laws, to achieve his goals.\n\nWhile many of the Project 2025 proposals are inspired by Trump, they are being echoed by GOP rivals Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy and are gaining prominence among other Republicans.\n\nAnd if Trump wins a second term, the work from the Heritage coalition ensures the president will have the personnel to carry forward his unfinished White House business.\n\n\"The president Day One will be a wrecking ball for the administrative state,\" said Russ Vought, a former Trump administration official involved in the effort who is now president at the conservative Center for Renewing America.\n\nMuch of the new president's agenda would be accomplished by reinstating what's called Schedule F - a Trump-era executive order that would reclassify tens of thousands of the 2 million federal employees as essentially at-will workers who could more easily be fired.\n\nBiden had rescinded the executive order upon taking office in 2021, but Trump - and other presidential hopefuls - now vow to reinstate it.\n\n\"It frightens me,\" said Mary Guy, a professor of public administration at the University of Colorado Denver, who warns the idea would bring a return to a political spoils system.\n\nExperts argue Schedule F would create chaos in the civil service, which was overhauled during President Jimmy Carter's administration in an attempt to ensure a professional workforce and end political bias dating from 19th century patronage.\n\nAs it now stands, just 4,000 members of the federal workforce are considered political appointees who typically change with each administration. But Schedule F could put tens of thousands of career professional jobs at risk.\n\n\"We have a democracy that is at risk of suicide. Schedule F is just one more bullet in the gun,\" Guy said.\n\nThe ideas contained in Heritage's coffee table-ready book are both ambitious and parochial, a mix of longstanding conservative policies and stark, head-turning proposals that gained prominence in the Trump era.\n\nThere's a \"top to bottom overhaul\" of the Department of Justice, particularly curbing its independence and ending FBI efforts to combat the spread of misinformation. It calls for stepped-up prosecution of anyone providing or distributing abortion pills by mail.\n\nThere are proposals to have the Pentagon \"abolish\" its recent diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, what the project calls the \"woke\" agenda, and reinstate service members discharged for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nChapter by chapter, the pages offer a how-to manual for the next president, similar to one Heritage produced 50 years ago, ahead of the Ronald Reagan administration. Authored by some of today's most prominent thinkers in the conservative movement, it's often sprinkled with apocalyptic language.\n\nA chapter written by Trump's former acting deputy secretary of Homeland Security calls for bolstering the number of political appointees, and redeploying office personnel with law enforcement ability into the field \"to maximize law enforcement capacity.\"\n\nAt the White House, the book suggests the new administration should \"reexamine\" the tradition of providing work space for the press corps and ensure the White House counsel is \"deeply committed\" to the president's agenda.\n\nConservatives have long held a grim view of federal government offices, complaining they are stacked with liberals intent on halting Republican agendas.\n\nBut Doreen Greenwald, national president of the National Treasury Employees Union, said most federal workers live in the states and are your neighbors, family and friends. \"Federal employees are not the enemy,\" she said.\n\nWhile presidents typically rely on Congress to put policies into place, the Heritage project leans into what legal scholars refer to as a unitary view of executive power that suggests the president has broad authority to act alone.\n\nTo push past senators who try to block presidential Cabinet nominees, Project 2025 proposes installing top allies in acting administrative roles, as was done during the Trump administration to bypass the Senate confirmation process.\n\nJohn McEntee, another former Trump official advising the effort, said the next administration can \"play hardball a little more than we did with Congress.\"\n\nIn fact, Congress would see its role diminished - for example, with a proposal to eliminate congressional notification on certain foreign arms sales.\n\nPhilip Wallach, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who studies the separation of powers and was not part of the Heritage project, said there's a certain amount of \"fantasizing\" about the president's capabilities.\n\n\"Some of these visions, they do start to just bleed into some kind of authoritarian fantasies where the president won the election, so he's in charge, so everyone has to do what he says - and that's just not the system the government we live under,\" he said.\n\nAt the Heritage office, Dans has a faded photo on his wall of an earlier era in Washington, with the White House situated almost alone in the city, dirt streets in all directions.\n\nIt's an image of what conservatives have long desired, a smaller federal government.\n\nThe Heritage coalition is taking its recruitment efforts on the road, crisscrossing America to fill the federal jobs. They staffed the Iowa State Fair this month and signed up hundreds of people, and they're building out a database of potential employees, inviting them to be trained in government operations.\n\n\"It's counterintuitive,\" Dans acknowledged - the idea of joining government to shrink it - but he said that's the lesson learned from the Trump days about what's needed to \"regain control.\"\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Jerry Seinfeld And Conservatives Want To Make America Masculine Again\n\nRecently, comedian Jerry Seinfeld publicly mourned the societal loss of \"dominant masculinity\" during an appearance on the \"Honestly With Bari Weiss\" podcast.\n\n\"I miss dominant masculinity,\" the actor said, referring to the days of yesteryear when \"an agreed-upon hierarchy\" reigned supreme, helmed by \"real men\" like John F. Kennedy Jr., Muhammad Ali, Sean Connery and Howard Cosell.\n\n\"Yeah, I get the toxic [masculinity], but still, I like a real man,\" Seinfield added.\n\nThe comedian's remarks are hardly original - in fact, lamenting the so-called extinction of the virile dude brah bro man is a conservative staple. In his final address on the U.S. House floor, Madison Cawthorn - who lost his reelection bid in the 2022 after a slew of controversies - begged young men to \"reclaim your masculinity,\" saying that in the United States \"young men are taught that weakness is strength, that delicacy is desirable and that being a soft metrosexual is more valuable than training the mind, body and soul.\"\n\nFormer Fox News host Tucker Carlson ran a special titled \"The End of Men.\" Republican Sen. Rick Scott issued \"An 11 Point Plan to Rescue America\" that included \"men are men, women are women.\" Hell, insurrectionist supporter and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley wrote an entire book on the subject, aptly titled \"Manhood: The Masculine Virtues America Needs.\" In it, the Missouri lawmaker argued that being a \"real man\" means being equal parts husband, father, warrior, builder, priest and king.\n\nUm, OK.\n\nHawley's Mad Libs-like definition of masculinity notwithstanding, rarely are the men pining for a resurgence of red-blooded machismo able to adequately articulate what a \"real man\" actually is, or more importantly why they think their version of manhood has gone by the wayside.\n\nIs a \"real man\" a human with the social intelligence of a gnat, who confuses vulnerability with weakness, asking for help with failure, and crying with an innate, personal shortcoming? As the Anxiety & Depression Association of America points out, toxic masculinity encourages men to oppose mental health treatment, causing a possible increase in rates of depression, trauma, anxiety, isolation, and even suicidal ideation among men overall.\n\nThe same political party that is quick to blame poor mental health - and not easy access to weapons of war - for the frequency of mass shootings in America is actively championing harmful stereotypes that make men less likely to seek mental health treatment .\n\nMaybe this \"real man\" is the one suffering from a \"friendship recession\" and, as a result, is lonely. According to a 2023 State of American Men report from Equimundo: Center for Masculinities and Social Justice, two-thirds of men ages 18 to 23 say \"no one really knows me.\" A 2021 study by the Survey Center on American Life found that, since 1990, the number of men who say they do not have a single close friend has increased fivefold - now, 1 in 5 unmarried men say they have no close friends at all.\n\nStudies have shown men in general are less emotionally intelligent and empathetic than women - perhaps that is Seinfeld's masculinity in practice. Women are more likely than men to be victims of intimate partner violence - maybe that's the contribution to society for Hawley's \"warrior man.\"\n\nThen again, maybe all of these silly little things like statistics and studies are beyond the pale for those who actively peddle conspiracy theories while denying reality and science.\n\nPerhaps we only have to look as far as Hawley himself, the \"warrior\" who defiantly raised his fist in a salute to a violent mob of insurrectionists only to later flee like a coward from those same insurrectionists as they stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Unlike true hero and former Washington, D.C., police officer Michael Fanone - who almost died while defending the Capitol that day - Hawley displayed his \"manhood\" by selling campaign merchandise, including a coffee mug highlighting his infamous fist pump and the phrase \"Show-Me Strong.\"\n\nOr maybe we should simply rely on Seinfeld's latest example of virility - constantly complaining about \"political correctness\" and how \"difficult\" it has made life for wealthy comics such as himself. In an April interview with The New Yorker , Seinfeld claimed funny television simply doesn't exist anymore, despite wildly successful, envelope-pushing shows like \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" and \"Veep\" (just to name a few).\n\n\"This is the result of the extreme left and PC crap and people worrying so much about offending other people,\" he said of today's television programming. In response, his former co-star and longtime friend Julia Louis-Dreyfus told The New York Times such comments are a \"red flag.\"\n\n\"I believe being aware of certain sensitivities is not a bad thing,\" she continued. \"I don't know how else to say it.\" Apparently for Seinfeld, that awareness runs antithetical to the manliness of years gone by.\n\nWhether it's simply looking at the faulty examples from the wannabe bastions of masculinity, or taking a gander at a society still dominated by patriarchy, if all this constitutes the uber-conservative's version of a \"real man,\" it's clear that's very much alive and well.\n\nMisogyny, toxic masculinity, harmful stereotypes of manhood - they all remain a bulwark of American society, American politics and American culture. It's why more than half the population lost the constitutional right to nationwide abortion access and bodily autonomy, why white men still make up the majority of lawmakers in this country, and why the U.S. has yet to elect a woman president.\n\nAnd it's why, in mere months, voters will decide whether a convicted felon found liable for sexual abuse who encouraged a violent insurrection to overthrow a free and fair election will, if you can believe it, return to the White House.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

A growing number of groups that Heritage previously listed as part of the effort's advisory board are jumping ship, and even some whose staff helped craft Project 2025.\n\nThe Intercept's review of the Project 2025 website identified seven conservative organizations that have been removed from the advisory board member list since Heritage first announced it two years ago . Among these are four newly identified groups, including the Competitive Enterprise Institute, an influential think tank.\n\nAs of publication, the Project 2025 website lists more than 100 organizations as part of the \"broad coalition\" that helped shape the effort alongside Heritage. This coalition morphed over the last two years, The Intercept found, including by quiet attrition of some prominent members. Some dropped off the website even before the Trump campaign started distancing itself from Project 2025 in early July.\n\nWe traced the timeline of vanishing advisers by comparing Heritage press releases, the Project 2025 playbook, data pulled from the website, and archived versions of the advisory board page.\n\nIn June 2022, Heritage announced that it had formed an advisory board of \"leading conservative partners\" for Project 2025, which had 21 organizations. Of these original members, three are no longer on the Project 2025 website. This includes two newly identified influential libertarian groups - the now-defunct FreedomWorks and the Competitive Enterprise Institute - plus Stephen Miller's America First Legal Foundation, as previously reported .\n\nIn February 2024, FreedomWorks was the first to disappear from the Project 2025 advisory board page. Three months later, in May, FreedomWorks dissolved very publicly , but it continued its policy advocacy up to its final gasps.\n\nWhen Heritage released the Project 2025 playbook in April 2023, it listed FreedomWorks as part of the advisory board, as did press releases in May 2023 and last October . Three former FreedomWorks staffers contributed to the Project 2025 manifesto, including Stephen Moore, an economist and former Trump adviser, who co-authored the Treasury Department chapter.\n\nFormer FreedomWorks leaders did not respond to inquiries about the group's removal from the Project 2025 page prior to its dissolution.\n\nThe Competitive Enterprise Institute, which did not respond to The Intercept's questions, was also acknowledged in the Project 2025 playbook. Its president and CEO, Kent Lassman, contributed a chapter, as did Daren Bakst, a CEI senior fellow. A handful of other CEI staff were also contributors, including its general counsel Dan Greenberg, and Iain Murray, vice president for strategy.\n\nLast August, economist and columnist Paul Krugman specifically called out CEI in his review of Project 2025's effort to recast climate change as a culture war issue.\n\n\"Project 2025 appears to have been largely devised by the usual suspects,\" Krugman wrote in the New York Times, \"fossil-fueled think tanks like the Heartland Institute and the Competitive Enterprise Institute that have been crusading against climate science and climate action for many years.\" CEI's website has a clip of Krugman's takedown .\n\nQuite recently, CEI staffers trumpeted their involvement in Project 2025. In a January 2024 speech at Heritage, Murray said he was \"delighted to contribute\" to the \"deregulatory proposals.\"\n\n\"There's a blueprint for a better tomorrow,\" Murray said. In a February blog post , CEI economist Ryan Young, who got a shoutout in the playbook, pointed to Project 2025 as an example of \"a successful approach to trade policy.\"\n\nHeritage continued to list CEI in Project 2025 press releases as recently as February 2024 , and CEI remained on the online list of advisory board members until early March 2024 . By March 15 , CEI's logo had been removed from the web page.\n\nThe next week, Heritage added a disclaimer to the Project 2025 page.\n\n\"The opinions of Project 2025 and The Heritage Foundation do not necessarily represent the opinions of every one of its advisory board partners,\" it reads. The disclaimer apparently didn't stanch the flow.\n\nBy late March, another group dropped off the page: the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a hawkish foreign policy think tank that seemed confused at why it was on Project 2025 lists in the first place. FDD was not in the inaugural advisory board cohort, but Heritage included it in the Project 2025 playbook and in press releases from May 2023 until this February.\n\nFDD appeared on the online advisory board list as recently as March 15 .\n\n\"FDD was included in error,\" a spokesperson told The Intercept. \"This was quickly corrected once known to us.\"\n\nFDD did not answer follow-up questions about how it failed to notice its inclusion in the Project 2025 playbook and advisory board lists for nearly a year.\n\nIn late June, the Discovery Institute, a think tank focused on \"intelligent design\" and \"Judeo-Christian culture,\" among other concepts, also disappeared from the Project 2025 site. The Discovery Institute, which did not respond to The Intercept's questions, was first announced as part of the advisory board in a February 2024 press release. Its logo was on the Project 2025 website as recently as June 25 , but by June 28, it was gone .\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you.

Both groups disappeared from the website at some point between Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday, and both were first listed as members in a February 2024 press release.\n\nNeither elaborated in detail on their reasons for exiting the Project 2025 coalition.\n\n\"Being listed on an advisory board indicated that we endorsed everything listed in the project, which was not the case,\" said Holly Wetzel of the Mackinac Center. \"We do not sign our name to things that we do not fully endorse.\"\n\nWetzel did not respond to follow-up questions about how the Mackinac Center ended up on the Project 2025 advisory board list in the first place.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation did not respond to emailed questions.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "As Immigration Plummeted, Conservatives Falsely Accused Biden of Fueling a Crisis\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nRarely has such a long-running and widely accepted political and media narrative been so at odds with reality.\n\nRep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, speaks during a news conference with members of the House Freedom Caucus about immigration on the U.S.-Mexico border outside the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on March 17, 2021.\n\nThroughout 2021, Republican politicians and conservative pundits hammered the Biden administration over what they claimed was a crisis of uncontrolled immigration.\n\nImages of migrants seeking to cross the border from Mexico in the early months of the new administration, which played in a seemingly endless loop on cable news, led to growing acceptance on the right of the \"great replacement\" conspiracy theory, claiming that President Joe Biden was throwing open the nation's borders to nonwhite immigrants who would steal white Americans' jobs - and vote for Democrats. The Anti-Defamation League called for Fox News to fire pundit Tucker Carlson last year because he espoused the \"great replacement\" theory so aggressively and so often, but the racist trope has now become normalized within the Republican Party.\n\nEven the mainstream press bought into the idea that there was a massive surge in illegal immigration and that Biden was mishandling the issue.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nBut rarely has such a long-running and widely accepted political and media narrative been so at odds with reality. In fact, immigration into the United States in 2021 plunged as a result of both a decline in international travel brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic and restrictive U.S. immigration policies, according to new report from the Census Bureau. The nation's political and media classes were seemingly so obsessed over the images of migrants at the border that they failed to grasp the truth, which was that immigration levels collapsed in 2021.\n\nThe startling Census Bureau report found that net international migration into the United States increased by just 247,000 people in 2021, the lowest annual level for any year since at least 2010. That's about half the number of people who came into the country between 2019 and 2020, during the Trump administration, when net international migration totaled 477,000. The 2021 figure was also far below the 1,049,000 who came into the U.S. between 2015 and 2016, the highest level for any year in that decade.\n\nIn 2021, the global movement of people was drastically cut by travel restrictions put in place by governments around the world as a result of the pandemic. Land borders between the United States, Mexico, and Canada were closed to nonessential travel for part of the year, along with many U.S. embassies and consulates abroad, where foreigners get visas to come here.\n\n\"The Covid-19 pandemic significantly impacted international migration patterns both to and from the United States,\" according to the report, which is one of the government's first studies of 2021 immigration levels.\n\nThe Census Bureau's findings are based on a comprehensive annual survey of more than 3 million households in the United States. To determine immigration levels, the bureau's American Community Survey asks where each person surveyed was living one year ago. Those who are foreign-born were also asked what year they came to live in the United States.\n\nA Census Bureau analyst said in an interview that the annual survey is designed to detect changes in the levels of both documented and undocumented immigration. In order to get more responses to the survey among undocumented immigrants, the bureau does not ask whether each person is in the country legally. \"We make the assumption that the American Community Survey is picking up the undocumented,\" said the Census Bureau analyst, who asked not to be identified so he could speak freely.\n\nTo improve the survey's accuracy, the bureau supplemented its results with data from other agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department, the Justice Department, and the Department of Transportation. (The pandemic also impacted the Census Bureau's ability to collect data, especially in 2020, so it relied heavily on adjusted 2019 data to compare against 2021.)\n\nMigrants hold a demonstration demanding clearer United States migration policies at the San Ysidro Port of Entry in Tijuana, Mexico, on March 2, 2021.\n\nThe Census Bureau's report on immigration levels in 2021 was issued in late December, but it has received little media attention. That may be because the dramatic reduction in immigration in 2021 that it found is in sharp contrast to the narrative created early last year by conservative politicians and the press that immigration was out of control.\n\nThe media fixation on an immigration \"crisis\" began right after Biden took office, just at the moment when journalists were eager to prove that they could be tough on the new Democratic president after four years of Donald Trump. Questions about the immigration dominated Biden's first formal press conference in March.\n\n\"The situation at our southern border provides a perfect platform for [journalists] to show their even-handedness,\" Heather Digby Parton wrote in Salon last March. \"Unfortunately, as with most such media moments, it's not even-handed in the least.\"\n\nIn fact, a Pew Research Center study found that a supposed immigration \"crisis\" was one of the most heavily covered issues by the press in the early days of the Biden administration. The Pew study, released last May, found that immigration was one of the five topics most covered by 25 major news outlets in the first 60 days of the Biden administration, accounting for 11 percent of all stories. It was also the issue that generated the most negative coverage of the administration of any of the top five issues covered, Pew found. About half the stories about the Biden administration's handling of immigration were negative, compared with just 15 percent that were positive. Pew also conducted a related survey to see how Americans' media intake influenced how much they heard about the Biden administration's immigration policy. The survey found that 30 percent of all U.S. adults said they had heard a lot about the administration's immigration policies, while 45 percent of those who only got their political news from right-wing media said they had heard a lot about it.\n\nIn addition to the images of migrants on cable news, the skewed and ill-informed public debate on immigration in 2021 was stoked by a focus on misleading data. The key figure consistently cited by politicians and the media last year was the number of apprehensions along the southwestern border. That figure hit 1.7 million in fiscal year 2021, the highest level in 60 years, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security. That surge in border apprehensions became the key talking point for critics who argued that the Biden administration had lost control over immigration.\n\nBut the data on border apprehensions only showed how many times migrants were stopped when they tried to get into the United States. A Homeland Security official said in an interview that the numbers are misleading because one migrant may try to cross the border several times and thus would show up repeatedly in the total figures, inflating the numbers.\n\nIronically, one factor making it possible for migrants to keep trying to cross so many times is the government's use of a pandemic-related border restriction that was first put in place by the Trump administration and has continued under Biden. Citing Covid-19, the government has used a public health statute, known as Title 42 , to carry out expulsions of migrants at the border without offering them the chance to request asylum. Title 42 expulsions happen so fast that migrants can try to cross again almost immediately.\n\nThe data on apprehensions also doesn't show how many migrants actually got into the United States and were allowed to stay.\n\nThere is no current data on how many migrants who were apprehended trying to cross the border in 2021 have been allowed to permanently stay in the United States, the Homeland Security official said. But the official pointed to the department's \"enforcement lifecycle reports\" from earlier years, which show that most migrants crossing the border are eventually sent home. A 2020 Homeland Security report found that of 3.5 million \"encounters\" on the southwestern border between 2014 and 2019, 51 percent of the migrants had already been repatriated, while only 8.1 percent, or 284,000, from that five-year period had been granted relief or other protection from removal.\n\nThe obsession over the border apprehension data led politicians and journalists to completely miss the fact that overall immigration cratered during Biden's first year in office.\n\nA \"Now Hiring\" sign outside a gas station amid record job openings in the U.S. is seen in Seymour, Ind., on Dec. 6, 2021.\n\nLast year's plunging immigration levels came at the same time as declining birth rates and rising mortality rates in the U.S.\n\nThe combination of low levels of immigration, a low birth rate, and a higher mortality rate - trends worsened by the pandemic - resulted in the slowest population growth for the United States in any year since the founding of the nation, the Census Bureau found in another new study . The U.S. population grew by only 0.1 percent in 2021, the lowest rate the Census Bureau has ever recorded. It was the first time since 1937, in the midst of the Great Depression, that America's population grew by less than 1 million, the Census Bureau found.\n\nSharply reduced immigration and low overall population growth come at the same time as a major labor shortage in the United States. The onset of the pandemic initially led to enormous job losses in 2020 as many businesses went into lockdown. A devastating recession was avoided, however, thanks to the government's stimulus packages and the Federal Reserve's easy monetary policy. The government's aggressive fiscal and monetary pump-priming helped bring about a quick economic recovery and soaring demand for labor in 2021.\n\nBut in what has been nicknamed the \"Great Resignation,\" many people have not returned to the workforce. In an analysis of economic data, the Washington Post reported last month that 3.5 million fewer people are now employed than two years ago, but only about half of them are currently looking for a job. Many are older workers who decided during the pandemic to take early retirement.\n\nThe combination of more job openings and fewer workers has forced companies to offer higher wages. Yet the labor shortage has persisted, leading to worsening supply chain problems and higher prices.\n\nLow immigration is making the labor shortage worse. There are now about 2 million fewer immigrants of working age than would have been expected before 2020, according to Giovanni Peri and Reem Zaiour, economists at the University of California, Davis. In an article published this month, they estimated that nearly 1 million of those \"lost\" immigrants would have been college-educated.\n\nThe steep drop in \"immigrant and nonimmigrant visa arrivals resulted in zero growth in working-age foreign-born people in the United States,\" they wrote.\n\n2022 may finally bring stability. In late 2021, there were some signs, particularly in government data about visa applications and international flights, that immigration levels were bouncing back from the stark lows earlier in the year. \"In the publicly available visa data that we have been monitoring in recent months, we've seen immigration levels higher,\" the Census Bureau analyst said. \"We've seen visa data start to return to pre-pandemic levels, and airline international passenger counts are returning to pre-pandemic levels.\" Whether the ongoing omicron variant wave of the Covid-19 pandemic will once again lead to a plunge in immigration is yet to be determined.\n\nBut the toxic, anti-immigrant political climate in the United States - underscored by right-wing conspiracy theories like the \"great replacement\" - will make it exceedingly difficult to significantly increase immigration levels in order to ease labor shortages. Today conservatives loudly complain about inflation and supply chain woes, but their xenophobic fears seem to blind them to the economic and social dangers that can arise from chronically low levels of immigration.\n\nIn fact, the nationalist, anti-immigrant policies of the Republican Party are now dividing it from many of its traditional corporate supporters. To address the labor shortage, supply chain problems, and rising prices, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce - long a GOP stalwart - called earlier this month for a doubling of legal immigration. The fight over immigration could soon become a proxy for a broader war between the new, nationalist base of the Republican Party and its more traditional supporters in the business community.\n\nWAIT!

If you want proof, look no further than a major campaign underway in conservative circles around a new ethics rule that could undercut the power of the Federalist Society. Haven't heard of it? That's the point.\n\nThe rule change, which was proposed by the ethical advisory arm of the federal judiciary and began circulating in January, would ban judges from being members of groups like the Federalist Society, the right-wing legal group that has been central to Trump's transformation of the courts, and the American Constitution Society, a liberal legal group. It wouldn't affect the ability to attend and participate in Federalist Society and American Constitution Society panels and events; the proposal simply says that active membership in these organizations is inconsistent with a judge's ethical obligations.

You're not seeing individual senators speak out about this like you have on the right, you're not seeing coordinated efforts from progressive media outlets the way the right has done with the Wall Street Journal editorial board and National Review and the usual cast of characters that swoop in to document any little development on judicial stuff on the right.\"\n\nOn May 5, the Wall Street Journal Editorial Board published a second op-ed about the draft ethics rule, arguing that the ethics committee is being used as a political weapon against Justin Walker - a 37-year-old federal judge nominated to a seat on the second most powerful court in the United States, and a Federalist Society member. Walker has joined hundreds of federal judges, and the entire conservative legal establishment, in trying to kill the draft ethics rule . The outlet noted that their previous editorials, which have been sounding the alarm on the draft ethics rule, \"echoed in the judicial community,\" resulting with \"what we're told are more than 70 letters to the Codes of Conduct Committee.\"\n\nTwenty-nine Republican senators, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, sent a letter to the chair of the Committee on Codes of Conduct in March, urging they \"withdraw this flawed draft opinion.\" Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., in a statement from his office, told National Review that it's \"wrong to target the Federalist Society,\" calling the draft rule the \"product of liberal smear campaign that will erode confidence in an independent and fair Judiciary.\" Democratic senators, for the most part, have made no effort to publicly defend the rule or weigh in on the debate.\n\nTrump's steady transformation of the courts will almost certainly be his most enduring legacy , and the Federalist Society has played an instrumental role. With the help of Senate Republicans, and at times, Democrats, Trump has been filling federal judicial vacancies at breakneck speed, with the youngest, most conservative (and in many cases, unqualified) judges he can find. Since entering office, Trump has appointed 193 federal judges, including two Supreme Court justices and 51 judges to federal appeals courts. \"We're going to have great judges, conservative, all picked by the Federalist Society,\" he told Breitbart as a presidential candidate in 2016. According to a New York Times analysis , all but eight of these 51 judges had ties to the Federalist Society.\n\nDespite the Federalist Society's efforts to portray itself as a debate club that takes no official positions on policy, the group pushes a highly ideological vision and in many ways functions as another arm of the Republican Party. The group promotes interpreting the Constitution according to its \"original meaning,\" under the guise of neutrality. But in practice, these judges wield power over who gets to vote , who is protected from discrimination, and who gets access to health care .\n\nMembership in either group could \"call into question\" judicial impartiality on certain subjects the organization has a position on and \"generally frustrate the public's trust in the integrity and independence of the judiciary,\" the advisory opinion said.\n\nAnd next week, the U.S. Judicial Conference Committee on Codes of Conduct will make a formal decision on whether to adopt the rule or not. Demand Justice is trying to organize the left to push back against the conservative campaign to sabotage the rule, but Fallon says progressive advocates are going to need more practicing lawyers, academics with ethics backgrounds, and activists to speak out.\n\nWAIT!

Let me put this gently: f*** yourselves. pic.twitter.com/aqJjZjfPra\n\n- Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) August 5, 2019\n\nHe continued:\n\nYour conflation of all conservatives with white supremacist monsters who despise actual conservative principles - you know, like the universal, non-racially-based applicability of the principles of Western civilization - is cynical, deliberate, and disgusting.\n\n- Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) August 5, 2019\n\nGot that? \"Conflation\" is \"cynical, deliberate, and disgusting.\"\n\nShapiro himself is Jewish and has been targeted by white nationalist terrorists. It would therefore be insane - to borrow a word favored by Shapiro - to suggest he has anything in common with the hate-filled bigots who are trying to kill him, right? It would be crazy to talk about a commentator who has said that Arabs \"like to bomb crap and live in open sewage,\" and has predicted that \"the next race war will come not from racist whites, but from racist blacks and Hispanics\" in the same breath as white nationalists and white supremacists. It would be mad to connect Shapiro - whose Twitter feed was visited by the Quebec City mosque shooter 93 times in the month leading up to the attack - with domestic terrorists.\n\nAmirite?\n\nHere are six other conservatives who have nothing whatsoever to do with white nationalism. Nothing, nada, zilch.\n\nThe fact that the host of one of the highest-rated shows on cable news went live on Monday evening, after the El Paso killings, to dismiss concerns about white nationalism as a \"conspiracy theory\" and a \"hoax\" doesn't make him a white nationalist. Nor does the fact that he has claimed immigrants are making America \"poorer and dirtier,\" accused the Democrats of pushing for \"demographic replacement\" via a \"flood of illegals,\" and referred to an \"invasion\" of Europe by refugees who are \"profoundly chang[ing] the demographics\" of the continent.\n\nNor does the fact that neo-Nazis are fans of his show because \"he is making the white nationalist talking points better than they have and they're trying to get some tips on how to advance it.\"\n\nIt's all a \"hoax,\" remember?\n\nThe president of the United States declared that \"our nation must condemn racism, bigotry, and white supremacy\" in a speech on Monday. So how can he be a white nationalist or supremacist? What evidence is there that the El Paso shooter has anything in common with Trump (aside from the fact that he and the president have both denounced an \" invasion \" of immigrants; both accused the Democratic Party of \" treason \"; both referred to the media as \" fake news \"; and both approved of the \"send them back\" message)?\n\nWe're independent of corporate interests - and powered by members.

      "text": "Do Kamala Harris's Neocon Supporters Just Hate Trump, or Is There Something More to Her Appeal?\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nPersonally, I would not accept an endorsement from a world-historic war criminal.\n\nThe Iraq war - sold on lies and bungled in its prosecution - has become the embodiment of American hubris in the 21st century. Hundreds of thousands died, allies were alienated, and the U.S. became mired in a decadeslong boondoggle that is still unfolding. By 2007, a few years after the war was launched, all but its most diehard proponents had come to see it as the mistake it was.\n\nToday, those same diehard war hawks - the very people who planned and carried out the Iraq invasion - are proudly throwing their full support behind Vice President Kamala Harris in the November presidential election.\n\nChief among them is former Vice President Dick Cheney. Not far behind are a clutch of other Bush-era figures aligned with the neoconservative movement, like Bill Kristol; former officials like former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales ; and staffers for the late former Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.\n\nHarris is, in turn, embracing her new right-wing fan club, touting endorsements from more than 200 Republican staffers who worked for George W. Bush, McCain, and another former Republican presidential nominee, Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah.\n\n\"Of course, we have plenty of honest, ideological disagreements with Vice President Harris,\" the GOP staffers wrote in a letter . \"That's to be expected. The alternative, however, is simply untenable.\"\n\nThese hawks say they're endorsing Harris largely to stop Donald Trump - citing his conduct and \"chaotic leadership\" - but these prominent conservatives are backing the Democratic nominee because their visions for U.S. foreign policy increasingly appear to be aligned. The Democratic and Republican parties are more unified than ever in their commitment to preserving American hegemony and preventing the multipolar world from emerging.\n\nAs vice president, Cheney was one of the principal architects not only of the Iraq War, which left hundreds of thousands of Iraqis dead, but also the U.S.'s worldwide torture regime. The aftershocks of America's eight-year occupation are still being felt in the region and in our domestic politics to this day. Former Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wy., who inherited her father's hawkish views, has also pledged to do whatever she can to elect Harris, including launching a PAC that has raised millions of dollars to boost the Democrat's campaign.\n\nThis marks a departure from the past 20 years of Democratic presidential campaigns, which were built on a repudiation of the Bush administration and its disastrous war in Iraq.\n\nJust 18 months after American troops went into Baghdad, the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee, John Kerry, said that the invasion created \"a crisis of historic proportions.\" He charged Bush with \"stubborn incompetence\" over his handling of the war. In 2008, Barack Obama's opposition to the unpopular war was a major source of his success at the ballot box.\n\nEven in 2016, the repercussions of the Iraq War were a major issue in the Democratic primary. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., made his opposition to the war a cornerstone of his platform and repeatedly referenced Hillary Clinton's vote in favor of it. \"I don't think you are qualified if you have voted for the disastrous war in Iraq,\" Sanders said of Clinton.\n\nNow, however, an endorsement from one of the biggest war criminals in recent history is seen as an asset, not a liability.\n\nThe Harris campaign isn't just courting moderates and conservatives as part of a short-term strategy to win the election. Rather, Democrats are actively supporting and spouting neoconservative ideas.\n\nDuring her keynote address at the Democratic National Convention, Harris vowed: \"As commander-in-chief, I will ensure America always has the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world\" - as her party blocked any Palestinian Americans from appearing on the convention stage to speak about Israel's genocidal war on Gaza.\n\nThe party's 2024 platform also reflects this rightward shift. A section from the 2020 platform on ending forever wars and opposing regime change was completely removed in 2024. The Democratic Party went from calling for an end to U.S. support for Saudi Arabia's brutal war in Yemen to championing the Biden administration's plan for a normalization deal between Israel and the Persian Gulf monarchy - a plan that could also put American lives on the line to protect the Saudi dictatorship for decades to come.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nSome of the most glaring neocon-coded changes in the platform have to do with Iran policy. This year's platform attempted to portray Trump as being too soft on Iran, while including no mention of the Trump administration's assassination of a top Iranian military commander. Though Harris's national security adviser, Phil Gordon, helped negotiate the 2015 Iran deal, others in her circle have predicted that a Harris administration would not seek to return to the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nIt's not like Trump offers a viable alternative. As recently as the debate this week, Harris and Trump tried to outflank each other on issues like China, immigration , and crime. Trump called Biden a \"very bad Palestinian\" who doesn't want to help Israel \"finish the job\" in Gaza. Both parties are guilty of China-bashing and casting China as an existential threat to the U.S. As president, Trump declared economic war on China, which was then escalated by Biden.\n\nThe American people don't support any of these bloodthirsty policies, but it appears that circles of power in the U.S. are increasingly disconnected from the will of the people. The vast majority of Americans who want the U.S. to pull back and focus on domestic issues are going to be left without any serious option in November. The country, and the world, will pay the price.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "The Right Loves Free Speech - Unless It's Pro-Palestine Speech\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nConservative critics of \"cancel culture\" were quick to defend Trump's attempt to deport Mahmoud Khalil over his political speech.\n\nFor the conservative pundit class, few issues have been as central to their cause as their supposed defense of free speech. Over the last decade, they have built a powerful political movement revolting against the force of so-called cancel culture, which they argued had restricted permissible dialogue and punished free thinkers willing to speak their own truths.\n\nBut as the Trump regime moves to expel from this country a Palestinian U.S. permanent resident based solely on his political expression, many of those free speech warriors have changed their tune. The arrest and attempted deportation of Columbia University graduate and green card holder Mahmoud Khalil demonstrates the clear hypocrisy of many conservative voices when it comes to free speech in America. Conservatives who previously opposed \"cancel culture\" on the grounds of defending free speech are now quick to support state violence against critics of Israel through the arrest and expulsion of those critics from U.S. society.\n\nOn March 8, officials from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security arrived at the home of Khalil and arrested him, separating him from his wife, a U.S. citizen who is 8 months pregnant. He was ultimately moved to a detention facility in Louisiana, a friendly jurisdiction for government cases against immigrants . Though Trump's desire to immediately deport the legal U.S. permanent resident has been temporarily blocked by Judge Jesse Furman of the Southern District of New York, the threat against him remains. After speaking with Khalil on Tuesday, his attorney Amy Greer said that he \"is moved by the extraordinarily broad and steadfast support he has received from a variety of communities that understand what is at stake.\"\n\nKhalil faces no criminal charges, and no evidence has been offered to substantiate the Trump administration's propagandistic claims that he is a \"national security threat\" who was \"inciting violence,\" in the words of Trump border czar Tom Homan. Indeed, top White House and Republican Party officials have essentially admitted that Khalil has not committed any crime. Secretary of State Marco Rubio justified his attempt to deport Khalil by claiming - without evidence - that he supports Hamas and \"antisemitic activities.\" This demonstrates that even as Rubio grossly misrepresents Khalil's politics, he is actually attempting to deport Khalil because of his alleged politics . When asked what crime Khalil committed, House Speaker Mike Johnson reverted to propaganda talking points.\n\nIt is worth noting what Khalil has actually said. In a 2024 interview with CNN, Khalil stated, \"As a Palestinian student, I believe that the liberation of the Palestinian people and the Jewish people are intertwined and go hand-by-hand and you cannot achieve one without the other. Our movement is a movement for social justice and freedom and equality for everyone.\"\n\nPerhaps that is why large numbers of Jewish protesters took over the lobby of Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday to demand Khalil's release.\n\nThe Trump administration has argued that it has the power to deport Khalil under the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1952, which states, \"An alien whose presence or activities in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States is deportable.\" But the White House has not shown how Khalil's advocacy against Israel's genocide in Gaza would cause \"serious adverse foreign policy consequences,\" unless one considers it \"adverse\" to end U.S. support for that genocide. Under the Trump administration's sweeping interpretation of this language, any legal permanent resident of the U.S. who criticizes any aspect of Trump's foreign policy - from Trump's desire to occupy Greenland to his gross abandonment of Ukraine - could be deported. This is a clear attack on the First Amendment and constitutionally protected free speech.\n\nA wide range of conservative voices who have frequently criticized \"cancel culture\" have been quick to defend the Trump administration's ugly actions. Conservative commentator Charlie Kirk is one example, having made cancel culture his calling card while justifying the deportation of Khalil. Kirk called him \"a Hamas propagandist\" and claimed without evidence that he \"distributed pamphlets on Hamas' propaganda\" - claims that remain unsubstantiated and are fundamentally about political speech. Dinesh D'Souza followed the same path, arguing against \"cancel culture\" on the one hand while calling for Khalil's expulsion based on his alleged offensive speech against \"Western civilization,\" an allegation that actually appears to be based on a fake Instagram post . Ben Shapiro has often opined against cancellation campaigns that have targeted everything from slave-owning historical figures to present-day conservative media personalities like Jordan Peterson and Joe Rogan. However, Shapiro has retweeted multiple voices on X arguing in support of Khalil's removal from the U.S., while sharing nothing regarding the free speech concerns or unconstitutionality of this action. The list goes on and on.\n\nTo be fair, there have been exceptions to this hypocrisy. Ann Coulter, in her typical style, stated on X , \"There's almost no one I don't want to deport, but unless they've committed a crime, isn't this a violation of the First Amendment?\" Candace Owen has questioned the absence of criminal charges against Khalil and debunked conservative claims regarding what Khalil has said.\n\nProminent conservative publications that have argued against \"cancel culture\" have staked out divergent positions. The Wall Street Journal has been sympathetic to deporting Khalil over supposedly \"pro-terrorist\" speech, due to the student group Columbia University Apartheid Divest stating, \"We support liberation by any means necessary, including armed resistance.\" It raises the question: If a Ukrainian student group took this stand, would the Wall Street Journal support their deportation too? Maya Sulkin, a reporter for Bari Weiss's Free Press, argued that Khalil's deportation was not about free speech but on-campus crimes. Of course, Khalil has not been charged with or convicted of any crimes, something Sulkin failed to mention. In contrast, Reason Magazine, whose tagline is \"Free Minds and Free Markets,\" has published multiple pieces that are skeptical or critical of Trump's actions against Khalil.\n\nWhat emerges from the above examples is that too many conservative voices are quick to defend free speech when it serves their ideological goals, but are equally quick to endorse the violent repression of free speech when the speech in question runs counter to those goals.  This targeting of Khalil by Trump and the conservative media ecosystem is just the latest escalation in a decadeslong campaign to silence critics of Israel in the U.S. These strategies have included unfounded claims that critics of Israel are antisemitic , denying opponents of Israeli policy funding or employment , calling them \" terrorists ,\" blocking or removing people from elected office, and preventing advocates for Palestinian freedom from participating in public discourse . The use of these tactics is by no means limited to Republicans, as the Kamala Harris presidential campaign demonstrated when it said no to having a Palestinian speaker at the 2024 Democratic National Convention.\n\nTrump has promised that Khalil's arrest is \"the first arrest of many to come.\" It is worth noting that this policy statement comes directly from the Heritage Foundation, the same conservative think tank that brought us Project 2025. The Heritage Foundation's \"Project Esther\" explicitly calls for deporting leaders of the Palestine solidarity organizations who aren't U.S. citizens . It also demonizes critics of Israel as part of a \"global Hamas Support Network\" and ludicrously labels advocates for Palestinian freedom as \"destroying capitalism and democracy.\" Read our complete coverage Israel's War on Gaza\n\nRead our complete coverage\n\nThe simple and ugly reality is that pro-Israel repression in the United States is a necessary ingredient for maintaining U.S. military support for Israel's destruction of Palestinian society . Without this internal climate of repression, more Americans would be likely to oppose the immense military support the U.S. has long provided to a nation that subjects millions of Palestinians to apartheid and genocide .\n\nAs with many of Trump's actions, his attack on Khalil's freedom may have backfired by triggering a dramatic response from advocates for civil rights and Palestinian freedom. Protests are occurring at multiple campuses across the U.S, and the American Civil Liberties Union announced that it is joining Khalil's legal team. Multiple organizations have launched grassroots campaigns calling on universities to oppose Trump's actions and protect student rights.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nSome elected Democrats have taken a stand in support of Mahmoud Khalil, though many have remained silent. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., declared , \"Today it's Mahmoud Khalil. Tomorrow it's me or you.\" Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee posted \"Free Mahmoud Khalil\" on X and decried Republican hypocrisy on free speech: \"So pro-'freedom of speech' that Republicans will DETAIN you if you disagree with them. This is actual cancel culture.\" A small contingent from the House of Representatives have released a letter demanding Khalil's release, as have some New York state elected officials. More actions are expected from other Democrats in the hours and days ahead.\n\nHowever, many Democrats have not said anything. Most embarrassingly, Khalil's own member of Congress, New York Rep. Adriano Espaillat, told The Intercept , \"I expect the Department of Justice to work within the confines of the law and that due process is guaranteed to [Khalil] and his family.\" This is an utterly absurd position given Trump's total hostility to the rule of law. Meanwhile, senior Democratic Party leaders have been muddled in their own language. Both Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries combined calls for Khalil's release with the repetition of false claims of antisemitism. Through their statements, they implicitly erased the many Jews who support Khalil and participated in protests against Israel's genocide in Gaza.\n\nBut despite the silence of many, Trump's actions have brought the vigorous defense of freedom of speech and support for the Palestinian people back into the center of U.S. political debate. The critical task at hand is to combine a robust rejection of Trump's repression of Palestinian voices with strategies that advance the broader cause. That means freeing Khalil and blocking the detention and deportation of other leaders like him. But it also means putting pro-Israel networks on the defensive, shattering the lie of Republican concern for free speech, and holding silent Democrats accountable. By doing so, we can begin to liberate America from the new McCarthyism of censorship and repression of pro-Palestine speech. And through this, we can end U.S. support for Israel's ethnic cleansing and genocide of Palestinians.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "How the Trump Era Lays Bare the Tension in the Marriage Between Conservatism and Capitalism\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nA new book charts how conservatives used to resist capitalism, but have completely given in. The politics of Donald Trump could loosen the bonds.\n\nThe marriage between capitalism and conservatism has been a strange one. While conservative parties around the world differ widely in their composition and specific policy proposals, conservatism as an ideology can broadly be described as a defense of the established order. Social stability, the maintenance of tradition, and a hierarchical view of society tend to be consistent aspects of any conservative creed.\n\nIt's precisely these characteristics of conservatism that make American conservatives' wholehearted embrace of capitalism so puzzling. In its purest form, capitalism is a revolutionary ideology par excellence, at least in terms of its social consequences. In its constant search for new markets, labor, materials, and technologies, free-market capitalism mercilessly upends communities, industries, social classes, and even basic human norms and values.\n\nThe profoundly destabilizing nature of such an economic system was identified by no less than Karl Marx, who observed that in capitalist societies, \"All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned.\"\n\nLooked at objectively, it makes little obvious sense for people who are concerned with maintaining tradition and social stability to align themselves with such a volatile system. So why, then, have conservatives in the United States lined up solidly behind free-market capitalism for so many years? Peter Kolozi, an associate professor at the City University of New York, attempts to answer this vexing question in a recent book called \"Conservatives Against Capitalism: From the Industrial Revolution to Globalization.\" In doing so, Kolozi also sheds light on a largely forgotten U.S. tradition of conservative skepticism toward capitalism.\n\n\"There's an inherent tension that some conservatives have recognized in the current system, which is that capitalism is inherently revolutionary. It throws everything up in the air and is a destabilizing force in society,\" Kolozi told The Intercept. \"Many of the things that conservatives want to define and protect, such as community and a hierarchical structure of society based on tradition, are by their nature threatened by capitalism.\"\n\nThe earliest generation of anti-capitalist American conservatives came out of the American South. For these men - and the intellectuals of the movement were all men - the emphasis on free markets posed a threat to the traditional \"Southern\" way of life that they sought to maintain - a way of life that was based on maintaining strict racial and class hierarchies. Unlike socialists, the challenge to capitalism expressed by conservative intellectual movements like the Southern Agrarians was fundamentally anti-egalitarian. In many ways, their support of a traditional agrarian economy against the free market represented a radical last-ditch effort to defend formal racial and class privileges within a country that was rapidly modernizing.\n\nTeddy Roosevelt at the dedication of Grant's tomb 1911.\n\nOver time, this tradition gave way to less radical critiques, including those made by conservatives like President Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt feared that the materialist and consumerist values promoted under capitalism would inevitably lead to the moral and physical degeneration of the American people. His notorious solution was to turn the United States into a global empire, one that would allow its citizens to become conquering heroes in the Third World and thereby maintain a sense of collective mission. Many decades later, a similar type of pro-imperial conservatism would be picked up by neoconservatives, who supported using the U.S. military as a tool for remaking the geopolitical order as well as re-energizing an American populace that they saw as morally adrift.\n\nConservatives largely made their peace with capitalism during the Cold War. Faced with the specter of communism, a system that seemed even more radically threatening to the status quo, American conservatives threw in their lot with the market completely. Old reservations soon gave way to a reflexive identification of conservative politics with free markets. In the prosperous decades immediately after World War II, these markets were seen as \"delivering the goods,\" in the form of higher living standards for the American people. In the short term, at least, capitalism also proved quite effective at maintaining existing social hierarchies, with traditional elites successfully passing down privilege to their descendants through preferred access to economic opportunities and top-tier educational institutions.\n\nEven while they adapted to the system, however, some conservatives continued to critique the more extreme consequences of the free market. During the Cold War, conservative criticisms of capitalism focused mainly on its laissez-faire variety, in which the market was left to its own workings with minimal government intervention. Under President Ronald Reagan, this form of capitalism took full flight, with his administration drastically slashing tax rates on the highest earners, removing regulations on market activity, and cutting funding for social programs. This predatory capitalism had a devastating effect on the American working class, who were denied the benefits of a social safety net as well as the dubious promise of \"trickle-down\" wealth from elites.\n\nAt the same time, radical laissez-faire policies helped empower an entirely new set of elites, many of whom came from the burgeoning financial sector. The ascendance of this new elite was made possible by the deregulation of financial markets, as well as improved communications and transportation links under globalization. Allegedly unmoored from the specific national interests of the United States, these \"globalists\" - as they are derisively called today by the likes of Donald Trump, Steve Bannon, and others of their type - have been blamed for grossly enriching themselves at the expense of Trump's preferred community, loosely defined as white middle America.\n\nThis ethnocentric critique of global capitalism is most closely identified with right-wing \"paleoconservative\" intellectuals like Patrick Buchanan, who has lauded Trump's presidency. This ideological movement also has an ugly undercurrent of anti-Semitism, reflected in populist attacks on financiers like George Soros, as well as some of Trump's ads from the 2016 election campaign that were widely seen as regurgitating anti-Semitic tropes.\n\nTrump himself has offered a blunt response to globalization and laissez-faire economics: nationalism. Among other policies, Trump has sought to use trade as a weapon against both foreign competitors and allies, placed draconian restrictions on immigration, and worked to undermine the stability of international governance organizations that are blamed for impinging on national sovereignty. In addition to his invective against Mexican immigrants and a ban on immigration from several Muslim-majority countries, Trump has tried renegotiate trade pacts such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and worked to undermine transnational bodies like the European Union. While he is avowedly capitalist, Trump has expressed a willingness to use state power to bend the global market to benefit favored constituencies .\n\nSome of Trump's economically protectionist inclinations happen to resonate with left-wing concerns about the immiseration of the American working class under global capitalism. The destruction of America's manufacturing sector by a combination of outsourcing and automation has had undeniably grievous effects on workers. Left alone to face the cruel vicissitudes of the market, regions of the country that decades earlier helped build a thriving manufacturing sector have now been seemingly abandoned to the ravages of opioid addiction, urban blight, and family dissolution.\n\nIn response to this slow-motion catastrophe, left-wing politicians like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and others have argued in terms that echo some of Trump's economically nationalist positions, particularly on trade. Importantly, the left has supported these positions without also endorsing Trump's xenophobia or anti-immigrant sentiment. But some have warned that a nationalistic response to globalization, also expressed by politicians like Jeremy Corbyn, Britain's Labour Party leader, and French socialist Jean-Luc Mélenchon may end up putting left-wing parties at a disadvantage in the face of a globally resurgent right.\n\nIn an interview last year, the late Marxist historian Moishe Postone warned that the left would be doomed in its embrace of a nationalist response to the problems of global capitalism. \"In the course of the 20th century, due to the welfare state and similar developments, the communist dream of internationalism dissipated and working-class movements became de facto nationalist,\" Postone said. \"But if that's going to be your position, then the right is much better at that. The right are much better nationalists.\"\n\nIn Europe, far-right parties in France, Poland, Hungary, and the Netherlands have discovered a potentially winning combination of ethnonationalism mixed with support for welfare state policies. Trump won the American presidency on an eerily similar platform, railing against immigrants and minorities while periodically hinting at his dissatisfaction with the dilapidated American health care system and concentration of wealth on Wall Street .\n\nTrump's brand of xenophobic populism seems to be trickling down to his supporters in the media. In a segment on his Fox News show, Tucker Carlson recently lambasted Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos for exploitative policies toward workers and for amassing huge amounts of personal wealth at the expense of public well-being. This embrace of economic populism by an avowed conservative like Carlson - who also regularly uses his platform to promote white nationalist positions - could signal a future in which European-style, right-wing politics gains a meaningful support base in the United States.\n\nFor all their differences, there is one key aspect of the intellectual history charted in \"Conservatives Against Capitalism\" that deals with an issue of shared concern on both the left and the right: the need for community. One of the grim consequences of the Social Darwinian pressures unleashed by free-market capitalism has been the destruction of networks of community, family, and professional associations in developed societies.\n\nThese so-called intermediate institutions have historically played a vital role giving ordinary people a sense of meaning and protecting them from the structural violence of the state and the market. Their loss has led to the creation of a huge class of atomized and lonely people, cut adrift from traditional sources of support and left alone to contend with the power of impersonal economic forces.\n\nThese insecure and disoriented masses of individuals have been identified by both conservative and leftist thinkers as the seedbed for totalitarianism, citing the historical experience of fascist and communist regimes in the 20th century. In her famous work \"The Origins of Totalitarianism,\" Hannah Arendt wrote, \"What prepares men for totalitarian domination in the non-totalitarian world is the fact of loneliness.\" This loneliness - \"once a borderline experience usually suffered in certain marginal social conditions like old age\" - had now become an endemic part of life for millions of people, Arendt argued, citing the experiences of European societies that became totalitarian during the 20th century.\n\nSome conservatives echoed this warning, raising the alarm that the eradication of church groups, local community organizations, and extended family networks by a rampant market had helped lay the groundwork for state tyranny. In terms reminiscent of Arendt, the conservative philosopher Robert A. Nisbet wrote:\n\nA great deal of the character of contemporary social action has come from the efforts of men to find in large-scale organizations, especially political ones, those values of status and intellectual security which were formally acquired in church, family and neighborhood. How else can we explain the success of such movements as Communism and Nazism except as mass movements designed to confer upon the individual some sense of that community which has been lost under the impact of modern social changes.\n\nToday, despite relative material wealth, the United States and other developed countries face epidemic levels of family breakdown, mental illness, and social anomie - phenomena that are increasingly being blamed on economic policies enacted over the past several decades that have destroyed networks of community and mutual support. If there can be fruitful common ground across ideologies, it may be in finding ways to rebuild a shared sense of belonging among people who have been isolated from one another by the impact of market forces and technological change.

What that actually means and what those communities look like is a subject of debate, but it's a value that both sides share.\"\n\nWith memories of the Cold War fading and the threat of Soviet Communism having no sway over younger generations, it's unclear how long the lockstep alliance between American conservatism and the capitalist free market will continue into the future. The prioritization of market growth and private wealth accumulation above all other concerns - including the environment, social welfare, family, and community - has led to widespread disenchantment on both the left and the right.\n\nReflecting on the period of the Great Depression, the conservative writer Peter Viereck once wrote that the United States at that time had been \"a revolutionary powder keg, needing only a spark.\" That the spark never came was a testament to American society's ability to pull back from the brink and implement policies that extended both wealth and opportunity beyond a small elite. As the global economy staggers from one crisis to the next, the future direction of politics in the West may end up depending on whether a new consensus can be reached on how to ameliorate the harms inflicted by a rampaging free market - and from there, build a vision of the future that more people find worth defending.\n\n\"There is a real potential now for a change in the conservative position on whether to regulate the harsher aspects of the market. If you look at the politics of young people today, they tend to widely share a more critical perspective on the question of what capitalism has delivered for society,\" said Kolozi. \"I don't think conservatives will become socialists, ever. But a much more regulated capitalism is something that they are going to have to seriously think about accepting in the foreseeable future.\"\n\nTop photo: An attendee stands for the Pledge of Allegiance at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Md., on Feb. 23, 2018.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Can Conservatives Expand the Death Penalty Using the \"Trigger Law\" Playbook?\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nProject 2025 - a road map for the next Trump White House - urges overturning Supreme Court precedent, and a trickle of bills may tee up challenges.\n\nHaving rolled back decades of precedent on abortion and reproductive health, conservatives are looking for ways to recycle the playbook that took down Roe v. Wade - and they've got their sights on the death penalty.\n\nRepublicans and their allies are eager to expand capital punishment, and U.S. Supreme Court cases that currently limit the crimes that can lead to executions are a prime target.\n\nConservatives' eagerness to create more capital crimes is laid out in the sprawling Project 2025 manifesto, a road map for the first 180 days of \"the next conservative administration.\" Project 2025 urges the next administration - presumably, a second Trump White House - to throw the Justice Department's weight into overturning the constitutional limits established by the Supreme Court.\n\nIn the meantime, Republican legislators are laying the groundwork to expand the death penalty to crimes beyond murder by passing \"trigger laws\" that would spring into effect once these Supreme Court Court guardrails are eliminated.\n\nSo far, Florida and Tennessee have enacted laws that allow prosecutors to seek the death penalty for child sex abuse. The laws' proponents flaunted the contradiction with a Supreme Court decision from 2008, Kennedy v. Louisiana, which bars the death penalty for crimes other than murder based on the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of \"cruel and unusual punishments.\"\n\nSimilar bills have been introduced by conservatives in Congress and a handful of other states, with an eye toward challenging the Supreme Court's Kennedy ruling just as state laws challenged Roe to overturn abortion rights.\n\n\"To the extent there is an effort by folks in the state systems to challenge Kennedy,\" said Robin Maher, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, \"they have a very high hill to climb.\"\n\nProject 2025 shows Republicans are gearing up for the climb.\n\nThe Kennedy case, decided in 2008, saw a divided Supreme Court strike down a state law that allowed a jury to impose the death penalty for rape of a child under 12 years old.\n\nThe majority's decision built on decades of precedent interpreting the Eighth Amendment under \"evolving standards of decency\" - an approach that stands in firm opposition to conservative \"originalist\" jurisprudence.\n\nThe five-justice majority weighed heavily the risk of wrongfully executing offenders based on a child's testimony and the documented negative effect on victims' willingness to come forward if the death penalty is on the table for their abusers.\n\nUnder the Kennedy decision, the death penalty is unconstitutional in \"instances where the victim's life was not taken.\" The court left open the possibility that execution might still be permissible for non-homicide crimes against the state, such as treason, espionage, or terrorism.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito wrote for the conservative dissenters - including Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Clarence Thomas, and late Justice Antonin Scalia - criticizing earlier death penalty rulings. Alito pointed to a handful of states that had enacted capital child-rape laws, which he suggested might be \"the beginning of a new evolutionary line\" for interpreting the Eighth Amendment.\n\nAt the time, the Kennedy ruling drew plenty of criticism, including from then-Sen. Barack Obama in the lead-up to the 2008 Democratic National Convention.\n\nPublic opinion, though, has shifted against capital punishment since Kennedy was decided, most starkly among Democrats and independents, according to Gallup polls . In 2008, a slight majority of Democrats and two-thirds of independents were in favor of the death penalty as a punishment for murder, compared to just under a third of Democrats and about half of independents in 2023.\n\nBy comparison, Republicans have consistently endorsed the death penalty, with support hovering around 80 percent since 2000.\n\nOn the campaign trail in 2020, Joe Biden promised to end the federal death penalty, but his Justice Department has sought death sentences for at least two defendants and urged appellate courts to uphold earlier sentences.\n\nLike Roe, Kennedy is a reviled decision among many conservatives, not least because of its non-originalist approach to the Eighth Amendment. And if Donald Trump wins the election in November, the conservative legal movement hopes he will prioritize overturning Kennedy.\n\nThe Project 2025 manifesto , spearheaded by the right-wing Heritage Foundation, is a 900-page document compiled by a \"who's who\" of the conservative legal movement. It touches on everything from gutting the administrative state to restoring \"the family as the centerpiece of American life.\"\n\nThe manifesto's chapter on the Justice Department was drafted by Gene Hamilton, the vice president and general counsel of America First Legal who served in the Trump DOJ. Hamilton calls capital punishment a \"sensitive matter\" while urging the \"next conservative Administration\" to \"do everything possible\" to execute all prisoners currently on death row.\n\nOriginal reporting.

Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nProject 2025 also calls for pushing the limits of capital punishment. The Justice Department should \"pursue the death penalty for applicable crimes,\" Hamilton writes, \"particularly heinous crimes involving violence and sexual abuse of children-until Congress says otherwise through legislation.\"\n\nIn a footnote, the Kennedy decision is quietly raised as a target.\n\n\"This could require seeking the Supreme Court to overrule Kennedy v. Louisiana ,\" reads the footnote, \"but the department should place a priority on doing so.\"\n\nMaher, of the Death Penalty Information Center, told The Intercept this section of Project 2025's playbook puzzled her.\n\n\"Congress has spoken very clearly, as has the Supreme Court,\" about the limits of the death penalty, she said.\n\n\"Roe was about a single issue, but this is about a standard of review that has been applied to decades of cases, anything that applies to the death penalty,\" Maher said. \"It would be the kind of abrupt change that would be unprecedented.\"\n\n\"There's no evidence the public is clamoring for more executions.\"\n\nConservative legislators are eager to tee up legal challenges to the Kennedy decision. Much of the pro-execution momentum so far has come from Florida Republicans.\n\nIn early May 2023, shortly before announcing his ill-fated bid for the Republican presidential nomination, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a trigger law that makes child rape a crime eligible for the death penalty \"notwithstanding existing case law which holds such a sentence is unconstitutional.\" The law says Kennedy was \"wrongly decided and an egregious infringement of the states' power to punish the most heinous of crimes.\"\n\n\"This bill sets up a procedure to be able to challenge that precedent,\" DeSantis told reporters at the time, \"and to be able to say that in Florida we think that the worst of the worst crimes deserve the worst of the worst punishment.\"\n\nIn December, local prosecutors announced the first attempt under the new Florida law to seek the death penalty for a man indicted for child sex abuse, which DeSantis lauded as the potential \"first case to challenge SCOTUS.\" Prosecutors later accepted a plea deal under which the defendant accepted a life sentence in prison. Last month, a Florida appellate judge noted the new legislation and urged Kennedy to be overturned.\n\nAnother Florida Republican has sponsored similar legislation in Congress. In April, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, introduced a pair of bills that would turn various child sex abuse offenses into capital crimes, including possession of child pornography.\n\n\"If someone commits horrific crimes against children, they deserve the death penalty or life in prison,\" Luna said in a statement to The Intercept. \"The Supreme Court did not make the right decision in Kennedy v. Louisiana.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Tennessee followed Florida's lead. In May, Republican Gov. Bill Lee quietly signed a law to make aggravated child rape a capital offense, which goes into effect on July 1.\n\nDuring debate in April in the Tennessee state Senate, Kennedy came up frequently. Sen. Ken Yager, one of the bill's Republican sponsors, read from Alito's dissent and affirmed that his aim was partly to overrule Kennedy.\n\n\"We have a bill that is unquestionably unconstitutional,\" said Sen. Jeff Yarbro, a Democrat from Nashville. \"I don't know why we're going to go down this path of passing something that's blatantly unconstitutional. Because that's what it is.\"\n\nSen. Janice Bowling, a Republican, suggested her colleagues should think of overturning Kennedy \"in terms of Roe v. Wade . \"\n\n\"Maybe it's time for this to be changed,\" Bowling said. \"And maybe the atmosphere in the Supreme Court is different now. We're not violating the Constitution. We're simply challenging a ruling.\"\n\nRepublicans in a handful of other states have recently floated similar legislation. One bill introduced in South Carolina in December, echoing Florida's law, calls Kennedy \"wrongly decided\" and characterizes the decision as infringing \"upon the power of the State to punish what it determines to be a monstrous and evil crime and punish those convicted as the State determines to be necessary and just.\"\n\nThe South Carolina bill's sponsor, state Rep. Jordan Pace, told The Intercept he used the Florida statute as a model. Asked whether he also hoped to challenge Kennedy, Pace said, \"The aim is to provide swift and righteous justice for victims and their families.\"\n\nBills that contradict Kennedy were also introduced last year in Arkansas, New Mexico, Missouri, Iowa, Idaho, and South Dakota.\n\nFor now, at least, Maher is skeptical that the trigger law playbook that tossed out Roe would also work to overrule Kennedy and other death penalty precedent. She said, \"We're all watching very closely to see what the court is willing to do.\"\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "Conservatives Are Nudging the Supreme Court to Dismantle Affordable Housing Policies\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nA conservative law firm has asked the Supreme Court to take up a challenge to inclusionary zoning, a tool localities use to increase affordable housing.\n\nWhen it comes to conservatives and the U.S. Supreme Court, abortion and labor rights are often considered among their prime targets. Brett Kavanaugh's ascension to the court last fall, though, opened the road for a host of other challenges for which conservatives have quietly been laying the groundwork for years. This month, the Pacific Legal Foundation, a conservative law firm based in California, made moves on one of those fronts, asking the Supreme Court to take up a case challenging the constitutionality of inclusionary zoning - a popular tool cities and states employ to increase affordable housing and promote residential integration.\n\nInclusionary zoning generally works by requiring real estate developers to reserve a certain number of units in new housing complexes for tenants who live on more modest incomes; some jurisdictions also allow developers to alternatively pay a fee so the city can construct more affordable housing elsewhere. Conservatives argue that the policy effectively violates a provision of the Fifth Amendment that says private property cannot be taken without just compensation.\n\nThis is the Pacific Legal Foundation's third attempt to bring an inclusionary zoning challenge before the Supreme Court. Its previous efforts, in 2015 and 2017 , were both dismissed, but legal experts say that with Kavanaugh now seated on the high court, it is more likely the case will find an audience - and be resolved in favor of conservatives.\n\nThe law firm is representing an elderly couple - Dart and Esther Cherk - in Marin County, California, who wanted to divide their 2.79 acres of land into two developable lots. They hoped to sell half of their land to supplement their retirement. In 2000, they applied for a permit, and in the time it took to get their permit, the local law changed such that the couple now had to pay Marin County $40,000 as an affordable housing fee to proceed. They paid, but then demanded a refund, calling the payment unconstitutional.\n\nBy the end of 2016, 886 jurisdictions in 25 states and Washington, D.C., had also adopted inclusionary zoning policies.\n\n\"Rather than respect property rights and allow a free market in land use, Marin County (and other California cities) have concocted counterproductive 'affordable housing' programs by which they collect fees from people like the Cherks (who are actually trying to create new building lots) and stuff it into government coffers for government programs that will allegedly make housing more 'affordable,'\" wrote Larry Salzman , a Pacific Legal Foundation attorney leading the case.\n\nInclusionary zoning is a land-use policy, first developed in Montgomery County, Maryland, in the 1970s, as a way to foster mixed-income communities. Since it was enacted, the inclusionary zoning policy in Montgomery County has been used to build more than 11,000 new affordable units. By the end of 2016, according to Grounded Solutions Network , 886 jurisdictions in 25 states and Washington, D.C., had also adopted inclusionary zoning policies. And it's still spreading: This past spring, the New Orleans City Council passed a mandatory inclusionary zoning law to boost affordable housing in the city's most desirable neighborhoods.\n\nSome real estate developers and economists bemoan inclusionary zoning, arguing that it actually decreases housing affordability by making it more expensive to build market-rate units. This is a concern leaders take seriously, especially in places like California, which is grappling with soaring housing costs driven largely by a scarcity of available units. Still, other experts say that fear is overblown, or can be mitigated with careful program design.\n\nThat the Pacific Legal Foundation is trying to eliminate a legal tool used by policymakers to promote residential diversity comes as little surprise to those in the civil rights community. The Pacific Legal Foundation has challenged a host of liberal policy ideas in court, including affirmative action , the Voting Rights Act , bilingual education , and school integration .\n\nTheir case, as Salzman explains, is built on the idea that Marin County's inclusionary zoning program violates Supreme Court precedent that protects property owners from being forced to pay extortionate permit fees. Since the couple splitting their lot wouldn't be exacerbating the local affordable housing crisis - and arguably would be helping to ameliorate it since they'd be increasing supply in an area that desperately needs more housing - \"they can't lawfully be charged a fat fee to solve the region's so-called 'affordable housing' problem,\" argues Salzman.\n\nThomas Silverstein, a fair housing attorney at the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law , said it's likely the Supreme Court will eventually take up an inclusionary zoning case, even if not this one. \"It seems it's just part of Pacific Legal Foundation's agenda to be consistently developing a pipeline of potential challenges, bringing them up and bringing them up, and hoping one day they'll crack through,\" he said.\n\n\"You could also imagine the court looking at these facts and saying this is a really unique situation.\"\n\nIn 2015, Justice Clarence Thomas signaled his interest in taking up a future inclusionary zoning case, writing a concurrence that stated the inclusionary zoning case they were denying to review \"implicates an important and unsettled issue under the Takings Clause.\" Kavanaugh's record on property rights and the Takings Clause is more limited, in part because he was previously on the bench at the D.C. Circuit, where those kinds of cases came up far less often. Still, his notorious record on civil rights was flagged by the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund at the time of his nomination. Last summer they warned that confirming him to the Supreme Court \"would threaten the government's ability to use race to promote diversity and halt discrimination.\"\n\nThis is the final week of the Supreme Court's current session, and the court won't decide whether to hear the zoning case until it reconvenes in the fall. The court's decision could rest on whether it finds the facts of the case to be representative of questions around inclusionary zoning writ large, Silverstein noted. On the one hand, the Pacific Legal Foundation picked a case with a relatively sympathetic set of plaintiffs; it's not some rich real estate developer building a high-rise tower but rather a couple looking to retire who would not be hurting Marin County's affordable housing crisis by splitting up their land. \"I think the flip side of this is, you could also imagine the court looking at these facts and saying this is a really unique situation, and if we're going to take up the issue of whether inclusionary zoning is constitutional, it makes more sense to do it when the facts in front of us are more typical,\" Silverstein said.\n\nA key constitutional question for the court, Silverstein said, will be whether inclusionary zoning amounts to a constitutional regulation of how property is used or an unconstitutional taking of property from a property owner. Another question will be whether past legal precedent applies to legislative ordinances, as opposed to ad hoc or administrative decisions. The three big Supreme Court cases that the Pacific Legal Foundation is basing its new argument on - Dolan v. City of Tigard, Nollan v. California Coastal Commission, and Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Management District - were all centered on administrative decisions. In the 5-4 Koontz decision authored by Justice Samuel Alito in 2013, the U.S Supreme Court ruled that a water management district in Florida had imposed illegal conditions on an entrepreneur's application to build a shopping center. The proposed shopping center was to be located on a swath of wetlands, and the water management district said the entrepreneur could either reduce the size of his project or spend money on wetlands restoration efforts to mitigate the project's environmental impacts. The entrepreneur refused, calling the conditions unreasonable, and the Supreme Court agreed. In the dissent , Justice Elena Kagan objected to the idea that a requirement to pay money to repair public wetlands amounts to a taking of private property, and noted that the court has already held that taxes do not amount to a violation of the Fifth Amendment. \"Once the majority decides that a simple demand to pay money-the sort of thing often viewed as a tax-can count as an impermissible 'exaction,' how is anyone to tell the two apart?\" she wrote. \"In short, the District never made a demand or set a condition-not to cede an identifiable property interest, not to undertake a particular mitigation project, not even to write a check to the government. Instead, the District suggested to Koontz several non-exclusive ways to make his applications conform to state law. The District's only hard-and-fast requirement was that Koontz do something-anything-to satisfy the relevant permitting criteria.\"\n\nWe're independent of corporate interests - and powered by members.

The group \"has been very careful to frame their cases around a fee; they want it to seem as much like Koontz as possible, where it's considered an unconstitutional fee from the start,\" said Silverstein. \"But if you say instead that there's a requirement to provide affordable housing, and if you don't want to provide affordable housing, you can get out of that obligation by paying a fee, that makes their case look much less like Koontz and more like a land-use regulation that might be permitted under Euclid v. Ambler , which effectively upheld zoning. If a fee is seen instead as an opt-out, it's almost like you're doing a nice thing for the property owner.\"\n\nEven as conservatives have raised constitutional challenges to inclusionary zoning in recent years, cities and states have not held back on moving forward with inclusionary zoning out of fear of their laws being struck down on the federal level. A Supreme Court dismissal of the new petition would reinforce the message that the proactive steps many jurisdictions have already taken to use inclusionary zoning are lawful and legitimate. Alternatively, if the court did take up the case and ruled in Marin County's favor, that would also send a strong signal that jurisdictions can continue to pass inclusionary zoning mandates.\n\n\"The problem,\" said Silverstein, \"is we have a Supreme Court that is very skewed toward the petitioners in this case, and there's a real risk they would decide the case the other way and upset the applecart.\"\n\nWAIT!

Wade\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nTwo hundred conservatives gathered at Yale Law School and coalesced into a group whose name was a joke: the Federalist Society.\n\nIn the early Reagan years, religious right movement leaders Paul Weyrich and Jerry Falwell knew that they could not solely rely on fickle politicians to implement their plan on a national scale. They didn't have public opinion on their side - certainly not on legal abortion, nor on other elements of their plan to maintain their privilege and power. In order to implement their anti-democratic policy agenda and political philosophy, they needed the influence and power of a court system impervious to the will of voters. In that pursuit, an institution named the Federalist Society became their main vehicle.\n\nIn 1982, a group of conservative students and professors gathered at Yale Law School giddy with the opportunity offered by Ronald Reagan's presidency. They spent the time discussing the perils of federalism, decrying the cultural influence of \"coastal elites,\" and listening to speakers who excoriated everything from New Deal politics to the legalization of abortion and its impact on \"acceptable sexual behavior.\" This relatively small crew of around 200 began the process of building a language and a culture around constitutional originalism, a designed approach of interpreting the Constitution very narrowly based on what the framers - all white, all men, all Christian - supposedly meant at the time they wrote it. They named the new group the Federalist Society as a bit of an inside joke. One of the organizers wrote to invite future Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork to help them, saying that the group \"settled on Federalist Society as a name which I suppose makes up in euphony what it lacks in accuracy. If you have any brilliant ideas for a better name, however, that would be splendid.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you.

They were all convinced that there was a desperate need for an antidote to what they believed was insidious left-wing bias in law schools. One of the student organizers, Steven Calabresi, recalled that \"part of Reagan's policy was to build up forces in battleground nations in order to topple enemy regimes, and I thought of us as kind of the same equivalent in law schools.\"\n\nPerhaps no speech better articulated the overarching mission of this new endeavor than that of Bork, who had recently been appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit by Reagan, when he told the gathered students that the courts were legislating with made-up constitutional rights:\n\nThis is a process that is going on. It happens with the extension of the equal protection clause to groups that were never previously protected. When they began to protect groups that were historically not intended to be protected by that clause, what they are doing is picking out groups that should not have any disabilities laid upon them.\n\nGiven that Bork had excoriated the Civil Rights Act as being grounded in \"unsurpassed ugliness\" and had opposed Griswold v. Connecticut, which granted married couples the right to contraception, those who read the speech reasonably concluded that Bork did not include historically marginalized groups as meriting protection. This seminal speech was later invoked in Bork's Supreme Court nomination hearings and helped sink his chances at confirmation.\n\nThe weekend was a smashing success, with one prominent attendee comparing it to Woodstock for right-wing legal activists. The attendees left convinced that they were a silent majority, despite all evidence to the contrary. They believed that if they could make it socially permissible, many more students on college campuses would come out against liberalism. They emerged from the gathering energized to build the Federalist Society, a new effort to train and promote conservative-minded lawyers into prominent positions, with an eye toward installing far-right judges. Backed by a who's who of right-wing money, the fledgling group quickly grew from a handful of grassroots chapters on college campuses into a million-dollar organization with headquarters in Washington, D.C., and at least 75 campus affiliates. One of its initial backers was the John M. Olin Foundation, the force behind the establishment of business-friendly law and economics programs at law schools throughout the country.\n\nThe Federalist Society scoped out the legal aspect of Falwell and Weyrich's new strategy, and it found that abortion proved to be an excellent litmus test for likely members of the radical right. It turned out that young and ambitious legal minds who had an antipathy to Roe v. Wade were far more likely to be on board with the full agenda to assert control and maintain the status quo of right-wing power.\n\nEdwin Meese, a top aide to Reagan, hired many \"Federalists,\" as they came to call themselves. Other GOP operatives helped young, newly graduated Federalist Society lawyers find jobs. The movement was riding high when Chief Justice Warren Burger informed Reagan of his intent to retire in 1986. Reagan, in his second term with no reelection to plan for and chastened by the backlash to his Sandra Day O'Connor Supreme Court nomination, did two things: He moved to elevate right-wing ideologue William Rehnquist to occupy the position of chief justice. Then he nominated Federalist Society superstar Scalia to replace Rehnquist.

Photo: Darren Hauck/AP The fight over Rehnquist's ascension was bitter and divided. He had served on the court since 1972, having been nominated by President Richard Nixon. Rehnquist was a stalwart conservative cut from the same cloth as Weyrich. As a clerk for the Supreme Court, he had written a memo arguing against mandated school desegregation as the court considered Brown v. Board of Education. He consistently argued for prayer in school and capital punishment and against equal rights extending to gender and abortion rights - dissenting in the Roe case. His ascension was an affront to numerous causes and issues that Democrats had come to champion, and many fought his nomination bitterly. A witness testified to Rehnquist's efforts to suppress minority voting in the early 1960s and, in a heated argument, Republican Sen. Strom Thurmond overruled the request of Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., and others demanding more transparency and fact-finding. Rehnquist was finally confirmed by a vote of 65-33, and the Democratic holdouts were defeated.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, center, speaks at the the Federalist Society half-day conference on \"The Legacy of the Rehnquist Court\" on Feb. 23, 2006, in Milwaukee.\n\nThey were also exhausted. They voted to confirm Scalia the same day as the vote on Rehnquist. The Democrats had little fight left in them, and they had spent all of their political capital. Besides, the junior nominee was relatively unknown outside his own conservative legal circles, without an established paper trail on hot-button issues - a profile that became a staple of Federalist nominees. Scalia was confirmed unanimously by the Senate and went on to become one of the most right-wing justices in the history of the Supreme Court, upending norms by using oral arguments as political theater and writing scathing dissents in cases in which he was outnumbered.\n\nThe following year, Justice Lewis Powell - of the infamous Powell memo - announced his intention to step down, giving Reagan yet another opportunity to shape the court. Reagan drew again from the same well, nominating Federalist Society founding father Bork. The man who had used the original conference to decry \"the gentrification of the Constitution\" and to claim that states should be able to ban abortion and define \"acceptable sexual behavior\" was up. The new legions of Federalists were ecstatic about the possibility of having two of their own on the Supreme Court.\n\nBut Democrats and progressives were not going to be caught flat-footed again. Opposition to Bork's nomination came fast and furious from civil rights and women's groups. Kennedy, who led the opposition, responded to the nomination by saying:\n\nRobert Bork's America is a land where women are forced into back-alley abortions, Blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police would break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists could be censored at the whim of the government, and the doors of the federal courts would shut on the fingers of millions of citizens for whom the judiciary is - and is often the only - protector of the individual rights that are the heart of our democracy. ... President Reagan is still our president. But he should not be able to reach out from the muck of Irangate, reach into the muck of Watergate, and impose his reactionary vision of the Constitution on the Supreme Court and the next generation of Americans. No justice would be better than this injustice.\n\nThe extreme ideology on display at Bork's initial Federalist speech came back to haunt him in the lengthy confirmation battle. Bork's nomination was defeated in a bipartisan vote after months of bitter fighting. The seat ultimately went to Justice Anthony Kennedy in 1988. The Federalists were enraged and took a solemn vow to never let one of their own be sunk again.\n\nOther groups were also hard at work using law and the courts to tilt culture in the direction of the radical right's goals. In 1990, Christian televangelist Pat Robertson created the American Center for Law and Justice specifically to go head-to-head with the liberal American Civil Liberties Union. The ACLJ held a stable of attorneys ready to jump into high-profile battles worldwide focused on its version of family values. The organization, today led by former President Donald Trump's personal attorney Jay Sekulow, has fought changes to the Kenyan constitution that would allow abortion, supported the government of Zimbabwe in its effort to criminalize homosexuality, and, closer to home, effectively blocked the construction of an Islamic cultural center near the World Trade Center site.

Jeb Bush during a presidential candidate forum at Regent University in Virginia Beach, Va., on Oct. 23, 2015. Photo: Steve Helber/AP In 1993, prominent evangelical Christian ministers founded the Alliance Defending Freedom to advance \"religious freedom, sanctity of life, and marriage and family\" through legal advocacy and funding court cases that tested legal precedent. In 1994, a Catholic lawyer named Kevin J. \"Seamus\" Hasson used seed money from the Knights of Columbus to round out these efforts with the Becket Fund, a nonprofit law firm solely devoted to promoting \"religious liberty.\" All of these groups shared a fundamental belief that their way of life was under attack and aimed to use the courts to impose a traditionalist, Christian ideology on the American public, echoing the demands for \"religious liberty\" that the radical right had first tested on its pro-segregation work in the 1960s.\n\nJay Sekulow, chief counsel of the American Center for Law and Justice, introduces former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush during a presidential candidate forum at Regent University in Virginia Beach, Va., on Oct. 23, 2015.\n\nThey subsequently joined in common cause to choose a series of high-profile cases that they believed would cement the idea that liberal reforms around civil rights and gender equity amounted to an attack on traditional religion. In California, the ACLJ and its allies aggressively defended Proposition 8, the ballot measure designed to ban same-sex marriage in the state. Their rhetoric presented out-of-touch elites trying to foist a liberal agenda on the rest of the nation. In 2018, the Alliance Defending Freedom advocated in the Supreme Court case Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, which dealt with religious business owners' ability to refuse service to people based on their sexual orientation, for similar reasons.\n\nPerhaps the feather in the cap of the movement architects - some of whom did not live to see this day - was their victory in the 2014 Hobby Lobby Supreme Court case. President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act had mandated long overdue reform that contraception be covered by insurance at no extra cost to the employee. The owners of the craft supply chain Hobby Lobby sought to deny their employees this coverage, using their go-to claim that it violated their religious beliefs. Core to the plaintiffs' case was the claim that the owners of Hobby Lobby believed that some kinds of contraception were \"abortifacients.\" This term was straight out of anti-abortion propagandist John Willke's playbook. It suggested, with no grounding in medical fact, that birth control was tantamount to abortion. In a hotly contested 5-4 decision, the court ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby, opening the door to the erosion of all sorts of hard-won gains in the name of moral objection. Tellingly, the court's majority wrote that the fact that birth control did not actually cause abortions was irrelevant in this context. For a violation of religious liberty to occur, the plaintiff must only believe that it could happen. Four of the five justices who ruled in Hobby Lobby's favor had Federalist Society ties.\n\nThe Hobby Lobby case was a massive triumph for the radical right, underscoring the effectiveness of the mutually reinforcing strategies. The movement had effectively used abortion as a Trojan horse to move the goalpost, limit access to contraception, and enshrine disinformation into the legal canon. For them, it was icing on the cake that the victory undercut the ACA, a crowning achievement for the much-loathed Obama administration. They had effectively reversed one of the most significant national steps forward for gender equity in decades.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage The End of Roe\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nIn the first week of May 2022, a draft decision penned by Justice Samuel Alito was leaked to the press laying bare the intention of the majority of the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. Many legal experts warned immediately that the draft was written to not only eradicate the current federal protection to abortion access, but also to lay the legal groundwork to undo a whole host of other rights guaranteed through the 14th Amendment protecting privacy and equality for all individuals.\n\nAlito repeated a common refrain from right-wing leaders and judges all the way back to Bork that the original interpretation of the 14th Amendment was just wrong. The ground is being set to review and revoke so many hard-won gains, from access to birth control to marriage quality. Six of the current occupants of the Supreme Court were nurtured and backed by the Federalist Society: Justices Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett, as well as Chief Justice John Roberts. The architects' plan has finally come to fruition, but this is only the beginning, not the end, of their quest to make sure we're all living in a world of their creation.\n\nThis article was adapted from the bestselling book \" The Lie That Binds,\" by Ilyse Hogue and Ellie Langford .\n\nWAIT!

The truth is, they actually defend domination and illegitimate power over others.\n\n(Elijah Nouvelage / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe political right often describes itself as the defender of tradition - of the norms, values, and rituals that we cherish, and the communities that sustain them. These two elements are, often correctly, taken as connected. Norms and values cannot be sustained unless they are rooted in stable communities of fellowship. And the community, for its part, is meaningful precisely because of the habits and rituals, the deep sense of mutuality and common values, that it provides its members.\n\nThe Right understands that for most people, these phenomena hold great value, and it assiduously presents itself as their proponent. Conversely, the Left is often presented as contemptuous of tradition. In its critique of the status quo, its association with the forces of change, and its defense of individual rights, the Left is taken to be overturning the very \"way of life\" in which people find meaning. Hence, while the Right is viewed as a defender of the community, the Left is presented as a promoter of an iconoclastic individualism.\n\nThere is certainly an element of truth to this description. The Right has indeed sought to uphold important elements of traditional culture; the Left, for its part, does seek to overturn many institutions inherited from the distant past. Socialist anthems often pick up this theme - \"The Internationale\" talks about remaking the world \"from its foundations,\" while \"Solidarity Forever\" gives us the line about making \"a new world from the ashes of the old.\" But while we can affirm the standard description at a certain level of generality, it probably distorts more than it reveals.\n\nFor starters, the Left has never had an absolute hostility to tradition and community. If it did, it would have almost immediately collapsed as a political force. Socialists and trade unionists have, in fact, worked hard to recover and strengthen practices of resistance in the regions where they organize. These vital practices are nothing other than a culture, a tradition , of struggle. In mining towns, the textile industry, steel mills, lumberyards, ports, and docks - in all these sites, when socialists have organized workers, they have relied upon already existing traditions of resistance and collective struggle.\n\nOnce again, we can see this illustrated in the music of the Left. The Industrial Workers of the World, also known as the Wobblies, were among the most important labor movements in US history, and spearheaded much of the early twentieth century's radical trade unionism. They utilized folk music to develop class consciousness and a sense of community on the picket line, producing figures such as Joe Hill, who would go on to influence future generations of leftist musicians like Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger.\n\nMuch of their most popular material was developed in the Little Red Songbook - but the tunes weren't new. In fact, they were almost all hymn tunes, drawing on biblical traditions. But this wasn't simply an appropriation of religious music: hymn tunes had been part of previous eras of struggle, from abolition to the Civil War and even early labor movement circles. In some cases, the tunes weren't even altered all that greatly. In the 1930s, when the labor movement organized black workers in the American South, they adopted \"We Are Climbing Jacob's Ladder,\" with each rung on the ladder representing a new worker joining the cause.\n\nThe existing traditions of resistance and struggle which the Left draws upon have been built up over decades in order to sustain working-class families in hard times and in their campaigns against their employers. They are multidimensional; in some instances, informal networks that support families in times of dearth, local aid to tide over bouts of unemployment, religious, or cultural institutions that provide moral support; then there are the various literary and symbolic representations that encode the tradition of resistance, such as the kind we have discussed - songs, poems, and legends so commonly found in communities of laboring groups.\n\nIt shouldn't come as a surprise that all of this also translates into a defense of working-class community - in two distinct ways. The first is protective: socialists try to defend and strengthen the collective traditions and shared institutions that working people have created for themselves. They understand that when employers lay off thousands, depress wages, or decamp and take their capital to other regions, they are not just destroying jobs but destroying entire ways of being. They tear up communities, and labor struggle is nothing other than the defense of that community against capital. They embed themselves within that community, become part of it, and join in the fight to sustain it.\n\nThe other way in which they promote community is by building it anew, even where it didn't exist. Socialists understand that the strongest, most destructive effect of capital is to fling people into the labor market, pitting them against one another. Because they are in a constant struggle for jobs and security, workers are forced to confront their peers as a competitive threat, as rivals in the scramble for securing a livelihood. If class organizing is to succeed at all, the forces that pull workers apart have to be counteracted by the creation of organizations that bind them together - unions, neighborhood associations, political parties, working people's clubs, and similar initiatives.\n\nThese organizations often build upon existing cultures of solidarity and struggle, as I have already suggested. In fact, one of the most striking examples of this is the League of the Just - a Christian organization which would eventually form the basis for Marx and Engels's Communist League. But they also have to sometimes create the sense of mutuality where it didn't exist previously. Unions and parties are critical in forging new political identities and, thereby, a new political community, without which political movements would simply collapse.\n\nThese are some of the important respects in which the Left has aligned with tradition, much against the accusation that they care only to upend it. What, then, differentiates their defense of it from the Right? The fact is that neither side adopts a blanket defense of tradition, nor a blanket condemnation. Each one selects elements of the culture that fit with its political goals, and is either indifferent or hostile to those which do not. Each side seeks to strengthen those parts of the culture that align with its goals while weakening those that clash with them. For the Left, this can mean seeking to uphold those traditions that strengthen labor's hand against capital.\n\nBut underlying this is a deeper principle: the elements of the culture that should be preserved are those which undermine illegitimate power. The power of capital over workers is the most important contemporary instance of this. But the principle also encompasses other forms of domination - of gender, race, ethnicity, and nation. Thus, socialists have celebrated traditions of resistance in peasant communities against rural elites, of national struggles against imperial power, women in their demands for reproductive rights. They have even delved further back than this - after all, Rosa Luxemburg's Spartacist League was named for a slave revolt against the Roman Empire which took place two thousand years earlier.\n\nThe Left recognizes that these traditions of resistance are to be found in every culture, in every part of the world. Whether in the Middle East, Asia, Africa, or the Americas, groups facing social domination have generated rich cultures of resistance, and this is why in every such region, the Left has been able to embed its basic principles into local practices and strengthen them. Every left thus becomes a local left, respectful of local traditions of struggle, but still part of a global movement, deploying a general principle against social domination. The general and the specific don't clash, they sustain each other.\n\nIf we turn now to the Right, how does it fare with regard to tradition? There is no dispute that they present themselves as its defenders. But what aspects of it do they uphold? There was a time, in capitalism's infancy, when conservatives could be identified as critics of the market's brutal force, fighting to preserve principles of community and ancient ways against the incursion of market forces. Thus, Edmund Burke was genuinely appalled by capitalism's narrow prioritization of profit above all else, and defended the old ways against its corrosive forces.\n\nThis was a conservatism still married to a feudal ethos. But by the middle of the twentieth century, the class alignment of conservatism had changed. By this time, the 1950s, conservatives and the Right no longer represented the fight of agrarian elites against an encroaching capitalist market. The order they were seeking to uphold was capitalism, and the class they served was the one of capital, in its fight against rising labor movements around the world. Far from seeking to preserve the ancient order, they now litigated for capitalism against demands for redistribution and socialism.\n\nThis realignment in the class basis of the Right makes its self-association with tradition a little awkward. As representatives of capital, it is hard to fathom how they can be viewed as defenders of community and its principles. As early conservatives were the first to point out, capitalism is driven to undermine community, and with it the most hallowed traditions. It is a system that prioritizes profit above all else, and in seeking the highest returns, investors don't hesitate for a minute to overturn past practices, break up communities, rip asunder binding social ties, or hurl millions into the labor market.\n\nIn this, it is the Right that is contemptuous of the \"old ways,\" not the Left. But just as in the case of the Left, it is not that conservatives have a total disregard for inherited practices either. They too have a principle of selection, however inchoate it might be and however hard they work to obscure it. And it is simple: the traditions that they uphold are the ones that help sustain the sanctity of private property.\n\nSo aspects of culture that empower working people, the very ones that the Left works to support and strengthen, are the ones that the Right either ignores or actively undermines: the expectation, so common to feudal economies, that individuals had rights over common resources, the tradition of mutual support, the institutions of collective struggle - all of these aspects of tradition have been directly attacked by the contemporary right.\n\nBut even more pointedly, in its defense of property, the Right is the most committed proponent of individualism that the world has ever seen. For what is private property but the ultimate assertion of the individual over the community? Property rights endow the capitalist with a tremendous power over the rest of the population.\n\nIt is a power that determines who has a livelihood and who doesn't; who has security and who doesn't; what the standard of living will be for thousands, even millions; a power to dispose of their labor, and thereby their persons, for much of their waking time. And this power is sustained and defended against their collective demands for redress; it is a power of the individual against the community, asserted and upheld against that community. That very power is then deployed in a manner that tears apart their social fabric - with a cold, remorseless logic.\n\nSocialists have been fierce critics of tradition, but not because they harbor wholesale antagonism to old ways; what they attacked were the components of the culture that sustained the social dominance of capital, that inhibited people's drive for self-determination. They didn't invent this principle, they simply articulated it. It was already present in the everyday struggle of working people to keep their heads above water in a ruthless market system.\n\nThese struggles were motivated by the very drive for autonomy and freedom from domination that the Left crafted into a theory and an ideology. And it will continue to motivate working people even if the Left disappears tomorrow. But this long history of critique, which the Left embraces, should not paint them as rootless cosmopolitans, as compulsive iconoclasts. That distinction belongs to the defenders of capital. As Tony Benn once wrote, \"I'm a traditionalist. There are two sorts of tradition. There's the tradition of obedience, deference, hierarchy and discipline; then there's a different tradition which we celebrate: of independence, of human rights, of democracy, of internationalism.\" While the current Left continues its revitalization, it will, just as every earlier generation did, embed itself in the everyday lives of working people. As it does, it too will excavate and strengthen traditions of struggle; it too will seek to defend the community against market forces, and build community where it has been torn apart. And it will advocate for the rejection of some traditions - those that stand in the way of people living secure, dignified lives.\n\nThis article is republished from the latest issue of Tribune .\n\nVivek Chibber is a professor of sociology at New York University.

But last week, these two places might as well have been on different planets. As congressional Democrats clenched their jaws and paced the halls trying to figure a way out of the mess that is the imploding Joe Biden campaign, the mood at the conference center was bright. The common areas were filled with smiling people in the requisite business casual attire - a mixture of young and old, almost all white, and mostly men - casually sipping coffees and pleasantly chatting. Strolling through these spaces, I overheard snippets of conversations about plans for the future: new jobs, hiring strategies, and next steps for the movement.\n\nInside the Presidential Ballroom, the first session's tone was similarly upbeat. Christopher DeMuth, former head of the American Enterprise Institute and current conference organizer, welcomed the audience \"to the mainstream\" of the conservative movement. Next up was Yoram Hazony, the Israeli American political theorist and chairman of the Edmund Burke Foundation, which hosted the event. Co-opting the slogan of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign, his opening speech, entitled \"Yes, We Can,\" began by underscoring how far their movement had already come.\n\n\"People are not afraid to use the word 'nation' anymore,\" Hazony declared. \"That's a great success.\"\n\nThen came Rachel Bovard, a vice president at the Conservative Partnership Institute and rising right-wing firebrand, who proclaimed, \"For the first time, we can look around and say we're winning. The wind is at our backs.\"\n\nRounding out the opening plenary, Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, pronounced, \"This is the future of the conservative movement and the next era.\" Calling it \"the second American Revolution,\" Roberts predicted \"a political, cultural, and social wresting from the Left all those institutions and centers of power they have steadily co-opted over several decades.\"\n\nFor the past five years, the National Conservatism Conference , or NatCon, has brought together a veritable who's who of New Right politicians, intellectuals, and movement builders from the United States and Europe. Since 2019, this group of conservative elites has been on a mission to remake the intellectual foundations of right-wing politics in the aftermath of Donald Trump's rise.\n\nPrevious NatCon events in DC, Miami, London, and Brussels were billed as laboratories of ideas for a self-consciously \"post-liberal\" right that rejects liberal individualism and libertarian economics and promises to restore the centrality of religion, family, and nation to the conservative movement. Over the years, countless sessions have been devoted to the \"New Nationalism,\" the \"New Jewish-Christian Alliance,\" the \"New Conservative Populism,\" and the \"New Natalism.\"\n\nBut even as these ideas ascended on the political scene, the official mood of National Conservatism was dark and pessimistic. Speaking from their podiums, the right-wing elites who presided over these sessions routinely railed against the rise of \"liberal totalitarianism\" and complained that American institutions had been taken over by \"woke Neo-Marxists\" who were silencing conservative voices and destroying the nation. In the past, conference speakers routinely called for conservatives to fight back and win the existential battle against the \"woke elites.\" Indeed, they insisted, the very survival of Western civilization depended on it.\n\nYet, as Helen Lewis observed in the Atlantic last year, the Right's dark worldview also demanded a sense of always being on the losing side of the war. Preoccupied with the Left's power, NatCon events often felt more like highly elevated bitching sessions - with plenty of talk about the rise of the \"Gramscian\" left, the domination of \"secular religion,\" and the crisis of the \"birth dearth\" - and less like a plan for actually restoring civilization whose proponents thought they stood a chance of winning.\n\nThe atmosphere felt markedly different this time around. To be sure, dark apocalyptic leitmotifs of left-wing hegemony were still the driving force and spiritual energy of virtually every session I attended.\n\n\"We are in a cold civil war,\" declared Tom Klingenstein, the chairman of the board at the Claremont Institute, on the second day of the conference. \"We are in a war with an enemy that would destroy us.\" That enemy is the \"woke group quota regime.\" Republicans still \"don't know we're in a war,\" he insisted.\n\nKlingenstein's own Claremont Institute played a central role in leading the legal efforts to challenge the 2020 election and subsequent initiatives to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs across the nation. But calling too much attention to these activities would undermine the Right's image of itself as passive victims of an oppressive left.\n\nAs the prospect of a second Trump presidency looms, however, more NatCons have started to publicly acknowledge their actual and potential power. Almost against their will, many have adopted a more confident vibe and a sense of excitement about the future. They are also lining up to help take over the administrative \"deep state\" that the Right has historically vilified. As Bovard, whose organization has been actively leading conservative efforts to roll back progressive achievements, concluded in her opening remarks, \"Let's get to work.\"\n\nReactionary planning , as we might call this paradoxical amalgam of elite victimization and ambitious administrative organizing, is having its moment. Project 2025 , the Heritage Foundation's nine-hundred-plus page plan for a second Trump presidency, and the 2024 GOP policy platform have recently been in the spotlight. But these documents, while certainly illuminating, provide a relatively cold and bureaucratic version of what that future might look like. You sometimes need to read between the lines to get a real understanding of the stakes. Over the course of three days, the NatCons conveyed their vision for taking back the administrative state in more vivid detail and with a greater sense of the human drama that will unfold should the Right seize power and use the tools of governance to finally \"own the libs\" once and for all.\n\nIn a packed breakout session on immigration, Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a hard-right nativist outfit that poses as a neutral think tank, began by discussing plans in other countries, including Britain and Israel, for deporting refugees to Rwanda. Acknowledging that these far-right initiatives had all unraveled under judicial or political opposition, he nonetheless offered his own more ambitious \"Remain in Mongolia\" plan as a form of deterrence against would-be asylum seekers.\n\nIt could be \"Botswana or Armenia,\" he explained. The point, Krikorian underscored, is that the numbers will go down \"if crossing the border simply lands you in Ulan Bakur,\" mispronouncing Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia. Although \"I hear it's nice this time of year,\" he added, \"nonetheless, that's not what you're looking for,\" and \"the incentive is going to disappear.\"\n\nBut even this would only be \"second-best,\" he explained. As executive initiatives, such programs can be \"undone by future administrations.\" Underscoring the need for a more permanent solution, Krikorian laid out a plan for the United States to withdraw from all international covenants - including the convention on refugees, the convention against torture, and the covenant on civil and political rights - that legally bind the nation to protect asylum seekers.\n\n\"Asylum,\" he concluded, \"must not be available to illegal immigrants. Period.\"\n\nHe was followed by Tom Homan, the former director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the first Trump administration, who promised, \"If Trump comes back, I will run the biggest deportation operation this country's ever seen. They ain't seen shit yet. Wait until 2025.\"\n\nKevin Lynn, executive director of Progressives for Immigration Reform, an organization whose name obscures its political alignment with the Right, then conveyed a host of ideas for how to curtail legal, as well as illegal, immigration, including ending programs aimed at workers in STEM fields, reducing the number of student visas, and asking foreign tourists to declare their pregnancies to prevent \"anchor baby tourism.\"\n\nOn the main stage after the lunch break, Stephen Miller, Trump's diabolical sidekick on all things immigration, panned out from these policy plans to reframe the bigger political picture on immigrants. His speech exemplified reactionary planners' amalgam of vindictiveness and uplift. After railing against the Joe Biden administration for knowingly letting the \"world's fugitives, predators, and rapists\" into the country, he concluded with a note of inspiration. \"Choose victory, choose optimism. Choose hope.\"\n\nAnother session on \"lawfare\" featured a group of conservative legal luminaries who shared their plans for fighting back against progressives who had used the justice system to wage war against Trump and his allies during the Biden administration. The legal scholar John Yoo, who made a name for himself defending torture in the post-9/11 era, put it most plainly when he explained that conservatives had no choice but to prosecute their political enemies as well.\n\n\"Unfortunately,\" Yoo lamented, \"we're going to have to use banana republic means and prosecute them too until they stop.\"\n\n\"Democrats do not change unless they feel the pain of their own rules,\" concurred Will Chamberlain, who currently serves as senior counsel at the Federalist Society. He went on to name the individuals at the top of the Right's hit list: Fani Willis, the Fulton County district attorney and lead prosecutor in the case against Trump in Georgia; Kristen Clarke, who currently heads the civil rights division in the Department of Justice; Juan Merchan, the judge who presided over the \"hush-money\" trial in New York; and, of course, Attorney General Merrick Garland.\n\nHighlighting an urgent need for conservative lawyers to demonstrate more \"loyalty\" to the movement, Chamberlain also envisioned a broader internal campaign to pressure these \"summer soldiers\" - as he called them, quoting Thomas Paine - into supporting the cause. In the Q and A portion, eager young lawyers stepped up to the mic and asked how they could get involved.\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, given the Supreme Court's historic decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022 , the session on the pro-life movement was comparatively more somber. Introducing the panel, Catholic University professor Chad Pecknold declared, \"The post- Dobbs reality is more difficult than ever.\" Numerous speakers complained about the difficulties of enacting abortion bans at the state level and expressed anger at the Republican Party for dialing back its pro-life agenda in the new platform.\n\nUndaunted, however, the panelists agreed that leaving abortion up to the states was insufficient and discussed plans for acting at the federal level.\n\nKaty Talento, who served as \"health adviser\" on Trump's Domestic Policy Council from 2017 to 2019, detailed how Biden's \"army of bureaucrats and political appointees have been quietly transforming federal agencies into Planned Parenthood\" and sketched out plans for reversing those policies. The Food and Drug Administration, she said, could invoke safety issues to clamp down on the use of abortion drugs. With the help of artificial intelligence, which could be used to speed up the lengthy process of judicial review, an army of political appointees could work to roll back Biden-era regulations that undermine the pro-life movement.\n\n\"Everyone needs to start early,\" she insisted. \"The new administration is going to need all the help it can get.\"\n\nThis is not to say that the conference speakers all sang in unison or offered coherent plans for every arena of governance. Despite broad agreement in many areas, there remained notable splits and contradictions on major issues. While the NatCons pride themselves on opposing \"globalism\" and were generally cool towards NATO, the conference organizers studiously avoided a full session on Ukraine, a conflict that continues to divide the Right. Meanwhile, the panel on Israel felt like a trip in the DeLorean to the 9/11 era. Conservative journalist Ben Weingarten, who seems to have imbibed his views from the Rudy Giuliani-era Manhattan Institute, went on about the rise of Islamism and the threat of sharia law being enacted in the United States. Details of the current war in Gaza were hardly mentioned, nor was the problem of self-proclaimed US nationalists offering billions of dollars of unconditional support to a recalcitrant client state.\n\nEconomics was another area of notable tension. A breakout session on \"working-class conservatism\" featured several individuals who claimed to represent a new direction in the movement's stance on labor. But when issues of actual policy came up, this facade quickly crumbled.\n\nRiley Moore, West Virginia's state treasurer and a self-professed defender of \"blue-collar\" conservatism, admitted that, as a legislator, he had voted for right-to-work laws, a crucial weapon in the conservative war against unions. Despite branding themselves pro-worker, Riley and other panelists evaded questions about the PRO Act , the most important piece of labor legislation in decades, and were more than happy to dismiss the AFL-CIO, the United Auto Workers, and public-sector unions on the grounds that they are associated with progressive cultural causes.\n\nEarlier that morning, on the main stage, GOP senators Mike Lee of Utah, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, and Rick Scott of Florida, who have much more power to do something about labor issues, rattled on about balancing budgets, cutting taxes, and slashing regulations. It's revealing that the Tea Party wing of the GOP, which still preaches the gospel of trickle-down economics, is also feeling the wind at its back.\n\n\"We can do it. And we must do it,\" declared Lee in reference to their austerity-happy fiscal vision.\n\nThis moment underscored the essence of reactionary planning. While ostensibly forward-looking, its goal is ultimately a return to an idealized past when, as many speakers wistfully recalled, men were men, women were women, and the Christian Bible was taught in every school.\n\nIt's too soon to say whether the Right will be able to accomplish this ambitious agenda. But if they can advance even a small fraction of their plans, a lot of pain and suffering will be in store at both the individual and institutional levels, especially for immigrants, people of color, women, and workers. Listening to these speakers reinforced my own sense of impending doom at the idea of a second Trump presidency.\n\nAt the same time, I could not help feeling a twinge of envy. The Right is currently experiencing the kind of hope that I remember feeling, however fleetingly, back in 2008, when Obama borrowed his \"Yes We Can\" slogan from Dolores Huerta , who coined the phrase for the United Farm Workers' 1972 organizing campaign. It is the feeling so many of us experienced even more profoundly in 2016, when Bernie Sanders ascended on the national scene and upended the neoliberal consensus within the Democratic Party.\n\nUnfortunately, that kind of optimism is pretty much off the table for progressives in 2024.\n\nBecause the Democratic leadership was willfully blind to the most fundamental realities of Biden's future, we are now all facing the likelihood of a second Trump administration. In this moment, the best we can hope for is that the Democrats can replace Biden with a younger and more charismatic candidate who has a fighting chance against Trump.\n\nBut in the long run, even as progressives expose and vehemently oppose the Right's reactionary plans, they must also do more to provide an alternative vision. Leftism, after all, is supposed to be oriented toward the future. And that requires forging a more forward-looking vision and being bold about advancing it, even when doing so feels risky. Otherwise, we will be resigned to a future of reactionary rule from which the nation might never recover.\n\nHannah Gurman is an associate professor at New York University's Gallatin School of Individualized Study and is working on a book about capitalism and the culture wars.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nLast November, conservative commentator Ross Douthat penned a provocative column titled \"How the Right Became the Left and the Left Became the Right.\" \"One of the master keys to understanding our era,\" Douthat wrote in the opening paragraph, \"is seeing all the ways in which conservatives and progressives have traded attitudes and impulses.\"\n\nThe populist right's attitude toward American institutions has the flavor of the 1970s - skeptical, pessimistic, paranoid - while the mainstream, MSNBC-watching left has a strange new respect for the F.B.I. and C.I.A. The online right likes transgression for its own sake, while cultural progressivism dabbles in censorship and worries that the First Amendment goes too far. Trumpian conservatism flirts with postmodernism and channels Michel Foucault; its progressive rivals are institutionalist, moralistic, confident in official narratives and establishment credentials.\n\nDespite some terminological imprecision - Douthat often writes of \"the Left\" when he really means \"liberals\" - the argument speaks to something real.\n\nWhile liberals of the Bush era worried about mass surveillance and government overreach, today's liberal mainstream champions the sanctity of institutions and views the likes of courts, security agencies, and misinformation regulators as a bulwark against the Right. As Donald Trump insulted his way into the executive branch, liberals bludgeoned Bernie Sanders and his supporters with bad-faith social-justice critiques and made prudish appeals to consensus and decency. The Republican affect, by contrast, has increasingly drawn on themes of dissent and rebellion, with a politics of trolling and an aesthetic of 4chan-esque vulgarity supplanting the comparatively upright style once associated with figures like Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush.\n\nThere's a certain elegance in seeing contemporary politics like this: censorious and oversensitive Brahmins sermonizing about institutional authority in one corner and a newly irreverent right pursuing a frenzied and paranoid style in the other. It isn't entirely wrong, but it's not exactly right either. In its tidiness, such a narrative elides the important ways that the Right now engages in its own version of the very politics it claims to deplore. Conservatism, in this sense, has not so much traded places with liberalism as converged with some of its shallowest and most illiberal instincts.\n\nRecently, conservatives launched a crusade against brewing company Anheuser-Busch in response to an innocuous advertising collaboration with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. Breweries have reportedly been targeted with bomb threats, and one right-leaning company has seized upon the situation to launch a service called \"Woke Alerts\" that will warn consumers \" when companies cave to the woke mob .\" The episode is instructive for several reasons, among them that the campaign so obviously mirrors the very sensibility it purports to be resisting. In effect, the Right's go-to reaction to what it imagines are woke mobs is to create woke mobs of its own.\n\nThe incident is merely one example of a wider zeitgeist currently reflected in mass campaigns to get books with black or LGBTQ themes pulled from library shelves, draconian legislation to discipline academics who teach particular subjects, heavy-handed regulation of free expression in public-school classrooms, and sinister directives to state agencies targeting transgender children and their parents. \"Woke capitalism\" has, meanwhile, become conservatism's favorite bête noire, inspiring absurd freakouts about everything from Disney's ostensible promotion of socialism to Pride-themed Oreo packaging . The related concept of \"ESG\" ( Environmental and Social Governance ) is set to be the subject of congressional hearings that will, like Woke Alerts, target investors thought to be undermining profits in pursuit of a \"woke\" agenda.\n\nConservatives, in effect, have recognized the socially liberal bent of modern America - and they absolutely hate it. The result is a politics increasingly indistinguishable from the most exaggerated right-wing caricature of censorious social-justice warrior liberalism.\n\nAnother irony of this posture is that it has seen conservatives embrace a key premise of the shallow social-justice ethos that now pervades the upper echelons of some large corporations. True, they may hate it when leviathans like Amazon and Nike issue statements in support of Black Lives Matter or partner with transgender TikTok stars. But, in lockstep with the marketing teams at these very companies, conservatives accept the corporate alignment with various social-justice causes as something genuine rather than a branding exercise. On this, they agree with an influential section of American liberals: \"woke capitalism\" exists.\n\nYet the whole idea of so-called woke capitalism is absurd on its face. Large profitable corporations are, by definition, driven by cold-market calculus, not the pursuit of social justice in anything but the hollowest sense. Insofar as some corporations bend toward social liberalism, it's mostly because there's a greater market share to be found there - on major issues like trans rights and abortion , conservatism is very much a minority proposition in today's America - and because it can be an effective inoculant when their owners and bosses are caught union busting, running exploitative workplaces, or contributing to climate change. It's a cynical and often nakedly hypocritical branding exercise undertaken by people thinking about their bottom lines and little more. If the Right is wrong to attack woke capital, liberals are wrong to celebrate it.\n\nIt's one thing to find fault with the moralism that pervades some liberal milieus, or to roll one's eyes in the direction of Wall Street banks or entertainment conglomerates trying to cash in on social-justice branding. The fact remains, however, that it is not oversensitive liberals who are crusading against Bud Light, trying to get books banned en masse , or enforcing parochial ideas about gender and sexuality through state legislation. In the narcotic haze of the culture war, it is all too easy to overlook the extent to which America's conservative minority has become a mirror image of the very thing it purports to deplore: a shrill and inflexible mass that not only mistakes consumption for politics but demands protection, at all times, from facts, people, and ideas that make it uncomfortable.\n\nLuke Savage is a staff writer at Jacobin .

But our social order is the product of human decisions - and it can be remade to benefit the many rather than the few.\n\nConservatives like Roger Scruton are right to regard themselves as defending a more ancient set of ideas than their liberal and socialist rivals. (Awakening / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWhen Roger Scruton died early last year at the age of seventy-five, right-wing outlets hailed him as \"the most important conservative thinker of his era,\" even \" sacred .\" The honorifics were understandable. The British philosopher possessed a rare combination of theoretical intelligence and expository panache that made him both a deep and accessible thinker. Whereas conservative figures like Jordan Peterson and Ben Shapiro blow a lot of hot air complaining about Marxist authors, Scruton took the increasingly novel step of actually reading leftists and meticulously responding to their points.\n\nBut I've come here to criticize Sir Roger, not praise him, and Scruton's virtues should not blind us to the severe ethical and political flaws of his traditionalist conservatism. So I want to do two things. First, explore Scruton's conservatism and what it tells us about the right-wing worldview. And second, explain one of the key moves in the conservative playbook: to naturalize power and existing forms of authority. For thinkers like Scruton, such arrangements are to be revered and rarely questioned - yet like Dorothy's Oz, when you look past the flash and bang and peel back the curtain of power, the authorities Scruton defends often look not only unimpressive but theoretically and morally bankrupt.\n\n-Roger Scruton, The Meaning of Conservatism\n\nConservatives like Scruton are right to regard themselves as defending a more ancient set of ideas than their liberal and socialist rivals: in this case, the notion that inequalities - whether of virtue, status, wealth, or strength - are natural and should be reflected in society. But modern conservatism is in fact younger than left-wing politics, arising as a response to Enlightenment-era revolutions in France, Haiti, and the United States.\n\nFor early thinkers on the Left - who insisted that individuals were moral equals and thus deserving of political and economic rights - a central task was to unmask power by revealing its contradictions, hypocrisies, and reliance on violence and coercion. Above all, they argued that the world as it is doesn't conform to some inviolable pattern, vindicated either by nature or religion. It is the product of human decisions, and thus capable of being remade.\n\nThis desacralized vision of political society, with authority exposed as mere power, was anathema to early conservatives like Edmund Burke. They castigated their opponents' \"abstract\" and chaotic visions of the world and claimed to be \"realists,\" unmoved by fanciful visions. When progressive movements toppled their preferred authorities (kings, priests, even slaveowners), reactionaries and counterrevolutionaries fought to restore the \"proper order of things\" in some modified form.\n\nRight-wing intellectuals labored, often begrudgingly, to reinvest the toppled system of power with moral gravity - to, in a sense, sublimate power as authority. I say begrudgingly because, as Scruton himself noted, conservatives have traditionally preferred the \"natural instinct in unthinking people - who, tolerant of the burdens that life lays on them, and unwilling to lodge blame where they seek no remedy, seek fulfillment in the world as it is - to accept and endorse through their actions the institutions and practices into which they are born.\" In an ideal world, conservatism would need only offer reaffirmations rather than apologetics and counterblows. After all, the danger of defending power is that it implies power is open to analysis and criticism - and not, as conservative philosopher Russell Kirk put it, an \"enduring moral order\" beyond critique.\n\nIn his book On Human Nature , Scruton calls our attention to an interesting (and, to my mind, correct) point from Hegel: my sense of being me, of being an I, depends on an immense net of inherited social relations. The autonomous \"I\" of liberal theory, creating a wholly independent identity, simply isn't tenable.\n\nBut Scruton takes this point much further: he argues, in true conservative fashion, that inherited social relations shouldn't be subjected to scrutiny because they are \"sacred\" - a move that very quickly becomes an apologia for some people getting more power than others. Later in the book, Scruton says we should adopt a posture \"of submission and obedience toward authorities that you have never chosen. The obligations of piety, unlike the obligations of contract, do not arise from the consent to be bound by them.\" He goes on to claim that the \"main task of political conservatism, as represented by Burke, Maistre, and Hegel, was to put obligations of piety back where they belong, at the center of the picture.\"\n\nAt times, Scruton lends the point a sentimental gloss by likening it to a filial obligation. Just as a child loves and appreciates their parents, so too should we accept the guidance, protection, and, yes, discipline that those in power mete out. Scruton makes this association most explicit in his metaphysical tome The Soul of the World : \"Not all of our obligations are freely undertaken, and created by choice. Some we receive 'from outside the will.' . . . It is hardly surprising, therefore, if they are wound into the order of things by moments of sacrificial awe.\"\n\nScruton's analogy between a political association and a family is wildly, even comically, stretched. Putting aside the fact that abusive families and marriages warrant dissolution, a political union is ultimately backed not by mutual relations of love and assistance but violence. Scruton gestures at this, rather disturbingly, when he talks about \"securing society against the forces of selfish desire\" through \"sacrificial awe.\"\n\nThe obvious question is whether those who would sacrifice others for their preferred \"eternal\" social order are in fact the selfless ones dedicated to filial love and community. But there is a deeper point here. Underneath Scruton's call to defer to political and economic authorities is a history of prisons, imperial wars, torture of dissidents, mass starvation, genocide, racism, poverty, patriarchal abuse, and more. From the perspective of those who have suffered and died at the hands of such authorities, calls for pious reverence can only seem a mockery. If such is to be our god, we should celebrate the death of God.\n\nIt would overstate things to call Scruton an out-and-out apologist for authoritarianism (though he had a sneaky habit of going soft on regimes like Franco's Spain, Pinochet's Chile , and the post-antebellum South ). Scruton was squarely in the tradition of British \"ordered liberty\" conservatism, accepting many of the classical liberal freedoms when complemented by a respect for traditional authorities, practices, and culture mores. What he opposed, above all, was the idea that political allegiance should be seen as voluntary and that individuals should be free to recreate society as they like.\n\nHis main target on this point was the \"social contract\" tradition inaugurated by Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau and carried on in the twentieth century by thinkers like Rawls and Nozick. Social contract theorists argue that it is voluntary consent, not mere allegiance, that grants political and economic authorities their legitimacy. If I never explicitly agreed to respect political power, or to venerate the existing regime of property rights, then I am under no obligation to do so.\n\nScruton is relentlessly critical of this idea, arguing that it animates a wildly emancipatory impulse that quickly becomes destructive. In Fools, Frauds and Firebrands: Thinkers of the New Left , he pillories the \"restless\" demands for liberation since the French Revolution, always seeking out new victims and \"emancipation of the structures: from the institutions, customs and conventions that shaped the 'bourgeois' order, and which established a shared systems of norms and values at the heart of Western society.\"\n\nThere's a long history of right-wing intellectuals criticizing the contractarian model. Edmund Burke famously mocked its rootless abstraction before putting forth his own grandiose vision of political society as a contract between \"those who are living, those who are dead, and those who are to be born.\" In Burke's mind, no generation is entitled to break the \"great and primaeval contract of eternal society\" that allocates \"all physical and moral natures\" to their appointed place.\" Rather than a voluntary contract, Burke's covenant is a duty imposed upon all, the high and the low alike, to keep to their appointed place.\n\nScruton's criticisms are in the same vein. He claims that our pious obligations to respect authority are unlike a contract because they \"do not arise from the consent to be bound by them\" but instead from the \"predicament of the individual.\" I am born into a system of political authority and hierarchical traditions, which apparently requires me to not just tolerate but revere them.\n\nThis is an extremely bizarre claim that no one would consistently hold to, Scruton included. No person born into, say, Hitler's Germany had a moral obligation to revere the authorities - quite the opposite. The only criteria Scruton seems to accept in differentiating the good authorities from the bad is ultimately aesthetic - those who seem worthy of respect just are. Scruton writes in The Meaning of Conservatism that \"it does not matter if the reason\" for venerating traditional authority \"cannot be voiced by the person who obeys it\" because tradition is enacted and \"not designed.\"\n\nScruton is right to criticize the hyper-libertarian vision of a social contract, which assumes only those obligations I deliberately chose are binding upon me. But this vision was never adopted by any of the classical social contract theorists or contemporaries like John Rawls. For these theorists, the point of thinking about a hypothetical social contract was to determine what kind of political system a group of equals would choose for themselves.\n\nPredictably, the result of this exercise is usually more egalitarian and free than conservatives are willing to permit, since no contractor in an equal position would accept a political system that severely limited their personal freedom or left them deeply impoverished. They would demand a political system that worked in the interests of all, not just the few.\n\nSo the real problem with the contractarian model for conservatives like Scruton is that it inspires us to think of political authority as mere power that must continuously justify its legitimacy to all those it seeks to rule, and not just those who benefit from it. Where power fails to do so, we are under no obligation to obey, let alone revere, the authorities. We may even be obligated to overthrow them.\n\nIt is this emancipatory and revolutionary impulse that has inspired the liberatory movements that have arisen since the French Revolution. And we are all the better for them.\n\nMuch of human history has conformed to Thucydides's gloomy diagnosis that \"the strong do as they will, and the weak suffer what they must.\" Whatever improvement we've seen in modern times has been inspired by the idea that there is nothing morally impressive about mere strength and power - that in fact they have all too often accrued in the hands of people like Donald Trump or Jair Bolsonaro who are comically ill-equipped to command much of anything.\n\nRather than revere authority or wealth and ask what we owe it, we should recognize that any granting of authority and power is contingent upon what it does for all. It is this ideal of a truly just society that we should venerate and seek to create - not the rust and fantasia of sacred power that conservatives like Scruton would have us bow before.\n\nMatt McManus is a lecturer at the University of Calgary.

Which is why governments pursue them in the first place.\n\nHLIT / Jacobin\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe thinking behind \"fiscal conservatism\" and austerity measures holds that government programs are inefficient, so we should aim to curtail government spending, privatize government assets, and lower taxes. We are told that ending homelessness, providing universal early childcare, healthcare, or higher education are unrealistic policies that would require spending far beyond our means.\n\nIn reality, though, the arguments made by the fiscal conservatives - saving money, efficiency, less government spending - don't align with the policies they are trying to implement. Fiscal conservatism is a myth, because cutting government programs doesn't actually reduce government spending.\n\nThere is a well-known theory of economics related to us by Terry Pratchett in his book Men at Arms , through a character named Vimes. The theory is basically that being poor is more expensive than being rich.\n\nTake boots, for example. [Vimes] earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was ... on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles. But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.\n\nFiscal conservatism is trying to get us to buy the cheap boots - and doing so causes us to spend more money than if we had just bought the good boots in the first place.\n\nMany social programs that fiscal conservatives advocate cutting have been shown to actually save the government money in the long run.\n\nLet's take providing affordable housing and adequate shelters in order to end homelessness as an example. In the rare moments such policies are even discussed, we are told that public affordable housing provision and shelters are too expensive to be feasible.\n\nBut academic research has shown that homelessness is actually very expensive, because homeless people tend to cost the government a great deal of money in healthcare and criminal justice system services. In fact, people experiencing homelessness tend to cost $3,810 per person per year greater than the average citizen in terms of justice services and $10,217 per person greater than the average citizen in terms of healthcare services. The cost of homelessness support programs range from a couple thousand dollars to just over $14,000 per person annually.\n\nSet aside any moral obligation we might have to help the homeless - failing to meaningfully address homelessness is the more costly policy. We simply cannot afford austerity.\n\nThe same logic applies to universal early childcare. While fiscal conservatives tell us that we cannot afford quality universal early childcare, the truth is that we can't afford not to have it.\n\nEconomic data shows us that providing universal early childcare actually saves the government money. This is because without it, childcare becomes so expensive that many parents face the impossible choice between working during the day or taking care of their child. One parent (disproportionately mothers) will often need to stay home and take care of the child. If that person is a single parent, they may have to go on welfare.\n\nBy providing universal early childcare, the government allows more parents to enter the labor force, get off of welfare, and generate taxable income. While the childcare program in Quebec is far from perfect, it has become clear that for \"every dollar [they] invest, they recoup $1.05.\"\n\nThere are a litany of similar cases: why does every state spend more money per inmate than they do per student? Programs that keep people out of prison by giving them the social support they need cost far less than prison, but fiscal conservatives are always telling us to live within our means. Spending on social programs also creates more economic growth than tax cuts for the wealthy, because lower-income people are more likely to spend their money (generating a ripple effect of growth), whereas wealthy people just put their money in the bank, taking it out of circulation in the economy.\n\nSupporting social programs reduces government spending in the long run. Nevertheless, fiscal conservatives and neoliberals continue to insist on implementing austerity policies that harm us all.\n\nThis isn't because they aren't aware of how social spending budget cuts shake out over the long term. They're less concerned with which policies are ideologically consistent or financially sound, and more concerned with preventing the kind of redistribution of wealth and power from the top to the bottom which increased social spending provides.\n\nIf it costs a bit more over time to structure budgets this way, so be it: spending extra on pair after pair of cheap shoes is worth it if the shoes are so shoddy that the working class can't kick your ass with them.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

(FPG / Archive Photos / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIn the depths of the McCarthy era, the American Library Association (ALA) released an eloquent statement in defense of intellectual freedom and free expression called \"The Freedom to Read.\" Subsequently updated and endorsed by a host of other organizations, the current version begins:\n\nThe freedom to read is essential to our democracy. It is continuously under attack. Private groups and public authorities in various parts of the country are working to remove or limit access to reading materials, to censor content in schools, to label \"controversial\" views, to distribute lists of \"objectionable\" books or authors, and to purge libraries. These actions apparently rise from a view that our national tradition of free expression is no longer valid; that censorship and suppression are needed to counter threats to safety or national security, as well as to avoid the subversion of politics and the corruption of morals. We, as individuals devoted to reading and as librarians and publishers responsible for disseminating ideas, wish to assert the public interest in the preservation of the freedom to read.\n\nThen and now, the ALA's statement gets at a deep and important truth. Coordinated efforts to target particular books or limit their reach have long been a canary in the coal mine for creeping censorship and authoritarianism - a reality as concerning in 2023 as it was during the McCarthy era. Amid the torrential discourse of today's culture war, however, it's easy to get a mistaken impression about where such efforts are really coming from.\n\nFor over two decades, the ALA has been compiling data about attempted bans in public and school libraries. Its newly released findings for 2022 suggest a growing appetite for censorship across the United States. The organization tracked a record 1,269 demands to censor library books and resources last year - an increase of 38 percent from 2021.\n\nA demand, as the director of ALA's Office for Intellectual Freedom Deborah Caldwell-Stone puts it , is an attempt \"to remove a book from a library's collection so that no one else can read it.\" Of the reported challenges, about 60 percent were aimed at materials in school libraries, with the remainder targeting those in public libraries.\n\nAlarming as it is, the ALA's top-line number actually understates the problem. Most of the registered 1,269 demands involved multiple titles, with four in ten taking aim at over a hundred books. (Before 2021, by contrast, the organization notes that \"the vast majority of challenges to library resources only sought to remove or restrict access to a single book.\") Such efforts appear to be the result of well-organized campaigns rather than some spontaneous surge in citizen or parental concern.\n\nIn recent years, some liberals have attempted to remove particular books from libraries or school curricula, a few of them successfully - most often because they contain racist language or imagery. But organizations like the ALA and PEN who monitor book challenges and censorship are absolutely categorical that such examples are dwarfed by those originating from the Right. Conservatives are banning books in America, not liberals.\n\nWhile the ALA has yet to release its annual list of the top ten banned books for 2022, we need only glance at its findings from the previous year for a clue about the kinds of titles that will almost certainly be included. Overwhelmingly, the ALA's 2021 list featured books containing LGBTQ-themed content or material some consider sexually explicit. As Caldwell-Stone told MSNBC earlier this month, these developments are overwhelmingly the product of conservative intolerance rather than liberal censoriousness:\n\nIt's just reflective of what we're seeing in the numbers this year. It's no longer a conversation between an educator and a librarian and a parent about a book the parent has concerns about. We're seeing organized political attacks on our libraries and on our school libraries, intending to limit books to what is politically approved, morally approved, that fits the narrow agenda of the groups that are bringing these challenges. Make no mistake about it: they've got lists of bad books. You can go to social media, you can go to their websites, and what you find are lists of disapproved books. . . . Someone will show up at the board meeting with a list of books they haven't read, haven't seen, haven't put in context, and demand their removal because they don't fit someone's agenda about being gay [or] being black.\n\nIt's fair to be concerned about the way some liberals have come to think about teaching books that contain dated or offensive language, or to take issue with the way some publishers are now opting to sanitize old titles. When it comes to schools, there can also be reasonable disagreement about what is age appropriate or best suited for inclusion in a particular curriculum. But even if you do have such concerns, it's a fact that the vast majority of efforts aimed at removing books from America's library systems are the result of campaigns by organized conservative groups rather than progressive activists or oversensitive college students.\n\nIn this respect, they are ripples in a much larger wave of right - wing intolerance that is currently rolling across the country, usually under the same fraudulent aegis of protecting the young from a narrow ideological agenda. Trying to get books removed from library shelves clearly does the opposite - and should be met with full-throated opposition from anyone who believes in democracy, intellectual openness, and freedom of expression.\n\nLuke Savage is a staff writer at Jacobin .

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIn recent months, Republican lawmakers in Texas and Florida have rallied behind a suite of efforts related to schools, children, issues of race, and issues of sexuality. At a glance, each represents an isolated case study in conservatism's wider cultural offensive. Taken together, however, all tell a much larger story about the Right's professed commitment to personal freedom and freedom of expression - and the inconsistency with which its partisans apply their own chosen idioms.\n\nThe past decade has seen conservatives aggressively rally around a narrative about censorious college professors and an intellectually stifled culture increasingly averse to ideas some find uncomfortable. More broadly, the Right has tended to present itself as the only reliable steward of free speech in a society which now deems certain questions out of bounds and has seen the ongoing creep of a state empowered to suppress individual expression. However you come down on what are sometimes complex debates about education or pedagogy, it's a story that's simply impossible to square with the kinds of moves Republican politicians are now willing to entertain, let alone what many are already using political power to do.\n\nRecent developments in two states are especially instructive in this respect.\n\nLast month, Texas lieutenant governor Dan Patrick signaled he'll push to end tenure for new hires at the state's public universities and colleges in a move to combat \"indoctrination\" and the teaching of Critical Race Theory (CRT) - also opening the door to reforming local laws so that those who currently have tenure can have it revoked if authorities decide they've engaged in wrongthink.\n\nIn Florida, which has also become a CRT battleground, the Republican-controlled house of representatives just approved a measure to prohibit discussions concerned with gender identity and sexual orientation in classrooms. Though the bill's language refers specifically to children in a specific age range, its many critics rightly point out an obvious loophole that could potentially make its implications even more expansive - the text referring to \"classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity . . . in kindergarten through grade 3\" with the caveat \"or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.\" Also empowering parents to sue districts perceived to have violated the new rules, the bill is transparently a first step toward what some conservatives clearly hope will be the eventual purging of some discussions from public schools altogether.\n\nGiven the Right's espoused commitment to freedom of speech and opposition to state overreach, you might think this would be a difficult circle to square. In relation to both CRT and discussions of sexual identity, however, the favored frame has become the idea of \" parental choice \": a rhetorically useful way of packaging the agenda of social conservatism in the language of individual freedom and moral neutrality. One only needs to return to Texas to see just how hollow and selective the Right's application of this very concept actually is.\n\nIn what is easily the most grotesque of all the various efforts Republicans are currently pushing at the state level, Governor Greg Abbott last month asked the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) to launch investigations into instances of what he calls \"abusive procedures\" related to parents, children, and gender identity. Effectively, it means that the parents of transgender children can now be criminally investigated for affirming their child's identity - and that a range of licensed professionals from doctors to teachers will be required to snitch on those who do. Less than a week on from Abbott's decree, two Texan parents - one of whom is a DFPS employee - are already being investigated (and are rightly suing ).\n\nRepublican lawmakers, in short, will embrace the concept of parental autonomy in one instance and abandon it in the next. Freedom of speech is said to be under attack, but teachers and college faculty must face professional discipline if they transgress against the standards handed down by politicians. The state and its organs, it is said, should remain neutral on particular questions, but are also morally obligated to criminalize and punish certain lifestyles and viewpoints.\n\nIn one obvious sense, there's no internal consistency here - the operating principle being \"free expression for me but not for thee.\" Then again, this apparent lack of consistency may offer us a deeper clue about what's really animating the Right's wider cultural offensive. Parse the language and aims of these various efforts, and it's clear that their inspiration is nothing more nor less than a socially conservative idea of society in which individuals have prescribed roles and identities and the function of public institutions is to help bolster this natural order. Look at various polls on a range of issues, and it's very difficult to make a convincing case that anything resembling such a worldview is shared by a majority of Americans - which is probably one reason conservatives have tended to package their objectives in the bogus rhetoric of neutrality and choice.\n\nUnfortunately, as Jennifer Berkshire observed in an essay for the Nation following November's Republican victory in Virginia, liberals' embrace of instrumentalist slogans like \"College, Knowledge and Jobs\" and \"Get Skilled, Get a Job, Give Back\" has left Democrats ill-equipped to mount the more principled and holistic defense of public education that the Right's current onslaught demands. Since the 1990s, America's liberals have increasingly seen the state as little more than a vehicle for facilitating markets and individual opportunities within them. Conversely, the Right understands that education potentially has much a thicker role to play and is more than happy to make heavy-handed use of the state to impose its minoritarian value system on public schools - and beyond.\n\nGiven the creeping privatization of education and the punishing nature of higher ed tuition fees, it's hardly possible for mainstream liberals to claim their politics have helped foster a vibrant culture of free inquiry or expression. Nevertheless, the kinds of measures at play in places like Florida and Texas are clearly irreconcilable with the binary fable of censorious liberals and freedom-loving conservatives through which the Right has increasingly framed recent debates.\n\nLuke Savage is a staff writer at Jacobin .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

(Patrick Donovan / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nEarlier this month, best-selling author Jordan Peterson declared that \"climate justice\" is \"the new guise of murderous Marxism.\" The same day, Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis appeared at a town hall event sponsored by WMUR-TV in Manchester, New Hampshire. A voter asked DeSantis, who often rails against all things \"woke,\" to define his favorite term. DeSantis replied that \"woke is a form of cultural Marxism.\" Speaking of Manchester, a few days after the DeSantis event a member of New Hampshire's legislature accused the city's mayor, Joyce Craig, of promoting \"Marxist indoctrination\" in the public schools.\n\n\"Marxism\" seems to be taking up a lot of space in the heads of contemporary conservatives. But, as they use the term, what does it mean ?\n\nAll too often, it's a catch-all term for every left-coded trend they find frightening.\n\nYoram Hazony is a conservative thinker vastly smarter DeSantis, Peterson, or Mike Belcher - the New Hampshire lawmaker who accused the mayor of Manchester of promoting \"Marxist indoctrination.\" Hazony is the intellectual leading light of the NatCon (national conservative) movement that's become increasingly influential within the contemporary right. If you see him at a NatCon conference, he might be rubbing shoulders with Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, or Hungary's authoritarian leader Viktor Orbán. I know from experience, though, that Hazony is fully capable of having an informed conversation about the philosophy of David Hume.\n\nLast year, he put out a major book laying out his worldview, titled Conservatism: A Rediscovery . When I read Hazony's writing, I don't expect to agree with him on much of anything. What did surprise and disappoint me, though, was that Hazony includes an entire chapter entitled \"The Challenge of Marxism\" - and that his understanding of Marxism is fully as superficial as that of his fellow conservatives.\n\nHazony makes mind-bending assertions like:\n\nBy the summer of 2020, even as American cities succumbed to rioting, arson, and looting, the liberal custodians of many of the country's leading institutions adopted a policy of accommodating their Marxist employees by giving in to some of their demands: dismissing liberal employees at the New York Times , removing President Woodrow Wilson's name from the halls of Princeton University, and so forth. But what initially looked like a temporary policy of appeasement has since become a rout. Control of many of the most important news media, universities and schools, major corporations and philanthropic organizations, and even the government bureaucracy, the military, and some churches has passed into the hands of Marxist activists.\n\nWhat does Marxism mean here? What could it mean that's consistent with the idea that \"major corporations\" are in Marxist hands? One would think any \"Marxist activist\" would want those corporations to be either nationalized or turned over to some form of worker-ownership. Why haven't the Marxist activists controlling them taken steps in this direction since the summer of 2020?\n\nIf Marxist activists have taken over \"most important news media,\" shouldn't such media be agitating for expropriating the means of production? If they've taken over the universities, shouldn't economics departments long filled with mainstream, pro-capitalist economists now be populated by, well, Marxist economists? (Perhaps Hazony gives the Marxist activists credit for respecting the bourgeois economists' academic freedom.) If they've taken over the military, how is it that America's posture of imperial military dominance hasn't been impacted by the shift?\n\nA clue comes when Hazony concedes that the \"new Marxists\" don't use \"the technical jargon that was devised by the nineteenth-century Communist Party.\" This makes it sound like an organization with that name existed in the nineteenth century, which is wrong - although Marx, like other writers of his era, sometimes used the word \"party\" to talk about general currents of thought. We can put aside this relatively minor mistake, though, and look at the jargon Hazony has in mind.\n\nHe says the \"new Marxists\" don't use terms like \" bourgeoise, proletariat, class struggle, alienation of labor, commodity fetishism , and the rest\" but instead \"have developed their own jargon tailored to present circumstances in America, Britain and elsewhere.\" But this is a dodge.\n\nIt's one thing to avoid outdated jargon and quite another to disagree with the substantive ideas the jargon was meant to express. A twenty-first-century Marxist may prefer to talk about \"the working class\" rather than \"the proletariat,\" for example, on the grounds that it's likely to be more familiar to her audience, but part of what makes her a Marxist is that she believes that everyone who has no way of making a living except by selling their working hours to a boss is bound together by common interests.\n\nTo make his claims about \"Marxist activists\" being in control of major corporations, the US military, and so on, Hazony needs to use the M-word far more broadly. He claims that various kinds of social justice activists are Marxists, because however much they might disagree with Marx on \"details,\" they accept the four major elements of a \"Marxist framework,\" which he calls:\n\nHazony writes that Marx argued \"that, as an empirical matter, people invariably form themselves into cohesive groups (he called them classes ), which exploit one another to the extent that they are able.\" Pretty clearly, in Hazony's hands, it doesn't matter much if the \"cohesive groups\" are actual classes or if they're races, genders, or pretty much anything else.\n\nHazony is scrupulous enough to recognize that Marx never actually used this phrase. Marx's collaborator, Friedrich Engels coined it, not in a theoretical work but in a letter to friend, and some later Marxists ran with the concept. As such, it's more than a little odd to call it a defining element of Marx's framework - so much so that even those who disagree with the central claims Marx spent his life arguing for are Marxists if they adopt it. In any case, though, Hazony defines belief in \"false consciousness\" simply as the belief that many people within any given society sincerely understand how that society works in ways that \"obscure the systematic oppression taking place.\"\n\nThis is simply the idea that the oppressed \"cohesive group[s]\" will take over society to end their oppression, and...\n\n...is the prediction that this will result in a society no longer divided into such groups.\n\nTellingly, the word \"production\" appears nowhere in this entire description of Marx's framework, even though no aspect of Marxist thought is recognizable without it. Marx of course meant something far more specific by \"classes\" than \"cohesive groups.\" Nor is Marx's notion of \"exploitation\" anything recognizable in Hazony's talk of \"cohesive groups\" trying to \"exploit one another to the extent that they are able.\"\n\nIf Marxism were nothing more than the view that whatever society any given \"Marxist\" found himself in was divided into groups where some of these groups treated others in an unjust way, then \"Marxism\" rather dramatically predated the birth of Karl Marx.\n\nWhen Spartacus led a slave revolt in ancient Rome, were he and his followers Marxists? How about the peasants who periodically rose up in revolt against feudal lords in medieval Europe? Perhaps the peasants didn't count because they were only looking for immediate improvements and mostly had no concept of a \"revolutionary reconstitution of society,\" but what about the French revolutionaries who stormed the Bastille in 1789? The abolitionists who railed against the evils of slavery in the American South long before Marx discovered politics? Was Mary Wollstonecraft, whose feminist tract A Vindication of the Rights of Woman was published a few years after the storming of the Bastille but over a quarter-century before Marx's birth, a Marxist?\n\nEven specifically socialist complaints about the injustices of capitalist society predated Marx. There was a thriving European socialist movement before Marxism became one of the contending factions within it. Marx's contributions were far more specific.\n\nWhat we now call Marxism is, first and foremost, a theory of history - of the different stages of historical development, of how the capitalist stage we're now at works, and of how we can transcend capitalism and achieve socialism. Marx postulated that the legal and political institutions of every society are downstream of its \"relations of production.\" These are the relations between some class of \"immediate producers,\" who actually make the products and services that make society run, and the ruling class of any given society - for example, the relationship between slaves and slave-owners, between medieval peasants and lords, or between modern-day wage laborers and business owners.\n\nWhen Marx says capitalist labor relations are marked by \"exploitation\" he doesn't just mean unfairness or one group having a comparative advantage. He means that some of the hours worked by proletarians are ones in which they create the equivalent of what they get back in their wages while others are hours in which they work for the benefit of their employers - and that this extraction of \"surplus labor\" is essentially involuntary, since working-class people have no realistic way of making a living other than to sell their working hours to capitalists. These relations of production are in turn downstream from the level of development of the forces of production - i.e., the capacity that a society has to produce things to meet people's needs.\n\nIt's very difficult to imagine a human society that wouldn't in any sense be divided into groups that might sometimes experience conflicts. When Marx used the term class , he meant classes as defined by their relationship to the means of production - e.g., factories, farms, or even restaurants where people produce food in order to make a profit. The belief that we can have a society without classes in this sense isn't the belief in some impossible conflict-free utopia, but simply the belief that, now that we're at a stage of history where the forces of production have developed enough to allow for generally shared abundance, we can achieve a better society by replacing individual with collective ownership of the means of production.\n\nSome fraction of the social justice activists who so annoy Hazony might actually accept some of these Marxist ideas. That fraction, though, is in control of precisely zero \"major corporations.\"\n\nThe grain of truth in Hazony's overheated description is that there really are people in positions of power in important institutions who talk a lot about various social justice concerns. Far from being Marxists, though, most of them are at worst soulless technocrats happy to read from any script they think is good for their institution's PR, and at best radical liberals whose vision is not of a classless society but of a society in which the top slots in the class hierarchy are apportioned in a demographically fair way between different races, genders, sexual orientations, gender identities, and so on. They don't want those \"major corporations\" to be nationalized and put under workers control, for example - they want more black and female CEOs.\n\nWhere Marx's overwhelming emphasis was on changing material conditions on the ground, with changes in collective consciousness tending to come in the wake of these more basic changes, the activists who annoy Hazony are primarily focused on changing the subjective ideas in people's heads while the material circumstances stay about the same. Any description of Marx's framework that conflates these rival ideologies is going to confuse far more than it clarifies.\n\nLike proponents of every other philosophy, Marxists can learn and ultimately benefit from the most intellectually rigorous critiques of our ideas. We should welcome that process. As such, I wish an enemy as smart as Hazony weren't satisfied to do battle with straw men.\n\nBen Burgis is a Jacobin columnist, an adjunct philosophy professor at Rutgers University, and the host of the YouTube show and podcast Give Them An Argument .

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nConservative pundits are more likely to caricature Karl Marx's writings and beliefs than offer serious rebuttals to his many ideas. Why? Because Marx's trenchant insights expose deep inconsistencies in cherished right-wing doctrines.\n\nKarl Marx insisted we appreciate what a radical break with the past liberal capitalism was.\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIf you want to anger a stock conservative intellectual, just try arguing that Karl Marx might have something worth saying. Or worse, suggest that a man who wrote numerous volumes on everything from German philosophy to the standard assumptions of classical political economy might have a more nuanced theory than \"rich people bad, poor people good.\"\n\nYet several decades after the Cold War, plenty of right-wing pundits still can't be bothered to offer rebuttals to Marx that go beyond glib denunciations. Jordan Peterson has described Marxism as an evil theory and made his name bashing \"postmodern neo-Marxism,\" despite admitting during one debate that he hasn't read much more than the Communist Manifesto in the past few decades.\n\nIn his latest opus, Don't Burn This Book , Dave Rubin lumps in socialism with Nazism and fascism by claiming Benito Mussolini was \"raised on Karl Marx's Das Kapital \" - ignoring Il Duce's later efforts to imprison and silence Marxists and other \"enemies of the nation.\" And most recently, Ben Shapiro's How To Destroy America in Three Easy Steps recycles old tropes about the \"nonsense\" of Marx's labor theory of value, while ignoring the irony of praising John Locke for \"correctly point[ing] out that ownership of property is merely an extension of the idea of ownership of your labor; when we remove something from the state of nature and mix our labor with it and join something of our own to it, we thereby make that property our own.\"\n\nThis tendency to criticize Marx without actually engaging his ideas is especially rich considering Peterson, Rubin, and Shapiro endlessly parrot clichés about the importance of hard work and spirited debate. An easy way to dismiss them would be to just insist they live up to those lofty standards in between appearances on PragerU.\n\nBut I am going to take a somewhat different tack. I am going to suggest that conservatives avoid seriously dealing with Marx's work not just because he was critical of capitalism, wrote some polemical things about religion, or was suspicious of class hierarchy. It is because Marx's writings reveal deep inconsistences in cherished conservative doctrines.\n\nTwo of the most glaring examples: the conservative penchant for praising capitalism while bemoaning the decline of tradition; and the tendency to invoke an unchanging \"human nature\" to lambast critics of capitalism while insisting that individuals should be understood in relation to the traditions and communities around them.\n\nModern bourgeois society, with its relations of production, of exchange and of property, a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange, is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells . . .\n\n- Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, Communist Manifesto\n\nEarly defenders of liberal capitalism like John Locke often wrote in ahistorical terms. They asserted that the kinds of individuals and market relations then emerging with the advent of modernity had always been present, reflecting timeless truths about the world and human nature. It was only with Kant and later Hegel that theorists began to think critically about the radical novelty of liberal capitalist societies.\n\nFor many of these thinkers, this novelty was cause for celebration. Kant's essay \" What Is Enlightenment? \", published in 1784, described humanity as waking up from its \"self-incurred immaturity\" and finally facing the world as free and rational beings. Hegel was more critical, arguing that the revolutionary individualism taking off in the eighteenth century needed to be tempered by strong institutions and meaningful social relations (something right-Hegelians like Roger Scruton would later pick up on and lend a conservative gloss).\n\nMarx shared in both the euphoria and anxiety about liberal-capitalist modernity. From his Young Hegelian days onward, he praised the nascent liberal capitalist order as an enormous improvement over its overtly authoritarian predecessors, even if he thought it was destined to be replaced by an even higher form of society. But Marx also insisted we appreciate what a radical break with the past liberal capitalism was.\n\nWriting in the middle of the Industrial Revolution and the age of European imperialism, Marx noted how old rural communities were being gutted as people moved to the cities, describing capitalism as a \"constantly expanding market\" pushing the bourgeoisie \"over the entire surface of the globe.\" He criticized the new culture of \"commodity fetishism\" that was replacing the religious fidelity of yore, gleefully inverting the language of faith to highlight society's new reverence for Mammon.\n\nWhile Marx always held that these developments were emancipatory in many respects, he insisted that these changes were also calamitous, breaking down \"fixed, fast frozen relations\" - violently, if need be - to remake the world in the image of capital. Capitalism was a revolutionary mode of production, constantly transforming every aspect of society in unexpected and sometimes frightening ways. It was the enemy of tradition.\n\nEarlier conservative thinkers were far more sensitive to capitalism's convulsions than their many progeny, decrying the way capitalism upended the world and established a vulgar bourgeois culture focused on consumption and opulence rather than transcendent or heroic virtues. But later authors, like Shapiro, have often ignored these problems, dismissing any criticisms of capitalism as utopian or Marxist while at the same time looking with horror at a world where urbanization, secularization, and conspicuous consumption have become the order of the day.\n\nHad they bothered to read and absorb Marx, perhaps they wouldn't be so surprised. His key point was that you cannot simultaneously decry declining traditionalism and support the economic system that makes \"all that is solid melt in air.\" Blaming cultural elites and academics at Ivy League universities for social change is like condemning smoke for starting a fire.\n\nAnother go-to argument of conservative thinkers is to dismiss Marx's \"theory of human nature\": either Marx was dangerously naive about the human capacity for evil and selfishness - which shows why his ideal classless society turned out to be such a bust in practice - or he believed that there was no human nature, that we are infinitely plastic beings that could be made and remade by a sufficiently rational and powerful state committed to utopian planning.\n\nBoth of these claims are nonsensical. From his early ruminations about our \"species being\" determined by nature, to his later psychological ruminations about how our desire for recognition and status spurs \"commodity fetishism,\" Marx was neither utopian nor naive about our potential for hypocrisy, cruelty, and hedonism. Where Marx was innovative was in showing how the historical and economic conditions around us play a major role in shaping our sense of self and behavior.\n\nThis doesn't mean we are purely determined by historical context. But Marx argued that the historical and economic conditions we're born into provide the starting point we all must navigate. As he put it in The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon , \"men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past.\"\n\nParts of this argument should actually appeal to many conservatives. From Edmund Burke to Roger Scruton, a common right-wing complaint has been that radicals portray humans as ahistorical beings that can be understood purely as atomized individuals. Instead, they stressed, every human is embedded in layers of community, with hallowed traditions and morals shaped through history and institutions, including churches and temples, nations, and even the ever-opaque \"Western civilization.\" These \"little brigades\" affect how we think of ourselves and what we believe.\n\nConservatives often insisted that ignoring the importance of these historical communities could only lead to disaster. Marx would certainly agree. But he would add that we are also embedded in a historically distinct economic system that profoundly shapes who we are and what we believe.\n\nIt's on this point that many of the same conservative commentators that insist on applying a historical and institutional lens to understand human behavior and communities become pious ahistoricists. They insist that capitalism simply flows from human nature, that it has always been around and therefore always must be, and that any effort to change it can only yield disaster, as surely as demanding fish ride bicycles. The following by Ben Shapiro is representative:\n\nNo, Marx wasn't right. But the Left will never let him go, because he offers the only true alternative to the religious view of human nature - the view of man that says he is not a blank slate, not an angel waiting for redemption, but a flawed creature capable of great things. To achieve those great things is hard work. To change ourselves on an individual level is hard work. To spout about the evils of society - that's certainly easy enough.\n\nBut capitalism is no more or no less natural than any other historically contingent system; including religious systems. What emerged in history can change in history. And as we lumber into another global recession, it is looking like time for some big changes.\n\nMarx famously wrote that philosophers have only ever interpreted the world, when the point is to change it. Ironically, interpretations - bad and good - of Marx have, in fact, changed the world, influencing revolutionary movements and tyrants alike. This testifies to the forceful power of his intellectual personality and the analytical sweep of Marxist theory. Getting the basics of Marxism right is important for any robust debate about the future of capitalism and the political antagonisms that shape our present era.\n\nFor his opponents, it is also a prerequisite for critiquing him effectively. Many commentators on the political right seem determined to brush past Marx as quickly as possible, ignoring or downplaying nuances and specificities. They also brush past the lessons of Marxism that inconveniently disturb their own sacred tropes.\n\nMarx deserves better critics. And those of us on the Left who care about his complex legacy should hope he gets them.\n\nMatt McManus is a visiting professor of politics at Whitman College.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe Capital Hilton in Washington, DC, is just three miles from Capitol Hill. But last week, these two places might as well have been on different planets. As congressional Democrats clenched their jaws and paced the halls trying to figure a way out of the mess that is the imploding Joe Biden campaign, the mood at the conference center was bright. The common areas were filled with smiling people in the requisite business casual attire - a mixture of young and old, almost all white, and mostly men - casually sipping coffees and pleasantly chatting. Strolling through these spaces, I overheard snippets of conversations about plans for the future: new jobs, hiring strategies, and next steps for the movement.\n\nInside the Presidential Ballroom, the first session's tone was similarly upbeat. Christopher DeMuth, former head of the American Enterprise Institute and current conference organizer, welcomed the audience \"to the mainstream\" of the conservative movement. Next up was Yoram Hazony, the Israeli American political theorist and chairman of the Edmund Burke Foundation, which hosted the event. Co-opting the slogan of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign, his opening speech, entitled \"Yes, We Can,\" began by underscoring how far their movement had already come.\n\n\"People are not afraid to use the word 'nation' anymore,\" Hazony declared. \"That's a great success.\"\n\nThen came Rachel Bovard, a vice president at the Conservative Partnership Institute and rising right-wing firebrand, who proclaimed, \"For the first time, we can look around and say we're winning. The wind is at our backs.\"\n\nRounding out the opening plenary, Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, pronounced, \"This is the future of the conservative movement and the next era.\" Calling it \"the second American Revolution,\" Roberts predicted \"a political, cultural, and social wresting from the Left all those institutions and centers of power they have steadily co-opted over several decades.\"\n\nFor the past five years, the National Conservatism Conference , or NatCon, has brought together a veritable who's who of New Right politicians, intellectuals, and movement builders from the United States and Europe. Since 2019, this group of conservative elites has been on a mission to remake the intellectual foundations of right-wing politics in the aftermath of Donald Trump's rise.\n\nPrevious NatCon events in DC, Miami, London, and Brussels were billed as laboratories of ideas for a self-consciously \"post-liberal\" right that rejects liberal individualism and libertarian economics and promises to restore the centrality of religion, family, and nation to the conservative movement. Over the years, countless sessions have been devoted to the \"New Nationalism,\" the \"New Jewish-Christian Alliance,\" the \"New Conservative Populism,\" and the \"New Natalism.\"\n\nBut even as these ideas ascended on the political scene, the official mood of National Conservatism was dark and pessimistic. Speaking from their podiums, the right-wing elites who presided over these sessions routinely railed against the rise of \"liberal totalitarianism\" and complained that American institutions had been taken over by \"woke Neo-Marxists\" who were silencing conservative voices and destroying the nation. In the past, conference speakers routinely called for conservatives to fight back and win the existential battle against the \"woke elites.\" Indeed, they insisted, the very survival of Western civilization depended on it.\n\nYet, as Helen Lewis observed in the Atlantic last year, the Right's dark worldview also demanded a sense of always being on the losing side of the war. Preoccupied with the Left's power, NatCon events often felt more like highly elevated bitching sessions - with plenty of talk about the rise of the \"Gramscian\" left, the domination of \"secular religion,\" and the crisis of the \"birth dearth\" - and less like a plan for actually restoring civilization whose proponents thought they stood a chance of winning.\n\nThe atmosphere felt markedly different this time around. To be sure, dark apocalyptic leitmotifs of left-wing hegemony were still the driving force and spiritual energy of virtually every session I attended.\n\n\"We are in a cold civil war,\" declared Tom Klingenstein, the chairman of the board at the Claremont Institute, on the second day of the conference. \"We are in a war with an enemy that would destroy us.\" That enemy is the \"woke group quota regime.\" Republicans still \"don't know we're in a war,\" he insisted.\n\nKlingenstein's own Claremont Institute played a central role in leading the legal efforts to challenge the 2020 election and subsequent initiatives to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs across the nation. But calling too much attention to these activities would undermine the Right's image of itself as passive victims of an oppressive left.\n\nAs the prospect of a second Trump presidency looms, however, more NatCons have started to publicly acknowledge their actual and potential power. Almost against their will, many have adopted a more confident vibe and a sense of excitement about the future. They are also lining up to help take over the administrative \"deep state\" that the Right has historically vilified. As Bovard, whose organization has been actively leading conservative efforts to roll back progressive achievements, concluded in her opening remarks, \"Let's get to work.\"\n\nReactionary planning , as we might call this paradoxical amalgam of elite victimization and ambitious administrative organizing, is having its moment. Project 2025 , the Heritage Foundation's nine-hundred-plus page plan for a second Trump presidency, and the 2024 GOP policy platform have recently been in the spotlight. But these documents, while certainly illuminating, provide a relatively cold and bureaucratic version of what that future might look like. You sometimes need to read between the lines to get a real understanding of the stakes. Over the course of three days, the NatCons conveyed their vision for taking back the administrative state in more vivid detail and with a greater sense of the human drama that will unfold should the Right seize power and use the tools of governance to finally \"own the libs\" once and for all.\n\nIn a packed breakout session on immigration, Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a hard-right nativist outfit that poses as a neutral think tank, began by discussing plans in other countries, including Britain and Israel, for deporting refugees to Rwanda. Acknowledging that these far-right initiatives had all unraveled under judicial or political opposition, he nonetheless offered his own more ambitious \"Remain in Mongolia\" plan as a form of deterrence against would-be asylum seekers.\n\nIt could be \"Botswana or Armenia,\" he explained. The point, Krikorian underscored, is that the numbers will go down \"if crossing the border simply lands you in Ulan Bakur,\" mispronouncing Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia. Although \"I hear it's nice this time of year,\" he added, \"nonetheless, that's not what you're looking for,\" and \"the incentive is going to disappear.\"\n\nBut even this would only be \"second-best,\" he explained. As executive initiatives, such programs can be \"undone by future administrations.\" Underscoring the need for a more permanent solution, Krikorian laid out a plan for the United States to withdraw from all international covenants - including the convention on refugees, the convention against torture, and the covenant on civil and political rights - that legally bind the nation to protect asylum seekers.\n\n\"Asylum,\" he concluded, \"must not be available to illegal immigrants. Period.\"\n\nHe was followed by Tom Homan, the former director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the first Trump administration, who promised, \"If Trump comes back, I will run the biggest deportation operation this country's ever seen. They ain't seen shit yet. Wait until 2025.\"\n\nKevin Lynn, executive director of Progressives for Immigration Reform, an organization whose name obscures its political alignment with the Right, then conveyed a host of ideas for how to curtail legal, as well as illegal, immigration, including ending programs aimed at workers in STEM fields, reducing the number of student visas, and asking foreign tourists to declare their pregnancies to prevent \"anchor baby tourism.\"\n\nOn the main stage after the lunch break, Stephen Miller, Trump's diabolical sidekick on all things immigration, panned out from these policy plans to reframe the bigger political picture on immigrants. His speech exemplified reactionary planners' amalgam of vindictiveness and uplift. After railing against the Joe Biden administration for knowingly letting the \"world's fugitives, predators, and rapists\" into the country, he concluded with a note of inspiration. \"Choose victory, choose optimism. Choose hope.\"\n\nAnother session on \"lawfare\" featured a group of conservative legal luminaries who shared their plans for fighting back against progressives who had used the justice system to wage war against Trump and his allies during the Biden administration. The legal scholar John Yoo, who made a name for himself defending torture in the post-9/11 era, put it most plainly when he explained that conservatives had no choice but to prosecute their political enemies as well.\n\n\"Unfortunately,\" Yoo lamented, \"we're going to have to use banana republic means and prosecute them too until they stop.\"\n\n\"Democrats do not change unless they feel the pain of their own rules,\" concurred Will Chamberlain, who currently serves as senior counsel at the Federalist Society. He went on to name the individuals at the top of the Right's hit list: Fani Willis, the Fulton County district attorney and lead prosecutor in the case against Trump in Georgia; Kristen Clarke, who currently heads the civil rights division in the Department of Justice; Juan Merchan, the judge who presided over the \"hush-money\" trial in New York; and, of course, Attorney General Merrick Garland.\n\nHighlighting an urgent need for conservative lawyers to demonstrate more \"loyalty\" to the movement, Chamberlain also envisioned a broader internal campaign to pressure these \"summer soldiers\" - as he called them, quoting Thomas Paine - into supporting the cause. In the Q and A portion, eager young lawyers stepped up to the mic and asked how they could get involved.\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, given the Supreme Court's historic decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022 , the session on the pro-life movement was comparatively more somber. Introducing the panel, Catholic University professor Chad Pecknold declared, \"The post- Dobbs reality is more difficult than ever.\" Numerous speakers complained about the difficulties of enacting abortion bans at the state level and expressed anger at the Republican Party for dialing back its pro-life agenda in the new platform.\n\nUndaunted, however, the panelists agreed that leaving abortion up to the states was insufficient and discussed plans for acting at the federal level.\n\nKaty Talento, who served as \"health adviser\" on Trump's Domestic Policy Council from 2017 to 2019, detailed how Biden's \"army of bureaucrats and political appointees have been quietly transforming federal agencies into Planned Parenthood\" and sketched out plans for reversing those policies. The Food and Drug Administration, she said, could invoke safety issues to clamp down on the use of abortion drugs. With the help of artificial intelligence, which could be used to speed up the lengthy process of judicial review, an army of political appointees could work to roll back Biden-era regulations that undermine the pro-life movement.\n\n\"Everyone needs to start early,\" she insisted. \"The new administration is going to need all the help it can get.\"\n\nThis is not to say that the conference speakers all sang in unison or offered coherent plans for every arena of governance. Despite broad agreement in many areas, there remained notable splits and contradictions on major issues. While the NatCons pride themselves on opposing \"globalism\" and were generally cool towards NATO, the conference organizers studiously avoided a full session on Ukraine, a conflict that continues to divide the Right. Meanwhile, the panel on Israel felt like a trip in the DeLorean to the 9/11 era. Conservative journalist Ben Weingarten, who seems to have imbibed his views from the Rudy Giuliani-era Manhattan Institute, went on about the rise of Islamism and the threat of sharia law being enacted in the United States. Details of the current war in Gaza were hardly mentioned, nor was the problem of self-proclaimed US nationalists offering billions of dollars of unconditional support to a recalcitrant client state.\n\nEconomics was another area of notable tension. A breakout session on \"working-class conservatism\" featured several individuals who claimed to represent a new direction in the movement's stance on labor. But when issues of actual policy came up, this facade quickly crumbled.\n\nRiley Moore, West Virginia's state treasurer and a self-professed defender of \"blue-collar\" conservatism, admitted that, as a legislator, he had voted for right-to-work laws, a crucial weapon in the conservative war against unions. Despite branding themselves pro-worker, Riley and other panelists evaded questions about the PRO Act , the most important piece of labor legislation in decades, and were more than happy to dismiss the AFL-CIO, the United Auto Workers, and public-sector unions on the grounds that they are associated with progressive cultural causes.\n\nEarlier that morning, on the main stage, GOP senators Mike Lee of Utah, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, and Rick Scott of Florida, who have much more power to do something about labor issues, rattled on about balancing budgets, cutting taxes, and slashing regulations. It's revealing that the Tea Party wing of the GOP, which still preaches the gospel of trickle-down economics, is also feeling the wind at its back.\n\n\"We can do it. And we must do it,\" declared Lee in reference to their austerity-happy fiscal vision.\n\nThis moment underscored the essence of reactionary planning. While ostensibly forward-looking, its goal is ultimately a return to an idealized past when, as many speakers wistfully recalled, men were men, women were women, and the Christian Bible was taught in every school.\n\nIt's too soon to say whether the Right will be able to accomplish this ambitious agenda. But if they can advance even a small fraction of their plans, a lot of pain and suffering will be in store at both the individual and institutional levels, especially for immigrants, people of color, women, and workers. Listening to these speakers reinforced my own sense of impending doom at the idea of a second Trump presidency.\n\nAt the same time, I could not help feeling a twinge of envy. The Right is currently experiencing the kind of hope that I remember feeling, however fleetingly, back in 2008, when Obama borrowed his \"Yes We Can\" slogan from Dolores Huerta , who coined the phrase for the United Farm Workers' 1972 organizing campaign. It is the feeling so many of us experienced even more profoundly in 2016, when Bernie Sanders ascended on the national scene and upended the neoliberal consensus within the Democratic Party.\n\nUnfortunately, that kind of optimism is pretty much off the table for progressives in 2024.\n\nBecause the Democratic leadership was willfully blind to the most fundamental realities of Biden's future, we are now all facing the likelihood of a second Trump administration. In this moment, the best we can hope for is that the Democrats can replace Biden with a younger and more charismatic candidate who has a fighting chance against Trump.\n\nBut in the long run, even as progressives expose and vehemently oppose the Right's reactionary plans, they must also do more to provide an alternative vision. Leftism, after all, is supposed to be oriented toward the future. And that requires forging a more forward-looking vision and being bold about advancing it, even when doing so feels risky. Otherwise, we will be resigned to a future of reactionary rule from which the nation might never recover.\n\nHannah Gurman is an associate professor at New York University's Gallatin School of Individualized Study and is working on a book about capitalism and the culture wars.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

      "text": "At the Center of the Right-Wing Revival? Hating Immigrants.\n\nMother Jones; Getty; ZUMA\n\nIsabela Dias August 8, 2024\n\nFive years ago, the first National Conservatism conference-a gathering on the right to propose a more populist version of conservatism-was held at the Ritz-Carlton in Washington, DC.\n\nThe event, organized by the then-nascent Edmund Burke Foundation, drew rising stars of the New Right: Sen. John Hawley (R-Mo.), a clean-shaven JD Vance , former Fox News host Tucker Carlson , and tech billionaire (and eventual backer of Vance's run for Congress) Peter Thiel . The coalition convened to push a new ideology. They hoped to create a conservative ethos \"inextricably tied to the idea of the nation\" and an \"intellectually serious alternative to the excesses of purist libertarianism, and in stark opposition to political theories grounded in race.\"\n\nIn a taxonomy of young conservatives, Sam Adler-Bell in the New Republic pointed out that these NatCons (as they're called) are among a variety of alternative ideas popping up to intellectualize Trumpism. But, in recent years, they have taken on a larger cache. New York Times columnist David Brooks, dismayed by the conference's rise, would in 2021 call NatCon attendees the \"terrifying future of the American right.\"\n\nDuring his opening remarks at that first conference, organizer David Brog invoked a recurring theme throughout the event-the dilution of the essence of the American nation. \"We give no aid to our immigrants,\" Brog said , \"when we permit the erosion of the very culture that motivated them to move here in the first place.\" Brog's statement could be generously interpreted as charitable to immigrants, but it veiled a belief that was, and is still, at the heart of national conservatives' pitch : Immigration is to blame for the fall of the Western world. It has become a source of weakness and an existential threat to the social fabric holding countries like the United States together.\n\nTo national conservatives, immigrants seem to hold no value unless fully assimilated. And no one drove that point home more forcefully at the inaugural conference than Amy Wax, a controversial University of Pennsylvania law professor, who made a \"cultural case for limited immigration.\" Conservatives, she offered, should push for an approach that preserves the country's identity as a \"Western and First World nation\" and considers the \"practical difficulties of importing large numbers of people from backwards states.\"\n\nIn building a framework for the future of the Republican Party rooted in nationalism, Vance and others are essentially saying: the nation is not an idea but our people.\n\nThat meant adopting a \"cultural-distance nationalism\" that embraces the vision \"that our country will be better off with more whites and fewer nonwhites.\" Wax argued that Donald Trump was right to question why the United States would want immigrants from \"shithole countries.\" (He was referring to Haiti, El Salvador, and nations in Africa.) The celebration of diversity, she concluded, \"means that we lose some of these norms...that make our life what it is.\"\n\nNational Conservatism began as an effort to intellectually retrofit Trumpism with a coherent framework. Today, the annual conference previews the direction of thought on the right in the United States and abroad. The most recent edition, which happened in downtown DC in early July, assembled a handful of Republican lawmakers such as senators Rick Scott of Florida and Utah's Mike Lee, a failed presidential contestant supportive of Trump (Vivek Ramaswamy), Hungarian emissaries, and a constellation of right-wing groups plotting the next conservative administration.\n\n\"National conservatives started out as a thoughtful intellectual movement,\" says Geoffrey Kabaservice, a political analyst and author of Rule and Ruin: The Downfall of Moderation and the Destruction of the Republican Party, From Eisenhower to the Tea Party , who has attended several national conservatism conferences over the years. \"As time goes on, they've taken more and more the characteristics of a tribe .\"\n\nTheir \"big tent\" elite movement rejects the laissez-faire economic tradition of the past and faults a \"cosmopolitan\" regime with the unraveling of the American \"way of life.\" They repudiate imperialism and globalism and wish for a muscular government that stands for the traditional values of family and Christianity. But the one reigning conviction bounding US conservatives and their international counterparts appears to be an inflated, when not outright fabricated, fear that immigration equals doom-be it from cultural change or the Great Replacement .\n\nThe halls and stage of the fourth National Conservatism conference in the US capital reeked of jubilant and, at times, vengeful confidence. \"This is the first conservative conference in memory where we can look around at our country and the world and say, we're winning,\" Rachel Bovard, vice president of programs at the MAGA Conservative Partnership Institute, said. \"National conservatism is the only kind of conservatism there is,\" the Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts declared.\n\nThe largely youthful looking, groomed men in attendance were told that the woke radical left, fake news media, corrupt ruling elites, and anti-white, anti-male, anti-Christian social justice warriors destroying the American way of life in a totalitarian fashion were being found out. Manhood is under attack and progressives are brainwashing and forcibly changing the sex of children, while imposing a \"group quota regime\"-and finally, this group gathered to fight back. All this had been done with the acquiescence of spineless mainstream Republicans and the legacy right who seem unaware of a brewing \"Cold Civil War,\" as Tom Klingenstein of the Claremont Institute put it. No more. Here comes the New Right.\n\nFor all the \"owning the libs\" discourse, the attacks on so-called gender ideology, the harangues against identity politics, and the warnings of the ever-present specter of neo-Marxism, the gathered \"army of spirited counterrevolutionaries\"- powered by nitro cold brew provided by the American Moment, an organization recruiting and training conservatives to work in Washington-at the Capital Hilton hotel rallied themselves most fervently around anti-immigrant sentiment.\n\nThe threat as they perceive it takes many forms. In the words of Stephen Miller, Trump's former senior adviser on all things immigration, it is a border being invaded by millions of would-be Democratic \"illegal voters\" and \"the world's fugitives, the world's predators, the world's rapists and murderers.\" For Mark Krikorian, from the anti-immigration Center for Immigration Studies, it is vulnerable asylum seekers.\n\n\"Where the national conservatism movement has made the most progress, not just here, but I think overseas as well is the recognition that the real threat to American democracy it's certainly not Donald Trump, it's not even some foreign dictator who doesn't like America or our values,\" JD Vance said during a dinner. \"The real threat to American democracy is that American voters keep on voting for less immigration and our politicians keep on rewarding us with more. That is the threat to American democracy.\"\n\nNever mind the fact that the long-term prospects of declining birth rates, a rallying cry for Vance, and shrinking population call exactly for more immigration, not less. The Congressional Budget Office projects that starting in 2040 net immigration will account for all population growth in the United States. But for Vance, the idea here is not actually about population decline as much as who is declining. As Margaret Talbot recently wrote in the New Yorker , Vance is more pronatalism than pro-family. \"And pronatalism, as it's been developing lately in certain conservative circles,\" she notes, \"typically combines concerns about falling birth rates with anti-immigration and anti-feminist ideas. It champions not just having children but having many-large families for the sake of large families, reproduction for reproduction's sake. Except that, in this world view, not all reproduction is equal. Pronatalism favors native-born baby makers.\"\n\nVance made a populist economic and cultural argument for curbing immigration, which he said \"has made our societies poorer, less safe, less prosperous, and less advanced.\" It is the cause of lower wages for American workers, spikes in housing prices, and crowded emergency rooms, he has claimed without evidence. \"The country has simply taken in too many, too quickly,\" Vance posted on X in May, \"and unless we fix it the United States won't exist.\"\n\nTo that end, the New Right, and Vance, have been working to define what the \"nation\" means in common parlance.\n\nFor a long time, it has been said that \"America is an idea.\" Joe Biden repeated the line in his statement to the country after withdrawing from the 2024 presidential race; telling viewers that the US is \"an idea stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator or tyrant.\" Former House Speaker Paul Ryan once said , \"America is the only nation founded on an idea, not on an identity.\" But national conservatives want to move past the \" myth \" of a propositional nation based on universal principles of freedom and equality.\n\n\"I'll be on his heels coming back, and I will run the biggest deportation force this country has ever seen,\" said Trump's former head of ICE.\n\nThis country, \"Never Trumper\" turned vice presidential candidate Vance said during his speeches at the National Conservatism conference and later at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, \"is not just an idea,\" but \"a group of people with a shared history and a common future. It is, in short, a nation.\" It is a homeland . In building a framework for the future of the Republican Party rooted in nationalism, Vance and others are essentially saying: the nation is our people.\n\n\"Commitments to abstract principles or institutions are simply less capable of inspiring a feeling of belonging and a strong sense of identity than appeals to a shared history, a shared culture, a shared religion or ethnicity, and sometimes a shared race,\" says Rogers Smith, a University of Pennsylvania scholar of American political thought. \"We've had those kinds of appeals throughout American history.\" He cites as an example the rise of nativism in the mid-1800s in response to the increased arrival of poor Irish and German immigrants.\n\nBut Vance and others within the national conservatism movement today, Smith explains, associate with new conservative thinkers who go further. \"They don't just say that you need a sense of identity that doesn't rest on an idea alone,\" Smith notes. \"They say the ideas of the American founding were bad ideas.\" He adds: \"It scares me to death. I think it appeals to some of the worst features of American society.\"\n\nThe fact that the \"conservative movement is leaning into this, fueling it, is no surprise,\" says Janelle Wong, a University of Maryland professor who researches race, immigration, and political mobilization. \"Those who view or agree with the belief that God intended America to be a new promised land where European Christians could create a society that could be an example to the rest of the world-that's ethnic Christian nationalism-agree with the great replacement theory rhetoric.\" Sixty percent of Republicans said they believe \"immigrants are invading our country and replacing our cultural and ethnic background\" in a survey by the Public Religion Research Institute. \"We're talking about something that has become relatively mainstream among conservatives,\" Wong says.\n\nNational conservatives' reverie of immigrants as the downfall of the West is so powerful that it calls for the harshest of responses. The asylum system, Krikorian, from the anti-immigration think-tank, said at NatCon, represents a \"surrender of sovereignty\" and a reframing of \"immigration as a right rather than a privilege.\" His solution? To have the United States withdraw its longstanding commitment to the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, the Convention Against Torture, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Later, in his speech, he toyed with a plan similar to one proposed in the United Kingdom, in which asylum seekers would be sent to Rwanda. \"All kinds of countries,\" he told the crowd \"would be willing to take our money to host a small number of illegal immigrants.\"\n\nIt was like this throughout my time at the conference. Another speaker advocated for doing away with the commonly held distinction between legal immigration as positive and unlawful immigration as negative, suggesting ending certain categories of work visas and the diversity visa program . \"Please replace us, just do it legally,\" Kevin Lynn, executive director of the deceptively named Progressives for Immigration Reform, said mockingly. He also suggested a screening of tourists to prevent potential \"anchor babies.\"\n\nTheo Wold, who served in the Trump administration's Department of Justice and on domestic policy issues, took it even further. He called out the experiment of \"massive importation\" of immigrants to the United States, saying it is \"unfair to millions of Americans who have been pushed aside for the arrival of millions of foreign nationals.\" The only sustainable form of immigration, Wold added, comes with assimilation. (Wold bemoaned that Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion programs discourages \"Americanization\" efforts.) \"Multiculturalism is, at its core, an anti-Western philosophy,\" he said . \"Disunion is its expressed goal. It's time not just to end mass immigration, but to reverse it. It's time to decolonize America.\"\n\n\"The real threat to American democracy is that American voters keep on voting for less immigration and our politicians keep on rewarding us with more,\" said JD Vance, Trump's pick for vice president.\n\nThis is the intellectual foundation of Donald Trump's mass deportation plans , which are shared by the Republican National Committee's official 2024 policy platform and were cheered on by RNC attendees carrying \"Mass Deportation Now\" signs. If elected, Trump and his aides want to pursue sweeping removal operations regardless of due process and build sprawling detention camps.\n\nSpeaking at the National Conservatism conference, Tom Homan, former acting director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) under Trump, told the audience he was ready to lead the deportation campaign: \"Trump comes back in January, I'll be on his heels coming back, and I will run the biggest deportation force this country has ever seen,\" he proudly said to a round of applause. \"They ain't seen shit yet. Wait until 2025.\"\n\nAt times, the bubbling rage against immigrants was palpable. During the Q&A portion of the border discussion with Krikorian, Wold, Homan, and others, a woman approached the mic to shout at the panelists, urging them to confirm her suspicion that immigrants were being purposefully brought into the country to be turned into Democratic voters, a baseless claim given credence by Republicans, who recently passed a law in the House requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration. When the panelists didn't give her the exact answer she was looking for, the woman got increasingly aggrieved. At a different session, after a speaker posed a rhetorical question about what's the biggest threat facing the country, someone in the audience angrily yelled, \"Illegals!\"\n\n\"There's a lot of speculation that the kind of conservatism we see nowadays is in some sense a resurgence of the Old Right and that it's coming along with those xenophobic attitudes, explicitly Christian nationalist attitudes, a sense of valorization of America as a people-and largely Eurocentric people-rather than America as a creedal nation ,\" Kabaservice says. \"I think what you're seeing is one end of a cycle within American conservatism. It's not clear that this is the future of American conservatism going forward. But it certainly seems to be until such a time that Trumpism ceases to be the main operating force on the conservative movement and the GOP.\"\n\nHe recalls Ronald Reagan's famous 1989 farewell address to the nation. In it, Reagan talks about America as a \"shining city on the hill\" and \"if there had to be city walls, the walls had doors and the doors were open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here.\" Kabaservice says, \"It's very odd for those of us who've lived long enough to remember Reagan to see how there's almost no trace of that kind of attitude in today's populist Republican Party.\"\n\nTop image: Mother Jones illustration; Carol Guzy/ZUMA; Joseph Prezioso/AFP/Getty (2)\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Conservatives Love Law Enforcement Until They're the Ones Being Policed\n\nPro-Trump protesters in Florida Alberto E. Tamargo/AP\n\nLast weekend, Danny Presti, who owns Mac's Public House in Staten Island, New York, hit a police officer with his car while evading arrest for having flagrantly violated coronavirus restrictions-specifically the one about serving unmasked customers indoors. A police statement said that they attempted to arrest Presti after observing people inside the bar, but the bar owner got behind the wheel, ran his car into a New York City sheriff's deputy, and drove 100 yards with that deputy perched on the car like some life-sized hood ornament. Before this encounter, Presti already had become a right-wing hero after publicly defying New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo order that bars and restaurants in areas with a high concentration of infections cease serving customers indoors. Instead he declared his bar an \"autonomous zone\" and encouraged people to come drink and eat at the establishment.\n\nAs Media Matters for America reported , Presti's opposition to science and to social distancing guidelines (especially those handed down by a Democrat) earned him several days of glowing praise from Sean Hannity, who has made an impressive living by fueling culture war s that keep white conservatives enraged and engaged. A key part of the Hannity's reliable playbook is defending the police from what he and other conservatives consider threats both to their lives and to their crucial authority in maintaining the social order.\n\nBut that changed with this most recent incident of, well, harming a police officer. All of a sudden, Fox News and Hannity doubled down on their support for Presti. As Presti sat looking concerned, Hannity explained that his guest was the real victim in all this. Hannity said that Presti was simply unaware that the people who were approaching him were cops trying to arrest him. He was similarly oblivious to the fact that the person who jumped on the hood of his car was a  law enforcement official. (He could not explain why he continued to drive with someone on the hood of the car.) Hannity also said Presti was getting killed (presumably financially) by restrictions.\n\nNow it was time to talk to his guest. \"Do people even understand that your heart, life, and soul is involved in this, sir?\" he asked . Presti replied that the reason he \"started all this\" was to bring attention to the fact that small businesses need assistance. Hannity even compared the bar owner to Eric Garner, a 44-year-old Black man who was killed by a white New York police officer  who put him in a chokehold while trying to arrest him for selling loose, untaxed cigarettes. \"It reminds me of...you know what was wrong with the Eric Garner case,\" Hannity said. \"Why are they arresting a guy over a loosey cigarette to begin with?\" (No need to elaborate on what Hannity said about the Eric Garner case when it was unfolding. For that, take a look at Media Matters.)\n\nThis might be just business as usual during the polarized and troubling last weeks of the Trump administration, but the Staten Island bar attack, subsequent arrest of Presti, and Hannity's framing of the two can be seen as a microcosm of the extreme right's muddled sense of the role of government in American lives. Basically, it appears that for them, the most legitimate role of government in the public sphere is to maintain existing and inequitable racial and social hierarchies. When it suits their purposes, conservatives  heap praise on government officials like the police, in their work to keep that racial order intact. But once anything falls outside of that realm-enforcing public health restrictions during a pandemic, for instance-their cries of tyrannical government overreach soon follow. As this year's racial justice movement and public health crisis collided, the conservative commentariat had to do some contortions to keep their messaging straight: Anyone defying public health orders is a patriot and anyone questioning the conduct of law enforcement officials is a traitor. Make sense?\n\nThe brazen hypocrisy of asserting that police violence is justified because law enforcement is indisputably right, but government orders to wear a mask or restrict indoor crowds is a grave blow to our freedoms is obvious. Let's look back at when the Black Lives Matter protests really took off this summer after George Floyd was killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota. At that same time many governors and mayors were also trying to get their constituents to wear masks, avoid crowds, and socially distance. Faced with these two competing narratives, conservatives could barely contain themselves. There was so much going on! First liberals-with the help of Antifa, of course-were waging a war on cops. Then, they were trying to curtail our God-given right to congregate at your nearest restaurant and spread disease to beleaguered service workers.\n\nMeanwhile, how dare they demonstrate and create a superspreader event, the hypocrites! \"Now that rioters and looters are gathering in large numbers, the media no longer cares about social distancing, because the media sympathizes with them,\" William Jacobson, a Cornell University law professor and right-wing pundit told Fox News in June. (Just to be clear, the demonstrations were not superspreader events, especially compared to, say, a Rose Garden ceremony .)\n\nThe racial justice demonstrations and the mask wearing debates and Danny Presti all reveal that the Hannitys of the world, for all their high mindedness and passionate conviction, don't actually believe in anything. They are the ultimate cynics. All of the indignation from conservative TV hosts, wily elected officials, and even your obnoxious relative who posts crudely designed political memes on Facebook, often turn out to be just empty rhetoric masquerading as principle. At rallies to support the president's attempt to overturn his election loss, Trump supporters flew Christopher Gadsden's Don't Tread On Me flag, but you can also find them waving the Thin Blue Line flag in a show of support for law enforcement. They're demanding freedom from government intrusion except when that intrusion happens to be law enforcement bearing down on protesters, in which case it's fine. It's not fine, however, when law enforcement tells them to follow the law, like wearing a mask. The end result is an incoherent mix of the- government-better-not-try-to-tell-me-what-to-do, but they-better-tell-those- marginalized-people-what-to-do. Don't tread on me, tread on those other people instead.\n\nIn fact, this line of reasoning is not new to the Trump era. Policing and punishing the poor, while fattening the pockets of the wealthy and well-connected is one of the enduring legacies of the presidency of Ronald Reagan. His family, impoverished by the Great Depression, benefited from Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal program, but as president, Reagan slashed the social safety net, filled up military and law enforcement coffers, and lavished tax breaks on the wealthy. He openly scoffed at the notion that government should help people. \"The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the government, and I'm here to help,\" he memorably said during a 1986 speech. (Democratic President Bill Clinton followed suit and was also cautious about the role of government during his years in the White House.)\n\nToday one would be hard pressed to find any conservative who thinks government should be involved in the lives of citizens by actively providing generous support to those in need. So, today, as Congress is stalled in the process of providing meaningful coronavirus relief, with millions unemployed, up to 40 million facing eviction at the end of the year, and 54 million people going hungry , bar owners like Danny Presti don't see our national crisis as the result of an incompetent and racist government, but rather as direct assault on all their cherished so-called freedoms. He's all about the Reagan myth of pulling ourselves up by our bootstraps, a myth we've been conditioned to accept in lieu of public services.\n\nIn a just world, the conservative cohort, who have spent a good part of this hellacious year appointing themselves as backers of law enforcement , responding to chants of Black Lives Matter with \"blue lives matter,\" flying Thin Blue line flags , and castigating protesters as the real enemy, would have reacted to what Presti did with outrage, framing it as an attack on the protectors of public safety. But clearly they didn't. And in not doing so, they are communicating something fundamental about their priorities: police lives only matter when it's convenient for their narrative.\n\nHow is Presti, who tried to evade arrest and hit a police officer with his car, a victim of police brutality? It all makes sense once you consider that conservatives don't support the police as much as they support the unspoken contract that policing is for other people, especially people of color. And one need only imagine what would have happened had Presti been a Black man doing exactly the same thing. Once cops violate that unspoken contract, they become mere government officials who have no right to tread on their liberty. \"I have nothing but the utmost respect for the NYPD and law enforcement,\" Presti said at a news conference after being released without bail. \"I think when the investigation is complete you're going to find out that I did nothing wrong.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Scientists Are Beginning to Figure Out Why Conservatives Are...Conservative\n\nScientists are using eye-tracking devices to detect automatic response differences between liberals and conservatives. University of Nebraska-Lincoln\n\nYou could be forgiven for not having browsed yet through the latest issue of the journal Behavioral and Brain Sciences . If you care about politics, though, you'll find a punchline therein that is pretty extraordinary.\n\nBehavioral and Brain Sciences employs a rather unique practice called \"Open Peer Commentary\": An article of major significance is published, a large number of fellow scholars comment on it, and then the original author responds to all of them. The approach has many virtues, one of which being that it lets you see where a community of scholars and thinkers stand with respect to a controversial or provocative scientific idea. And in the latest issue of the journal, this process reveals the following conclusion: A large body of political scientists and political psychologists now concur that liberals and conservatives disagree about politics in part because they are different people at the level of personality, psychology, and even traits like physiology and genetics .\n\nThat's a big deal. It challenges everything that we thought we knew about politics-upending the idea that we get our beliefs solely from our upbringing, from our friends and families, from our personal economic interests, and calling into question the notion that in politics, we can really change (most of us, anyway).\n\nThe occasion of this revelation is a paper by John Hibbing of the University of Nebraska and his colleagues, arguing that political conservatives have a \"negativity bias,\" meaning that they are physiologically more attuned to negative (threatening, disgusting) stimuli in their environments. (The paper can be read for free here .) In the process, Hibbing et al. marshal a large body of evidence, including their own experiments using eye trackers and other devices to measure the involuntary responses of political partisans to different types of images. One finding? That conservatives respond much more rapidly to threatening and aversive stimuli (for instance, images of \"a very large spider on the face of a frightened person, a dazed individual with a bloody face, and an open wound with maggots in it,\" as one of their papers put it).\n\nIn other words, the conservative ideology, and especially one of its major facets-centered on a strong military, tough law enforcement, resistance to immigration, widespread availability of guns-would seem well tailored for an underlying, threat-oriented biology.\n\nThe authors go on to speculate that this ultimately reflects an evolutionary imperative. \"One possibility,\" they write, \"is that a strong negativity bias was extremely useful in the Pleistocene,\" when it would have been super-helpful in preventing you from getting killed. (The Pleistocene epoch lasted from roughly 2.5 million years ago until 12,000 years ago.) We had John Hibbing on the Inquiring Minds podcast earlier this year, and he discussed these ideas in depth; you can listen here:\n\nHibbing and his colleagues make an intriguing argument in their latest paper, but what's truly fascinating is what happened next. Twenty-six different scholars or groups of scholars then got an opportunity to tee off on the paper, firing off a variety of responses. But as Hibbing and colleagues note in their final reply, out of those responses, \"22 or 23 accept the general idea\" of a conservative negativity bias, and simply add commentary to aid in the process of \"modifying it, expanding on it, specifying where it does and does not work,\" and so on. Only about three scholars or groups of scholars seem to reject the idea entirely.\n\nThat's pretty extraordinary, when you think about it. After all, one of the teams of commenters includes New York University social psychologist John Jost, who drew considerable political ire in 2003 when he and his colleagues published a synthesis of existing psychological studies on ideology , suggesting that conservatives are characterized by traits such as a need for certainty and an intolerance of ambiguity . Now, writing in Behavioral and Brain Sciences in response to Hibbing roughly a decade later, Jost and fellow scholars note that\n\nThere is by now evidence from a variety of laboratories around the world using a variety of methodological techniques leading to the virtually inescapable conclusion that the cognitive-motivational styles of leftists and rightists are quite different. This research consistently finds that conservatism is positively associated with heightened epistemic concerns for order, structure, closure, certainty, consistency, simplicity, and familiarity, as well as existential concerns such as perceptions of danger, sensitivity to threat, and death anxiety. [Italics added]\n\nBack in 2003, Jost and his team were blasted by Ann Coulter , George Will , and National Review for saying this; congressional Republicans began probing into their research grants; and they got lots of hate mail. But what's clear is that today, they've more or less triumphed. They won a field of converts to their view and sparked a wave of new research, including the work of Hibbing and his team.\n\nGranted, there are still many issues yet to be worked out in the science of ideology. Most of the commentaries on the new Hibbing paper are focused on important but not-paradigm-shifting side issues, such as the question of how conservatives can have a higher negativity bias, and yet not have neurotic personalities. (Actually, if anything, the research suggests that liberals may be the more neurotic bunch.) Indeed, conservatives tend to have a high degree of happiness and life satisfaction. But Hibbing and colleagues find no contradiction here. Instead, they paraphrase two other scholarly commentators (Matt Motyl of the University of Virginia and Ravi Iyer of the University of Southern California), who note that \"successfully monitoring and attending negative features of the environment, as conservatives tend to do, may be just the sort of tractable task...that is more likely to lead to a fulfilling and happy life than is a constant search for new experience after new experience.\"\n\nAll of this matters, of course, because we still operate in politics and in media as if minds can be changed by the best honed arguments, the most compelling facts. And yet if our political opponents are simply perceiving the world differently, that idea starts to crumble. Out of the rubble just might arise a better way of acting in politics that leads to less dysfunction and less gridlock...thanks to science.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Supreme Court Conservatives Just Dealt a Massive Blow to the Administrative State\n\nHerring being unloaded from a fishing boat in Rockland, Maine Robert F. Bukaty/AP\n\nIn one of the most highly anticipated decisions this term, the Supreme Court overturned a 40-year-old legal doctrine, so-called \"Chevron deference,\" under which judges had been expected to defer to a federal agency's interpretation of laws that are ambiguous. The ruling, split 6-3 along ideological lines, will have far-reaching consequences, experts say, and could impact all sorts of federal policies, from health care and taxes to climate change.\n\nThe cases at the center of this decision- Relentless, Inc. v. Department of Commerce and Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo -on their most basic level, involve a dispute about herring fishing and regulatory fees. In an effort to prevent overfishing, the federal government required fishers to pay at least some of the cost for legally mandated monitors to observe their fishing operations. The fishermen behind the cases- backed by anti-regulatory interests like Charles Koch -argued that they shouldn't have to foot the bill because the law doesn't specify who pays.\n\nBut this ruling is much, much bigger than a fight over fishing fees. Vickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, whom I spoke to in advance of the ruling, sees the challenge to Chevron deference (named after a 1984 Supreme Court case, Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council ) as part of an \"extensive campaign\" by industry and their allies to unravel federal authority to regulate food safety, clean air, clean water, protections from consumer fraud, and more. \"The stakes for people's lives are profound,\" she said.\n\n\"Profound\" is right: Chevron is among the legal field's most cited doctrines ever . That's because ambiguity is everywhere in policy-making. And in legal disputes over ambiguous statutes, Chevron says judges, within reason, ought to defer to federal agencies' understanding of those statutes.\n\nIn this case, the law in question was the 1976 Magnuson-Stevens Act. As SCOTUSblog reported in January , the conservation law gives the National Marine Fisheries Service, a federal agency, the power to mandate that \"one or more observers\" ride on fishers' boats to collect data \"necessary for the conservation and management of the fishery.\" In 2020, the agency ruled anglers would be on the hook for the cost too-to the tune of about $700 per day. Herring fishermen sued, and as the cases rose through lower courts, judges invoked Chevron deference, prioritizing the agency's interpretation of the law and ruling in its favor. Now, in a major victory for industry, the Supreme Court just threw out that precedent.\n\nAccording to NRDC lawyer David Doniger, who argued the original 1984 Chevron case before the Supreme Court, Chevron deference mattered because Congress can't possibly weigh in on every last practice of every industry to which a law might apply. That's what expert agencies are for, he argues, so it makes sense for judges to defer to them. \"The only way our government can keep up with the problems that the modern world throws at us is if you have this partnership between Congress and administrative agencies,\" he says.\n\nThose who oppose Chevron , however, argue that the doctrine creates constitutional problems and that the interpretation of laws should be left to judges. As lawyer Roman Martinez said in his opening arguments for Relentless, Inc. , Chevron \"undermines\" judges' duty to interpret federal statutes using their \"best and independent\" judgment and encourages agency overreach.\n\nIn a backward way, the original 1984 case for which Chevron deference was named was actually a win for industry-minded conservatives; the court ruled in favor of the Reagan administration's EPA, which had re-interpreted an amendment to the Clean Air Act in an effort to limit a pollution regulation. Since then, the late Justice Antonin Scalia and Justice Clarence Thomas have both argued in favor of Chevron . But after President Obama's time in office, conservatives started souring on the doctrine.\n\nNo matter your views on Chevron , there's no question overturning it will have major implications for how the country's judicial system operates. Doniger argues that if judges are handed more power to interpret the law, agencies may be more \"gun shy\" in making policies, partisan groups may judge-shop in selected courts to challenge regulations they oppose, and there may be a general \"lack of coherence\" in which agency rules are overturned or upheld. In short, he said, it will diminish the government's ability \"to get stuff done.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Is There Room for Black Conservatives in the GOP When the President Is Racist?\n\nNathalie Baptiste October 29, 2020\n\nOn November 4, 2008, Sean Jackson hesitated in the voting booth in West Palm Beach, Florida. He disagreed with Barack Obama on every issue and had vowed never to vote for someone just because of their skin color. Jackson is Black and wanted to be able to tell his grandchildren that he had voted for the first Black president, but he is also a loyal Republican. For his first presidential election he couldn't quite fathom voting for a Democrat, especially since, as a Floridian, his vote was pivotal. \"It took me 30 minutes to do it,\" Jackson tells me. Would he also tell his grandchildren that he instantly regretted it? \"Honestly, I did it against my own conscience,\" Jackson explains. \"He told us on the campaign trail that he was going to fundamentally change the course of this nation, and, dammit, he did just that.\"\n\nFor the next 12 years, Republican politics began to organize Jackson's life. Not wanting to make the same mistake twice, Jackson voted for Mitt Romney in 2012, despite seeing him as \"nothing more than just an egotistical SOB who just wanted to be president.\" In 2015 Jackson became the leader of the Black Republican Caucus of Florida-a loose organization that is not part of the official Republican Party of Florida but one that Jackson has used to steer Black support to candidates. He threw his weight behind Gov. Ron DeSantis in his bids for US Senate and then governor. Soon it was time for another presidential election, and Jeb! Bush was his man. As for a Trump candidacy? \"There's no way in hell, uh-uh, ain't happening,\" he recalls thinking. \"He can forget about it.\" But after Jeb dropped out, when there was no other choice against Hillary Clinton, Jackson went \"balls to the wall\" for Trump.\n\n\"He started to grow on me,\" Jackson admits. \"I started to like him and became very enthused.\" His character and behavior aside, Trump championed views cherished by people who call themselves Republicans: personal responsibility, organized religion, opposition to abortion, big tax cuts, and small government. At the same time, his overt racism and bizarre insistence that he has been the best president for Black people since Abraham Lincoln have caused many people who consider themselves to be Black Republicans to have second thoughts at the ballot box.\n\nJackson's affection for Trump certainly did not sit well with his family. They criticize him for his Republicanism, which he dismisses because \"they don't know no better\" and \"don't want to hear reason.\"\n\nBecause politicians and the media see Black people as a political monolith, they tend to treat Black supporters of Trump as a spectacle-the zanier they are, the more attention they're given. Even during more ordinary times, Black Republicans are often approached like a sideshow within their own party, put on display by their white, uh, confederates as a demonstration of the GOP's broadmindedness. See! We're not racist! The combination of zany and we're not racist explains how Diamond and Silk grabbed the spotlight on the national stage. It explains the ongoing presence of Candace Owens, a popular right-wing controversialist who heads Blexit, an organization that focuses on persuading Black people to leave the Democratic Party and join the Republican cause.\n\nThe elevation of the kooky Black Republican obscures the presence of people like Jackson and the Black conservative tradition they draw on (and in some ways reject). I'm neither a conservative nor a Black conservative-crucially, these identities are not synonymous-and I'm certainly not a Republican. But I am Black, and I've grown increasingly frustrated with the racist myth that Black people are an unvariegated mass of automatic liberals, as if our political ideologies weren't as complex and crosshatched as anyone else's. All sorts of white people are said all the time to \"vote against their own interests,\" and while we might reject such a programmatic conception of \"interests,\" there's no denying that these Americans are treated as a serious voting bloc deserving of nuance and empathic magazine prose. When Black people do it, they are made to look like clowns.\n\nI want to understand people like Jackson and, for that matter, Diamond and Silk. What drives a Black person in the time of Trump to be a member of a political party that can barely contain its contempt for Black Americans? Has Black Republicanism become completely untied from Black conservatism?\n\n\"The major difference between Black conservatives and Black Republicans is the belief in systemic racial oppression,\" says Tasha Philpot, a professor at the University of Texas and author of Conservative But Not Republican: The Paradox of Party Identification and Ideology among African Americans. \"It's the notion of linked fate, the idea that African Americans see their fates intertwined with other African Americans.\" Black Republicans \"don't put their race above all else,\" Philpot says. \"They believe that racism is more of an individual experience.\" With a president who doesn't bother to dress up his racism in the usual genteel finery, many Black conservatives have fled the Republican Party, and yet there remain Republican faithfuls like Jackson who choose to accept the bigotry for the sake of-well, for the sake of what?\n\nLet's start with a look at polling data, a snapshot of preferences that are distinct from strict party affiliation. Despite being the Democrats' most reliable voting bloc, Black people skew conservative on some major cultural issues. A 2019 Pew Research poll found only 51 percent of Black people supported gay marriage, compared with 62 percent of white people. In a 2020 Gallup poll, 46 percent of Black respondents said abortion was morally acceptable. But other polling shows that a majority of Black people do support a legal right to an abortion. And while a majority of Black people support gun control laws, after Dylann Roof, a white supremacist, murdered nine Black worshippers in a historic church in Charleston, South Carolina, some Black people began to wonder if guns could help protect themselves and their families from racist violence. Since the George Floyd protests began, more Black Americans are considering arming themselves. Philip Smith, the president of the National African American Gun Association, told Politico that his organization has grown by as many as 2,000 new members every day, a number he used to see only annually. Concerns about \"law and order\" have remained another touchstone for Black conservatives. As Michael Steele, the former chair of the Republican National Committee, told me, \"We don't need another white man threatening us with law and order. We support law and order. We get law and order. What we're after is equality.\"\n\nBut you need some history to explain how we arrived at a place where the conservative views of Black people don't necessarily manifest in Republican votes. The story of Jackie Robinson, the first Black man to break Major League Baseball's color line when he played for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947, is instructive. Robinson was a loyal Republican. This was not terribly bizarre in the 1950s. While Black people had begun migrating into the Democratic column in the 1920s, the party's appeasement of its racist Southern wing meant that a significant share of Black votes was up for grabs in the 1950s. Republican President Eisenhower, who sent troops into Little Rock to enforce a school desegregation order and oversaw the passage of the first civil rights bill since Reconstruction, won an estimated 39 percent of nonwhite votes in 1956.\n\nStill, Robinson's friends were stunned when he supported Richard Nixon, Eisenhower's vice president, against John F. Kennedy in 1960. Robinson saw Kennedy's outreach to Southern governors as implicitly supportive of racism and naively considered Nixon someone who would not pander to that constituency. A revealing exchange between Robinson and the RNC's campaign director took place after Nixon's defeat. \"I was terribly disappointed over the election and feel we are at a great loss,\" Robinson wrote him. \"I cannot help but feel we must work for a two-party system as far as the Negro is concerned.\" The campaign director thanked Robinson and replied, \"Personally, it is my judgment that you could be a 'Messiah' for the Republican Party in the days ahead.\"\n\nRobinson never got a chance to be the GOP's Negro Messiah. The civil rights revolution was realigning American politics, forcing Democrats to shore up their losses by enfranchising more Black voters and imposing reforms on the South. In 1964, Barry Goldwater became the Republican presidential candidate. Jackie Robinson attended the GOP convention that year and warned that Goldwater's nomination-and the abuse that was heaped on Black delegates-indicated the party was no longer \"the party of Lincoln.\" Instead, Robinson wrote a New York Herald Tribune op-ed in which he decried \"a new breed which is seeking to sell to Americans a doctrine which is as old as mankind, the doctrine of racial division, the doctrine of racial prejudice, the doctrine of white supremacy.\"\n\nRobinson was describing what would become known as the Southern strategy, whereby the GOP courted white Southerners by appealing to racism. Today we can say with more certainty that the racial radicalization of the Republican Party was a national phenomenon, not regional, and that the influence was running in the other direction-it was white suburbanites turning the Republican Party into a means of upholding the racial order. After 1972, Republicans presidential candidates would only average 10 percent of Black support.\n\nIn response to the advances made during Lyndon Johnson's Great Society initiative, the Nixon administration concocted policies that would dismantle the programs established by Johnson to fight poverty. Behind the scenes, the racism was much more explicit. One 1971 conversation between President Nixon and California Gov. Ronald Reagan was recently revealed by Tim Naftali , a professor of history at New York University. Reagan disparaged the African delegates to the UN as \"monkeys from those African counties-damn them, they're still uncomfortable wearing shoes.\" Nixon responded with a laugh at the gross characterization. A year later, Nixon, who championed \"the great silent majority\" (yet another in a long list of euphemisms for white people), sought to put a moratorium on school busing that was intended to bring some measure of equality to American education.\n\nThe ensuing decades brought high-profile Black conservatives like Clarence Thomas into greater prominence. Thomas used his nomination to Thurgood Marshall's seat on the Supreme Court as proof that racism was over. (Never mind that he called his hearings, which involved sexual harassment allegations against him, a high-tech lynching.) A cadre of Black conservative intellectuals were heralded in a 1981 story in the New York Times Magazine . The lead gave credence to Black people who were simply tired of racism: \"Nathan Wright Jr., educator, author and chairman of the National Assault on Illiteracy Program, is convinced that racism no longer has a 'damn thing' to do with the still-perilous predicament of black America and that Ronald Reagan, a man of 'principle and pragmatism,' is committed to helping blacks advance.\"\n\nOne of the people featured in this story was Thomas Sowell, an economist whose personal story involves bootstrapping his way out of poverty to a PhD in economics from the University of Chicago. That narrative became, for him at least, the model that all Black people could replicate. Sowell never felt impeded by Blackness. Those who did, obviously, were lazy.\n\nIn the 1981 Times article, Sowell insisted that the combination of \"the political interventionist state\" and self-interested Black civil rights leadership have damaged Black people, a theme he would repeatedly revisit for decades to come. In a 2015 essay for the conservative publication National Review , revealingly titled \"The Inconvenient Truth About Ghetto Communities' Social Breakdown,\" Sowell wrote , \"You cannot take any people, of any color, and exempt them from the requirements of civilization-including work, behavioral standards, personal responsibility, and all the other basic things that the clever intelligentsia disdain-without ruinous consequences to them and to society at large.\"\n\nWith the election of the first Black US president in 2008, the GOP went apocalyptic. The tea party movement, at its core a backlash-a whitelash, if you will-to his presidency, was overt racism masquerading as a call for lower taxes and less government intrusion.\n\nEnter Michael Steele as the new head of the GOP. Under Steele's leadership, the Republican Party attempted to move away from the Southern strategy. Although Steele left his post in 2011, the GOP's soul-searching intensified with the 2012 defeat of Mitt Romney. The party conducted a much publicized \"autopsy report\" that asserted that the party had to diversify to stay relevant. \"We need to campaign among Hispanic, black, Asian, and gay Americans and demonstrate we care about them, too,\" the report read . Not that it made much of a difference. Four years later, the party's new standard bearer doubled down on the fear, racism, and xenophobia.\n\nDecades of encouraging and embracing bigotry culminated in a second whitelash with the election of Donald Trump, whose expressions of overt racism began long before he descended the golden staircase and announced his candidacy. A few weeks before the 2016 election, Steele announced that he would not be voting for Trump. \"I believe in this idea of individual rights and liberties,\" he told me. \"While the leaders may have been flawed, those principled ideas transcend those flaws.\"\n\nWe all know what happened next.\n\n\"If Black people just act a certain way, [they] would be afforded rights and freedom\" is how Angela Lewis-Maddox, a political science professor at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, and author of Conservatism in the Black Community: To the Right and Misunderstood , describes the essence of the Black conservative experience, as articulated by Sowell and others. This is not a new phenomenon, she notes. In 1787, Jupiter Hammon, an enslaved person and a writer, addressed a crowd of enslaved people in New York. \"Now I acknowledge that liberty is a great thing, and worth seeking for, if we can get it honestly; and by our good conduct prevail on our masters to set us free.\" God wanted them to obey their masters and who were they to disobey God? Hammon wished for \"younger Negroes\" to be free but was comfortable remaining a slave because it was all he knew. But the belief that their freedom was bound up in their character and not their literal enslavement set the tone for an important theme in Black conservatism. Lack of morals, not racism or indifference or discrimination, could explain the Black condition.\n\n\"The 'legacy of slavery' argument is not just an excuse for inexcusable behavior in the ghettos,\" Sowell writes in the National Review article. \"In a larger sense, it is an evasion of responsibility for the disastrous consequences of the prevailing social vision of our times, and the political policies based on that vision, over the past half century.\" Conservatives obsess over individual morals while excusing the moral failings of an entire apparatus. Black people may as well have enslaved themselves. This broadside is hardly different from the infamous \"Pound Cake\" speech given by comedian, TV star, and convicted rapist Bill Cosby in which he implored young Black men to pull up their pants so white people would respect them.\n\nFrom the work of Sowell and Clarence Thomas, you can make out the contours of modern Black conservative ideology. Patriarchal, individualistic, and capitalistic, fatalistic in its view of racism's persistence, Black conservatism is a sort of thwarted Black nationalism, all bleakness and bootstraps. Just as important is what Black conservatism is not: a palette-swapped movement conservatism, which tends to dislodge race from the heart of the American story. Thomas might dismiss the possibility of any remedy for racism, but racism is at the center of his politics, the source of the pessimism that has shaped his jurisprudence. And if Sowell is heavy-handed in his sermons about morality and respectability, his views still speak to a shared Black experience.\n\nBut there are nuances within Black conservatism, as Lewis-Maddox reminds me. She puts Black conservatives in one of four general categories: First are the members of the religious right, then there are the Afrocentrists, the neoliberals, and the individualists. For each of these four groups of Black conservatives, their understanding of the role racism and discrimination plays in the lives of Black Americans frames their political leanings. Her model confounds any attempt to map the Black political spectrum onto the liberal-conservative paradigm. Many of the 40 percent of Black Democrats who identify as moderate and not liberal would fall into one or more of these categories.\n\nThe religious right, and Jackson would include himself in that group, believe that while white supremacy is partially to blame, Black inequality can also be explained by a lack of morals. Jackson believes that it only makes sense for Black people vote Republican. \"If you look at the Black family, if you look at the values and principles that have guided the Black family from as far back as slavery,\" Jackson insists, \"we are very God-fearing, conservative people.\" And in his view, the Republican Party is the only one that aligns with those godly principles. As we spoke, it became obvious that religion was the main driver of his conservatism. \"It is our responsibility to do just what the word of God says,\" Jackson says, and supporting Republicans who espouse organized religion and pay lip service to small government ideals is the way to do it. \"We are not supposed to go to the government first for our needs,\" he told me. \"We're supposed to go to the Church.\"\n\nNaturally, Jackson isn't alone in thinking that God-fearing Black people belong in the GOP. \"When I think to myself-how do I reconcile being Black and being Republican? I reconcile myself first as a child of God,\" Danielle Robinson, a Black woman from North Carolina told a Raleigh ABC News affiliate in August. \"Black is beautiful, being Black is excellent, and at the end of the day, Black people do not have to continue sacrifice what seems like Blackness, or the direction of what Blackness should be in exchange for real results for our community.\" To this we could include all the Black pastors who were photographed in the White House praying for Trump. Philpot notes that the perspective of those who support the Republican Party because of their personal religiosity tends to lean more towards the white evangelical tradition of Christianity.\n\nThe Afrocentric conservative squares the blame for the condition of Black people on the dominance of whiteness. They are likely to be what we call \"Hoteps\"-the name is from an Egyptian word that means \"at peace.\" These are Black people who practice respectability politics and have socially conservative views. With a strong racial identity, they value the patriarchal family. You can find them on the internet opining about Black people as kings and queens, but only in the patriarchal sense. But because they see white racism as the main reason for the Black condition, they're unlikely to vote for Republicans. Nonetheless, their traditional views place them squarely in the conservative tradition.\n\nNeoliberals tend to be wealthy and gravitate toward a conservative party that favors rich people. Herman Cain, who passed away from the coronavirus in July, was a Republican stalwart. The former CEO of Godfather's Pizza, Cain came to prominence during the 2012 presidential election when he ran on a platform that Trump would repeat four years later: His supposed business acumen would help him become an exemplary candidate. Never mind that the federal tipped minimum wage is stuck at $2.13 an hour thanks, in part, to a lobbying effort he led in the 1990s. Cain popularized a flat tax rate plan and his, ahem, unconventional ways helped make him a serious contender for the White House.\n\nHe was the perfect foil for Barack Obama; how could anyone charge the Republicans with racism if the party was boosting a Black man for the top of the ticket? But in late 2011, Cain suspended his campaign, brought down by several allegations of sexual harassment. As a testament to just how badly the GOP needs visible Black supporters, and how shallow the bench is, Cain was appointed to co-chair Trump's Black Voices for Trump coalition in November 2019. It was unclear how the group planned on drawing Black voters into the fray, but Cain boosted Trump for reelection through the beginning of the pandemic and the massive uprising that spread through the country. In June, Cain attended a Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The state was seeing an uptick in coronavirus cases and Tulsa's public health director had asked the Trump campaign to postpone the rally. Reeling from the controversy over his gassing of protesters in Washington, DC, for an awkward photoshoot in front of a historic church, Trump refused.\n\nCain was photographed at the rally shoulder-to-shoulder with other maskless Black Trump supporters. Less than two weeks later, in early July, he announced that he'd been hospitalized with the coronavirus. He died on July 30. Cain's public relations team continues to tweet from his account and write blog posts downplaying the virus and supporting Trump. It's unclear whom these posthumous posts are for. The Republican Party has forgotten about him.\n\nIndividualists see themselves as an American first and don't feel particularly bound to race. \"I work hard. I did all this and it didn't have anything to do with my race,\" Lewis-Maddox says, explaining their thinking. Candace Owens best fits this bill. \"It was because America is a great country and America is a land of opportunity and everybody can get whatever they want if they just work hard,\" Lewis-Maddox says. It also doesn't hurt the self-interested that the overwhelming majority of Black people support the Democratic Party. \"If you are one of the handful of Trump supporters who's African American, you're guaranteed at least some screen time,\" Philpot says, \"if not a position of prominence.\"\n\nIt appears that Jackson also fits at least partially into this final category. An investigation of his work by the Tampa Bay Times that appeared this summer found that there are few active members of the caucus he says he heads, and that Jackson seems to have operated without much oversight, much less organizational structure, even though he brags about representing 60,000 registered Black Republicans in this crucial swing state. Jackson did not respond to a request for follow-up comment on this discrepancy. Nonetheless, as one of Trump's self-appointed Black champions, he attracts some media attention, basically by dismissing racist statements by Republicans like Gov. Ron DeSantis and Donald Trump. It's essentially part of the job description.\n\nBlack Republicanism can be located in this taxonomy but the practical realities of being an elected Black Republican right now mean that the language of Black conservatism is being used to address white audiences. This was the case at the Republican National Convention in August, during which Black political figures were trotted out less to pull in Black voters than to assure white moderates that their party had not gone full Confederate.\n\nTim Scott, the senator from South Carolina, was among them. Scott, soon to be the last Black Republican in Congress, was elected in Sen. Lindsey Graham's South Carolina, and his constituents are overwhelmingly white. In his various defenses of the president, Scott hems and haws. When Trump refused to denounce the Proud Boys, a far-right extremist group, at the first presidential debate in 2020, Scott offered the president a lifeline. \"I think he misspoke. I think he should correct it,\" he said. \"If he doesn't correct it, I guess he didn't misspeak.\" At the RNC in 2012, Scott spoke of learning to \"think his way out of poverty.\" He said, \"My journey has been filled with potholes-I hit them all. But in America a kid born anywhere at anytime can rise to the level that he or she wants to go.\" Scott isn't blind to racism-he opposed Trump's nomination of Thomas Farr to the federal judiciary because of Farr's work with arch-segregationist Jesse Helms-but his politics are shaped around avoiding direct confrontation with it. \"Education and hard work are the closest things to magic,\" he once said.\n\nThen there's Daniel Cameron, Kentucky's Republican attorney general who was tasked with deciding whether the Louisville police officers committed a crime when they shot and killed Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman, while she slept in her bed. After a grand jury indicted one of the officers involved for wanton endangerment for shooting into Taylor's neighbors' apartment, Cameron, a Mitch McConnell protege, earned praise from the president, the most important member of his white audience. Cameron also spoke at the RNC in August.\n\nThere are exceptions. Appearing on the What the Hell Is Going On? podcast hosted by conservatives Marc Thiessen and Danielle Pletka, Rep. Will Hurd, a Texas Republican, laid out a history of structural racism that would not have been out of place in an anti-racist consciousness-raising session:\n\nIn San Francisco, after World War II, there were places where African Americans weren't allowed to get FHA loans. There were communities that were built that weren't allowed to have black people apply to try to rent those homes. This is what everyone would consider liberal progressive San Francisco, and we're talking '40s and '50s. And you can fast forward to 1968, where a lot of those things were still going on and that stuff was still happening even in the '70s. So, while a lot of those things have been taken off the books today, the ramifications of those previous decisions are still having an influence.\n\nBut Hurd isn't running for reelection. He's giving up his seat after this, his third term.\n\nMichael Steele was the first Black man elected in a Maryland statewide office as lieutenant governor. He has endorsed Joe Biden but he has not yet given up on the Republican Party. He still imagines the GOP can still be wrested from the president's grip. \"In order to fight for the future of the GOP, it starts by defeating a president who is an anathema to the very principles that were so inviting to me as a young man,\" Steele told the Washington Post 's Jonathan Capehart in August. \"Trump's full-throated embrace of conspiracies and white nationalism; his encroachments on our constitutional values; his efforts to undermine the integrity of our voting system and the seemingly interminable fear most Republicans have of a tweet is enough.\"\n\nAs Steele tells me, \"It's been frustrating to me to see the party resorting to its old tactics.\" But maybe the party isn't resorting to old tactics. Maybe after all these years, it's openly embracing what's been its core principles since the Southern strategy. In the end the question is not if it's a place that Black conservatives could ever consider home, it is why some could imagine it would ever change.\n\nI asked Jackson to give me the spiel he'd give to a potential Black voter. \"For 60 years we've been promised these things,\" he answered. \"In less than three years, a white president, not a Black president, a white president was the one to actually give it to us.\"\n\nThis talking point is the fallback for most Black people who support Trump, and it's the one the president has emphasized relentlessly, as recently as during the last debate. They tout the First Step Act, a bill he championed and signed into law that aims to reduce sentences for some inmates, his success in securing funding for HBCUs, and the creation of economic opportunity zones, a program that allows investors to save on taxes when building in low-income neighborhoods. The criminal justice reform bill has been criticized for failing to meaningfully address mass incarceration, and opportunity zones have been widely disparaged as a boon to the wealthy, not to the poor. The bill that granted funding for HBCUs had been negotiated by Congress for months before the president signed it.\n\nBut even though he has campaigned for him, Jackson has lost some of his enthusiasm for Donald Trump. When he explained when his disillusionment began, I was surprised. Surely, it was when the president refused to do anything to get a handle on the pandemic, which has had a disproportionate impact on Black and Brown communities. Or the economic collapse that his inaction spurred, which has also fallen disproportionately on Black and Brown communities. Or when George Floyd was killed by a white police officer who pressed his knee into his back for nearly nine minutes, and Trump responded to the mass protests with tear gas and federal troops. It turns out, it was much earlier than that. \"I traveled across in all 67 counties of the state of Florida for him,\" Jackson says. \"I did it all. Then Omarosa came in with him and then I wished to God that I had never gotten behind him.\"\n\nWait. What?\n\nThe Omarosa? The Omarosa Manigault Newman who had been a contestant on The Apprentice and gone on to a White House job? Though a long-time Democrat, she joined Trump's campaign as the director of outreach for African Americans and then his administration in the Office of Public Liaison. \"I realized very quickly that she was not going to be the voice of reason between him and the Black community,\" Jackson says of Newman. \"It was all about her.\" Jackson could not fathom why any Black voter would take Trump seriously if he thought Omarosa was the best person for the job. \"She didn't give a damn about Black America,\" Jackson notes, \"which in retrospect shows that [Trump] didn't give a damn about Black America.\" Newman was fired in December 2017 after less than a year on the job. She claimed Trump was a racist, and that she'd heard tape of Trump using racial slurs. To Jackson, Trump relying on someone who was more interested in self-promotion than actual political outreach proved that wasn't really interested in reaching out to Black voters. It revealed a stunning lack of self-reflection.\n\nJackson says the president's pandemic response and his reaction to the protests have made it close to impossible to convince Black people to vote for him. \"You can't just come at Black people in such a tone and manner that makes it seem as if you're not being sensitive to the needs of our community,\" Jackson says about the way Trump has threatened protesters and sent racist tweets during the uprising. \"And furthermore, you have to understand that there is such a little thing called institutional racism.\"\n\nJackson is slippery on this score. He uses the phrase \"institutional racism\" and yet does not think that Trump, a real estate mogul once sued by the Justice Department for discriminating against would-be Black tenants, is racist. Instead, he excuses Trump's racism as a function of his privileged upbringing-as if racism weren't embedded in the advantages with which Trump was born. Jackson says the president is someone who \"never had to deal with\" this in his life and thus does not know how \"to be sensitive to it.\" Despite it all, Jackson is still voting for Trump. \"I'm not voting for the person,\" he assures me. \"I'm voting for the principles of that party, of my party, of the Republican Party.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "What Should Liberals and Conservatives Write More About?\n\nOver at National Review , Jim Geraghty joins in the mockery of all the lavish Christmas trips that the editors of British Vogue wrote about last month:\n\nThose extravagant Christmas vacation plans are even more ironic with the arrival of the first issue of Vogue in 2020 which brings the declaration of \" Vogue values.\" The magazine declares, \"in 2020, Vogue promises to live more sustainably every day, in every way.\" The print magazine includes a letter from \"all of the editors in chief of Vogue \" declaring: \" Vogue stands committed to practices that celebrate cultures and preserve the planet for future generations. We speak with a unified voice, across 26 editions standing for the values of diversity, responsibly, and respect for individuals, communities, and for our natural environment.\" Again, in a matter of hours, these editors racked up more carbon emissions than the average American does in three weeks - and that's just from the flights, not from anything else they did on their extravagant getaways. Just how loose are the standards for \"living sustainably\" at Vogue ?\n\nOK, fine. Vogue editors probably deserve all this just on general principles. If you can't mock Vogue , who can you mock?1\n\nStill, this should stop. Personal contributions to fighting climate change are pretty near zero, and it's not controversial to say that we should stop trying to guilt our way to saving the planet. Practically every serious environmentalist is on board with this. On a personal level, you should go ahead and do whatever you want. If that means making a difference by getting rid of your dryer and hanging your clothes on a line in the backyard, then do that. If it means flying to Bermuda, then fly to Bermuda. They're both perfectly good choices-the first since every little bit helps, and the second since, nonetheless, the only way we'll make a real dent in global warming is via massive collective action-that is, action at the national and international level.\n\nOf course, this is National Review . The only time they mention climate change is when there's a chance to mock people who take it seriously. Likewise, the only time they mention the plight of the poor is when there's a chance to write about a program that doesn't work or a beneficiary who cheated. The only time they mention African Americans is when there's a chance to defend the police or mock some aspect of modern wokeness.2\n\nIf you ask them, they'll say they take climate change seriously. They aren't a bunch of idiot Trumpies who think it's all a Chinese hoax. They'll also say they truly want to help the poor. And they agree that racism is still a problem in America. That's what they'll say. But when it comes time to write about it, somehow it's always on the other side. That's not a coincidence.\n\nAll of us in the writing biz demonstrate our priorities by what we choose to write about. I think National Review shows its priorities by declining to write about the dangers of climate change; the genuine problems faced by the poor and homeless; and the racism that still afflicts America , especially in their own circle of movement conservatism.\n\nThat's what I'd like to see them write more about-from a conservative perspective, of course. But what do they think we progressive writers ignore that we shouldn't? Perhaps they think I should write more about ways to improve the military. Or ways to keep our borders secure. Or ways to keep universities open to conservative voices. Or something else. That is, I shouldn't write about these things only when I have a chance to mock conservative hypocrisy or cite a study showing that conservatives are wrong.\n\nAnd maybe so. But what should those subjects be? The three I chose for NR are off the top of my head, but they're good enough. I'll stick with them. What do they have for me?\n\n1This is going to get me in trouble. I should be getting a call from my sister shortly.\n\n2This footnote is the obligatory \"not all the time\" acknowledgment. This isn't 100 percent of their writing on these subjects. But I'd peg it at 90 percent or so.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Do You Remember What Conservatives Feared About Hillary?\n\nXinhua via ZUMA\n\nDo you remember \"The Flight 93 Election\" ? It was an essay written in 2016 by Michael Anton, a sometime speechwriter for Rupert Murdoch, Rudy Giuliani, and George W. Bush, who also had a bit of Wall Street experience salted in over the years. It was printed in the Claremont Review of Books and it-oh hell, let's just give you a taste:\n\n2016 is the Flight 93 election: charge the cockpit or you die. You may die anyway. You-or the leader of your party-may make it into the cockpit and not know how to fly or land the plane. There are no guarantees. Except one: if you don't try, death is certain. To compound the metaphor: a Hillary Clinton presidency is Russian Roulette with a semi-auto. With Trump, at least you can spin the cylinder and take your chances.\n\nAnton's essay had a huge impact when it was written, and in a way it describes the id of the Trumpist movement. In a nutshell, Anton argued that the nation was declining and close to collapse, which meant that voting for Donald Trump was our only choice. Like the passengers on Flight 93, who could charge the cockpit and probably die or do nothing and definitely die, conservatives needed to vote for Donald Trump whether they liked it or not. Sure, he might be a disaster. But Hillary Clinton would definitely be a disaster.\n\nRich Lowry, editor of National Review , reminded me of \"The Flight 93 Election\" a few days ago, and it produced two thoughts when I reread it. The first is something I've mentioned before: the reason conservatives fight so hard is that they really, truly believe that liberals are bringing about the collapse of the country. The second is that they're completely wrong. Consider the \"litany of ills,\" that Anton enumerates at the beginning of his essay. I'm reproducing them here word-for-word, adding only numbers to make them easier to reference:\n\nThat all sounds pretty terrible. How about if we go through them one by one?\n\nThere's no question that births to single mothers skyrocketed during the '70s through the early aughts, and it's certainly arguable that although this hardly portends the downfall of the nation, it's had unhealthy effects on society. That said, during the Obama administration unmarried births went down, especially among teens:\n\nAnd then there's this:\n\nAs you can see, the highest concentrations of single mothers are in the deep-red south, pushing up into the industrial Midwest that's been trending Republican for several decades. It's lower along the West coast and the Northeast, and lowest in the Plains states. There's a lot of noise here, but it certainly suggests that if single mothers are an epidemic, it's one where ground zero is in places dominated by conservatives, not liberals.\n\nAny regular reader of this blog knows that crime isn't up. In fact, thanks to the introduction of unleaded gasoline in 1975, it's gone down tremendously since 1990.\n\nThis is a favorite bugaboo of conservatives, but it's just not true. Over the past half century, government spending has generally gone up during recessions and down during economic expansions-as it should. But over the long term spending has been flat. In 1970, total spending came to 34 percent of GDP. In 2020 it came to . . . 34 percent of GDP.\n\nBy this, I presume that Anton is talking about \"wokeness,\" the movement to increase awareness of things like systemic racism and rape culture. Like any movement led by young idealists, it can go too far sometimes, but aside from a few high-profile scalps it seems to have done little or no harm to conservatives. In fact, Anton may be surprised to learn that, if anything, it's caused more internecine warfare among liberals than anything else.\n\nIn any case, it turns out that Americans have become more tolerant of letting people speak over the past few decades. The only exception is a growing intolerance for racists, which I assume even Anton considers a good trend. Personally, I doubt this affects many of us who aren't political junkies, but I'll still give Anton half a point for this.\n\nThis is ridiculous. Personal income taxes have stayed steady since the 1950s and corporate income taxes have gone down . Among the rich, JFK lowered the top marginal rate from 90 percent to 70 percent and Ronald Reagan reduced it further to 50 percent. Since then it's bounced around in the vicinity of 40 percent. Meanwhile, Medicare and Social Security taxes, which primarily hit the middle classes, have indeed gone up. This, however, has been at the behest of Republicans, not Democrats.\n\nNobody really knows if this is true. Every year the American Society of Civil Engineers isuses a report in which they give the United States a D+ for its infrastructure, which is duly reported in all major media. But then, they would say that, wouldn't they? They're civil engineers, and they want an excuse to build new stuff. But what does our infrastructure look like if we take a more objective look at it? Here's an example from Brookings:\n\nWe continue to build thousands of miles of interstate highway, and the overall smoothness of the highways has been improving since the early '90s. The rest of the report suggests that we have more buses than ever and the age of the fleet is steady. Ditto for the urban rail fleet. It says nothing about bridges, but here's a comparison of bridge failure rates over time from a paper published last year:\n\nThis is a little hard to read since the y-axis is on a log scale with negative exponents, but what it tells us is that bridge failures have fallen by more than half since 1950. This is for all bridges in the world, but the evidence suggests that American and European bridges are about equally reliable.\n\nBottom line: We do have bridges and roads that need work, but generally speaking our infrastructure is OK.\n\nGotta give it to Anton on this one. We really do suck at counterinsurgency.\n\nThis is just flatly untrue. High school graduation rates are up, and students today graduate with much better math skills than their parents and grandparents. The results in reading are more equivocal, but they certainly haven't gone down.\n\nAs for whether the school system is willing to discipline \"disruptive punks,\" as Anton puts it, here are two charts that speak to this:\n\nIn summary: graduation rates are up; reading and math scores are up, violent behavior on campus is down, and satisfaction with K-12 education has stayed steady for the past two decades. And in case you're curious, the US ranks about average among all countries for bullying.\n\nNo argument here. Student debt is indeed out of control.\n\nAnton is unclear what he means by this, so let's take a look at both legal and illegal immigration. Here is illegal immigration:\n\nIllegal border crossings sometimes spike up, as they did in 2019, but generally speaking they've plummeted since their peak in 2000. Now here's legal immigration:\n\nLegal permanent residency has steadily increased since 1960, but it's been pretty flat for the past 25 years. There's nothing much to see here even if you think legal immigration is bad for the country.\n\nThe basic lesson here is striking. Anton is not just scared, but absolutely terrified of national trends that, upon inspection, melt away. I feel much the same way I do when I hear some conservative pundit talking about what a hellhole California is. Well, I live here, and it seems pretty nice to me. We have our problems, just like any state, but overall California is a generally good place to live.\n\nNeedless to say, this terror of liberals didn't stop with Hillary Clinton. It attaches to Joe Biden or, for that matter, to any Democrat. Like Anton, the insurrectionists who stormed the Capitol are emotionally convinced that the country is sliding into decay and eventual collapse. They get this from Fox News and other places, but they've never stopped to look around and see if it's really true. Because the truth is that the stuff Anton is afraid of barely even exists. I give him full marks for pointing out both ineptitude in our disastrous recent wars and our skyrocketing student debt. Welcome to the left, comrade! And I give him a half mark for moments of excessive political correctness. If this is enough to make something into a Flight 93 election, then so be it. Alternatively, he could just become a Democrat and get nearly everything he wants while having a seat at the table to rein in the wokeness project if that's what really bothers him.

      "text": "What Do Conservatives Want?\n\nNOTE: See update below.\n\nThis chart comes from John Sides, who gathered information from the 2008 American National Election Study about spending priorites. Self identified conservatives, it turns out, aren't actually in favor of cutting spending on much of anything. Child care scored the worst for some reason, getting more hostility than even perennial bogeymen like foreign aid and welfare. Still, even at that, only 20% of conservatives wanted to cut child care spending, and scores dropped precipitously from there.\n\nWhat to make of this? It's a pretty good guess that if conservatives don't want to cut Social Security then they don't want to cut Medicare either. War on terrorism is probably a pretty good proxy for the defense budget. Low scores for public schools + welfare + aid to the poor suggests they don't really want to cut social safety net programs. And interest on the national debt is off limits no matter what they think. That accounts for about 90% of the federal budget right there, and spending on highways, the environment, crime, science, and foreign aid probably takes care of another 5%. And that's pretty much the whole ball of wax.\n\nThe lesson from this? It turns out that conservative politicians really do represent their base pretty well. They like to yammer endlessly about cutting spending, but when push comes to shove, there's not much they really think we're spending too much on. It's all just venting.\n\nUPDATE: It turns out that Sides made some mistakes in his original chart. The corrected version is on the right, and a corrected post is here.\n\nThe basic point still holds: conservatives aren't in favor of cutting very much. However, foreign aid is still a bogeyman, though it represents only a tiny part of the federal budget, and conservatives are in favor of cutting \"welfare\" generally, though not so much in favor of cutting specific welfare programs.\n\nThis makes a little more sense: opposition to \"welfare\" is a longstanding conservative issue. Still, when you get down to specifics, there still aren't very many programs that more than a small fraction of conservatives actually want to cut.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

The answer was a resounding \"NO.\" Clearly, despite the drama, the policy successes of the first Trump administration still resonate strongly with Americans. Indeed, Trump's first term boasts a remarkable record: economic vibrancy, American strength on the international stage, border security, and protections for family, religion and individual liberty.\n\nBuilding on this foundation is the best path toward restoring American security and prosperity. However, the 2.0 version of President-elect Donald Trump displays a worrisome willingness to diverge from the time-proven conservative principles that marked his first term.\n\nThe 2.0 version of President-elect Donald Trump displays a worrisome willingness to diverge from the time-proven conservative principles that marked his first term.\n\nToday's GOP is being courted by a populist ideology more akin to that of Bernie Sanders than Ronald Reagan - predicated on protectionism, isolationism, government intervention to provide circumstantial appeasement, embrace of union bosses and an abandonment of the pro-life cause. If the voters are indicating they were better off four years ago, it seems counterintuitive to walk away from the successful strategies of Trump's first term.\n\nFollow MSNBC's live blog for the latest updates and expert analysis on Donald Trump's inauguration.\n\nThere are, to be sure, reasons for excitement among conservatives as Trump retakes the White House. Chief among them are economic revival and border security. These were the most important issues for voters in the 2024 election, and Trump's schema for addressing them is drastically different from the Biden-Harris disaster of the last four years.\n\nUnder the previous administration, prices rose more than 22% overall and real wages fell by 1.3% . Kamala Harris' campaign promises of socialist-style price controls and nonsense claims about \"price gouging\" clearly did not restore voter confidence. Additionally, in a study produced for the Committee to Unleash Prosperity, Casey Mulligan, former chief economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisers, showed Biden's overbearing regulations cost American households around $10,000 each . The Biden administration's spending has been so reckless that the Congressional Budget Office now estimates the federal debt will be $7.2 trillion higher by 2031 than its projections from four years ago.\n\nAmerican voters believe Trump will be more effective in extinguishing inflation and protecting them from higher taxes. One of the clearest and simplest steps Trump and Congress should take to stimulate economic growth is to extend the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TJCA). A hallmark of the Trump-Pence administration, the TCJA created a revenue boom that massively outperformed CBO projections, despite a global pandemic. The tax cuts also gave Americans more of their hard-earned wages back, increasing real median household income by more than $6,000 over two years. Small businesses were freed from the shackles of overregulation, and the reduction in the corporate tax rate allowed American businesses to be globally competitive.\n\nEconomic advancement can also come through unleashing American energy, a cause which Trump campaigned on vociferously. The Orwellian-named Inflation Reduction Act has been a categorical disaster. Not only has it crippled innovation and distorted markets with haphazard subsidies, but it has also cost $1.2 trillion more than its supporters originally claimed . Supplanting the IRA with domestic energy production will bolster the labor market and provoke a much-needed uptick in domestic manufacturing.\n\nTo address voters' concerns about the southern border, Trump should resume his first-term policies to stop the uncontrolled influx of drugs and crime into the United States. Weapons , fentanyl and humans are being trafficked over the southern border at soaring rates. The new administration should move swiftly to eliminate Biden's disastrous \"catch and release\" policies, finally put an end to sanctuary cities by declaring them ineligible for federal grants, and mobilize immigration enforcement to protect American citizens from migrant violence.\n\nAmerican voters believe Trump will be more effective in extinguishing inflation and protecting them from higher taxes.\n\nMeasures like these are resonant of Trump 1.0. They are continuations of proven success, and they harken back to the prosperity and safety the American electorate is seeking. Concern arises in the realms where Trump plans to diverge from this track record. Voters may find that Trump 2.0 renounces much of what they remembered from four years ago.\n\nNational security was one of the strongest contrasts to the Biden-Harris record. Unfortunately, Trump's transition has featured alarming appeasement of Chinese causes. Trump joined the Biden administration in opposing a merger of U.S. Steel at the behest of union bosses, thus jeopardizing thousands of blue-collar jobs, an agreement that would have made American manufacturing much more globally competitive and provided steel manufacturing parity against our communist foe. Moreover, Trump has performed a full about-face in his approach to TikTok, switching from rightly acknowledging it as a national security threat to advocating the Supreme Court overturn the law of the land.\n\nWhile Trump's domestic economic program has much to commend, his trade agenda is deeply troubling. The undeniable benefits of extending the TCJA would be nullified by his proposed global unilateral tariffs, which would make basic consumer goods, like groceries and school supplies, immensely more expensive. The guiding principles for U.S. trade policy should be ensuring fair competition, open markets and a level playing field, not inflicting real economic pain on American citizens for the sake of appeasing arbitrarily chosen industries.\n\nThe most striking example, however, of the GOP's wandering off course is the disavowal of the pro-life movement. Trump's approach to abortion is now marred by total apathy; the Dobbs decision is being leveraged as an excuse to sit idly while hundreds of thousands of babies conceived in blue states never survive the abortion industry. Trump's nominee for the head of Health and Human Services, outspoken abortion advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has a careerlong opposition to the pro-life cause. Yet, Senate Republicans seem poised to reject the unborn for the sake of party obedience. If Trump does not course-correct and return to the pro-life resolutions of his first term, the pro-abortion vestiges of the Biden-Harris administration will endure.\n\nGovernmental interference in market activity is historically a trait of the left. Sadly, Trump seems open to incorporating it into his second term.\n\nUltimately, Trump has the map to success from his first administration. Americans expressed their frustration with the ridiculous excesses of the Biden-Harris regime, and Trump's first stint in the White House stands out clearly as the preferred alternative. Should he choose to ditch this winning record and dive into a populist abyss, it is possible that much of the damage inflicted by the Biden-Harris administration will remain unresolved; or, in some cases, be made worse.\n\nMarc Short served as Chief of Staff to Vice President Mike Pence and as Assistant to the President and Director of Legislative Affairs at the White House for President Donald J.

      "text": "A Kamala Harris win could save conservatism\n\nWATCH LIVE: Journalists and political leaders take part in the 2025 White House Correspondents' Dinner\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nTo MAGA-era conservatives , there is no crime more unforgivable than for a traditional, Reagan-era Republican to endorse voting for Vice President Kamala Harris . You won't find any such endorsement here: I care less about whom you're voting for than you should care about for whom I'm casting my ballot.\n\nOf course Harris can't keep the price of food and clothing down by setting up a ridiculous \"price gouging\" law (and if she could, why hasn't the Biden/Harris administration done so yet?). Obviously giving $25,000 to first-time homebuyers would increase demand and drive up housing prices. And taxing unrealized gains would be economically catastrophic, bureaucratically unworkable and almost certainly unconstitutional.\n\nIt's not like Republicans have spent the past nine years defending the bedrock principles of free-market conservatism.\n\nBut it's not like Republicans have spent the past nine years defending the bedrock principles of free-market conservatism. Slowly but surely, most of them have contorted themselves into endorsing whatever former President Donald Trump thinks \"economic populism\" is.\n\nThat's why, with less than two months until the election, there should be an honest discussion of whether a Trump loss would be best in the long term for \"conservatism\" as traditionally understood. In a sense, a Harris presidency could serve as a type of political chemotherapy: a poisonous injection meant to eradicate a tumor in order to keep a major political party alive.\n\nWhat happens to traditional free-market, low-tax conservatism if Trump were to win in November? One could argue the classical liberalism horse has already jumped the fence, never to return. But if America gives up and returns Trump to the presidency, \"conservatism\" as many of us understood it for the past half-century would simply become a museum piece, gathering dust on library shelves.\n\nA second Trump term would mean that for the next four years, conservatism would continue its descent into whatever Trump decides it is based on the last person to whom he spoke. He would continue to insist tariffs are paid by other countries, when in fact economists are nearly unanimous in their belief those costs are borne by American consumers. Trump would continue to fumble the abortion issue, dragging Republicans into becoming the maybe-pro-life-sometimes-when-it's-politically-convenient party. And he would destroy faith in American elections, but conveniently only in states in which he loses.\n\nFurther, if Trump were to win, the right would have permanently ceded any moral ground to the left.\n\nOver the past four decades, the GOP's defense of morality, family values and patriotism was the sinew that held the party together. These were fundamental ties that held together religious conservatives, libertarian-leaning Americans worried about taxes and the economy and national defense hawks.\n\nIf Trump were to win, the right would have permanently ceded any moral ground to the left.\n\nBut Trump believes in none of these things. On the personal side, his amoral predilections are well-known and have been for 40 years (and have cost him dearly in courts around America).\n\nPublicly, his idea of strength is to demean the presidency by cozying up with dictators and strongmen around the world. He mocks great American cities for their crime problems while he himself is carrying dozens of felonies on his ledger. Exactly what limited government principle was Trump \"conserving\" when he called for the \" termination \" of certain parts of the Constitution in order to return himself to the presidency?\n\nGranted, it is rarely beneficial for a political party to occupy the minority in American politics, but the GOP's best chance at regaining its conservative heritage may be to mold itself in opposition to Harris' positions. This would allow those truly interested in liberty to oppose taxes, regulations, court-packing and \"green\" mandates instead of obsessing over whether Harris is Black or Indian, whether photos of her crowds have been doctored with artificial intelligence or whether America is overrun by single women who enjoy the companionship of felines.\n\nAmerica has had good presidents and bad presidents. It has survived Democrats and Republicans, conservatives and progressives. Each time it has come out on the other side, electing a new administration that corrects the course of the previous one.\n\nBut Donald Trump isn't a true member of a party, nor does he clutter his mind with any ideological knowledge or allegiances. He is simply a political movement unto himself who responds with ridicule and scorn to any attempts to undergird his mercurial instincts with a cogent philosophy. He doesn't recognize the rules that have kept America a functioning republic for nearly 250 years, which has left the nation in the inconceivable position of either electing a man to the presidency or potentially sending him to prison for most of the remainder of his life.\n\nConversely, Kamala Harris is a standard, run-of-the-mill Democrat with bad ideas. Her administration would prompt groans and eye-rolls among conscious conservatives while sending the deranged fringes of the Republican Party into full conspiracy mode.\n\nA Harris administration would be a painful four years for Republicans in the way America muddled through terms by Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and Joe Biden. But pain is also the way the body teaches you a lesson. And the lesson in this case is that the sooner Republicans cut out the Trump tumor, the quicker they can once again become a healthy political party.\n\nChristian Schneider writes the Anti-Knowledge newsletter.

More people live unmarried , in multigenerational households, or in blended families. More women are primary breadwinners. More children are born without married parents . The Covid-19 pandemic produced new categories of interpersonal dependency in the form of \"bubbles,\" \"quaranteams,\" and \"pods,\" which combined friends, relatives, other people's children, and even divorced or separated partners. For many people, it is no longer possible or desirable to leave home, marry, purchase property, and have children. Threatened by these changes, the conservative movement wants to resurrect a narrow vision of the \" traditional \" family. To do so, they have unleashed an unprecedented legislative campaign targeting LGBTQ+ rights, especially those of transgender people, and shattered the rights to reproductive freedom. In the aftermath of Roe v. Wade , many have been quick to point out the hypocrisy of Republican policies that purport to be \"pro-life\" only until birth. In response, conservatives now argue that they must begin to develop legislation around \"the basic social building block of the family.\" But what counts as \"family\" is an open question-and one that progressives have a stake in fighting over. Indeed, the changes in American kinship have created expanded possibilities for fostering intimacy, care, labor, pleasure, and belonging. Anyone who finds themselves outside of the \"traditional\" family, regardless of their sexual or gender identity, should ally with LGBTQ+ people to defend the right to kinship in whatever form it takes. Queer kinship first emerged in the early 1990s as a concept in anthropology to describe the ways that LGBTQ+ people develop bonds outside of the heteronormative family. Kath Weston's groundbreaking Families We Choose (1991) documented how LGBTQ+ people, often ejected from their home and family unit, make lasting intimacies that are not structured around legal or blood relations. Yet queer kinship is not limited to LGBTQ+-identified people. As our research shows, queer kinship takes many different forms. It can include but is not limited to: polyamory, non-monogamy, platonic partnerships, polycules, adoption, surrogacy, assisted reproduction, multigenerational friendships, peer parenting, diasporic intimacies, and more. What counts as queer kinship changes drastically over time, from romantic friendships to ongoing sexual play partners . This is because it is a creative way of forming bonds without a clear road map for how they should look.

But their list also includes Bridgerton , The Boys , and The Mandalorian , which aren't directly about queer life but do rethink the contours of the family. Such expansive understandings of family are welcome, but there is a danger of idealizing kinship in ways that erase the systemic violence that shapes intimate bonds. In the context of LGBTQ+ cultures, chosen families are not insulated from intimate-partner violence or racial discrimination . And we should never forget that our nation has privileged the white, patriarchal, and heterosexual family while destroying others, including our genocidal history of forcing Indigenous communities to conform to normative kinship in the name of \"civilization.\" A founding moment in United States kinship law lies in the 1662 colonial Virginia doctrine of partus sequitur ventrem , which dictated that children of enslaved women would inherit their mother's legal status. As Black feminist scholars have long noted , slave owners had a property incentive to rape enslaved women and produce more children, legally making enslaved Black people \"kinless\" insofar as their inherited status as property denied them marital and parental rights. Much more recently, under Donald Trump, undocumented migrant families were forcibly separated between April and June 2018, and some have yet to be reunited. In short, our nation is adept at shredding familial bonds when it serves white supremacy and economic superiority.

And in June, Alabama borrowed the rationale and even the wording of the Dobbs decision to argue in federal court that the state, not parents, has authority over a child's right to receive gender-affirming care. Similar anti-LGBTQ+ legislation has caused the parents of trans children to flee from states like Texas out of fear of imprisonment and violence. LGBTQ+ or not, some people are being forced to become parents; others are denied the ordinary rights granted to parents.

Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling striking down Roe v.

And in June, Alabama borrowed the rationale and even the wording of the Dobbs decision to argue in federal court that the state, not parents, has authority over a child's right to receive gender-affirming care.

This moment lays bare the reality of a nation that has long sought to control the bodies , bonds, and reproductive lives of its people. The goal of the conservative movement is clear: to enshrine the white, heterosexual, and patriarchal family as the only acceptable form of kinship; and to enforce conformity to that ideal, even if it requires stripping away the rights of anyone who would dare to imagine an alternative. Our goal must be equally clear: to support politically and economically the many different forms of kinship, including those that do not travel under the sign of \"family\" and especially those that the nation has stigmatized, criminalized, and cruelly ruptured. Queer kinship can be a rallying cry for anyone and everyone who wants the freedom to pursue different forms of belonging together.\n\nSuch expansive understandings of family are welcome, but there is a danger of idealizing kinship in ways that erase the systemic violence that shapes intimate bonds. In the context of LGBTQ+ cultures, chosen families are not insulated from intimate-partner violence or racial discrimination . And we should never forget that our nation has privileged the white, patriarchal, and heterosexual family while destroying others, including our genocidal history of forcing Indigenous communities to conform to normative kinship in the name of \"civilization.\" A founding moment in United States kinship law lies in the 1662 colonial Virginia doctrine of partus sequitur ventrem , which dictated that children of enslaved women would inherit their mother's legal status. As Black feminist scholars have long noted , slave owners had a property incentive to rape enslaved women and produce more children, legally making enslaved Black people \"kinless\" insofar as their inherited status as property denied them marital and parental rights.

Despite a stellar academic record, Wang said, he was rejected from top-tier universities across the nation. \"Applying to college is an anxiety-filled rite-of-passage for students and parents alike. For Asian-American families, however, the anxiety is mixed with dread,\" Wang wrote. \"They know that their race will be used against them in admissions, and there is nothing they can do but over-prepare.\" Wang's perspective-though far from the dominant view among Asian Americans-was one that resonated with many students and parents. It was also one with a powerful supporter: Edward Blum, the right-wing legal activist and staunch affirmative action foe. Months after Wang's op-ed, Blum filed a lawsuit against Harvard's affirmative action policies. By 2015, a grassroots movement-headed by Chinese and other Asian Americans-had sprung up too. Asian American Coalition for Education, cofounded by Wang's father, mobilized 64 Chinese American, Indian American, Korean American, Pakistani American, and other Asian American organizations to file a civil rights complaint with the departments of Education and Justice, building on Blum's lawsuit. Last week, Wang, Blum, and their allies got their wish at long last when the Supreme Court struck down the use of affirmative action in college admissions. The ruling represents a critical victory and consolidation of the Asian American conservative movement-one that is years in the making. The forces that finally swept affirmative action away could soon come to discover that their victory is a hollow one. That's because, as researchers Janelle Wong, Viet Thanh Nguyen , Nicole Gon Ochi, and OiYan Poon have pointed out, reversing affirmative action only strengthens the population of white students at the expense of Black and other minority students, including Asian Americans. But we must be clear about one thing: Asian American anti-affirmative action activists have not been simply \"used\" by white activists and duped into this white supremacist policy. They are active, militant co-conspirators with white conservatives. They are building a key flank for the right wing across the nation, and the left must urgently recognize that right-wing politics precisely gain power by recruiting conservative ideologies among communities of color that overlap with, but retain distinct aspects from, white supremacy.

Mediocre Whites Can Rest Easier. Elie Mystal and The Nation What We Can Do Right Now to Stop Anti-Asian Violence Promise Li Affirmative Action-but Only for Military Academies Spencer Ackerman O ver twenty years ago, before he wrote The Sympathizer and became a mainstream literary success, Nguyen recognized crucial limits within the rubric of \"Asian America\" as it has been conceived. Scholars and activists in the community tend to treat Asian American identity as a category of resistance. But as Nguyen described , the overemphasis on movements for progressive causes obscures a more troubling reality of \"the ideological heterogeneity of a diverse Asian American population, and the willingness of a considerable portion of that population to participate in and perpetuate such commodification and the social and economic practices that lead to it.\" These Asian Americans are those who feel most at ease with the paradigm that Claire Jean Kim observes in her theory of \"racial triangulation,\" which characterizes how Asian Americans have long been recruited into functioning as a \"model minority\" to reinforce the structural oppression of Black people and the privilege of white people. Despite the fact that they cannot fully assimilate into whiteness, certain Asian Americans do enjoy privileges in Kim's framework. Indeed, as she wrote in The Nation , \"It is the convergence of this nascent, conservative Chinese immigrant nationalism with an older, conservative white nationalism that is driving anti-affirmative action politics today.\" This disturbing alliance has only grown in strength in recent years, finding a common cause in the safeguarding of capitalism and anti-Blackness. The outgrowth of anti-Asian violence has driven some Asian Americans to call for more police funding, directly aligning with right-wing movements. The rise of China in the global sphere has also stoked existing anti-communist sentiment among Chinese, Vietnamese, and other diasporas. Current Issue View our current issue These factors have helped to create an environment that easily lends itself to right-wing politics-and many Asian American conservatives have played an active role in the Trump-era radicalization of the right. In the Asian American-dominated ethnoburb of Arcadia near Los Angeles, Chinese immigrant activists protested a development initiative to house unhoused people, harassing and doxxing youth progressive counter-protesters. A recent New York Times article reports the growth of the Asian American Republican electorate; as longtime Asian American organizer Alex Tom says , this base is motivated \"to organize against affirmative action and police reform.\" The Asian American conservative movement is rife with contradictions, but this unevenness may even empower the growth of right-wing consciousness in action. Red Canary Song sex workers' rights activist Kate Zen observes that Chinese American \"hometown associations,\" many of which have deep ties to the Chinese Communist Party apparatus, showed up in close alliance with pro-American Chinese right-wing protesters at a pro-NYPD rally in Flushing in 2020. \"Men's Rights Asians,\" or ''MRAsians,\" profess a hatred of whiteness in favor of a masculinist conception of Asian American nationalism, while bolstering the right in their anti-Blackness and virulent misogyny toward Asian women. The assault on cultural issues, in other words, is how the struggle to preserve social relations of capitalism becomes most salient to Asian American conservative organizing. McGill professor William Clare Roberts, riffing on Stuart Hall, remarks that \"culture is the modality in which class is lived\" to describe that no socialist class politics can form without attending to particular issues of different working-class communities. The same goes for its inverse. Asian American conservatives' consensus on anti-Blackness and misogyny, among other issues, strengthens the politics of the capitalist class. The political divisions among them that may impede a straightforward consolidation around an electoral platform or party should not obscure the urgent danger represented by these activists. The mass mobilizations around affirmative action and \"law and order\" politics represent the rise of a reactionary grassroots consciousness with the dangerous capacity for mass action-just as threatening as, if not more than, their growing electoral unity. Unpacking how these prejudices serve as powerful allies to white supremacy entails refusing that white supremacy can completely explain how Asian American conservative politics emerges. Indeed, as Adrian De Leon and Jane Hong write , \"Asian American conservatism is not just about claiming whiteness, even though these alignments are indelibly forged from the politics of white supremacy.\" But the other strands of Asian American conservatism beyond white supremacy are seldom explored by Asian Americans, especially in relation to cultural politics in Asia. For one, Kun Huang identifies contemporary anti-Black racism in China with a long history of \"Chinese racial-nationalism\" constructed from anxieties that intermixing between Chinese and Africans would disrupt the coherence of \"Chineseness.\" Huang traces the continuity of these anxieties from the mass of historical literature before European colonialism to contemporary xenophobic netizens' uproar against a 2020 bill in China to expand immigration. And as scholar-activist Christopher Chien says, understanding that \"Chineseness\" is no \"static category that shares the same cultural, political, and economic interests\" is crucial to \"addressing the exact drivers behind the US Asian [American] conservative movement...to know precisely who we should engage or out-organize so we can adjust our tactics accordingly.\" Likewise, Hindu nationalists-many of whom have celebrated the Supreme Court's attack on affirmative action-have long developed distinct practices of violent discrimination, as Ajay Verghese shows , since precolonial conflicts across India. Upper-caste Hindus have cut their teeth in their own struggle against affirmative action policies for underprivileged castes and tribes, some even organizing for certain upper castes to be classified as \"backward\" to still enjoy privileges under affirmative action. These forces consolidate power through entanglements with the West, from early Hindutva organization Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh's incorporation of European fascist practices to Hindutva's growing alliance with the US establishment, but retain unique aspects. These discourses inevitably shape the political and cultural formation of Asian Americans. And the failure to recognize the diverse roots of Asian American conservatism leads to a failure to understand the persuasive roots of conservatism among Asian communities. White supremacy gains strength not because it supersedes the distinct histories and practices of other reactionary ideologies, but because it pluralistically maintains these long-standing forms of cultural reaction that are able to persuasively mobilize other communities of color in a common cause. To truly understand how Asian American conservatives serve white supremacy, in other words, requires exploring the distinct cultural politics that make conservative politics persuasive to those communities in their own right. T he defeat of affirmative action once again reinforces what scholar Nic John Ramos raised in the wake of the election victory of the right-wing Filipino president \"Bongbong\" Marcos: \"Ignoring conservative movements in immigrant communities leaves us without a true assessment of power.\" While white supremacy clearly structures the circumstances of anti-affirmative action activism, we must also ask what other distinct forms of cultural politics motivate Asian Americans to rally for its cause. This does not mean endorsing some idea of a cultural politics \"natural\" to Asian American identity, but discovering how Asian American conservative ideologies came into being through practices and histories irreducible to whiteness. This means recognizing right-wing Asian Americans are not simply misguided but political agents in their own right actively strategizing to strengthen ruling-class power. Compatibility and entanglement between white supremacy and other conservatisms should not signal that the latter can be fully explained by its identification with the former. Continued majority-Asian American support of affirmative action policies should not obscure the dangers of growing right-wing mass politics in our communities. To resist their advances, the left must also understand that power takes root most effectively through mass action calibrated to varied and distinct kinds of cultural and political practices. We need to better attend to the specific organizing strategies that emerge from the Asian American right, just as Yuanyuan Feng and Mark Tseng-Putterman reveal WeChat groups as a crucial \"counterpublic enclave\" for Asian immigrant neoconservative activists. Progressive groups like Chinese for Affirmative Action and Xīn Shēng Project (formerly the WeChat Project) are doing important work fighting against the right in these spaces, but we still need a broader political vision to strengthen a multiethnic movement against capitalism. The Chinese American-led pro-NYPD rally in Flushing in 2020 was met by a significant counter-protest including Asian American sex workers and anti-gentrification activists-a manifestation of years of coalitional organizing on the ground. They are already modeling the key principle of what a persuasive progressive challenge against the right can be: building organizing tactics that bridge the concerns of working-class Asian Americans in all their particularities.\n\nWang's perspective-though far from the dominant view among Asian Americans-was one that resonated with many students and parents.

That's because, as researchers Janelle Wong, Viet Thanh Nguyen , Nicole Gon Ochi, and OiYan Poon have pointed out, reversing affirmative action only strengthens the population of white students at the expense of Black and other minority students, including Asian Americans. But we must be clear about one thing: Asian American anti-affirmative action activists have not been simply \"used\" by white activists and duped into this white supremacist policy. They are active, militant co-conspirators with white conservatives. They are building a key flank for the right wing across the nation, and the left must urgently recognize that right-wing politics precisely gain power by recruiting conservative ideologies among communities of color that overlap with, but retain distinct aspects from, white supremacy.

Scholars and activists in the community tend to treat Asian American identity as a category of resistance. But as Nguyen described , the overemphasis on movements for progressive causes obscures a more troubling reality of \"the ideological heterogeneity of a diverse Asian American population, and the willingness of a considerable portion of that population to participate in and perpetuate such commodification and the social and economic practices that lead to it.\" These Asian Americans are those who feel most at ease with the paradigm that Claire Jean Kim observes in her theory of \"racial triangulation,\" which characterizes how Asian Americans have long been recruited into functioning as a \"model minority\" to reinforce the structural oppression of Black people and the privilege of white people. Despite the fact that they cannot fully assimilate into whiteness, certain Asian Americans do enjoy privileges in Kim's framework. Indeed, as she wrote in The Nation , \"It is the convergence of this nascent, conservative Chinese immigrant nationalism with an older, conservative white nationalism that is driving anti-affirmative action politics today.\" This disturbing alliance has only grown in strength in recent years, finding a common cause in the safeguarding of capitalism and anti-Blackness. The outgrowth of anti-Asian violence has driven some Asian Americans to call for more police funding, directly aligning with right-wing movements. The rise of China in the global sphere has also stoked existing anti-communist sentiment among Chinese, Vietnamese, and other diasporas. Current Issue View our current issue These factors have helped to create an environment that easily lends itself to right-wing politics-and many Asian American conservatives have played an active role in the Trump-era radicalization of the right. In the Asian American-dominated ethnoburb of Arcadia near Los Angeles, Chinese immigrant activists protested a development initiative to house unhoused people, harassing and doxxing youth progressive counter-protesters. A recent New York Times article reports the growth of the Asian American Republican electorate; as longtime Asian American organizer Alex Tom says , this base is motivated \"to organize against affirmative action and police reform.\" The Asian American conservative movement is rife with contradictions, but this unevenness may even empower the growth of right-wing consciousness in action. Red Canary Song sex workers' rights activist Kate Zen observes that Chinese American \"hometown associations,\" many of which have deep ties to the Chinese Communist Party apparatus, showed up in close alliance with pro-American Chinese right-wing protesters at a pro-NYPD rally in Flushing in 2020. \"Men's Rights Asians,\" or ''MRAsians,\" profess a hatred of whiteness in favor of a masculinist conception of Asian American nationalism, while bolstering the right in their anti-Blackness and virulent misogyny toward Asian women. The assault on cultural issues, in other words, is how the struggle to preserve social relations of capitalism becomes most salient to Asian American conservative organizing. McGill professor William Clare Roberts, riffing on Stuart Hall, remarks that \"culture is the modality in which class is lived\" to describe that no socialist class politics can form without attending to particular issues of different working-class communities. The same goes for its inverse. Asian American conservatives' consensus on anti-Blackness and misogyny, among other issues, strengthens the politics of the capitalist class. The political divisions among them that may impede a straightforward consolidation around an electoral platform or party should not obscure the urgent danger represented by these activists. The mass mobilizations around affirmative action and \"law and order\" politics represent the rise of a reactionary grassroots consciousness with the dangerous capacity for mass action-just as threatening as, if not more than, their growing electoral unity. Unpacking how these prejudices serve as powerful allies to white supremacy entails refusing that white supremacy can completely explain how Asian American conservative politics emerges. Indeed, as Adrian De Leon and Jane Hong write , \"Asian American conservatism is not just about claiming whiteness, even though these alignments are indelibly forged from the politics of white supremacy.\" But the other strands of Asian American conservatism beyond white supremacy are seldom explored by Asian Americans, especially in relation to cultural politics in Asia. For one, Kun Huang identifies contemporary anti-Black racism in China with a long history of \"Chinese racial-nationalism\" constructed from anxieties that intermixing between Chinese and Africans would disrupt the coherence of \"Chineseness.\" Huang traces the continuity of these anxieties from the mass of historical literature before European colonialism to contemporary xenophobic netizens' uproar against a 2020 bill in China to expand immigration. And as scholar-activist Christopher Chien says, understanding that \"Chineseness\" is no \"static category that shares the same cultural, political, and economic interests\" is crucial to \"addressing the exact drivers behind the US Asian [American] conservative movement...to know precisely who we should engage or out-organize so we can adjust our tactics accordingly.\" Likewise, Hindu nationalists-many of whom have celebrated the Supreme Court's attack on affirmative action-have long developed distinct practices of violent discrimination, as Ajay Verghese shows , since precolonial conflicts across India. Upper-caste Hindus have cut their teeth in their own struggle against affirmative action policies for underprivileged castes and tribes, some even organizing for certain upper castes to be classified as \"backward\" to still enjoy privileges under affirmative action. These forces consolidate power through entanglements with the West, from early Hindutva organization Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh's incorporation of European fascist practices to Hindutva's growing alliance with the US establishment, but retain unique aspects. These discourses inevitably shape the political and cultural formation of Asian Americans. And the failure to recognize the diverse roots of Asian American conservatism leads to a failure to understand the persuasive roots of conservatism among Asian communities. White supremacy gains strength not because it supersedes the distinct histories and practices of other reactionary ideologies, but because it pluralistically maintains these long-standing forms of cultural reaction that are able to persuasively mobilize other communities of color in a common cause. To truly understand how Asian American conservatives serve white supremacy, in other words, requires exploring the distinct cultural politics that make conservative politics persuasive to those communities in their own right. T he defeat of affirmative action once again reinforces what scholar Nic John Ramos raised in the wake of the election victory of the right-wing Filipino president \"Bongbong\" Marcos: \"Ignoring conservative movements in immigrant communities leaves us without a true assessment of power.\" While white supremacy clearly structures the circumstances of anti-affirmative action activism, we must also ask what other distinct forms of cultural politics motivate Asian Americans to rally for its cause. This does not mean endorsing some idea of a cultural politics \"natural\" to Asian American identity, but discovering how Asian American conservative ideologies came into being through practices and histories irreducible to whiteness. This means recognizing right-wing Asian Americans are not simply misguided but political agents in their own right actively strategizing to strengthen ruling-class power. Compatibility and entanglement between white supremacy and other conservatisms should not signal that the latter can be fully explained by its identification with the former. Continued majority-Asian American support of affirmative action policies should not obscure the dangers of growing right-wing mass politics in our communities. To resist their advances, the left must also understand that power takes root most effectively through mass action calibrated to varied and distinct kinds of cultural and political practices. We need to better attend to the specific organizing strategies that emerge from the Asian American right, just as Yuanyuan Feng and Mark Tseng-Putterman reveal WeChat groups as a crucial \"counterpublic enclave\" for Asian immigrant neoconservative activists. Progressive groups like Chinese for Affirmative Action and Xīn Shēng Project (formerly the WeChat Project) are doing important work fighting against the right in these spaces, but we still need a broader political vision to strengthen a multiethnic movement against capitalism. The Chinese American-led pro-NYPD rally in Flushing in 2020 was met by a significant counter-protest including Asian American sex workers and anti-gentrification activists-a manifestation of years of coalitional organizing on the ground. They are already modeling the key principle of what a persuasive progressive challenge against the right can be: building organizing tactics that bridge the concerns of working-class Asian Americans in all their particularities.\n\nThe forces that finally swept affirmative action away could soon come to discover that their victory is a hollow one.

Current Issue View our current issue These factors have helped to create an environment that easily lends itself to right-wing politics-and many Asian American conservatives have played an active role in the Trump-era radicalization of the right. In the Asian American-dominated ethnoburb of Arcadia near Los Angeles, Chinese immigrant activists protested a development initiative to house unhoused people, harassing and doxxing youth progressive counter-protesters. A recent New York Times article reports the growth of the Asian American Republican electorate; as longtime Asian American organizer Alex Tom says , this base is motivated \"to organize against affirmative action and police reform.\" The Asian American conservative movement is rife with contradictions, but this unevenness may even empower the growth of right-wing consciousness in action. Red Canary Song sex workers' rights activist Kate Zen observes that Chinese American \"hometown associations,\" many of which have deep ties to the Chinese Communist Party apparatus, showed up in close alliance with pro-American Chinese right-wing protesters at a pro-NYPD rally in Flushing in 2020. \"Men's Rights Asians,\" or ''MRAsians,\" profess a hatred of whiteness in favor of a masculinist conception of Asian American nationalism, while bolstering the right in their anti-Blackness and virulent misogyny toward Asian women. The assault on cultural issues, in other words, is how the struggle to preserve social relations of capitalism becomes most salient to Asian American conservative organizing. McGill professor William Clare Roberts, riffing on Stuart Hall, remarks that \"culture is the modality in which class is lived\" to describe that no socialist class politics can form without attending to particular issues of different working-class communities. The same goes for its inverse. Asian American conservatives' consensus on anti-Blackness and misogyny, among other issues, strengthens the politics of the capitalist class. The political divisions among them that may impede a straightforward consolidation around an electoral platform or party should not obscure the urgent danger represented by these activists. The mass mobilizations around affirmative action and \"law and order\" politics represent the rise of a reactionary grassroots consciousness with the dangerous capacity for mass action-just as threatening as, if not more than, their growing electoral unity. Unpacking how these prejudices serve as powerful allies to white supremacy entails refusing that white supremacy can completely explain how Asian American conservative politics emerges. Indeed, as Adrian De Leon and Jane Hong write , \"Asian American conservatism is not just about claiming whiteness, even though these alignments are indelibly forged from the politics of white supremacy.\" But the other strands of Asian American conservatism beyond white supremacy are seldom explored by Asian Americans, especially in relation to cultural politics in Asia. For one, Kun Huang identifies contemporary anti-Black racism in China with a long history of \"Chinese racial-nationalism\" constructed from anxieties that intermixing between Chinese and Africans would disrupt the coherence of \"Chineseness.\" Huang traces the continuity of these anxieties from the mass of historical literature before European colonialism to contemporary xenophobic netizens' uproar against a 2020 bill in China to expand immigration. And as scholar-activist Christopher Chien says, understanding that \"Chineseness\" is no \"static category that shares the same cultural, political, and economic interests\" is crucial to \"addressing the exact drivers behind the US Asian [American] conservative movement...to know precisely who we should engage or out-organize so we can adjust our tactics accordingly.\" Likewise, Hindu nationalists-many of whom have celebrated the Supreme Court's attack on affirmative action-have long developed distinct practices of violent discrimination, as Ajay Verghese shows , since precolonial conflicts across India. Upper-caste Hindus have cut their teeth in their own struggle against affirmative action policies for underprivileged castes and tribes, some even organizing for certain upper castes to be classified as \"backward\" to still enjoy privileges under affirmative action. These forces consolidate power through entanglements with the West, from early Hindutva organization Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh's incorporation of European fascist practices to Hindutva's growing alliance with the US establishment, but retain unique aspects. These discourses inevitably shape the political and cultural formation of Asian Americans. And the failure to recognize the diverse roots of Asian American conservatism leads to a failure to understand the persuasive roots of conservatism among Asian communities. White supremacy gains strength not because it supersedes the distinct histories and practices of other reactionary ideologies, but because it pluralistically maintains these long-standing forms of cultural reaction that are able to persuasively mobilize other communities of color in a common cause. To truly understand how Asian American conservatives serve white supremacy, in other words, requires exploring the distinct cultural politics that make conservative politics persuasive to those communities in their own right. T he defeat of affirmative action once again reinforces what scholar Nic John Ramos raised in the wake of the election victory of the right-wing Filipino president \"Bongbong\" Marcos: \"Ignoring conservative movements in immigrant communities leaves us without a true assessment of power.\" While white supremacy clearly structures the circumstances of anti-affirmative action activism, we must also ask what other distinct forms of cultural politics motivate Asian Americans to rally for its cause. This does not mean endorsing some idea of a cultural politics \"natural\" to Asian American identity, but discovering how Asian American conservative ideologies came into being through practices and histories irreducible to whiteness. This means recognizing right-wing Asian Americans are not simply misguided but political agents in their own right actively strategizing to strengthen ruling-class power. Compatibility and entanglement between white supremacy and other conservatisms should not signal that the latter can be fully explained by its identification with the former. Continued majority-Asian American support of affirmative action policies should not obscure the dangers of growing right-wing mass politics in our communities. To resist their advances, the left must also understand that power takes root most effectively through mass action calibrated to varied and distinct kinds of cultural and political practices. We need to better attend to the specific organizing strategies that emerge from the Asian American right, just as Yuanyuan Feng and Mark Tseng-Putterman reveal WeChat groups as a crucial \"counterpublic enclave\" for Asian immigrant neoconservative activists. Progressive groups like Chinese for Affirmative Action and Xīn Shēng Project (formerly the WeChat Project) are doing important work fighting against the right in these spaces, but we still need a broader political vision to strengthen a multiethnic movement against capitalism. The Chinese American-led pro-NYPD rally in Flushing in 2020 was met by a significant counter-protest including Asian American sex workers and anti-gentrification activists-a manifestation of years of coalitional organizing on the ground. They are already modeling the key principle of what a persuasive progressive challenge against the right can be: building organizing tactics that bridge the concerns of working-class Asian Americans in all their particularities.\n\nThese factors have helped to create an environment that easily lends itself to right-wing politics-and many Asian American conservatives have played an active role in the Trump-era radicalization of the right.

T he defeat of affirmative action once again reinforces what scholar Nic John Ramos raised in the wake of the election victory of the right-wing Filipino president \"Bongbong\" Marcos: \"Ignoring conservative movements in immigrant communities leaves us without a true assessment of power.\" While white supremacy clearly structures the circumstances of anti-affirmative action activism, we must also ask what other distinct forms of cultural politics motivate Asian Americans to rally for its cause. This does not mean endorsing some idea of a cultural politics \"natural\" to Asian American identity, but discovering how Asian American conservative ideologies came into being through practices and histories irreducible to whiteness. This means recognizing right-wing Asian Americans are not simply misguided but political agents in their own right actively strategizing to strengthen ruling-class power. Compatibility and entanglement between white supremacy and other conservatisms should not signal that the latter can be fully explained by its identification with the former. Continued majority-Asian American support of affirmative action policies should not obscure the dangers of growing right-wing mass politics in our communities. To resist their advances, the left must also understand that power takes root most effectively through mass action calibrated to varied and distinct kinds of cultural and political practices. We need to better attend to the specific organizing strategies that emerge from the Asian American right, just as Yuanyuan Feng and Mark Tseng-Putterman reveal WeChat groups as a crucial \"counterpublic enclave\" for Asian immigrant neoconservative activists. Progressive groups like Chinese for Affirmative Action and Xīn Shēng Project (formerly the WeChat Project) are doing important work fighting against the right in these spaces, but we still need a broader political vision to strengthen a multiethnic movement against capitalism. The Chinese American-led pro-NYPD rally in Flushing in 2020 was met by a significant counter-protest including Asian American sex workers and anti-gentrification activists-a manifestation of years of coalitional organizing on the ground. They are already modeling the key principle of what a persuasive progressive challenge against the right can be: building organizing tactics that bridge the concerns of working-class Asian Americans in all their particularities.\n\nT he defeat of affirmative action once again reinforces what scholar Nic John Ramos raised in the wake of the election victory of the right-wing Filipino president \"Bongbong\" Marcos: \"Ignoring conservative movements in immigrant communities leaves us without a true assessment of power.\" While white supremacy clearly structures the circumstances of anti-affirmative action activism, we must also ask what other distinct forms of cultural politics motivate Asian Americans to rally for its cause.

You can read our Privacy Policy here.\n\nThe Supreme Court is poised to take down affirmative action and declare the consideration of race in college admissions unconstitutional. On Halloween, the court heard two cases aimed at prohibiting the policy-one against the University of North Carolina and the other against Harvard University. Over a five-hour marathon of oral arguments, the six conservative justices all seemed willing to do away with the most effective policy I can think of in American history for promoting diversity and racial integration. While a wide array of conservative-aligned people and institutions always arrive at the conclusion that affirmative action is \"bad,\" they generally fail to provide logically or legally coherent reasons for why this policy must die. This was the case during the oral arguments. As the justices asked their questions and telegraphed their takes, they couldn't even agree on why they were going to ban affirmative action. (Diversity is bad! Diversity is good but can be achieved by other means! Affirmative action has failed because we still need it!) Instead, they kept throwing spaghetti at the wall, desperately attempting to find a basis on which to issue their predetermined ruling, because the cases in front of them are too weak to support their extremist desires to overturn nearly 60 years of precedent. The cases against the universities were brought by a group called Students for Fair Admissions , which claims to represent students from the Asian American and Pacific Islander community who feel that affirmative action discriminates against them. In fact, the group was organized by a well-funded white conservative gadfly, Ed Blum, who has made it his life's work to end affirmative action. Actual AAPI affinity groups , and a whopping 69 percent of AAPI voters , support affirmative action. The idea that the white conservative legal echo-system is attacking affirmative action on behalf of Asian Americans fails in its first contact with reality. Moreover, the argument that race consciousness in admissions hurts AAPI applicants is wholly unsupported. In the North Carolina case, the facts show that the university admits a higher percentage of AAPI applicants than Black and Latino applicants. The Harvard case is a little more complicated, because Harvard does use a metric, called the \"personal rating,\" which does seem to discriminate against AAPI applicants . But Harvard's use of this problematic rating has nothing to do with affirmative action. Indeed, after the conservatives ban affirmative action, Harvard will not be allowed to consider an applicant's race, but it will still be allowed to consider an applicant's personal rating. The very process that we know is hurting AAPI applicants at Harvard will be allowed to continue, while the process that has nothing to do with AAPI students will be ruled unconstitutional. The conservatives' final argument against affirmative action also fails spectacularly. An army of white people who have reduced the life and career of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to one line, from one speech they probably haven't read, think the legal argument against affirmative action is obvious: It's unconstitutional to judge people on the basis of race. But that's not what the Constitution says. The 14th Amendment says that you must treat people equally and fairly, and it was written with specific racial remuneration programs in mind. Moreover, there is an entire canon of constitutional law that says race can be taken into account if it serves a \"compelling\" state interest , and it's hard to get more compelling than diverse representation, inclusion, and social integration. The conservative justices can't muster a good argument against affirmative action because there isn't one. The idea that universities can consider an applicant's legacy status, extracurricular endeavors, gender, hometown, parental donations, foot speed, test-taking skills, and personal rating, but not their race or ethnicity, is preposterous on its face. That said, the conservative lawyers and justices did make one argument that, while not compelling, was revealing. They kept saying that college admissions are a \" zero-sum game ,\" the implication being that anything that helps Black or Latino students hurts everybody else. And that is why affirmative action will die. It's not unconstitutional, and it doesn't lead to discrimination against AAPI students, but conservatives believe that anytime a Black or brown person gets ahead, there's a more deserving white person who gets left behind. They think that America itself is a zero-sum game, and anything that doesn't help white Americans win that game and keep a disproportionate share of the spoils must be stopped. It's not a good argument. It's just the one they all agree on.\n\nWhile a wide array of conservative-aligned people and institutions always arrive at the conclusion that affirmative action is \"bad,\" they generally fail to provide logically or legally coherent reasons for why this policy must die.

Activate your online access\n\nAsa Hutchinson is the only Republican presidential candidate with the courage to discuss the 14th Amendment.\n\nAsa Hutchinson at the Republican presidential debate in Milwaukee on August 23, 2023.\n\nFormer New Jersey governor Chris Christie explained to a disapproving crowd at the first 2024 Republican presidential debate why he could not support 91-times-indicted former president Donald Trump as the next GOP presidential nominee.\n\n\"Someone's got to stop normalizing this conduct,\" Christie said midway through last week's desultory gathering of the Republicans who would like to be seen as credible alternatives to Trump. \"Whether or not you believe that the criminal charges are right or wrong, the conduct is beneath the office of president of the United States.\" Cautiously worded as the statement was, it drew boisterous boos from the audience of 4,000 Republicans that assembled for the debate, giving Christie an opportunity to deliver a prepackaged admonition. \"This is the great thing about this country,\" he said. \"Booing is allowed, but it doesn't change the truth.\"\n\nThat was good theater, and Christie knew it. He parlayed the exchange into a round of post-debate television appearances where he awarded himself many kudos for his insight and courage.\n\nBut the candidate at the debate who actually said something of consequence regarding presidential accountability eschewed such glib punchlines.\n\nInstead, former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson calmly explained that he could not pledge to back Trump in 2024 because \"I'm not going to support somebody who's been convicted of a serious felony or who is disqualified under our Constitution.\"\n\nThat mention of disqualification was a reference to the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution, which was added after Southern states revolted against the republic in the Civil War. Section 3 of the amendment reflects on officials who support insurrection and rebellion and explicitly declares:\n\nNo person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.\n\nHutchinson served as the youngest US Attorney in the country under President Ronald Reagan, managed more than 100 high-profile jury trials, and made headlines trying white supremacists in the 1980s, before serving in Congress, holding several posts in the Bush administration, and getting himself elected to two terms as a Republican governor. He's an economic and social conservative who twice backed Trump for the presidency. But unlike a lot of Republicans who call themselves \"constitutional conservatives,\" Hutchinson has actually read the Constitution and takes seriously the scholarship of conservative legal experts like William Baude of the University of Chicago Law School and Michael Stokes Paulsen of the University of St. Thomas Law School, who argue in a forthcoming University of Pennsylvania Law Review article, \" The Sweep and Force of Section Three \":\n\nFirst, Section Three remains an enforceable part of the Constitution, not limited to the Civil War, and not effectively repealed by nineteenth century amnesty legislation. Second, Section Three is self-executing, operating as an immediate disqualification from office, without the need for additional action by Congress. It can and should be enforced by every official, state or federal, who judges qualifications. Third, to the extent of any conflict with prior constitutional rules, Section Three repeals, supersedes, or simply satisfies them. This includes the rules against bills of attainder or ex post facto laws, the Due Process Clause, and even the free speech principles of the First Amendment. Fourth, Section Three covers a broad range of conduct against the authority of the constitutional order, including many instances of indirect participation or support as \"aid or comfort.\" It covers a broad range of former offices, including the Presidency. And in particular, it disqualifies former President Donald Trump, and potentially many others, because of their participation in the attempted overthrow of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nFormer US Court of Appeals judge J. Michael Luttig, a leading conservative, shares this view, explaining in a recent interview that, no matter what comes of Trump's many trials, the former president can be bumped from the ballot by state election officials, because \"no legislation by Congress or judicial decision or any other finding in a court of law-by virtue of a conviction in a criminal trial, for instance-is necessary for the clause to operate against someone who has previously taken an oath to support the Constitution of the United States and thereafter engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the Constitution of the United States.\"\n\nThese clear readings of the 14th Amendment echo the interpretation of US Representative Jamie Raskin, the Maryland Democrat and former law professor who led the effort to convict Trump following the former president's 2021 impeachment. With regard to the 14th Amendment's standard for disqualification, Raskin says Trump \"really does fulfill exactly the constitutional prohibition there.\"\n\nThe debate about the disqualification of Trump has become a live issue in recent months. As the former president's legal troubles have mounted, watchdog groups such as Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and Free Speech for People have been urging state officials to apply the 14th. This summer, letters from Free Speech For People and the voting rights ground Mi Familia Vota Education Fund urged secretaries of state and chief election officials in nine states to recognize that \"the qualifications for eligibility for the presidency-in addition to natural-born citizenship, age, and residency-have also included not having engaged in insurrection against the United States after having taken an oath to support the Constitution. And Trump does not meet that qualification.\"\n\nThis is what Hutchinson was talking about in the contentious section of the debate that came after Fox News host Bret Baier said: \"You all signed a pledge to support the eventual Republican nominee. If former president Trump is convicted in a court of law, would you still support him as your party's choice? Please raise your hand if you would.\"\n\nMost of the attention to the responses to that question focused on a fierce exchange between Christie and Trump defender Vivek Ramaswamy, but it was Hutchinson who went to the heart of the matter when he said:\n\nI did not raise my hand because there's an important issue we as a party have to face. And well over a year ago, I said that Donald Trump was morally disqualified from being President, again, as a result of what happened on January 6th. More people are understanding the importance of that, including conservative legal scholars, who says he may be disqualified under the 14th Amendment from being President, again, as a result of the insurrection. This is something that could disqualify him, under our rules, and under the Constitution. And so obviously, I'm not going to support somebody who's been convicted of a serious felony, or who has this is disqualified under our Constitution. And that's consistent with RNC rules. And I hope everybody would agree with that.\n\nThey didn't. Hutchinson was booed just as aggressively as Christie, and the chaotic debate carried forward. But, for a brief moment, the Republicans in Milwaukee heard the voice of an actual constitutional conservative.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025. But we can't do this without you. As a reader-supported publication, we rely on the support of generous donors. Please, help make our essential independent journalism possible with a donation today.\n\nIn solidarity,\n\nThe Editors\n\nThe Nation\n\nJohn Nichols is a national affairs correspondent for The Nation .

(AP Photo/Mark Humphrey) Let's continue my series on the continuities on the American right: the stockpiling of guns for the coming apocalypse; the panic over textbooks and the passion for reckless spending cuts ; the horror at the government sponsoring pre-school education -and, for today, the comfort the right harbors for minoritarianism : the conviction that conservatives are fit to rule even if they don't actually win elections. We've been reading about that and again these days in the way the Republican Party does business: the \"Hastert rule\" which doesn't let a measure get to the House floor if it can't win a majority of Republicans even if the majority of all House members want it; the Republican embrace of gerrymandering that guarantees Republican congressional majorities in states Obama won decidedly like Pennylvania; the Republican comfort with the disenfranchisement of Democratic constituencies that the Nation 's Ari Berman has been covering so effectively these days. This comes from somewhere-from the nature of conservatism itself. It is an old, old story. Let's start, though, with a question of first principles, one absolutely crucial to understanding the difference between liberalism and conservatism, one that goes very deep at the cognitive level. We'll be returning to it when I arrive at the crucial question of how that which liberals consider hypocrisy functions on the right. That first principle is the matter of procedure versus norms. As I wrote in a 2003 review of Eric Alterman's book What Liberal Media? We Americans love to cite the \"political spectrum\" as the best way to classify ideologies. The metaphor is incorrect: it implies symmetry. But left and right today are not opposites. They are different species. It has to do with core principles. To put it abstractly, the right always has in mind a prescriptive vision of its ideal future world-a normative vision. Unlike the left (at least since Karl Marx neglected to include an actual description of the \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" within the 2,500 pages of Das Kapital), conservatives have always known what the world would look like after their revolution: hearth, home, church, a businessman's republic. The dominant strain of the American left, on the other hand, certainly since the decline of the socialist left, fetishizes fairness, openness, and diversity. (Liberals have no problem with home, hearth, and church in themselves; they just see them as one viable life-style option among many.) If the stakes for liberals are fair procedures, the stakes for conservatives are last things: either humanity trends toward Grace, or it hurtles toward Armageddon.

It has to do, too, with the almost opposite definitions liberals and conservatives affix to the word \"principle.\" For liberals, generally speaking, honoring procedures- means- is the core of what being \"principled\" means. For conservatives, fighting for the right outcome- ends- even at the expense of procedural nicety, is what being \"principled\" means. Think of it it, allegorically, this way: imagine in Washington DC, near Capitol Hill, a little old lady is crossing a hazardous street. A fastidious liberal congressmen, proud of always acting in a principled way in all things, stops to help her across the street-even though that means he might be late for a key vote (the sacrifice of an end, in itself, confirms his principled nature). A fastidious conservative congressman, on the other hand, leaves the lady to her fate and makes the vote (because the upholding of the end, in itself, is where honor lies-and dishonor rests, in the ultimate term of derision righties reserve for each other, in being a \"squish\"). In short, if you're a conservative, isn't the point of an election to win, so you can bend the world to your will, no matter the means it takes to get there? Even if you don't necessarily have the majority's support? Here are some historical illustrations. Again and again, when I was doing research in the papers of Clarence Manion, the pioneering conservative activist who was the first to try to draft Barry Goldwater as the Republican presidential candidate, I ran across references to schemes to run conservative third party candidates. One, in 1956, ran T. Coleman Andrews , Eisenhower's former commissioner of public revenue-who now considered the states' income-tax-creating Sixteenth Amendment his charge to enforce, as a \"sign[ing] away the powers that were reserved to them by the Constitution as a safeguard against degeneration of the union of states into an all-powerful central government!\" Another, aimed at 1960, looked to draft Arkansas's segregationist Orval Faubus. They planned these efforts not in the expectation that they might win, but with an eye just toward getting enough support to deny the front runner the Constitutional required majority in the Electoral College. Without that majority 270 electoral votes, the election gets thrown into the House of Representatives-something a nice procedural liberal might consider a dangerously divisive Constitutional crisis, but which I found Manion and his pals considering an outcome devoutly to be wished. For that way, right-wing congressmen could sell their votes in exchange for policy concessions-and a conservative minority that knew it was right could bend the world to its will. That sort of cleverness, of course, no longer became necessary as the idea of making the Republican Party a vehicle for the conservative movement tout court came to seem more and more viable. Such that, as the late New Right founding father Paul Weyrich once put it, \"I don't want everybody to vote. Elections are not won by a majority of the people. They never have been from the beginning of our country and they are not now. As a matter of fact, our leverage in the elections quite candidly goes up as the voting populace goes down.\" Which was pretty damned brazen, considering he was co-founder of an organization called the Moral Majority. Now, of course, for over a decade now, the brazenness is institutionalized within the very vitals of one of our two political parties. You just elect yourself a Republican attorney general, and he does his level best to squeeze as many minority voters from the roles as he can force the law to allow. And a conservative state legislature, so they can gerrymander the hell out of their state, such that, as a Texas Republican congressional aid close to Tom Delay wrote in a 2003 email , \"This has a real national impact that should assure that Republicans keep the House no matter the national mood.\" Or you lose the popular vote in the 2000 presidential election but win in the electoral college-then declare a mandate to privatize Social Security, like George Bush did. Which only makes sense, if you're trying to save civilization from hurtling toward Armageddon. That's how conservatives think. To quote one Christian right leader , \"We ought to see clearly that the end does justify the means...If the method I am using to accomplishes the goal I am aiming at, it is for that reason a good method.\" Why is Fox News defending disgraced Rutgers basketball coach Mike Rice?

Even if you don't necessarily have the majority's support? Here are some historical illustrations. Again and again, when I was doing research in the papers of Clarence Manion, the pioneering conservative activist who was the first to try to draft Barry Goldwater as the Republican presidential candidate, I ran across references to schemes to run conservative third party candidates. One, in 1956, ran T. Coleman Andrews , Eisenhower's former commissioner of public revenue-who now considered the states' income-tax-creating Sixteenth Amendment his charge to enforce, as a \"sign[ing] away the powers that were reserved to them by the Constitution as a safeguard against degeneration of the union of states into an all-powerful central government!\" Another, aimed at 1960, looked to draft Arkansas's segregationist Orval Faubus. They planned these efforts not in the expectation that they might win, but with an eye just toward getting enough support to deny the front runner the Constitutional required majority in the Electoral College. Without that majority 270 electoral votes, the election gets thrown into the House of Representatives-something a nice procedural liberal might consider a dangerously divisive Constitutional crisis, but which I found Manion and his pals considering an outcome devoutly to be wished. For that way, right-wing congressmen could sell their votes in exchange for policy concessions-and a conservative minority that knew it was right could bend the world to its will. That sort of cleverness, of course, no longer became necessary as the idea of making the Republican Party a vehicle for the conservative movement tout court came to seem more and more viable. Such that, as the late New Right founding father Paul Weyrich once put it, \"I don't want everybody to vote. Elections are not won by a majority of the people. They never have been from the beginning of our country and they are not now. As a matter of fact, our leverage in the elections quite candidly goes up as the voting populace goes down.\" Which was pretty damned brazen, considering he was co-founder of an organization called the Moral Majority. Now, of course, for over a decade now, the brazenness is institutionalized within the very vitals of one of our two political parties. You just elect yourself a Republican attorney general, and he does his level best to squeeze as many minority voters from the roles as he can force the law to allow. And a conservative state legislature, so they can gerrymander the hell out of their state, such that, as a Texas Republican congressional aid close to Tom Delay wrote in a 2003 email , \"This has a real national impact that should assure that Republicans keep the House no matter the national mood.\" Or you lose the popular vote in the 2000 presidential election but win in the electoral college-then declare a mandate to privatize Social Security, like George Bush did. Which only makes sense, if you're trying to save civilization from hurtling toward Armageddon. That's how conservatives think.

Activate your online access\n\nThe London-born daughter of Nigerian parents presides over the ruins of 14 years of Tory rule. Can her brand of nativism-lite bring the party out of the wilderness?\n\nL ondon- In December 2006-a year into David Cameron's tenure as leader of Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition-Kemi Adegoke, a 26-year-old computer systems analyst for a bank, contributed to an Observer magazine feature on why it was \" cool to be Conservative .\" Acknowledging that as \"a black African woman\" she may not \"fit the image\" of a \"stereotypical\" Tory party member, Adegoke, who moved to Britain a decade earlier having grown up in Lagos, Nigeria, told the reporter she did not think \"every problem in the country is down to [Tony] Blair and the Labour Party.\" She believed, simply, that \"the Conservatives would do a much better job of running the country.\"\n\nNow, Kemi Badenoch, married to a banker she met as a young Conservative activist, sits as member of Parliament for North West Essex, and finds herself running the party that, following 14 years in government, was unceremoniously ejected from office in July this year. In a selection process where less than 100,000 dues-paying Tory supporters voted on who should replace former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak as head of the party, the former business secretary beat ex-immigration minister Robert Jenrick -also residing on the Tories' right flank-to become the sixth leader in nine years.\n\nOver the past century, nearly every Conservative leader has, at some point, held the office of prime minister-apart from a few brief years at New Labour's peak at the turn of this century when the party faithful opted for three forgettable middle-aged bald men in quick succession. If Badenoch, a combative communicator of conservative values, is to avoid their fate, her party must recover from the worst general election result in its history, reduced to a rump of just 121 of the 650 seats in the House of Commons.\n\nSince 2010, only two of the five Tory Prime Ministers won outright majorities at the polls: Cameron and Boris Johnson--both of them Old Etonians and, at Oxford University, both members of the Bullingdon Club , an elitist all-male dining society notorious for its expensive tailored uniforms and penchant for vandalizing restaurants. Badenoch, who worked shifts at a McDonald's while studying at a further-education college, is cut from a different cloth, though it was as equalities minister under Johnson that she first came to prominence, embroiling herself in public rows about single-sex toilets and the contested legacy of the British Empire.\n\nWhen Johnson was ousted as prime minister by parliamentary colleagues in July 2022, with the party mired in corruption and sex scandals, Badenoch ran to succeed him. She performed better than expected, fighting a culture war where everything-from \"identity politics\" to \"net zero\" and a \" Ben and Jerry's tendency \" within business toward social justice-became a target.\n\nOnce Badenoch was eliminated from the race, a tranche of her supporters defected to the victorious campaign of Liz Truss, whose chaotic prime-ministership abruptly ended just seven weeks later, after she alienated her cabinet and crashed the pound . She was hastily replaced by Sunak-Parliament's wealthiest MP, richer even than the king -without the party grassroots' ever being consulted. \"We have to be honest-honest about the fact that we made mistakes,\" the new leader conceded during her victory speech on Saturday, \"honest about the fact that we let standards slip.\"\n\nSince the summer, the Tory party in opposition has undertaken little soul-searching, its MPs preoccupied by factional positioning which saw them ultimately short-list two candidates from the populist right. Though vestiges of liberalism have barely troubled the party leadership since Margaret Thatcher's first term-during which she successfully sidelined ministerial \"Wets\" opposed to her tough socioeconomic program-every time a contest comes around Britain's chattering classes yearn for a supposedly unifying \"One Nation\" candidate (the phrase comes from the Victorian Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, who has a plausible claim to governing as a \"One Nation\" Tory) to emerge-a \"moderate\" option for the Tory selectorate. The failure of this to happen during the latest campaign, in the aftermath of far-right violence and racist riots flaring up across the country, led to muted mainstream media interest, offering the remaining candidates an opportunity to directly appeal to their members' basest instincts around the issue of immigration.\n\nOnly weeks after mosques and migrant hostels had been targeted by racist vandals, Badenoch proclaimed that Britain \"is not a dormitory for people to come here and make money,\" adding that \"not all cultures are equally valid\" when deciding who is allowed to enter and who is not. Her opponent Jenrick-who once ordered a Disney mural at an asylum processing centre for unaccompanied children to be painted over for being too welcoming-argued that his nation's former colonies owed it a \"debt of gratitude,\" and that anyone shouting \"Allahu Akbar\" in the street should be immediately arrested.\n\nThe proximate reason for the Conservative party's descent into nativist rhetoric is simple: the success of Nigel Farage. The leader of the Reform party both electorally disrupted and ideologically influenced the Tories during their most recent stretch in government, finally gaining a parliamentary foothold in 2024 as MP for Clacton in Essex. Depriving his rivals of five seats and millions of votes, Farage- dubbed \"Mr. Brexit\" by Donald Trump -will be heartened that EU states like France, Italy, Austria, and the Netherlands have, in recent years, seen iconoclastic anti-immigrant parties of the outside right overtake traditional conservative parties in national elections. Badenoch will inevitably face calls to \"unite the right'\"around policies prescribing strong borders and a \"war on woke'\" If she is successful, it will see the world's oldest political party reduced to a mid-Atlantic Trumpist tribute act, floating somewhere between Republican America and the European mainland.\n\nHow the Conservative Party, facing a cautious Labour Government under Sir Keir Starmer, will spend its time in opposition still remains to be seen. Those who study British political history know that, even after large-scale national ruptures-from repealing the Corn Laws to Irish Home Rule, from appeasing Hitler to Brexit-the Tories are more than capable of adapting to new realities. Though their parliamentary rump is somewhat shrunken, extra-parliamentary change can be affected through a reliable ecosystem of extractive business interests, secretive think tanks, and reactionary press barons, the latest of whom is Sir Paul Marshall.\n\nA hedge-fund tycoon-whose satellite television channel GB News broadcast the sole head-to-head debate between Conservative leadership candidates, with Nigel Farage and a number of sitting Tory MPs also on the network's payroll-Marshall recently acquired The Spectator , the print magazine where, less than a decade ago, Kemi Badenoch worked as digital director. Michael Gove, the Machiavellian former cabinet minister who has praised the new leader's \"no bullshit\" approach and was widely seen as her political mentor, has just been appointed editor of the two-centuries-old in-house Tory journal, with Charles Moore , (the official biographer of Margaret Thatcher, ennobled under Boris Johnson) installed as chair.\n\nArmed with clear ideological talking points, two viable parliamentary vehicles, and friends in high places, British Conservatism may yet embark upon its boldest transformation since Thatcher became leader of the opposition 50 years ago.\n\nEditor's Note: Due to an editing error an earlier version of this story stated that Ms. Badenoch was born in Nigeria.  She was actually born in Wimbledon, in south-west London. The Nation regrets the error.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

Wade . The ability to access safe and legal abortion is nothing less than the structural foundation of women's self-determination: Without it, the walls cave in. But for conservatives, the battleground may be the uterus, but the war is for the future of family. And their governing worldview requires the resurrection of the married, two-parent variety, with roles clearly demarcated by gender. For years, conservatives have been fixated on declining marriage and fertility rates and rising nonmarital-birth rates. The refrain of \"family breakdown\" has become their convenient explanation for all social problems, from crime to drug addiction to poverty, and platitudes about \"strengthening the nuclear family\" their catchall solution. But just as the anti-abortion crusade isn't really about \"saving babies,\" the restoration of a \"marriage culture\" isn't really about saving marriage. Feminists understand that both are punishment for the transgression of autonomy, whether it takes the form of having non-procreative sex or even sex outside of marriage, being child-free or not marrying, or having a child without first having a husband. A recently released report by the think tank Family Story (which we lead and serve on the advisory board for, respectively) calls this cultural reverence for the superiority of the married two-parent family \"marriage fundamentalism.\" It encompasses the belief that married two-parent families are unequivocally the superior type of family for children, adults, and society at large, and that poverty and other economic risks are largely avoidable if women would stop making the supposedly bad choice to become parents without first marrying-claims that, as we point out in the report, lack any clear scientific consensus. \"Marriage fundamentalism\" may be a newly coined term, but it has served as the basis for American social policy for the better half of the last century. In its most extreme iteration, marriage fundamentalism is also the guiding philosophy of self-appointed \"family values\" conservatives, a label that would be hilarious were it not so dangerous. If the current wave of abortion bans spark comparisons to the dystopian Handmaid's Tale , marriage fundamentalism is more akin to Leave It to Beaver -a cheery, white, heteronormative middle-class version of palatable patriarchy. These philosophies are distinct, but deeply intertwined, and we cannot leave either one intact if we hope to dismantle the other. Marriage fundamentalism has never waned, but it changes contours to align with the current zeitgeist. As brazen misogyny and white supremacy are having a frightening resurgence, conservatives have been emboldened to relitigate basic assumptions about women's equality that most of us consider settled. Marriage fundamentalism has always used barely coded racism, shaming, and stigma to coerce low-income couples into marriage under the veneer of reducing poverty and improving outcomes for children. But today's marriage fundamentalists have begun using the rhetoric of \"strengthening families\" to transparently attack the idea of women's basic economic autonomy, in ways that feel reminiscent of a past era.

In a recent New York Times op-ed warning that \"the American family is once again in crisis,\" The Washington Examiner 's Helen Andrews made the absurdly regressive contention that the wage gap is beneficial, in that when it widens in men's favor, marriage and fertility rates rise. What would women rather have, she writes glibly, \"a few extra cents, or a husband and a child?\"-a false dichotomy that would be considered laughable if posed to men. Fox TV host Tucker Carlson went further , alleging that women outearning men \"causes a drop in marriage, a spike in out-of-wedlock births and all the familiar disasters that inevitably follow.\" Conservatives' interest in promoting marriage goes beyond moral preening. It is necessary for their political survival. Married white women, in particular, who have long benefited from their proximity to patriarchy and white supremacy, have more conservative political beliefs and vote Republican in greater numbers , in part because structural inequalities like the wage gap have the practical effect of yoking their economic interests to their husbands'. But more fundamentally, the illusion of the married, two-parent nuclear family as the primary source of women's economic security is necessary for the maintenance of the economic status quo. Conservatives' marriage-promotion efforts post-welfare reform, which capitalized on a racist \"welfare queen\" stereotype, articulate their fears in the clearest terms: Without the proper incentives, women will end up \"married\" to the state. No matter how thoroughly the causal links between marriage and economic security or poverty are refuted , it is a myth upon which conservatives must double down. Their entire house of cards depends on it. Conservatives' attacks on women will not stop with abortion. The nuclear family unit has always been rooted in patriarchal notions of controlling women's sexuality, even if that rationale has waned as the institution has become more egalitarian. As women fight to preserve the most fundamental form of autonomy-the ability to control our reproduction-we will also have to push back against the myriad other ways women are penalized for failing to adhere to conservatives' antiquated notions of family. As frightening and perilous as this moment is, we must be heartened by the fact that women's political unity is on the rise, fueled by a revived, more intersectional feminist movement and the overwhelming support for a policy agenda-equal pay, child care, paid family leave, and health care that includes reproductive care-that puts women's experiences at the center. Conservatives may control enough levers of power to advance their extremist agenda in the near term. But their toxic combination of anti-abortion fervor and marriage fundamentalism seems fated to rouse the vast majority of women who will not allow their bodies, nor their families, to become pawns in conservatives' last-gasp regressive crusade.\n\nFor years, conservatives have been fixated on declining marriage and fertility rates and rising nonmarital-birth rates. The refrain of \"family breakdown\" has become their convenient explanation for all social problems, from crime to drug addiction to poverty, and platitudes about \"strengthening the nuclear family\" their catchall solution.

Marriage fundamentalism has always used barely coded racism, shaming, and stigma to coerce low-income couples into marriage under the veneer of reducing poverty and improving outcomes for children. But today's marriage fundamentalists have begun using the rhetoric of \"strengthening families\" to transparently attack the idea of women's basic economic autonomy, in ways that feel reminiscent of a past era.

Conservatives may control enough levers of power to advance their extremist agenda in the near term. But their toxic combination of anti-abortion fervor and marriage fundamentalism seems fated to rouse the vast majority of women who will not allow their bodies, nor their families, to become pawns in conservatives' last-gasp regressive crusade.\n\nA recently released report by the think tank Family Story (which we lead and serve on the advisory board for, respectively) calls this cultural reverence for the superiority of the married two-parent family \"marriage fundamentalism.\" It encompasses the belief that married two-parent families are unequivocally the superior type of family for children, adults, and society at large, and that poverty and other economic risks are largely avoidable if women would stop making the supposedly bad choice to become parents without first marrying-claims that, as we point out in the report, lack any clear scientific consensus. \"Marriage fundamentalism\" may be a newly coined term, but it has served as the basis for American social policy for the better half of the last century. In its most extreme iteration, marriage fundamentalism is also the guiding philosophy of self-appointed \"family values\" conservatives, a label that would be hilarious were it not so dangerous. If the current wave of abortion bans spark comparisons to the dystopian Handmaid's Tale , marriage fundamentalism is more akin to Leave It to Beaver -a cheery, white, heteronormative middle-class version of palatable patriarchy. These philosophies are distinct, but deeply intertwined, and we cannot leave either one intact if we hope to dismantle the other. Marriage fundamentalism has never waned, but it changes contours to align with the current zeitgeist. As brazen misogyny and white supremacy are having a frightening resurgence, conservatives have been emboldened to relitigate basic assumptions about women's equality that most of us consider settled.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

When Nikita Khrushchev sent tanks into Hungary to crush a grassroots uprising in 1956, many radicals chose that moment to stop apologizing for the Soviet Union. Ronald Radosh, a red-diaper baby who published seventeen articles in The Nation between 1966 and 1980, decided it was time to join the Communist Party USA. Later, when sane people were celebrating the end of the Vietnam War, Radosh and those around him regarded the moment as \"an occasion for deep melancholy.\" They liked the Vietnam War, he explained in his memoir, Commies ; it gave their lives meaning. Now that our country was no longer laying waste to Third World peasants, America, for these folks, \"could no longer so easily be called Amerika .\" And now that the exigencies of war could no longer excuse the communists' human-rights abuses, their struggle could no longer be idealized as the heroic effort to create a model Marxist society: \"The idea of an immediate, no-fault revolution, a fantasy of the previous decade, was no longer tenable.\" With that, Radosh doubled down again and traveled to Cuba with a group of revolutionary enthusiasts. One day, they visited a mental hospital.  A doctor there boasted, \"In our institution, we have a larger proportion of hospital inmates who have been lobotomized than any other mental hospital in the world.\" Back on their bus, a flabbergasted therapist exclaimed, \"Lobotomy is a horror. We must do something to stop this.\" Another member of the American  delegation shot back: \"We have to understand that there are differences between capitalist lobotomies and socialist lobotomies.\" Radosh, of course, ended up on the political right. The final straw came when he published a book in 1983 arguing that Julius Rosenberg was indeed guilty of the crime for which he had been executed in 1953. Radosh found himself unfairly attacked from the left. Thus was he moved to \"consider the ultimate heresy: perhaps the Left was wrong not just about the Rosenberg case, but about most everything else.... My journey to America was about to reach its final leg.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis But he notes something else in his memoir, baldly contradicting his earlier claim about the left being wrong about \"most everything\": some on the left defended him, including in the pages of The Nation . He doesn't note that two of his intellectual adversaries, Walter and Miriam Schneir, ultimately changed their minds about the case in the face of new evidence. Radosh's political journey follows a familiar pattern, well documented among Nation writers who end their careers on the right: a rigid extremist, possessed of the most over-the-top revolutionary fantasies, comes face to face with the complexity of the real world, then \"changes sides\" and makes his career by hysterically identifying the \"socialist lobotomies\" set as the only kind of leftist there is-ignoring evidence to the contrary that's right in front of his nose. * * * One of the first leftists to abandon the tribe in the pages of The Nation was no less than the magazine's longtime owner and columnist, Oswald Garrison Villard (1872-1949). Villard was such a doctrinaire pacifist that he resigned his column in protest in June 1940 because The Nation favored the United States' rearming to fight Hitler. As he wrote in his valedictory, the magazine had abandoned \"the chief glory of its great and honorable past\": its \"steadfast opposition to all preparations for war.\" He predicted that the course the editors were proposing would \"inevitably end all social and political progress, lower still further the standard of living, enslave labor, and, if persisted in, impose a dictatorship and turn us into a totalitarian state.\" Villard ended up starring in a 1975 book, Prophets on the Right: Profiles of Conservative Critics of American Globalism , whose author happened to be Ronald Radosh. The novelist and critic Granville Hicks (1901-1982) was an orthodox communist who in 1933 published a Marxist history of American literature. In 1940, however, Hicks published an essay in The Nation titled \"The Blind Alley of Marxism,\" in which he excoriated his comrades' unexamined political assumptions. Why, for instance, should \"the elimination of the economic contradictions of capitalism inevitably and automatically [lead] to the higher stage of social development?\" And why, he asked-not long after the Moscow trials railroaded many of the founders of the Soviet state into gulags-do American radicals give \"carte blanche...to a little group of men, five thousand miles away?\" This was thoughtful stuff, but rather than sticking around to nurture a rich debate, Hicks became an eager namer of names to the House Un-American Activities Committee. The culture and history of the left, of course, is shot through with silly, ideologically driven absurdities (\"socialist lobotomies,\" to coin a phrase). There is, for example, the argument Radosh made in The Nation in 1966 that Henry Wallace, perhaps the furthest-left major public official in the history of the United States, was actually a capitalist sellout. Another part of the pattern: the tendency to depict ostensibly revolutionary societies as lands straight out of a fairy tale. Max Eastman (1883-1969), who ended up in the orbit of National Review , filed a dispatch for The Nation in 1923 on a rail journey through Russia whose childlike wonder rivaled a scene from Tom Hanks's The Polar Express . The passport functionary \"was almost magically friendly and gentle.\" The cars were \"wider than railroad cars in America.\" The cabin had \"clean white bed-linen at a mild price, and a friendly young host in a workingman's shirt who came in every once in a while to know if we wouldn't like some tea.\" Some radicals have no problem maturing away from fantasies absorbed at the height of their revolutionary fervor while maintaining the moral core of their commitment to the broader left. Eastman, Radosh and, most famously, Whittaker Chambers (1901-1961), who contributed occasional poems to The Nation in the 1920s, instead went \"all the way.\" Afterward, they projected their own extremism onto the entire left and thus became conservative heroes. This is because they performed a matchless service in letting conservatives ignore the evidence of their senses: that the actual left is thoughtful, humane and diverse. Even if you're a confessed traitor like Chambers, your sins-provided you undergo the proper purification rites-are not an impediment to an embrace from the right, but an advertisement. By bearing witness to the myth that the right's adversaries are more wicked than other conservatives could possibly imagine, you ritualistically renourish the moral Manichaeism without which no right wing worthy of the name can survive. David Horowitz, for example, was an occasional contributor whose first Nation article was a 1964 essay about suicide in Scandinavia. In it, he argued it was no surprise that Swedes and Danes would want to kill themselves-because those countries were still, after all, capitalist nations. He now edits FrontPageMag.com, for which his friend Ronald Radosh publishes articles like \"The American Left: Friends of Our Country's Enemies.\" In 1979, on the cusp of his own apostasy, Horowitz wrote an essay wondering whether the left could ever shed its \"arrogant cloak of self-righteousness that elevates it above its own history and makes it impervious to the lessons of experience.\" That essay, however, was published in The Nation -vitiating his very claim about the arrogant self-righteousness of the left. J. Edgar Hoover once called communism \"a disease that spreads like an epidemic, and like an epidemic, quarantine is necessary to keep it from infecting the nation.\" The apostate from the left adds another crucial detail to that etiology: the idea that the infection is all the more frightening and dangerous because it's invisible, hiding within its host until it finds the opportune moment to do the most damage. Liberalism, like the devil, hides its true face. Thus the slogan of Horowitz's FrontPageMag.com: \"Inside Every Liberal Is a Totalitarian Screaming to Get Out.\" That's how conservatives can depict centrists like Barack Obama and Bill Clinton as aspiring commissars. Didn't Clinton, after all, hire the \"black Marxist Johnnetta [ sic ] Cole,\" as Radosh describes the former president of Spelman College, to direct his transition team for education? Back in the days of Radosh's trip to Cuba, Cole too had been a supporter of Fidel Castro. And so, wrote his friend Eric Breindel in the New York Post , the conclusion was \"inescapable\" that Clinton was not \"interested in distinguishing between a left-liberal and someone who cast her lot with the cause of Communist totalitarianism.\" * * * Of course, plenty of Nation writers traveled rightward with their honor intact. The sociologist Alan Wolfe, once a gentlemanly radical, is now a gentlemanly centrist. He helps to make my point: his contributions to these pages in the 1970s and '80s were resolutely unsilly; he doesn't have to despise leftists now because he never gave himself a reason to despise the leftist he was then. Max Lerner (1902-1992), a towering legend of American liberalism, published some forty-four articles here between 1936 and 1940. He became, in his late 70s, an admirer of Ronald Reagan-but his columns on the subject were full of thoughtful admonitions that liberals hurt only themselves by dismissing the fortieth president as a dunce. And the political philosopher Jean Bethke Elshtain (1941-2013) made the same useful criticisms about the glibness of some radical feminists' deconstructions of \"the family\" in 1979 that she did when she later aligned with George W. Bush. Others, though, evinced one of the ugliest traditions on the left: revolutionary megalomania, the display of a will to power in which the writer embraces radicalism in order to aggrandize himself. A curious note emerges among the admirers of the Soviet experiment who wrote in these pages in the 1930s and '40s. In the Soviet Union and Cuba, the intellectuals who harnessed themselves to the correct side in the battle between socialism and barbarism died as prophets (or, in the case of Trotsky, great martyrs). Back in the United States, writers could secretly imagine the same imminent fate for themselves: that when the revolution came in America, they would become its heroes-or even its leaders. This grandiosity helps explain why apparently intelligent writers would sign on to a project so manifestly unintelligent as America's invasion of Iraq, confident it would go exactly as planned. We find a clue in a children's book published in 1982 by Paul Berman, The Nation 's onetime theater critic, who went on to a career as a self-described \"liberal\" booster of Dick Cheney's adventure in Iraq, framing it as an existential struggle against Islamic fascism. It was called Make-Believe Empire: A How-To Book , and it is described by the Library of Congress as \"A fantasy-craft book which tells how to construct a capital city and an imperial navy.... Provides instructions for writing laws, decrees, proclamations, treaties, and imperial odes.\" Left or right, it doesn't much matter: it sure is a bracing feeling for the chair-bound intellectual to imagine himself the drivetrain in the engine of history. Or at the very least a prophet, standing on the correct side of history and looking down upon moral midgets who insist the world is more complicated than all that. Consider Christopher Hitchens: the former Trotskyist wrote, following his 2002 resignation as a Nation columnist, that by not embracing things like the Iraq War, \" The Nation joined the amoral side....

When Nikita Khrushchev sent tanks into Hungary to crush a grassroots uprising in 1956, many radicals chose that moment to stop apologizing for the Soviet Union. Ronald Radosh, a red-diaper baby who published seventeen articles in The Nation between 1966 and 1980, decided it was time to join the Communist Party USA. Later, when sane people were celebrating the end of the Vietnam War, Radosh and those around him regarded the moment as \"an occasion for deep melancholy.\" They liked the Vietnam War, he explained in his memoir, Commies ; it gave their lives meaning. Now that our country was no longer laying waste to Third World peasants, America, for these folks, \"could no longer so easily be called Amerika .\" And now that the exigencies of war could no longer excuse the communists' human-rights abuses, their struggle could no longer be idealized as the heroic effort to create a model Marxist society: \"The idea of an immediate, no-fault revolution, a fantasy of the previous decade, was no longer tenable.\" With that, Radosh doubled down again and traveled to Cuba with a group of revolutionary enthusiasts. One day, they visited a mental hospital.  A doctor there boasted, \"In our institution, we have a larger proportion of hospital inmates who have been lobotomized than any other mental hospital in the world.\" Back on their bus, a flabbergasted therapist exclaimed, \"Lobotomy is a horror. We must do something to stop this.\" Another member of the American  delegation shot back: \"We have to understand that there are differences between capitalist lobotomies and socialist lobotomies.\" Radosh, of course, ended up on the political right. The final straw came when he published a book in 1983 arguing that Julius Rosenberg was indeed guilty of the crime for which he had been executed in 1953. Radosh found himself unfairly attacked from the left. Thus was he moved to \"consider the ultimate heresy: perhaps the Left was wrong not just about the Rosenberg case, but about most everything else....

He doesn't note that two of his intellectual adversaries, Walter and Miriam Schneir, ultimately changed their minds about the case in the face of new evidence. Radosh's political journey follows a familiar pattern, well documented among Nation writers who end their careers on the right: a rigid extremist, possessed of the most over-the-top revolutionary fantasies, comes face to face with the complexity of the real world, then \"changes sides\" and makes his career by hysterically identifying the \"socialist lobotomies\" set as the only kind of leftist there is-ignoring evidence to the contrary that's right in front of his nose. * * * One of the first leftists to abandon the tribe in the pages of The Nation was no less than the magazine's longtime owner and columnist, Oswald Garrison Villard (1872-1949). Villard was such a doctrinaire pacifist that he resigned his column in protest in June 1940 because The Nation favored the United States' rearming to fight Hitler. As he wrote in his valedictory, the magazine had abandoned \"the chief glory of its great and honorable past\": its \"steadfast opposition to all preparations for war.\" He predicted that the course the editors were proposing would \"inevitably end all social and political progress, lower still further the standard of living, enslave labor, and, if persisted in, impose a dictatorship and turn us into a totalitarian state.\" Villard ended up starring in a 1975 book, Prophets on the Right: Profiles of Conservative Critics of American Globalism , whose author happened to be Ronald Radosh. The novelist and critic Granville Hicks (1901-1982) was an orthodox communist who in 1933 published a Marxist history of American literature. In 1940, however, Hicks published an essay in The Nation titled \"The Blind Alley of Marxism,\" in which he excoriated his comrades' unexamined political assumptions. Why, for instance, should \"the elimination of the economic contradictions of capitalism inevitably and automatically [lead] to the higher stage of social development?\" And why, he asked-not long after the Moscow trials railroaded many of the founders of the Soviet state into gulags-do American radicals give \"carte blanche...to a little group of men, five thousand miles away?\" This was thoughtful stuff, but rather than sticking around to nurture a rich debate, Hicks became an eager namer of names to the House Un-American Activities Committee. The culture and history of the left, of course, is shot through with silly, ideologically driven absurdities (\"socialist lobotomies,\" to coin a phrase). There is, for example, the argument Radosh made in The Nation in 1966 that Henry Wallace, perhaps the furthest-left major public official in the history of the United States, was actually a capitalist sellout. Another part of the pattern: the tendency to depict ostensibly revolutionary societies as lands straight out of a fairy tale. Max Eastman (1883-1969), who ended up in the orbit of National Review , filed a dispatch for The Nation in 1923 on a rail journey through Russia whose childlike wonder rivaled a scene from Tom Hanks's The Polar Express . The passport functionary \"was almost magically friendly and gentle.\" The cars were \"wider than railroad cars in America.\" The cabin had \"clean white bed-linen at a mild price, and a friendly young host in a workingman's shirt who came in every once in a while to know if we wouldn't like some tea.\" Some radicals have no problem maturing away from fantasies absorbed at the height of their revolutionary fervor while maintaining the moral core of their commitment to the broader left. Eastman, Radosh and, most famously, Whittaker Chambers (1901-1961), who contributed occasional poems to The Nation in the 1920s, instead went \"all the way.\" Afterward, they projected their own extremism onto the entire left and thus became conservative heroes. This is because they performed a matchless service in letting conservatives ignore the evidence of their senses: that the actual left is thoughtful, humane and diverse. Even if you're a confessed traitor like Chambers, your sins-provided you undergo the proper purification rites-are not an impediment to an embrace from the right, but an advertisement. By bearing witness to the myth that the right's adversaries are more wicked than other conservatives could possibly imagine, you ritualistically renourish the moral Manichaeism without which no right wing worthy of the name can survive. David Horowitz, for example, was an occasional contributor whose first Nation article was a 1964 essay about suicide in Scandinavia. In it, he argued it was no surprise that Swedes and Danes would want to kill themselves-because those countries were still, after all, capitalist nations. He now edits FrontPageMag.com, for which his friend Ronald Radosh publishes articles like \"The American Left: Friends of Our Country's Enemies.\" In 1979, on the cusp of his own apostasy, Horowitz wrote an essay wondering whether the left could ever shed its \"arrogant cloak of self-righteousness that elevates it above its own history and makes it impervious to the lessons of experience.\" That essay, however, was published in The Nation -vitiating his very claim about the arrogant self-righteousness of the left. J. Edgar Hoover once called communism \"a disease that spreads like an epidemic, and like an epidemic, quarantine is necessary to keep it from infecting the nation.\" The apostate from the left adds another crucial detail to that etiology: the idea that the infection is all the more frightening and dangerous because it's invisible, hiding within its host until it finds the opportune moment to do the most damage. Liberalism, like the devil, hides its true face. Thus the slogan of Horowitz's FrontPageMag.com: \"Inside Every Liberal Is a Totalitarian Screaming to Get Out.\" That's how conservatives can depict centrists like Barack Obama and Bill Clinton as aspiring commissars. Didn't Clinton, after all, hire the \"black Marxist Johnnetta [ sic ] Cole,\" as Radosh describes the former president of Spelman College, to direct his transition team for education? Back in the days of Radosh's trip to Cuba, Cole too had been a supporter of Fidel Castro. And so, wrote his friend Eric Breindel in the New York Post , the conclusion was \"inescapable\" that Clinton was not \"interested in distinguishing between a left-liberal and someone who cast her lot with the cause of Communist totalitarianism.\" * * * Of course, plenty of Nation writers traveled rightward with their honor intact. The sociologist Alan Wolfe, once a gentlemanly radical, is now a gentlemanly centrist. He helps to make my point: his contributions to these pages in the 1970s and '80s were resolutely unsilly; he doesn't have to despise leftists now because he never gave himself a reason to despise the leftist he was then.

Eastman, Radosh and, most famously, Whittaker Chambers (1901-1961), who contributed occasional poems to The Nation in the 1920s, instead went \"all the way.\" Afterward, they projected their own extremism onto the entire left and thus became conservative heroes. This is because they performed a matchless service in letting conservatives ignore the evidence of their senses: that the actual left is thoughtful, humane and diverse. Even if you're a confessed traitor like Chambers, your sins-provided you undergo the proper purification rites-are not an impediment to an embrace from the right, but an advertisement. By bearing witness to the myth that the right's adversaries are more wicked than other conservatives could possibly imagine, you ritualistically renourish the moral Manichaeism without which no right wing worthy of the name can survive. David Horowitz, for example, was an occasional contributor whose first Nation article was a 1964 essay about suicide in Scandinavia. In it, he argued it was no surprise that Swedes and Danes would want to kill themselves-because those countries were still, after all, capitalist nations. He now edits FrontPageMag.com, for which his friend Ronald Radosh publishes articles like \"The American Left: Friends of Our Country's Enemies.\" In 1979, on the cusp of his own apostasy, Horowitz wrote an essay wondering whether the left could ever shed its \"arrogant cloak of self-righteousness that elevates it above its own history and makes it impervious to the lessons of experience.\" That essay, however, was published in The Nation -vitiating his very claim about the arrogant self-righteousness of the left. J. Edgar Hoover once called communism \"a disease that spreads like an epidemic, and like an epidemic, quarantine is necessary to keep it from infecting the nation.\" The apostate from the left adds another crucial detail to that etiology: the idea that the infection is all the more frightening and dangerous because it's invisible, hiding within its host until it finds the opportune moment to do the most damage. Liberalism, like the devil, hides its true face. Thus the slogan of Horowitz's FrontPageMag.com: \"Inside Every Liberal Is a Totalitarian Screaming to Get Out.\" That's how conservatives can depict centrists like Barack Obama and Bill Clinton as aspiring commissars. Didn't Clinton, after all, hire the \"black Marxist Johnnetta [ sic ] Cole,\" as Radosh describes the former president of Spelman College, to direct his transition team for education? Back in the days of Radosh's trip to Cuba, Cole too had been a supporter of Fidel Castro. And so, wrote his friend Eric Breindel in the New York Post , the conclusion was \"inescapable\" that Clinton was not \"interested in distinguishing between a left-liberal and someone who cast her lot with the cause of Communist totalitarianism.\" * * * Of course, plenty of Nation writers traveled rightward with their honor intact. The sociologist Alan Wolfe, once a gentlemanly radical, is now a gentlemanly centrist. He helps to make my point: his contributions to these pages in the 1970s and '80s were resolutely unsilly; he doesn't have to despise leftists now because he never gave himself a reason to despise the leftist he was then. Max Lerner (1902-1992), a towering legend of American liberalism, published some forty-four articles here between 1936 and 1940. He became, in his late 70s, an admirer of Ronald Reagan-but his columns on the subject were full of thoughtful admonitions that liberals hurt only themselves by dismissing the fortieth president as a dunce. And the political philosopher Jean Bethke Elshtain (1941-2013) made the same useful criticisms about the glibness of some radical feminists' deconstructions of \"the family\" in 1979 that she did when she later aligned with George W. Bush. Others, though, evinced one of the ugliest traditions on the left: revolutionary megalomania, the display of a will to power in which the writer embraces radicalism in order to aggrandize himself. A curious note emerges among the admirers of the Soviet experiment who wrote in these pages in the 1930s and '40s. In the Soviet Union and Cuba, the intellectuals who harnessed themselves to the correct side in the battle between socialism and barbarism died as prophets (or, in the case of Trotsky, great martyrs). Back in the United States, writers could secretly imagine the same imminent fate for themselves: that when the revolution came in America, they would become its heroes-or even its leaders. This grandiosity helps explain why apparently intelligent writers would sign on to a project so manifestly unintelligent as America's invasion of Iraq, confident it would go exactly as planned. We find a clue in a children's book published in 1982 by Paul Berman, The Nation 's onetime theater critic, who went on to a career as a self-described \"liberal\" booster of Dick Cheney's adventure in Iraq, framing it as an existential struggle against Islamic fascism. It was called Make-Believe Empire: A How-To Book , and it is described by the Library of Congress as \"A fantasy-craft book which tells how to construct a capital city and an imperial navy.... Provides instructions for writing laws, decrees, proclamations, treaties, and imperial odes.\" Left or right, it doesn't much matter: it sure is a bracing feeling for the chair-bound intellectual to imagine himself the drivetrain in the engine of history. Or at the very least a prophet, standing on the correct side of history and looking down upon moral midgets who insist the world is more complicated than all that. Consider Christopher Hitchens: the former Trotskyist wrote, following his 2002 resignation as a Nation columnist, that by not embracing things like the Iraq War, \" The Nation joined the amoral side.... I say that they stand for neutralism where no such thing is possible or desirable, and I say the hell with it.\" It is the turncoat's greatest gift to his new hosts: the affirmation that the world exists only in black and white. They're the good guys, we're the bad guys. The rest of us can aspire to something better: no more socialist lobotomies.\n\nWith that, Radosh doubled down again and traveled to Cuba with a group of revolutionary enthusiasts. One day, they visited a mental hospital.  A doctor there boasted, \"In our institution, we have a larger proportion of hospital inmates who have been lobotomized than any other mental hospital in the world.\" Back on their bus, a flabbergasted therapist exclaimed, \"Lobotomy is a horror. We must do something to stop this.\" Another member of the American  delegation shot back: \"We have to understand that there are differences between capitalist lobotomies and socialist lobotomies.\" Radosh, of course, ended up on the political right. The final straw came when he published a book in 1983 arguing that Julius Rosenberg was indeed guilty of the crime for which he had been executed in 1953. Radosh found himself unfairly attacked from the left. Thus was he moved to \"consider the ultimate heresy: perhaps the Left was wrong not just about the Rosenberg case, but about most everything else.... My journey to America was about to reach its final leg.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis But he notes something else in his memoir, baldly contradicting his earlier claim about the left being wrong about \"most everything\": some on the left defended him, including in the pages of The Nation . He doesn't note that two of his intellectual adversaries, Walter and Miriam Schneir, ultimately changed their minds about the case in the face of new evidence. Radosh's political journey follows a familiar pattern, well documented among Nation writers who end their careers on the right: a rigid extremist, possessed of the most over-the-top revolutionary fantasies, comes face to face with the complexity of the real world, then \"changes sides\" and makes his career by hysterically identifying the \"socialist lobotomies\" set as the only kind of leftist there is-ignoring evidence to the contrary that's right in front of his nose. * * * One of the first leftists to abandon the tribe in the pages of The Nation was no less than the magazine's longtime owner and columnist, Oswald Garrison Villard (1872-1949). Villard was such a doctrinaire pacifist that he resigned his column in protest in June 1940 because The Nation favored the United States' rearming to fight Hitler. As he wrote in his valedictory, the magazine had abandoned \"the chief glory of its great and honorable past\": its \"steadfast opposition to all preparations for war.\" He predicted that the course the editors were proposing would \"inevitably end all social and political progress, lower still further the standard of living, enslave labor, and, if persisted in, impose a dictatorship and turn us into a totalitarian state.\" Villard ended up starring in a 1975 book, Prophets on the Right: Profiles of Conservative Critics of American Globalism , whose author happened to be Ronald Radosh. The novelist and critic Granville Hicks (1901-1982) was an orthodox communist who in 1933 published a Marxist history of American literature. In 1940, however, Hicks published an essay in The Nation titled \"The Blind Alley of Marxism,\" in which he excoriated his comrades' unexamined political assumptions. Why, for instance, should \"the elimination of the economic contradictions of capitalism inevitably and automatically [lead] to the higher stage of social development?\" And why, he asked-not long after the Moscow trials railroaded many of the founders of the Soviet state into gulags-do American radicals give \"carte blanche...to a little group of men, five thousand miles away?\" This was thoughtful stuff, but rather than sticking around to nurture a rich debate, Hicks became an eager namer of names to the House Un-American Activities Committee. The culture and history of the left, of course, is shot through with silly, ideologically driven absurdities (\"socialist lobotomies,\" to coin a phrase). There is, for example, the argument Radosh made in The Nation in 1966 that Henry Wallace, perhaps the furthest-left major public official in the history of the United States, was actually a capitalist sellout. Another part of the pattern: the tendency to depict ostensibly revolutionary societies as lands straight out of a fairy tale.

He now edits FrontPageMag.com, for which his friend Ronald Radosh publishes articles like \"The American Left: Friends of Our Country's Enemies.\" In 1979, on the cusp of his own apostasy, Horowitz wrote an essay wondering whether the left could ever shed its \"arrogant cloak of self-righteousness that elevates it above its own history and makes it impervious to the lessons of experience.\" That essay, however, was published in The Nation -vitiating his very claim about the arrogant self-righteousness of the left. J. Edgar Hoover once called communism \"a disease that spreads like an epidemic, and like an epidemic, quarantine is necessary to keep it from infecting the nation.\" The apostate from the left adds another crucial detail to that etiology: the idea that the infection is all the more frightening and dangerous because it's invisible, hiding within its host until it finds the opportune moment to do the most damage. Liberalism, like the devil, hides its true face. Thus the slogan of Horowitz's FrontPageMag.com: \"Inside Every Liberal Is a Totalitarian Screaming to Get Out.\" That's how conservatives can depict centrists like Barack Obama and Bill Clinton as aspiring commissars. Didn't Clinton, after all, hire the \"black Marxist Johnnetta [ sic ] Cole,\" as Radosh describes the former president of Spelman College, to direct his transition team for education? Back in the days of Radosh's trip to Cuba, Cole too had been a supporter of Fidel Castro. And so, wrote his friend Eric Breindel in the New York Post , the conclusion was \"inescapable\" that Clinton was not \"interested in distinguishing between a left-liberal and someone who cast her lot with the cause of Communist totalitarianism.\" * * * Of course, plenty of Nation writers traveled rightward with their honor intact. The sociologist Alan Wolfe, once a gentlemanly radical, is now a gentlemanly centrist. He helps to make my point: his contributions to these pages in the 1970s and '80s were resolutely unsilly; he doesn't have to despise leftists now because he never gave himself a reason to despise the leftist he was then. Max Lerner (1902-1992), a towering legend of American liberalism, published some forty-four articles here between 1936 and 1940. He became, in his late 70s, an admirer of Ronald Reagan-but his columns on the subject were full of thoughtful admonitions that liberals hurt only themselves by dismissing the fortieth president as a dunce. And the political philosopher Jean Bethke Elshtain (1941-2013) made the same useful criticisms about the glibness of some radical feminists' deconstructions of \"the family\" in 1979 that she did when she later aligned with George W. Bush. Others, though, evinced one of the ugliest traditions on the left: revolutionary megalomania, the display of a will to power in which the writer embraces radicalism in order to aggrandize himself. A curious note emerges among the admirers of the Soviet experiment who wrote in these pages in the 1930s and '40s. In the Soviet Union and Cuba, the intellectuals who harnessed themselves to the correct side in the battle between socialism and barbarism died as prophets (or, in the case of Trotsky, great martyrs). Back in the United States, writers could secretly imagine the same imminent fate for themselves: that when the revolution came in America, they would become its heroes-or even its leaders. This grandiosity helps explain why apparently intelligent writers would sign on to a project so manifestly unintelligent as America's invasion of Iraq, confident it would go exactly as planned. We find a clue in a children's book published in 1982 by Paul Berman, The Nation 's onetime theater critic, who went on to a career as a self-described \"liberal\" booster of Dick Cheney's adventure in Iraq, framing it as an existential struggle against Islamic fascism. It was called Make-Believe Empire: A How-To Book , and it is described by the Library of Congress as \"A fantasy-craft book which tells how to construct a capital city and an imperial navy.... Provides instructions for writing laws, decrees, proclamations, treaties, and imperial odes.\" Left or right, it doesn't much matter: it sure is a bracing feeling for the chair-bound intellectual to imagine himself the drivetrain in the engine of history. Or at the very least a prophet, standing on the correct side of history and looking down upon moral midgets who insist the world is more complicated than all that. Consider Christopher Hitchens: the former Trotskyist wrote, following his 2002 resignation as a Nation columnist, that by not embracing things like the Iraq War, \" The Nation joined the amoral side.... I say that they stand for neutralism where no such thing is possible or desirable, and I say the hell with it.\" It is the turncoat's greatest gift to his new hosts: the affirmation that the world exists only in black and white. They're the good guys, we're the bad guys. The rest of us can aspire to something better: no more socialist lobotomies.\n\nRadosh's political journey follows a familiar pattern, well documented among Nation writers who end their careers on the right: a rigid extremist, possessed of the most over-the-top revolutionary fantasies, comes face to face with the complexity of the real world, then \"changes sides\" and makes his career by hysterically identifying the \"socialist lobotomies\" set as the only kind of leftist there is-ignoring evidence to the contrary that's right in front of his nose. * * * One of the first leftists to abandon the tribe in the pages of The Nation was no less than the magazine's longtime owner and columnist, Oswald Garrison Villard (1872-1949). Villard was such a doctrinaire pacifist that he resigned his column in protest in June 1940 because The Nation favored the United States' rearming to fight Hitler. As he wrote in his valedictory, the magazine had abandoned \"the chief glory of its great and honorable past\": its \"steadfast opposition to all preparations for war.\" He predicted that the course the editors were proposing would \"inevitably end all social and political progress, lower still further the standard of living, enslave labor, and, if persisted in, impose a dictatorship and turn us into a totalitarian state.\" Villard ended up starring in a 1975 book, Prophets on the Right: Profiles of Conservative Critics of American Globalism , whose author happened to be Ronald Radosh. The novelist and critic Granville Hicks (1901-1982) was an orthodox communist who in 1933 published a Marxist history of American literature. In 1940, however, Hicks published an essay in The Nation titled \"The Blind Alley of Marxism,\" in which he excoriated his comrades' unexamined political assumptions. Why, for instance, should \"the elimination of the economic contradictions of capitalism inevitably and automatically [lead] to the higher stage of social development?\" And why, he asked-not long after the Moscow trials railroaded many of the founders of the Soviet state into gulags-do American radicals give \"carte blanche...to a little group of men, five thousand miles away?\" This was thoughtful stuff, but rather than sticking around to nurture a rich debate, Hicks became an eager namer of names to the House Un-American Activities Committee. The culture and history of the left, of course, is shot through with silly, ideologically driven absurdities (\"socialist lobotomies,\" to coin a phrase). There is, for example, the argument Radosh made in The Nation in 1966 that Henry Wallace, perhaps the furthest-left major public official in the history of the United States, was actually a capitalist sellout. Another part of the pattern: the tendency to depict ostensibly revolutionary societies as lands straight out of a fairy tale. Max Eastman (1883-1969), who ended up in the orbit of National Review , filed a dispatch for The Nation in 1923 on a rail journey through Russia whose childlike wonder rivaled a scene from Tom Hanks's The Polar Express . The passport functionary \"was almost magically friendly and gentle.\" The cars were \"wider than railroad cars in America.\" The cabin had \"clean white bed-linen at a mild price, and a friendly young host in a workingman's shirt who came in every once in a while to know if we wouldn't like some tea.\" Some radicals have no problem maturing away from fantasies absorbed at the height of their revolutionary fervor while maintaining the moral core of their commitment to the broader left. Eastman, Radosh and, most famously, Whittaker Chambers (1901-1961), who contributed occasional poems to The Nation in the 1920s, instead went \"all the way.\" Afterward, they projected their own extremism onto the entire left and thus became conservative heroes. This is because they performed a matchless service in letting conservatives ignore the evidence of their senses: that the actual left is thoughtful, humane and diverse. Even if you're a confessed traitor like Chambers, your sins-provided you undergo the proper purification rites-are not an impediment to an embrace from the right, but an advertisement. By bearing witness to the myth that the right's adversaries are more wicked than other conservatives could possibly imagine, you ritualistically renourish the moral Manichaeism without which no right wing worthy of the name can survive.

Even if you're a confessed traitor like Chambers, your sins-provided you undergo the proper purification rites-are not an impediment to an embrace from the right, but an advertisement. By bearing witness to the myth that the right's adversaries are more wicked than other conservatives could possibly imagine, you ritualistically renourish the moral Manichaeism without which no right wing worthy of the name can survive. David Horowitz, for example, was an occasional contributor whose first Nation article was a 1964 essay about suicide in Scandinavia. In it, he argued it was no surprise that Swedes and Danes would want to kill themselves-because those countries were still, after all, capitalist nations. He now edits FrontPageMag.com, for which his friend Ronald Radosh publishes articles like \"The American Left: Friends of Our Country's Enemies.\" In 1979, on the cusp of his own apostasy, Horowitz wrote an essay wondering whether the left could ever shed its \"arrogant cloak of self-righteousness that elevates it above its own history and makes it impervious to the lessons of experience.\" That essay, however, was published in The Nation -vitiating his very claim about the arrogant self-righteousness of the left. J. Edgar Hoover once called communism \"a disease that spreads like an epidemic, and like an epidemic, quarantine is necessary to keep it from infecting the nation.\" The apostate from the left adds another crucial detail to that etiology: the idea that the infection is all the more frightening and dangerous because it's invisible, hiding within its host until it finds the opportune moment to do the most damage. Liberalism, like the devil, hides its true face. Thus the slogan of Horowitz's FrontPageMag.com: \"Inside Every Liberal Is a Totalitarian Screaming to Get Out.\" That's how conservatives can depict centrists like Barack Obama and Bill Clinton as aspiring commissars. Didn't Clinton, after all, hire the \"black Marxist Johnnetta [ sic ] Cole,\" as Radosh describes the former president of Spelman College, to direct his transition team for education? Back in the days of Radosh's trip to Cuba, Cole too had been a supporter of Fidel Castro. And so, wrote his friend Eric Breindel in the New York Post , the conclusion was \"inescapable\" that Clinton was not \"interested in distinguishing between a left-liberal and someone who cast her lot with the cause of Communist totalitarianism.\" * * * Of course, plenty of Nation writers traveled rightward with their honor intact. The sociologist Alan Wolfe, once a gentlemanly radical, is now a gentlemanly centrist. He helps to make my point: his contributions to these pages in the 1970s and '80s were resolutely unsilly; he doesn't have to despise leftists now because he never gave himself a reason to despise the leftist he was then. Max Lerner (1902-1992), a towering legend of American liberalism, published some forty-four articles here between 1936 and 1940. He became, in his late 70s, an admirer of Ronald Reagan-but his columns on the subject were full of thoughtful admonitions that liberals hurt only themselves by dismissing the fortieth president as a dunce. And the political philosopher Jean Bethke Elshtain (1941-2013) made the same useful criticisms about the glibness of some radical feminists' deconstructions of \"the family\" in 1979 that she did when she later aligned with George W. Bush. Others, though, evinced one of the ugliest traditions on the left: revolutionary megalomania, the display of a will to power in which the writer embraces radicalism in order to aggrandize himself. A curious note emerges among the admirers of the Soviet experiment who wrote in these pages in the 1930s and '40s. In the Soviet Union and Cuba, the intellectuals who harnessed themselves to the correct side in the battle between socialism and barbarism died as prophets (or, in the case of Trotsky, great martyrs). Back in the United States, writers could secretly imagine the same imminent fate for themselves: that when the revolution came in America, they would become its heroes-or even its leaders. This grandiosity helps explain why apparently intelligent writers would sign on to a project so manifestly unintelligent as America's invasion of Iraq, confident it would go exactly as planned. We find a clue in a children's book published in 1982 by Paul Berman, The Nation 's onetime theater critic, who went on to a career as a self-described \"liberal\" booster of Dick Cheney's adventure in Iraq, framing it as an existential struggle against Islamic fascism. It was called Make-Believe Empire: A How-To Book , and it is described by the Library of Congress as \"A fantasy-craft book which tells how to construct a capital city and an imperial navy.... Provides instructions for writing laws, decrees, proclamations, treaties, and imperial odes.\" Left or right, it doesn't much matter: it sure is a bracing feeling for the chair-bound intellectual to imagine himself the drivetrain in the engine of history. Or at the very least a prophet, standing on the correct side of history and looking down upon moral midgets who insist the world is more complicated than all that. Consider Christopher Hitchens: the former Trotskyist wrote, following his 2002 resignation as a Nation columnist, that by not embracing things like the Iraq War, \" The Nation joined the amoral side.... I say that they stand for neutralism where no such thing is possible or desirable, and I say the hell with it.\" It is the turncoat's greatest gift to his new hosts: the affirmation that the world exists only in black and white. They're the good guys, we're the bad guys. The rest of us can aspire to something better: no more socialist lobotomies.\n\nThe culture and history of the left, of course, is shot through with silly, ideologically driven absurdities (\"socialist lobotomies,\" to coin a phrase). There is, for example, the argument Radosh made in The Nation in 1966 that Henry Wallace, perhaps the furthest-left major public official in the history of the United States, was actually a capitalist sellout. Another part of the pattern: the tendency to depict ostensibly revolutionary societies as lands straight out of a fairy tale. Max Eastman (1883-1969), who ended up in the orbit of National Review , filed a dispatch for The Nation in 1923 on a rail journey through Russia whose childlike wonder rivaled a scene from Tom Hanks's The Polar Express . The passport functionary \"was almost magically friendly and gentle.\" The cars were \"wider than railroad cars in America.\" The cabin had \"clean white bed-linen at a mild price, and a friendly young host in a workingman's shirt who came in every once in a while to know if we wouldn't like some tea.\" Some radicals have no problem maturing away from fantasies absorbed at the height of their revolutionary fervor while maintaining the moral core of their commitment to the broader left. Eastman, Radosh and, most famously, Whittaker Chambers (1901-1961), who contributed occasional poems to The Nation in the 1920s, instead went \"all the way.\" Afterward, they projected their own extremism onto the entire left and thus became conservative heroes.

A curious note emerges among the admirers of the Soviet experiment who wrote in these pages in the 1930s and '40s. In the Soviet Union and Cuba, the intellectuals who harnessed themselves to the correct side in the battle between socialism and barbarism died as prophets (or, in the case of Trotsky, great martyrs). Back in the United States, writers could secretly imagine the same imminent fate for themselves: that when the revolution came in America, they would become its heroes-or even its leaders.

      "text": "Conservatives Have Lost Their Grip on the World - and Themselves\n\nOpinion Guest Essay\n\nCredit... Pablo Delcan and Noah Kalina\n\nSupported by\n\nBy Ferdinand Mount\n\nMr. Mount is a political commentator and a former columnist for The Sunday Times and The Daily Telegraph. He wrote from London.\n\nThe British Conservative Party has long boasted of being the most successful political party on the planet. The unimaginable scale of its defeat on July 4, when it won the fewest seats in its history, looks like the downfall of moderate conservatism. It appears to be the final straw for the center-right parties offering pragmatism, prosperity and opportunity that have dominated Western politics since World War II. Almost everywhere conservatism's brash rival, nationalist populism, is on the march: already in power with its colorful leaders in Hungary, Italy and Argentina; on the brink of it in the United States and France; and eroding the old-style conservatives in Germany, the Netherlands and now Britain. The rivalry on the right is in danger of becoming a rout, with the senior, steadier force swallowed by its insurgent challenger.\n\nThese shocks to our established ways of thinking are so violent that we immediately assume that this must be a unique apocalypse, the product of unprecedented social and economic forces. This, I think, is a temptation to be resisted. The reality is that something similar has often happened or nearly happened before, at different times and in different places. Nationalist populism, my umbrella term for the smorgasbord of hard-right forces, always sings the same song. The circumstances that gain it a sympathetic hearing are usually much the same, too: decline of old industries and loss of well-paid jobs for men, undercutting by rising nations and, of course, fresh waves of immigrants from new places. It's when mainstream conservatism visibly flounders in dealing with the challenge - as it has so clearly done in recent years - that such movements can hope to surge.\n\nThe upshot is both concerning and consoling. Conservatism has been here before - and it can get through it again.\n\nN ationalist populism is not a weird deviation from the natural flow of history. Since the dawn of the nation-state, it has been an ever-present threat, sometimes lurking in the shadows, sometimes derided as a throwback, but never quite disappearing from view. The possibilities for its success are often visible well in advance to keen observers, at times when most people are thinking about something else. In 1922, when the rest of Europe was convulsed by the threat of Bolshevism and Adolf Hitler was still a nonentity, the German chancellor declared \"There is no doubt about it: The enemy is on the right.\" In 1994, when all of Europe was still celebrating the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of history, Edward Luttwak foresaw a \"space that remains wide open for a product-improved fascist party.\"\n\nIt's in the United States where the most stunning example of something like that has taken place. But the Trump phenomenon did not come out of a calm blue sky. Donald Trump's discarded guru Steve Bannon saw in his master echoes of earlier populist orators, such as William Jennings Bryan, who could rage against bankers to rural audiences for hours on end. Mr. Bannon prepped Mr. Trump for his inauguration by telling him tales of his predecessor Andrew Jackson, whose inauguration had drawn to Washington thousands of obstreperous supporters who drank the capital dry and outstayed their welcome - echoing what was to come four years later, on a more violent and terrifying scale.\n\nMr. Trump's critics, and his fans too, preferred to think of him as a unique irruption into American history. But Mr. Bannon was right in thinking that most of his instincts and his policies have roots going way back. Before the aviator Charles Lindbergh helped lead the America First Committee to keep the United States out of World War II, Woodrow Wilson had used the slogan \"America First\" in his doomed 1916 pledge to keep America out of World War I. The press baron William Randolph Hearst used it in his campaigns almost as often as he played up the threat of Chinese immigration. (Orson Welles's \"Citizen Kane , \" based on Mr. Hearst, is Mr. Trump's favorite film.) In the 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan took up the slogan, and as recently as 2016, David Duke, a former leader of the Klan, ran for a Louisiana Senate seat as an \"America First\" candidate.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

But as the administration has rushed to carry out deportations as quickly as possible, making mistakes and raising concerns about due process along the way, the unified front in favor of President Trump's immigration purge is beginning to crack.\n\nWhen the administration deported a professional makeup artist and accused him of being part of a criminal gang, the enormously popular podcaster Joe Rogan balked.\n\n\"You've got to get scared that people who are not criminals are getting lassoed up and deported and sent to El Salvador prisons,\" Mr. Rogan, who endorsed Mr. Trump, said on his show \"The Joe Rogan Experience.\" He added that the case was \"horrific.\"\n\nWhen the administration arrested a former Columbia University graduate student who had been involved in campus protests, the far-right commentator Ann Coulter questioned the move.\n\n\"There's almost no one I don't want to deport, but unless they've committed a crime, isn't this a violation of the First Amendment?\" Ms. Coulter wrote on social media.\n\nThe dissenting voices, which have been limited mostly to commentators rather than elected Republicans, are remarkable because conservatives don't often openly break with the president. And while the objections have largely been contained to tactics - not the overarching goal of ramping up deportations - the cracks show how seriously some conservatives are taking the administration's aggressive and at times slapdash methods.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "I Viewed the Rise of Barstool Conservatism With Alarm. And Rightly So.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nGuest Essay\n\nBy Matthew Walther\n\nMr. Walther is the editor of The Lamp, a Catholic literary journal, and a contributing Opinion writer.\n\nDespite Donald Trump's defeat in the 2020 presidential election, his political coalition was already expanding in consequential ways. Not only did he make notable gains among Hispanic and African American voters - gains that only increased this year - but he also attracted the support of a loose grouping of mostly young male voters, whom I described around that time as Barstool conservatives. This year, as I predicted, they appeared to swing hard for Mr. Trump.\n\n\"Barstool conservatism\" was a reference to the media company Barstool Sports and its founder, Dave Portnoy, who became a folk hero of sorts in 2020 after raising millions of dollars on behalf of bars and restaurants whose existence had been threatened by Covid lockdowns. Apart from Mr. Portnoy, Barstool conservatism's most representative figures today are the podcast host Joe Rogan, the retired N.F.L. punter turned ESPN personality Pat McAfee and various mixed martial arts fighters.\n\nBarstool conservatism is libertarian in the sense that it values autonomy and ambition but is not doctrinaire about it in a way that would be recognizable to, say, the editors of Reason magazine. It is a world of fantasy football podcasts, betting apps, diet trends (keto, paleo, carnivore) and more nebulous lifestyle questions about the nuances of alcohol and cannabis use. The outlook is culturally rather than socially conservative, skeptical of racial and gender politics for reasons that have more to do with the stridency of their proponents than with any deep-seated convictions about the issues themselves.\n\nAs a social conservative with an antipathy to libertarianism in all its forms, I viewed the rise of Barstool conservatism in 2020 with foreboding. And rightly so. This year Mr. Trump ran what was, in effect, a pro-choice campaign. He signaled support for legalized cannabis but not for a traditional conception of marriage. He might have selected JD Vance as his running mate, but otherwise he took social conservatives for granted. Barstool conservatives had the upper hand throughout the campaign, as underscored by the emphasis Mr. Trump's team placed on Mr. Rogan's endorsement.\n\nI have long been inclined to make certain hard and fast distinctions between Barstool conservatism and Trumpism of the sort that Mr. Vance represents, which I associate with opposition to abortion, pornography and cannabis and support for traditional families, shoring up the power of organized labor and protecting religious freedom. In theory these two conservative tendencies are diametrically opposed. Until recently I would have suggested that only Mr. Trump could unite them, by sheer force of personality.\n\nBut since this year's election, I have been on an informal listening tour of young men in the part of rural Michigan where I live, which is a nice way of saying that I have spent a lot of time talking to people in bars. What I heard from mechanics, waiters, high school teachers and others often surprised me. The future of American conservatism now strikes me as more complex and less ideologically predictable - and less dependent on Mr. Trump - than I had thought.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Why Conservatives Shouldn't Be Doomers\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSubscriber-only Newsletter\n\nBy Ross Douthat\n\nOpinion Columnist\n\nAlong with Donald Trump, a big winner in Thursday night's presidential debate was the distinguished historian Niall Ferguson, who recently stirred up a lot of debate with a column for The Free Press comparing contemporary America with the later stages of the Soviet Union.\n\nPart of that case was that our political system is governed by a gerontocracy that evokes the age of Leonid Brezhnev and Yuri Andropov. After watching Joe Biden's performance on the debate stage, I think Ferguson can claim that point as proven.\n\nHis essay folded the gerontocracy argument into a larger case that exemplifies what you might call conservative doomerism. In general there is more doomerism on the American left today than on the right - both more personal pessimism and more anxiety about various apocalypses, from climate change to Trumpian authoritarianism. But Ferguson eloquently expressed a kind of general pessimism that I hear fairly often from friends on the right, a fear that America is not just a decadent society but also a deteriorating one, that like the late U.S.S.R., we are a hollow empire with an unsustainable economic model, a common life shadowed by addiction and despair, and a public square policed by a left-wing nomenklatura committed to ideological fantasies and hostile to dissent.\n\nLike any good provocation, Ferguson's column inspired various critiques (here's Noah Smith , here's James Pethokoukis , here's Jonah Goldberg ) and various defenses (here's Ferguson responding to Goldberg, here's Helen Andrews arguing that he doesn't go far enough ).\n\nMy view is that Ferguson's analogy is useful if and only if you don't go all the way with it. That is, I think that comparisons with the decay of the U.S.S.R. can help us see key ways in which American life has gotten worse - but the claim that America in 2024 is actually a lot like the Soviet Union circa 1983 is entirely unpersuasive.\n\nBut rather than critique that kind of claim directly, I thought I'd respond to Ferguson's essay with a case for not being a right-of-center doomer, with an argument for why American conservatives, in particular, have some decent reasons for optimism about their preferred vision of the American future and certainly stronger reasons than \"Soviet America\" analogies would suggest.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "A Princeton Professor's Advice to Young Conservatives\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nGuest Essay\n\nBy Robert P. George\n\nDr. George is a legal scholar and a political philosopher. He is the McCormick professor of jurisprudence at Princeton University.\n\nAs a professor who is known to dissent from progressive ideologies that are dominant at universities such as Princeton, where I've taught for nearly 40 years, I'm frequently asked by students for advice about how to navigate a campus they worry will be hostile to them. Some are pro-Israel, or politically and socially conservative, or religiously observant.\n\nThey fear being treated unfairly by faculty members who are hostile to their beliefs. Many are afraid of being regarded as outcasts by their more liberal or progressive peers. They worry about being excluded from academic opportunities or not treated equitably in social or other extracurricular activities.\n\nTo these students I say, with regret: You're right to worry. I've seen these things happen.\n\nIn the past decade, for example, a student was removed from a leadership position on a sports team because some of her more liberal teammates accused her of expressing an opinion about policing that they disagreed with. A Black conservative student was expelled from an African American students' group chat after she participated in a pro-life event on campus. Several Jewish student journalists were subjected grossly unfairly to \"no communication\" or \"no contact\" orders that barred them from speaking with certain students after they reported on pro-Palestine protests.\n\nMy advice to students who fear that they will be subjected to discrimination and double standards is this: Don't hide and don't be silent. Exercise and, if necessary, defend your right to think for yourself and to dissent from campus orthodoxies.\n\nBut even as you push back against ideological bias and discrimination, remember that as a university student you are one of the luckiest - most privileged - people on the planet. So do not think of yourself as a victim. You can assert and defend your rights without building an identity around grievances, however justified those grievances may be.\n\nGrievance identitarianism - be it of the left or the right - impedes the very thing a student is attending university to do: namely, think and learn. It turns a person into a tribalist, someone who, rather than thinking for oneself, outsources one's thinking to the group.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Why U.S. Conservatives Should Fall in Love With France\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nRoss Douthat\n\nBy Ross Douthat\n\nOpinion Columnist\n\nThere is a certain tension in the way that American conservatism looks at Europe. On the one hand, Donald Trump and his allies insist that European countries need to step up, behave like serious world powers, and take on much more military responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, many American right-wingers display contempt for a continent they regard as impotent, decadent and basically doomed. And they have a special contempt for the current structure through which Europeans act in concert, the bureaucratized pseudo-confederacy (see, I'm expressing contempt myself) of the European Union.\n\nAs a consequence, American conservatives tend to sympathize with European parties of the further right, because they're ranged against the Eurocrat consensus. But these parties are often more inclined to retreat into nationalist self-preservation than to embrace concerted European action. So Europeans who recall that America has often been complicit in Europe's strategic emasculation (starting with Franklin Roosevelt's \"friendly\" push to take over from the British Empire) might reasonably suspect that when figures like Elon Musk boost parties like the Alternative for Germany, they are tacitly encouraging Europe to turn ever-more-inward and leave the global field to the U.S.A.\n\nThat means that for American conservatives who sincerely want a capable Europe, just supporting European populism is not enough. Instead, the American right should consciously support a stronger France. It should encourage a special relationship between the two republics, support French primacy on the continent, treat Paris rather than Brussels as the European capital and the French military as the keystone of Europe's security.\n\nIn effect, we should revisit Charles de Gaulle's bid to maintain more French independence within the Western alliance, which made him a thorn in the American side during the Cold War, and recognize that he was right. It was not actually in America's long-term interests to make Europe our full dependent, because vassaldom encourages weakness, and weakness reduces the value of the alliance in a world that America can no longer simply bestride alone.\n\nOf course it may be too late for a European escape from decadence: The goal of transitioning from a \"welfare state\" to a \"warfare state,\" as the Financial Times columnist Janan Ganesh put it , may be doomed by the expectations of an aging electorate.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Some are uprooting their lives to show that they mean it.\n\nFed up by what they see as an increasingly hostile and disordered secular culture, some Christian conservatives are moving to what they view as more welcoming states, regions and communities. Credit... Margaret Albaugh for The New York Times\n\nSupported by\n\nBy Ruth Graham\n\nRuth Graham, who covers religion for The Times, reported from Dallas and Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.\n\nThe Claremont Institute has been located in Southern California since its founding in the late 1970s. From its perch in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, it has become a leading intellectual center of the pro-Trump right .\n\nWithout fanfare, however, some of Claremont's key figures have been leaving California to find ideologically friendlier climes. Ryan P. Williams, the think tank's president, moved to a suburb in the Dallas-Fort Worth area in early April.\n\nHis friend and Claremont colleague Michael Anton - a California native who played a major role in 2016 to convince conservative intellectuals to vote for Mr. Trump - moved to the Dallas area two years ago. The institute's vice president for operations and administration has moved there, too. Others are following. Mr. Williams opened a small office in another Dallas-Fort Worth suburb in May, and said he expects to shrink Claremont's California headquarters.\n\n\"A lot of us share a sense that Christendom is unraveling,\" said Skyler Kressin, 38, who is friendly with the Claremont leaders and shares many of their concerns. He left Southern California to move to Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, in 2020. \"We need to be engaged, we need to be building.\"\n\nAs Mr. Trump barrels through his third presidential campaign, his supporters buoyed by last week's debate, many of the young activists and thinkers who have risen under his influence see themselves as part of a project that goes far beyond electoral politics. Rather, it is a movement to reclaim the values of Western civilization as they see it. Their ambitions paint a picture of the country they want should Mr. Trump return to the White House - one driven by their version of Christian values, with larger families and fewer immigrants. They foresee an aesthetic landscape to match, with more classical architecture and a revived conservative art movement and men wearing traditional suits.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "What Do Conservatives Fear About Critical Race Theory?\n\nOne of the first forays in a mounting conservative campaign to control the teaching of race was HB 3979, which was introduced in the Texas legislature this spring. The bill, which has become a model for state legislation across the country, proposed to elevate the teaching of \"founding documents\" in Texas schools, prevent teachers from supplementing approved books with other texts, and ban the teaching of the 1619 Project, which emphasizes the role of structural racism in American history. Its original sponsor was a staunch conservative named Brandon Creighton, who had previously introduced legislation that would have made it more difficult for local governments to remove Confederate monuments. But Creighton collapsed on the floor of the Texas Senate in early May, during a debate over a bill he supported to let Texans carry concealed weapons without a permit, and did not return to work when HB 3979 came to the Senate floor, on May 21st, so the task of presenting the bill fell to a bearded Republican named Bryan Hughes, whose genial manner lent a John Grisham-like courtliness to a tense debate. \"You're a very respectful individual,\" the Democratic state senator José Menéndez said, eyeing Hughes. Hughes quickly replied, \"You certainly are, too. Thank you.\"\n\nSince the January 6th insurrection , Republicans on the national level have been a little low on talking points and shock material. That is not the case in state legislatures and on cable television, where conservatives have been vigorously denouncing the influence of critical race theory, a scholarly movement ascendent during the nineties, the adherents of which argue that white supremacy is encoded in law and in the structure of American institutions. These conservatives have noticed that concepts used in critical race theory-\"structural racism,\" \"internalized white supremacy\"-have entered the mainstream, and in some cases have become part of corporate training or public-school education. A center-right policy journal has reported that third-grade students in Cupertino, California, are being asked to rank themselves according to their power and privilege, and that white male executives at Lockheed Martin, of all places, were asked to examine their racial and gender privileges. Like in Texas, conservatives in nearly a dozen other state legislatures have introduced bills with very similar language, with the apparent goal of keeping the idea of enduring structural racism as far from schools as possible.\n\nIn the Texas legislature on May 21st, Hughes presented as a case study a picture book called \" Not My Idea: A Book About Whiteness ,\" in which a white child, prompted by TV-news coverage of a police shooting, goes to the library stacks to find out about racial history. \"Whiteness is a bad deal. It always was,\" the child eventually concludes. The book, which was said to have been recommended by teachers in the Highland Park Independent School District, in Dallas, was held up by the bill's supporters as proof that the legislation was necessary. \"It's horrible, horrible,\" Hughes said. But, beneath the bluster, he seemed to be conceding quite a lot. Hughes opened his presentation by saying that he wanted to be direct about the American experience, and that, as glistening as the ideals in the founding documents had been, they had applied at first only to \"white property-owning males.\" However much those rights had since expanded, some Texans continued to experience unfairness that was \"much worse and more invidious\" than for others, he said, \"and there's no getting around that.\"\n\nRepublicans hold a small advantage in the Texas Senate, so the bill's passage was always likely, but for more than four hours Hughes moved patiently around the Senate floor, taking questions. The Democratic state senators, a majority of whom are Hispanic or Black, asked pointed questions about whether there was really any public demand for this legislation, and also more searching ones, about what would be accomplished by deëmphasizing the cruel and unjust elements of the American experience. The bill, Hughes kept insisting, would not ask teachers to change how they taught the past-it wouldn't affect lessons on slavery. It was only seeking teacher neutrality when it came to current events. The Democrats seemed basically to distrust this distinction. Royce West, one of the most prominent Black politicians in the state, rose to point out that Hughes's beloved founding documents had been chosen entirely by white legislators-\"no input from us.\" West asked Hughes if he believed that the ideals of the founding documents were often betrayed. \"Lincoln said that,\" Hughes jumped in. \"He said we're hypocrites.\" West asked Hughes to define white supremacy. Hughes answered that it was the belief that one race is superior to others. \"Many people believe that,\" Hughes said. \"Of course, they're wrong. But, many people believe that.\" West asked whether acts of racism still occurred. \"Of course, it happens,\" Hughes said. \"Of course, it does.\"\n\nThe bill passed the Texas Senate 18-13, over the objections of the Texas A.F.T. And, although the Senate debate had for many liberals emphasized the conservative challenge to free speech, it wasn't immediately obvious how the new law would affect the work of Texas teachers. August Plock, who teaches eleventh-grade U.S. history in the public schools in Pflugerville, outside of Austin, told me that, in the existing Texas curriculum, \"we do a poor job of including minorities in teaching history,\" Latinos especially. \"We cover Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta, and that's about it.\" There is nothing on the Zoot Suit Riots, he said, and little on the enduring struggles over immigration. But the bill, which requires teachers not to give special \"deference\" to any one side, seemed to Plock to be relatively easy to manage. In each of his classes, he said, a handful of students are deeply engaged in the material, and it doesn't take much to draw out more critical perspectives. Plock said, of the conservative legislators, \"They want to get out there thinking that these damn liberal schoolteachers are teaching stuff they disagree with. I'm sitting here looking at it and thinking, It really doesn't impact me as a teacher, per se, because I teach [the Texas state curriculum].\"\n\nOne reason might be that the emphasis in the text of the bills, in Texas and in other states, is often on insuring that white students not be made to feel racist, and that conservative ones not be made to feel isolated by their views. In Texas's bill, after three short sections establishing that students can't be required to receive academic credit by working for organizations also involved in lobbying, and that teachers can't be required to attend training sessions that attribute \"blame on the basis of race or sex,\" there is a very long and telling section, which is present also in bills in other states. It prohibits teachers and administrators from suggesting that \"an individual's moral character, standing, or worth is necessarily determined by the individual's race or sex.\" It insists that no individual student should \"feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress on account of the individual's race or sex.\" It bans any teaching that \"meritocracy or traits such as a hard work ethic are racist or sexist.\"\n\nIn Texas, the news coverage of the bill-which the Republican governor, Greg Abbott, is expected to sign-has focussed on the idea that it will \"ban critical race theory,\" as one local news station put it. But the term \"critical race theory\" does not appear in the text. What it seeks to do, on closer reading, is establish a protective halo around white students, so that they do not hear that their success might have something to do with their race, or that the structures of racial power and privilege in the past also apply to the present. The bill doesn't rewrite history in the way that the campaigns to protect Confederate memorialization have sometimes sought to. Instead, it tries to cleave off students from any feeling of historical responsibility-as if, with each generation, America were re-created, blameless and anew.\n\nThis notion-that a generation can arise purely in the context of its own experience rather than that of its parents or generations before them-recurs often in American politics, and especially right now. Increasingly, conservatism after Donald Trump has been defined by a fear that American society is on the verge of being displaced by a progressive reimagining, with woke politics and aggressive redistribution. Progressivism is defined by an equally urgent hope that it can, in fact, displace old patterns of ecological destruction and discrimination. It is interesting-and slightly ironic-that critical race theory, with its invocations of structural racism, should be so central to the policy debate right now: part of its teaching is that the patterns of American society can't be easily dislodged by a change in manners, and that if you are snapping your fingers to make the past disappear you are only doing so in tandem with the rhythms of the past.\n\nThat is reason to think that the conflict over critical race theory might endure, even when the attention of Fox News inevitably drifts. The question of what children are held responsible for cuts deep, and the answer isn't always determined by a person's ideology or partisan identity. When I spoke with Terry Stoops, a conservative education-policy expert at the John Locke Foundation who had been appointed to a task force on \"indoctrination\" in public schools by the conservative lieutenant governor of North Carolina, he told me that he wasn't sure how long the outrage of some grassroots conservatives would ultimately last. But he did think their anger had been misunderstood. \"I've seen so much discussion about the fact that conservatives are advancing these critical-race-theory bills because they don't want the truth of slavery or racism to be taught, and I haven't seen that at all. I think parents want their children to learn about the mistakes of the past in order to create a better future,\" Stoops said. \"They don't want their children to be told that they are responsible for the mistakes of their ancestors, and that unless they repent for those mistakes then they will remain complicit.\" The debate isn't about history, exactly. It is about the possibility of blamelessness.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "What Have Fourteen Years of Conservative Rule Done to Britain?\n\nMy life divides, evenly enough, into three political eras. I was born in 1980, a year after Margaret Thatcher entered Downing Street with the prayer of St. Francis of Assisi on her lips: \"Where there is doubt, may we bring faith. And where there is despair, may we bring hope.\" The Conservative-run Britain of the eighties was not harmonious. Life beyond the North London square where my family lived often seemed to be in the grip of one confrontation or another. The news was always showing police on horseback. There were strikes, protests, the I.R.A., and George Michael on the radio. My father, who was a lawyer in the City, travelled to Germany to buy a Mercedes and drove it back, elated. Until Thatcher resigned, when I was ten, her steeply back-combed hair and deep, impossible voice played an outsized role in my imagination-a more interesting, more dangerous version of the Queen.\n\nI was nearly seventeen when the Tories finally lost power, to Tony Blair and \"New Labour,\" an updated, market-friendly version of the Party. Before he moved to Downing Street, Blair lived in Islington, the gentrifying borough I was from. Boris Johnson, an amusing right-wing columnist, who was getting his start on television, also lived nearby. Our local Member of Parliament was an out-of-touch leftist named Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nNew Labour believed in the responsibility of the state to look after its citizens, and in capitalism to make them prosper. Blair was convincing, even when he was wrong. He won three general elections in ten years and walked out of the House of Commons to a standing ovation, undefeated in his eyes. I was turning thirty when Labour eventually ran out of road, undone by the Iraq War, the global financial crisis, and the grim temper of Gordon Brown, Blair's successor. He was caught in a hot-mike moment describing an ordinary voter, who was complaining about taxes and immigration, as a bigot.\n\nSince then, it's been the Conservatives again. In 2010, the Party returned to government in a coalition with the Liberal Democrats. Since 2015, it has held power alone. Last May, the Tories surpassed the thirteen years and nine days that New Labour had held office. But the third political era of my lifetime has been nothing like the previous two. There has been no dominant figure or overt political project, no Thatcherism, no Blairism. Instead, there has been a quickening, lowering churn: five Prime Ministers, three general elections, two financial emergencies, a once-in-a-century constitutional crisis, and an atmosphere of tired, almost constant drama.\n\nThe period is bisected by the United Kingdom's decision, in 2016, to leave the European Union, a Conservative fantasy, or nightmare, depending on whom you talk to. Brexit catalyzed some of the worst tendencies in British politics-its superficiality, nostalgia, and love of game play-and exhausted the country's political class, leaving it ill prepared for the pandemic and the twin economic shocks of the war in Ukraine and the forty-nine-day experimental premiership of Liz Truss. Covering British politics during this period has been like trying to remember, and explain, a very convoluted and ultimately boring dream. If you really concentrate, you can recall a lot of the details, but that doesn't lead you closer to any meaning.\n\nLast year, I started interviewing Conservatives to try to make sense of these years. \"One always starts with disclaimers now-I didn't start this car crash,\" Julian Glover, a former speechwriter for David Cameron, the longest-serving Prime Minister of the period, told me. I spoke to M.P.s and former Cabinet ministers; political advisers who helped to make major decisions; and civil servants, local-government officials, and frontline workers hundreds of miles from London who had to deal with the consequences.\n\nSome people insisted that the past decade and a half of British politics resists satisfying explanation. The only way to think about it is as a psychodrama enacted, for the most part, by a small group of middle-aged men who went to élite private schools, studied at the University of Oxford, and have been climbing and chucking one another off the ladder of British public life-the cursus honorum , as Johnson once called it-ever since. The Conservative Party, whose history goes back some three hundred and fifty years, aids this theory by not having anything as vulgar as an ideology. \"They're not on a mission to do X, Y, or Z,\" as a former senior adviser explained. \"You win and you govern because we are better at it, right?\"\n\nAnother way to think about these years is to consider them in psychological, or theoretical, terms. In \"Heroic Failure,\" the Irish journalist Fintan O'Toole explains Brexit by describing Britain's fall from imperial nation to \"occupied colony\" of the E.U., and the rise of a powerful English nationalism as a result. Last year, Abby Innes, a scholar at the London School of Economics, published \"Late Soviet Britain: Why Materialist Utopias Fail,\" which argues that, since Thatcher, Britain's political mainstream has become as devoted to particular ideas about running the state-a default commitment to competition, markets, and forms of privatization-as Brezhnev's U.S.S.R. ever was. \"The resulting regime,\" Innes writes, \"has proved anything but stable.\"\n\nThese observations are surely right, but I worry that they obscure two basic truths about Britain's experience since 2010. The first is that the country has suffered grievously. These have been years of loss and waste. The U.K. has yet to recover from the financial crisis that began in 2008. According to one estimate, the average worker is now fourteen thousand pounds worse off per year than if earnings had continued to rise at pre-crisis rates-it is the worst period for wage growth since the Napoleonic Wars. \"Nobody who's alive and working in the British economy today has ever seen anything like this,\" Torsten Bell, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, which published the analysis, told the BBC last year. \"This is what failure looks like.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nHigh levels of employment and immigration, coupled with the enduring dynamism of London, mask a national reality of low pay, precarious jobs, and chronic underinvestment. The trains are late. The traffic is bad. The housing market is a joke. \"The core problem is easy to observe, but it's tough to live with,\" Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, told me. \"It's just not that productive an economy anymore.\"\n\nWith stagnant wages, people's living standards have fallen. In 2008, Brown's Labour government commissioned Michael Marmot, a renowned epidemiologist, to come up with ways to reduce England's health inequalities. Marmot made suggestions in six policy areas, including better access to child care, walking and cycling programs, social-security reforms, and measures to improve people's sense of agency at work. In 2010, he presented his ideas to the incoming Conservative-led coalition, which accepted his findings. \"I thought, Wow, this is great. . . . I was pretty bullish about the whole thing,\" Marmot told me. \"The problem was they then didn't do it.\"\n\nTen years later, Marmot led a follow-up study , in which he documented stalling life expectancy, particularly among women in England's poorest communities-and widening inequalities. \"For men and women everywhere the time spent in poor health is increasing,\" he wrote. \"This is shocking.\" According to Marmot, the U.K.'s health performance since 2010, which includes rising infant mortality, slowing growth in children, and the return of rickets, makes it an outlier among comparable European nations. \"The damage to the nation's health need not have happened,\" Marmot concluded in 2020. He told me, \"It was a political choice.\"\n\nAnd that is the second, all too obvious, fact of British life throughout this period: a single party has been responsible. You cannot say that the country has been ruled against its will. Since 2010, the Tories have emerged as the winner of the popular vote and as the largest party in Parliament in three elections. In December, 2019, Boris Johnson won an eighty-seat majority in the House of Commons, the Conservatives' biggest electoral success since the heyday of Thatcherism.\n\nHow is this possible? The opposition has been underwhelming. For years, Labour drifted and squabbled under two unconvincing leaders: Ed Miliband and Corbyn, my old Islington M.P. It is telling that, since Labour elected Keir Starmer, an unimaginative former prosecutor with a rigidly centrist program, the Party is competitive again. But the Conservatives have not survived by default. Their party has excelled at diminishing Britain's political landscape and shrinking the sense of what is possible. It has governed and skirmished, never settling for long. \"It's all about constantly drawing dividing lines,\" a former Party strategist told me. \"That's all you need. It's not about big ideological debates or policies or anything.\" In many ways, the two momentous decisions of this period-what came to be known as austerity and Brexit-are now widely accepted as events that happened, rather than as choices that were made. Starmer's Labour Party does not seek to reverse them.\n\nIf you live in an old country, it can be easy to succumb to a narrative of decline. The state withers. The charlatans take over. You give up on progress, to some extent, and simply pray that this particular chapter of British nonsense will come to an end. It will. Rishi Sunak, the fifth, and presumably final, Conservative Prime Minister of the era, faces an election later this year, which he will almost certainly lose. But Britain cannot move on from the Tories without properly facing up to the harm that they have caused.\n\nThe Conservative Party manifesto for the 2010 election was a plain blue hardback book titled \" Invitation to Join the British Government .\" After the Party's longest spell out of power in more than a century, its pitch to voters was \"the Big Society,\" a call for civic volunteering and private enterprise after the statism of Labour. \"There was a feeling that it must be possible to be positive about a better future in a way that wasn't socialist,\" Glover, the former speechwriter, said. \"And that wasn't an ignoble thing to try.\"\n\nBeginning in 2005, Cameron and George Osborne, the shadow Chancellor, had modernized the Tories. The duo represented a new generation of Conservatives: deft and urbane, easy in their privilege. Osborne was the heir to a baronetcy; Cameron's family descended from a mistress of William IV. Cameron embraced centrist causes, including the environment and prison reform. There was talk of a \"post-bureaucratic age.\" But the main aim was simpler. \"Above all, it was trying to win,\" Osborne told me recently.\n\nIn the spring of 2009, Cameron told a gathering of Party members in Gloucestershire, \"The age of irresponsibility is giving way to the age of austerity.\" The speech was part of a successful campaign to associate Labour's public spending with the global financial crash, to which Britain had been badly exposed. \"The word 'austerity' was deliberately introduced into the lexicon by myself and David Cameron,\" Osborne said. \"Austerity\" evoked the country's sober rebuilding after the Second World War. \"The word didn't have the connotations then that it does now,\" Osborne recalled. \"It was, you know, a bit like prudence.\"\n\nIn 2010, the Conservatives fell short of a majority in the House of Commons and formed, with the Liberal Democrats, Britain's first coalition government in almost seventy years. The state was running a deficit of a hundred and fifty-seven billion pounds-about one and a half times the budget of the National Health Service. Any incoming administration would have had to find ways to balance the books, but, under Cameron and Osborne's leadership, austerity was a moral as well as an economic mission. \"We allowed it to become the defining thing,\" the former senior adviser reflected.\n\n\"Austerity\" is now a contested term. Plenty of Conservatives question whether it really happened. So it is worth being clear: between 2010 and 2019, British public spending fell from about forty-one per cent of G.D.P. to thirty-five per cent. The Office of Budget Responsibility, the equivalent of the American Congressional Budget Office, describes what came to be known as Plan A as \"one of the biggest deficit reduction programmes seen in any advanced economy since World War II.\" Governments across Europe pursued fiscal consolidation, but the British version was distinct for its emphasis on shrinking the state rather than raising taxes.\n\nLike the choice of the word itself, austerity was politically calculated. Huge areas of public spending-on the N.H.S. and education-were nominally maintained. Pensions and international aid became more generous, to show that British compassion was not dead. But protecting some parts of the state meant sacrificing the rest: the courts, the prisons, police budgets, wildlife departments, rural buses, care for the elderly, youth programs, road maintenance, public health, the diplomatic corps.\n\nPlan A spooked economists because of the risk to economic growth. But, in 2013, the British economy grew by 1.8 per cent. The government claimed victory. Around that time, Osborne declared that the nation could win \"the global race\" and become the richest major economy in the world by 2030. \"We were in complete command of the political landscape,\" he recalled. \"The U.K. is the country that is seen to have got its act together after the crash. London has become the kind of global capital. So it has worked-there's a bit of a dénouement coming-but it had worked.\" At the general election in 2015, the Conservatives won a majority in the House of Commons, with proposals to make a further thirty-seven billion pounds' worth of cuts.\n\n\"It was devastatingly politically effective,\" Osborne told me, of austerity. It's just that the effects were so horrendous. Between 2010 and 2018, funding for police forces in England fell by up to a quarter. Officers stopped investigating burglaries. Only four per cent now end in prosecution. In 2021, the median time between a rape offense and the completion of a trial reached more than two and a half years. Last fall, hundreds of school buildings had to be closed for emergency repairs, because the country's school-construction budget had been cut by forty-six per cent between 2009 and 2022.\n\nIn October, I talked with Tony Durcan, a retired local-government employee who was responsible for libraries and other cultural programs in the city of Newcastle during the twenty-tens. Durcan told me that he'd had \"a good war,\" all things considered. There were moments, he said, when the sheer extremity of the crisis was exciting. Between 2010 and 2020, central-government funding for local authorities fell by forty per cent. At one point, it looked as if sixteen of Newcastle's eighteen libraries would close. The city's parks budget was cut by ninety-one per cent. The situation forced some creative reforms: Newcastle City Library now hosts the Citizens Advice bureau, where residents can apply for benefits and seek other forms of financial guidance. (The library is featured in \"I, Daniel Blake,\" Ken Loach's anti-austerity film of 2016.) But other parts of the city government fell apart. \"Youth services and a lot of community-support services, they just disappeared completely,\" Durcan said. Child poverty rose sharply. (About forty per cent of children in Newcastle currently live below the poverty line.) But after a while Durcan and his colleagues stopped talking about the cuts, even though their budgets continued to fall. \"There was a view-was it helpful? Were you risking losing confidence in the city?\"\n\nOver time, Durcan came to question the official reasoning for the savings. \"You can make a mistake, even when you're acting for the best,\" he explained. \"I don't think that's what happened in austerity.\" Newcastle was a Labour stronghold, as was the rest of the northeast. Until 2019, the Tories held only three out of twenty-nine parliamentary seats in the region. A similar pattern was repeated across England. Poorer communities, particularly in urban areas, which tended to vote Labour, suffered disproportionately.\n\nIn Liverpool, where the Conservatives have not won a Parliamentary seat for forty years, spending, per head, fell more than in any other city in the country. Public-health spending in Blackpool, one of the poorest local authorities in England, was cut almost five times more, per person, than in the affluent county of Surrey, just south of London, whose eleven M.P.s are all Tories. Durcan and his colleagues noted the discrepancies between Labour- and Conservative-supporting regions. \"And so there was cynicism,\" he said, \"and also great disappointment, a sense of injustice.\"\n\nOsborne denies that austerity was ever targeted in this way. \"It's not like we ministers just sit there and go, We're not going to cut Kensington Council. We're going to cut Liverpool Council. That is a lampoonish way of thinking about British politics,\" he said. But some of his colleagues were more willing to acknowledge that electoral thinking was at play. One former Cabinet minister conceded that there were \"big strategic moves\" to favor older voters, who were more likely to vote Conservative, in the form of pension increases and interventions to raise property prices. David Gauke, a Treasury minister from 2010 to 2017, agreed that the parts of the country that had benefitted most under Labour had seen their budgets cut under the Conservatives. \"There was a rebalancing that went on,\" he said. \"Did it go too far? Maybe it did.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nWhat was less forgivable, in the end, was the cuts' unthinking nature, their lack of reason. In the fall of 2013, a staffer named Giles Wilkes, who worked for a senior Liberal Democrat minister in the coalition, became alarmed by projections that showed ever-reducing government budgets. \"I don't wish to paint the picture of the British state as too chaotic and heedless and amateur. But I was wandering around in 2013 and 2014, saying to people, Does anyone know what this means for the Home Office or the court system, for local authorities and the social-care budget?\" Wilkes said. \"Nobody was curious .\" Wilkes is now a fellow at the Institute for Government, a nonpartisan think tank. \"It was very obvious in real time,\" he told me. \"There wasn't a central function going, Hold on a mo. Have we made sure that we can provide a decent prison estate, a decent sort of police system?\"\n\nAnd so stupid things happened. Since 2010, forty-three per cent of the courts in England and Wales have closed. No one thinks that this was a good idea. For years, the Conservatives cut prison funding and staffing while encouraging longer jail times. \"You kind of had a mismatch,\" Gauke, who later served as the Justice Secretary, admitted. The number of adults sentenced to more than ten years in prison more than doubled-until the system caved in, overrun by violence, self-harm, drug use, and staff shortages. In 2023, the government activated what it called Operation Safeguard, in which hundreds of jail cells in police stations were requisitioned to hold convicted offenders, because the prisons were full. In September, a terrorism suspect escaped from Wandsworth Prison, in South London, by clinging to the underside of a food-delivery truck. Eighty of the prison's two hundred and five officers had not shown up for work that day.\n\nThe long-term effects of austerity are still playing out. A 2019 paper by Thiemo Fetzer, an economist at the University of Warwick, asked, \"Did Austerity Cause Brexit?\" Fetzer found that, beginning in 2010, the parts of the country most affected by welfare cuts were more likely to support Nigel Farage's U.K. Independence Party, which campaigned against immigration and the E.U. The withdrawal of the social safety net in communities already negatively hit by globalization exacerbated the sense of a nation going awry. Public-health experts, including Marmot, argue that a decade of frozen health-care spending undermined the country's response to the pandemic. More broadly, austerity has contributed to an atmosphere of fatalism, an aversion to thinking about the future. \"It is a mood,\" Johnna Montgomerie, a professor at the University of British Columbia who studies debt and inequality, has written. \"A depression, a chronic case of financial melancholia.\"\n\nSince leaving politics, in 2017, Osborne has enjoyed a lucrative career, serving simultaneously as an adviser at BlackRock, the asset-management firm, and as the editor of the Evening Standard newspaper; more recently, he has been a partner at an investment bank and a podcaster. He insists that the cuts, ultimately, enabled the U.K.'s public finances to withstand the pandemic and the energy crisis that followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine. \"There's no counterfactual,\" he told me. Osborne likes to accuse his critics of living in a parallel reality, in which the financial crisis and Britain's deficit never existed: \"It's, like, Apart from the assassination, Mrs. Lincoln, did you enjoy the play?\"\n\nBut that does not mean the Tories made good choices. British social-security payments are at their lowest levels, relative to wages, in half a century. Under a steady downward ratchet, started by Osborne and continued by his successors, household payments have been capped and income thresholds effectively lowered. In 2017, a \"two child\" limit was placed on benefits for poor families. In November, 2018, Philip Alston, the U.N.'s special rapporteur on extreme poverty, toured the U.K. When we spoke, he recalled a strong sense of denial, or ignorance, among British politicians about the consequences of their decisions. \"There was a disconnect between the world and what senior ministers wanted to believe,\" he said.\n\nThe fall in Britain's living standards isn't easy for anyone to talk about, least of all Conservatives. The Resolution Foundation, which studies the lives of people with low and middle incomes, is chaired by David Willetts, a former minister in Cameron's government. Willetts is a tall, genial man, who worked for Margaret Thatcher's policy unit in the eighties. His nickname in the Party was Two Brains. \"What I say to Tories now is, Look, we are behind for various reasons,\" Willetts said, carefully. \"You can argue about it. But our household incomes are clearly lower than France or Germany or the Netherlands.\" Part of the problem, Willetts explained, was that Britain's richest twenty per cent had largely been spared the effects of the past fourteen years-and that made it genuinely difficult for them to comprehend the damage. \"We are all O.K.,\" he said. \"The burden of adjustment has almost entirely been borne by the less affluent half of the British population.\"\n\nIn late November, I took a train to Worcester, a cathedral city south of Birmingham, on the River Severn. It was a raw, washed-out morning. Floodwater shone in the meadows. The city is famous as the home of Lea & Perrins Worcestershire sauce-a dark, sweet yet sour, almost indescribably English condiment, first sold by a pair of chemists in 1837-which has been doused on two centuries' worth of shepherd's pie and other stodgy lunches. Worcester used to be a den of political corruption: in 1906, men willing to sell their votes to the Tories could collect payment in the rest rooms of the Duke of York, a pub in the middle of town. More recently, it has been a bellwether. In the nineties, Conservative strategists described \"Worcester Woman,\" a median female voter-politically aware, married, with two children. (Since 1979, the city's M.P.s have belonged to the party in power.) I was on my way to Citizens Advice Worcester-part of a charitable network that offers free counselling on debt relief and legal matters-behind a restored Victorian hotel.\n\nShakira was playing on the radio in the reception and a sign read \"If You Are Frightened of Your Partner, Call Us.\" Geraint Thomas, a Welsh lawyer who runs the center, was in his office, worrying about a heating bill. A few years ago, it was some four thousand pounds a year, but after recent price hikes it was now about fourteen thousand. In 2017, the charity had started running services in Herefordshire as well. Now funding was tight, and various Covid emergency funds were coming to an end. \"Next year, we have got a bit of a hole,\" Thomas said. The clock on his wall had stopped.\n\nSince 2019, the number of people seeking help at the center had risen by thirty per cent. Two years of high inflation and rising interest rates meant that the caseworkers were now seeing homeowners and people working two jobs, along with the unemployed and families on benefits. \"It's like a black hole, dragging more and more people in,\" Colin Stuart, who manages volunteers, said. Anne Limbert, who oversees the advice team, explained that, until a few years ago, it was usually possible to make a recovery plan for clients. \"It used to be that we could help people, you know, and make a difference,\" she said. \"Now it's just kind of depressing.\" Increasingly, Limbert was sending clients to food banks.\n\nThe caseworkers said that they had mostly tuned out politics. Gwen Fraser, a volunteer manager in Herefordshire, which has some of England's most deprived rural communities, had met a visiting M.P. a few months earlier. \"I thought, You're not in the real world, mate,\" she said. Not long ago, a seventy-seven-year-old man, behind on his mortgage, had told Fraser that he was suicidal. The proportion of people coming to the center with a long-term health condition had risen by twenty per cent since 2019. (N.H.S. prescriptions for antidepressants in England almost doubled between 2011 and 2023.) Fraser had recently settled on a phrase that she found useful in her paperwork: \"Overwhelming distress.\"\n\nWorcester Woman voted for Brexit. In 2016, the city chose to leave the European Union by a margin of fifty-four per cent to forty-six per cent. The perception of the Brexit vote as a cry of anguish from deindustrialized northern towns or from faded seaside resorts isn't wrong-it just leaves out the rest of England. Two weeks after the referendum, Danny Dorling, a geography professor at the University of Oxford, published an article in the British Medical Journal showing that Leave voters weren't defined neatly either by geography or by income. Fifty-nine per cent identified as middle class, and most lived in the South. \"People wouldn't believe me for years,\" Dorling told me. \"This was Hampshire voted to leave.\"\n\nDorling's politics are on the left. He opposed Brexit and often describes Britain as a failing state. During the summer of 2018, Dorling gave dozens of public talks across the country reflecting on the referendum. He noticed that places that had voted Remain invariably had better rail connections than those that voted Leave. A lot of Brexit supporters were older and economically secure but had a keen sense of the country going downhill. \"Something was falling apart,\" Dorling said. \"They had got a house in their twenties. They'd had full employment. Their children were in their forties and they might be renting. . . . It was an almost entirely unselfish vote by the old for their grandchildren-let's try it, or let's at least show we're angry.\"\n\nHow you interpret the Brexit vote informs, to a great extent, how you make sense of the past fourteen years of British politics. It is not just a watershed-a before and after. It is also a prism that clarifies or scrambles the picture entirely. One perspective sees the whole saga as a woeful mistake. In this view, Cameron decided to settle, once and for all, an internal Tory argument about Britain's place in an integrating E.U., a question that had haunted the Party since the last days of Thatcher. In the process, he turned what was an abstruse obsession on the right wing of British politics into a much simpler, terrifyingly binary choice for the population on how they felt their life was going.\n\nIn the accident theory of Brexit, leaving the E.U. has turned out to be a puncture rather than a catastrophe: a falloff in trade; a return of forgotten bureaucracy with our near neighbors; an exodus of financial jobs from London; a misalignment in the world. \"There is a sort of problem for the British state, including Labour as well as all these Tory governments since 2016, which is that they are having to live a lie,\" as Osborne, who voted Remain, said. \"It's a bit like tractor-production figures in the Soviet Union. You have to sort of pretend that this thing is working, and everyone in the system knows it isn't.\"\n\nThe other view sees Brexit as an unfinished revolution. Regardless of its origins, the vote in 2016 was a repudiation of how Britain had been governed for a generation or more. In the B . M . J . article, Dorling observed that younger voters-who chose overwhelmingly to remain in the E.U.-were angry with their elders. \"They will feel newly betrayed . . . but their real betrayal has been a long time in the making,\" he wrote. For a highly centralized country that is smaller than Wyoming, the U.K. is lopsided beyond belief. It contains regional inequalities greater than those between the east and the west of Germany, or the north and the south of Italy-inequalities that have been allowed by successive governments to grow to shameful extremes. On average, people in Nottingham earn about a quarter of what people make in Kensington and Chelsea, in West London, which is some two hours away by train.\n\nDuring the Brexit campaign, the E.U. came to represent not just a supranational monolith across the English Channel but profound distances within the U.K. itself. And the politicians who defended the E.U. looked and sounded, for the most part, as if they spent more time in Tuscany each summer than they had spent on Teesside in their lives. \"The kind of globalism, the internationalism, the liberal élite view, was seized on by people who thought that they'd been spoken down to for decades,\" John Hayes, a Tory M.P. and a Brexiteer, told me. \"And the more they wheeled out the establishment figures, the more it was, Yeah, that's them. Those are the ones who don't get it. They don't understand us.\"\n\nAlmost eight years after the vote, what stays with me is how unimagined Brexit was. Overnight, and against the will of its leaders, the country abandoned its economic model-as the Anglo-Saxon gateway to the world's largest trading bloc-and replaced it with nothing at all. \"I can't think of another occasion when a party has so radically changed direction while in office,\" Willetts said. Thatcher was an architect of the E.U.'s single market, which in time became a heresy.\n\nYou can marvel at the recklessness of Brexiteers such as Farage, or of Johnson, who spearheaded the Vote Leave campaign. (\"He is not a Brexiteer,\" Osborne said. \"I really would go to my grave saying, deep down, Boris Johnson did not want to leave the E.U.\") But the real dereliction ran deeper. Sensible Britain failed. The Civil Service did not plan for Brexit. Ivan Rogers was the U.K.'s permanent representative to the E.U. from 2013 to 2017. He started warning about the likelihood of Brexit about five years before the vote. \"It was difficult to get the attention of the system,\" he said. Beyond a briefing paper, demanded by the House of Lords, there was only some \"confidential thinking,\" in the words of Jeremy Heywood, the former head of the Civil Service. (Heywood died in 2018.) \"The mandarins have a lot to answer for on this,\" Rogers said. \"We were very badly prepared in 2016.\"\n\n\"I didn't think it was very wise,\" Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, said, of the official refusal to consider the referendum going wrong. \"We did a ton of planning.\" After the vote, the Bank stabilized the markets while British politics imploded. Cameron resigned and was replaced by Theresa May, a former Home Secretary with limited experience of the economy or of international affairs. In the second half of 2016, May worked with a small group of advisers to formulate a Brexit strategy that ultimately satisfied nobody. \"It was incredibly poor statecraft,\" a former Cabinet colleague said. \"Absolute shit. Abominable.\" The abiding image of the Brexit talks was a photo of Michel Barnier, the E.U.'s chief negotiator, with his colleagues and their neat piles of paper on one side of a table, while their British counterparts, led by David Davis, a bluff former special-forces reservist, sat on the other side with a single note among them.\n\nOne Friday lunchtime, a couple of months ago, I met Dominic Cummings at a pub not far from his house in London. A light snow was in the air. Cummings, who is fifty-two, worked on education policy in the coalition government before becoming the campaign director of Vote Leave. (He coined its notorious slogan, \"Take Back Control.\") Cummings is a Savonarola figure in British politics, an ascetic and a technocrat, who wants to save the state by burning it down. He refers to Elon Musk by his first name and writes Substack essays with titles such as \"On Complexity, 'fog and moonlight,' prediction, and politics VII: why social science is so bad at prediction & what is to be done.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nCummings reveres the Apollo space program and takes a dim view of almost all Britain's elected officials. \"Where they are not malicious they are moronic,\" he told me once. He talks rapidly, with a slight Northern rasp. (He is from Durham, near Newcastle.) Next to our table in the pub, a woodstove emitted a sudden, enveloping cloud of smoke, which dissipated while we talked. Cummings appeared to be wearing two hats, against the cold. He apologized if it seemed as if he were staring at me. He had recently undergone retinal surgery.\n\nCummings, unsurprisingly, saw Brexit in revolutionary terms-as a chance to break with the country's ruling orthodoxy. \"The Vote Leave campaign was not of the Tory Party,\" he said. \"It was not a conservative-big 'C' or little 'c'-effort. But none of them wanted to confront the reasons why we did it in the first place. . . . For us, this was an attempt to wrench us off the Cameron, establishment, Blairite line.\" Cummings believes that Britain must rediscover its ability to build things-roads, railways, houses, research institutes, products that people want to buy-in order to prosper again. He argues that it is America's ecosystem of universities, entrepreneurs, and government procurement departments that have helped maintain its economic and technological edge, not just lower taxes or a freer form of capitalism. \"When you start talking about this to Tories, they go, Oh, Dominic, you sound like a terrible central planner,\" Cummings said. \"And you go, That's America. This is not weird left-wing shit.\"\n\nNo one would accuse Cummings of having a popular platform. His jam is A.I. and Nietzsche. But, after the Brexit vote, he kept waiting for May's government to act on what was, to him, its obvious implications: to restrict immigration, reform the state, and explore dramatic economic policies, in order to diverge from the E.U. and to boost the country's productivity. \"I kept thinking, month after month, God, like, it's weird the way they are just thrashing around and not facing it,\" Cummings said. In his view, the election of Trump, that November, provided a perfect excuse for Remainers not to take the Brexit vote seriously. \"They just lumped it all in with, Oh, it's a global tide of populism. It's mad, irrational, evil. It's partly funded by Putin,\" he said. \"They didn't have to reëvaluate and go, Maybe the establishment in general has been, like, fucking up for twenty-plus years. \"\n\nIn July, 2019, May resigned as Prime Minister and was replaced by Johnson, who hired Cummings as a senior adviser. Cummings thought that Johnson would probably screw it up. At the same time, he saw an opportunity to advance what he considered the true Vote Leave agenda. \"In some sense,\" he said, \"the risk was worth taking.\"\n\nThat fall was the most kinetic, breathtaking period of Britain's fourteen years of Tory rule. With Cummings at his side, along with Lee Cain, another former Vote Leave official, who became his director of communications, Johnson broke the deadlock that had existed since the referendum. He asked the Queen to prorogue, or suspend, Parliament. He expelled twenty-one Conservative M.P.s-including eight former Cabinet ministers and Nicholas Soames, the grandson of Winston Churchill-for attempting to stop the country from leaving the E.U. with no deal at all.\n\nOn a Tuesday in late September, the Supreme Court ruled that Johnson's suspension of Parliament had been unlawful. \"The effect upon the fundamentals of our democracy was extreme,\" the Justices found. I stood outside the court in the rain, and it felt as though the thousand-year-old timbers of the state were moving beneath our feet. Someone in the crowd was wearing a prison jumpsuit and an enlarged Johnson head. A woman was dressed as a suffragist. Anna Soubry, a former Tory M.P. who quit the party to fight for a second referendum, shook her head in wonder. \"Astonishing,\" she said. But Johnson prevailed. Before the year was out, he had cobbled together a new, hard-line Brexit deal and thumped Corbyn at a general election on another three-word Cummings-approved slogan: \"Get Brexit Done.\"\n\nJohnson was, briefly, unassailable. In the election that December, the Conservatives won seats in places such as Bishop Auckland, in Cummings's home county of Durham, which they had not held for more than a hundred years. The Party gathered a new, loose coalition of pro-Brexit voters-many of whom were from formerly Labour-voting English towns-to go with its traditionally older, fiscally conservative base. Johnson's celebrity (the hair, the mess, the faux Churchillian vibes, the ridiculous Latin) was the glue that held it all together. He sensed the public mood. (With Johnson, that was not the same as doing something about it.) He disavowed austerity-promising more money for the N.H.S., new hospitals, and more police-and described a mighty program to redress the country's economic imbalances, which he called Levelling Up.\n\nJohnson's premiership collapsed under the pressure of the pandemic and of his own proclivities. According to Cummings, the alignment between the goals of Vote Leave and Johnson's ambitions as Prime Minister decoupled in January, 2020, just a few weeks after the election. Cummings wanted to overhaul the civil service and Britain's planning laws. Johnson, for his part, wanted a rest. \"He was, like, What the fuck are you talking about? Why would I want to do that?\" Cummings recalled. (Johnson did not reply to a request for comment.) \"It's basically cake-ism, right?,\" Cummings said, referring to Johnson's political lodestar: having his cake and eating it, too. \"I want to do all the things you want to do, and I want everyone to love me,\" Cummings recalled. \"I was, like, Yeah, that's not happening.\"\n\nBritain's first cases of the coronavirus were announced on January 31, 2020, the day the country left the European Union. In March, Johnson ordered the first national lockdown, caught COVID , and later spent three nights in the I.C.U. For months, the country staggered from one set of restrictions to the next-a reflection of Johnson's inconstant attitude toward the virus. In texts, Cummings used a shopping-cart emoji to indicate the Prime Minister veering from one half-formed idea to the next. Levelling Up became a pork-barrel exercise: of seven hundred and twenty-five million pounds earmarked in June, 2021, about eighty per cent was for Conservative constituencies.\n\nJohnson's Downing Street was operatically dysfunctional. A rift opened between Cummings and his team and a faction centered on Carrie Symonds, Johnson's then fiancée, a former Conservative Party communications director. In November, 2020, Cummings accused the Prime Minister of betraying the Vote Leave program and resigned. \"I said, Listen, we had a deal. And if you end up breaking our deal there is going to be hell to pay,\" Cummings recalled. Cain left as well. A little more than a year later, the Daily Mirror , a left-wing tabloid, broke the news that Johnson and his staff had organized parties while the rest of the country was under lockdown-beginning with the party for Cain's departure, the previous November. Johnson resigned six months later.\n\nThe pandemic bore out truths about the British state. There were bright spots: the vaccines and their rollout by the N.H.S.; the intervention of the Treasury, under Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, whose furlough plan protected millions of jobs. More generally, though, the virus revealed tired public services, a population in poor health, and a government that was less competent than it thought it was. \"It's very convenient for everyone to blame Boris,\" Cummings said. \"But the truth is, in January, February, of 2020, it was the civil service saying‚ We're the best-prepared country in the world. We're brilliant at pandemics. The reality is, everything was crumbling.\"\n\nIn October, 2023, Cummings testified at the U.K.'s Covid inquiry, an investigation of the government's handling of the pandemic led by a retired judge. His written evidence was a hundred and fifteen pages long and began with an epigraph from \"War and Peace\": \"Nothing was ready for the war which everybody expected.\"\n\nThe hearings took place in an office building around the corner from Paddington Station. I sat next to a row of bereaved family members, who were holding photographs of their loved ones. Cummings wore a white linen shirt, which came untucked, a tweed jacket with elbow patches, and black boots. He is such a contentious figure-an agent of these disordered times-that people often don't really listen to what he says. A great deal of the media coverage of Cummings's testimony focussed on his texting style. In messages during the pandemic, he referred to ministers as \"useless fuckpigs,\" \"morons,\" and \"cunts.\" The inquiry's lawyer asked Cummings if he thought his language had been too strong. \"I would say, if anything, it understated the position,\" he replied.\n\nIn written testimony, Cummings implored the Covid inquiry to address a wider crisis in Britain's political class. \"Our political parties and the civil service are extremely closed institutions with little place for people who can think and build,\" he wrote. Cummings believes that the war in Iraq, the financial crisis, the pandemic, and the invasion of Ukraine all, in their ways, exposed serious shortcomings in the British state that have yet to be addressed.\n\nBrexit, too. When we met, Cummings observed that the country has still failed to confront the full implications of the vote, either domestically or abroad: \"You can just treat it as, like, a weird thing, like a witch trial in a medieval village. Now the witch has been burnt, and now the community is getting back to normal. Or you can think of it as part of big structural changes in Western politics, society, and the economy. And if the establishment thinks that you can treat it like a sort of episode of witchcraft mania, then they're just going to walk straight into recurring shocks.\"\n\nI was at Heathrow Airport, refreshing the BBC's Web site on my phone, when the screen changed to a black-and-white commemorative portrait of the Queen. On February 6, 1952, when Elizabeth's father, George VI, died, the Prime Minister was Winston Churchill. \"We cannot at this moment do more than record a spontaneous expression of our grief,\" he told the House of Commons that afternoon. Seventy years later, in September, 2022, Britain was seized again by deference, tenderness, and other, more inchoate, emotions. You could not escape the ritual. Hats, horses, artillery in London's parks. In her later years, the Queen's aura of permanence had been enhanced by the recklessness at work in other parts of Britain's public life. Her survival helped to contain a sense of crisis.\n\nThe Queen died on Liz Truss's second full day in office. When the country's brand-new Prime Minister and her husband, Hugh O'Leary, arrived at Westminster Abbey for the state funeral, Australian television identified them as \"maybe minor royals.\" Four days later, Truss launched the Growth Plan 2022, a Thatcher-inspired, forty-five-billion-pound package of tax cuts intended to reignite the British economy. The bond markets didn't like it. The pound fell to a record low against the dollar. The International Monetary Fund asked Truss to \"re-evaluate.\" Her approval rating dropped by almost thirty points in a week. Ashen, Truss fired her Chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, then left office herself, on October 25th, serving seventy-one days fewer than Britain's previous shortest-serving Prime Minister, George Canning, who died suddenly of pneumonia in 1827.\n\nIt made sense to pretend that Truss and her Growth Plan had been a rogue mission, inflicted on an unsuspecting nation. Truss was depicted as mad, or ideologically unreliable, or both. She had been a Liberal Democrat at Oxford who once opposed the monarchy. She was strangely besotted with mental arithmetic. But the truth is that Truss was neither an outlier nor a secret radical, but a representative spirit of the Conservative Party and its years in power. She was one of the first M.P.s of her intake to be promoted to the Cabinet, brought on by Cameron, before serving both May and Johnson in a hectic and haphazard series of important jobs: running departments for the environment, justice, international trade, and a large part of the Treasury.\n\nIn all these positions, Truss was the same: spiky, dynamic, considered skillful on TV. In 2012, she and Kwarteng contributed to \"Britannia Unchained,\" an ode to tax cutting and deregulation that described the British as \"among the worst idlers in the world.\" I asked one of Truss's contemporaries, the former Cabinet minister, if anyone took the ideas seriously at the time. It was hard to catch the attention of the Party's base under the coalition, he complained. \"The easiest way was to show a bit of leg,\" he said. \"It used to be hanging.\" Truss campaigned for Remain before becoming a Brexiteer. As Foreign Secretary, she posed on top of a tank-pure Thatcher cosplay-and dominated the government's Flickr account, with pictures of herself jogging across the Brooklyn Bridge and standing, ruminatively, in Red Square, in Moscow.\n\nLink copied\n\n\"It's silliness,\" Rory Stewart told me. Stewart became a Conservative M.P. on the same day as Truss, in 2010, after working for the British government in Iraq, running an N.G.O. in Afghanistan, and teaching at Harvard. He was ejected from the Party during the Johnson purge of 2019. Last year, he published \"How Not to Be a Politician,\" a compulsive, depressing memoir of his career during this period. \"It's clever, silly people. It's a lack of seriousness,\" he said, of Truss and many of his peers.\n\nIn 2015, Stewart was sent to work under Truss at Britain's department for the environment. Truss challenged him to come up with a strategy for England's national parks in three days. \"She said, Come on, Rory, how difficult can this be?\" he recalled. Truss started firing off suggestions. \"Get young people into nature. Blah blah blah blah.\" (The plan was announced on time; Truss declined to speak to me.) \"I felt with Liz Truss slight affection but above all profound pity,\" Stewart said. \"Because she's approaching these big conversations as though she's sort of performing as an underprepared undergraduate at a seminar.\"\n\nOn a cloudless summer's morning, in the dog days of Theresa May's government, I travelled to Scunthorpe, in North Lincolnshire. In the sixties, Scunthorpe was a growing steel town with four blast furnaces named after English queens. In 2016, the population voted overwhelmingly for Brexit; three years later, the steelworks was at risk of closure, in part because of trade uncertainties caused by the vote. British Steel, which ran the plant, had been sold to private-equity investors for a pound. Four thousand jobs were on the line.\n\nIn the afternoon, I sat down with Simon Green, the deputy chief executive of the local council. Green was in his early fifties, angular and forthright. He grew up in Grimsby, a fishing town on the coast, and spent his career in local government-in Boston and New York, as well as in Nottingham and Sheffield-before taking the job in North Lincolnshire, in 2017. Green was sick of reporters, like me, coming up to Scunthorpe from London for the day, to gawk at its predicament and wonder why people could have believed that Brexit would improve their situation. \"No disrespect, but we do get a level of poverty porn,\" he said. \"A lot of doom and gloom.\"\n\nGreen assured me that the Brexit-related anxiety around the steelworks was a blip. \"We're actually on a bit of a comeback roll,\" he said. He was excited about the region's potential for green technology and the construction of HS2, a new Y-shaped high-speed railway that was going to transform connections between London and cities in the northeast and the northwest. \"Rail track, ballast, concrete, cement-you name anything to do with trains, infrastructure, it's an engineering, Midlands, Northern thing,\" he said. Green ascribed the Brexit vote in Scunthorpe to \"values and culture\" rather than to economics-a sense of dislocation and of feeling disdained by politicians in London.\n\nRecently, I wondered how Green was getting on. In 2019, Scunthorpe was part of the \"Red Wall\" of Labour constituencies that flipped for the Tories. British Steel had changed hands once more. Now Chinese investors were planning to install new furnaces, which required fewer workers and were fed with scrap metal. For the first time since 1890, the plant would no longer produce virgin steel from ore. I met Green a couple of weeks before Christmas. He had left his job a few days before. He seemed relieved to be done. Seven local authorities in England have gone bust since 2020, including the one serving Birmingham, Britain's second-largest city. In North Lincolnshire, the council now spends about three-quarters of its budget on services for vulnerable children and adults-roughly double the proportion of a decade ago. \"We're still here,\" Green said, ruefully. The saga of the steelworks continued. \"It's endless,\" he went on. \"Is it closing? Isn't it closing?\" Britain has had eleven different economic programs in the past thirteen years.\n\nWe were in a teaching room at the University Campus North Lincolnshire, which opened a few years ago in the former local-authority offices. The old council chamber, built in the shape of a blast furnace, was now a lecture hall. The average student age was twenty-nine. Green was proud of the project. It reminded him of mechanics' institutes in the nineteenth century. \"People are using their own judgment to better themselves,\" he said. \"If you want a job in this area, you can get a job. We need more quality opportunity.\" Green had had a clear strategy for Scunthorpe and the nearby Humber estuary, built around green technology and education. \"I asked a question to my colleagues and politicians as well,\" he said. \"What sort of town do you want this to be in ten, fifteen, twenty years?\"\n\nBritain has no equivalent strategy for itself. In September, Sunak weakened several of the country's key climate-change targets. A few weeks later, he cancelled what was left of HS2, the new rail network. Only the stem of the Y will now be built, from London to Birmingham, at a cost of some four hundred and seventy million pounds per mile , with little or no benefit to the North. \"I can get quite excited, agitated by that,\" Green said. \"It makes us look a laughingstock.\" Green was studiously apolitical when we talked. I had no sense of which way he voted. But he despaired of the shallowness and contingency now at the heart of British politics, and the lack of narrative coherence-or shared purpose-about what these years of struggle had been intended to achieve. I asked if he ever worried that the country was in a permanent state of decline. \"I think, at the moment, we are at the crossroads,\" he replied.\n\nWhen will it end? Sunak says that he will call a general election in the second half of the year. The gossip in Westminster says that probably that means mid-November: a British encore, to follow the main event in the U.S. But it could come as soon as May. The Prime Minister began preparing the ground last fall, after his first year in office, by presenting himself as a change candidate-a big claim, considering the circumstances.\n\nIn October, I went to Manchester to watch Sunak address the Conservative Party's annual conference. He was introduced onstage by his wife, Akshata Murty, the daughter of N. R. Narayana Murthy, a founder of Infosys, the Indian I.T. conglomerate. (According to the London Sunday Times , Sunak and Murty have an estimated net worth of about five hundred million pounds.) Murty wore an orange pants suit, and she addressed Britain's most successful political organization as if it were a local gardening society. \"Please know that Rishi is working hard,\" she said. \"He shares your values and he knows how much you care about the future of the U.K.\"\n\nSunak has a quietly imploring tone. British politics was in a bad way, he explained. People were fed up. \"It isn't anger,\" Sunak said. \"It's an exhaustion with politics, in particular politicians saying things and then nothing ever changing.\" Sunak dated the rot back thirty years without explaining why, but, presumably, to indicate the fall of Thatcher. (Thatcher was everywhere in Manchester; she is the modern Party's only ghost.) Having positioned himself as the country's next, truly transformative, leader, Sunak offered his party a weirdly pallid program: the dismantling of HS2, plus two long-range, complex policies, to abolish smoking and to reform the A-levels-England's standard end-of-school exams. \"We will be bold. We will be radical,\" Sunak promised. \"We will face resistance and we will meet it.\"\n\nIncreasingly, Sunak has been pulled between the Party's diverging instincts: to retreat to the dry, liberal competence of the Cameron-Osborne regime or to head off in a more explicitly protectionist, anti-immigrant, anti-woke direction. In Manchester, the energy was unmistakably on the Party's right. Suella Braverman, then the Home Secretary, magnetized delegates with a speech warning of a \"hurricane\" of mass migration. Truss staged a growth rally, and Nigel Farage cruised the conference hall, posing for selfies. (There is talk of Farage standing as a Conservative M.P.) Back in London, I had lunch with David Frost, an influential Conservative peer. \"Rishi, I feel for him, in a way,\" Frost said. \"He's just trying to keep the show on the road and not upset all these different wings of the Party. But the consequence of that is you end up with a sort of agenda which is not politically meaningful at all.\"\n\nOn January 14th, a poll of fourteen thousand people, which Frost facilitated, suggested that the Party is on course for a huge defeat later this year. The question is what kind of haunted political realm it will leave behind. Under Starmer, Labour has been tactical in the extreme, exorcising Corbyn's left-wing policies (Corbyn has been blocked from standing for the Party at the election), while making vague noises about everything else. It has nothing new to say about Brexit and equivocates about its own tax and spending plans, if it wins power. The Party recently scaled back a plan to invest twenty-eight billion pounds a year in green projects. There is no rescue on the way for Britain's welfare state.\n\nOsborne noted all this with satisfaction. \"The underlying economic arguments have basically been accepted,\" he said, of austerity. \"It's rather like the Thatcher period. Everyone complained that Thatcher did deindustrialization, and yet no one wants to unpick it.\" By contrast, Cummings sees the two cautious, hedging leaders in charge of Britain's main political parties-and the relief among some centrists that the candidates are not so different from each other-in rather darker terms. \"They are deluded when they think it's great that Sunak and Starmer are in. It's just like they're arguing over trivia,\" he said. \"The politics of it are insane.\"\n\nI am afraid that I agree. It is unnerving to be heading into an election year in Britain with the political conversation so small, next to questions that can feel immeasurable. I put this to Hayes, the Tory M.P., when I went to see him in the House of Commons. \"You're arguing we have very vanilla-flavor politics, in a richly colored world. There's something in that,\" he said. Then he surprised me. \"I think the key thing for the Conservatives now is to be more conservative,\" he said. We were sitting in a bay window, overlooking the Thames. A waiter poured tea. Hayes seemed to relish the coming election. It was as if, after almost fourteen years of tortuous experiment, real conservatism might finally be at hand. \"Outside metropolitan Britain and the university towns, it's all up for grabs,\" Hayes assured me. \"Toryism must have its day again.\" ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "The Supreme Court's Conservatives Have Asserted Their Power\n\nThe lasting depredations of the Trump Presidency were brought into sharp focus by last week's testimony before the House Select Committee investigating the events of January 6th , which left an indelible portrait of Donald Trump as a food-throwing despot willing to encourage an armed mob to march to the Capitol. And, in addition to an attempted coup, we have him to thank for 2022's becoming the turning point of the Supreme Court's conservative revolution.\n\nIn a single week in late June, the conservative Justices asserted their recently consolidated power by expanding gun rights, demolishing the right to abortion, blowing a hole in the wall between church and state, and curtailing the ability to combat climate change. The Court is not behaving as an institution invested in social stability, let alone in the importance of its own role in safeguarding that stability. But what if its big and fast moves, eviscerating some constitutional rights and inflating others, are bound for collision? As people harmed by one aspect of its agenda look to other aspects of it to protect them, the Court may not be altogether pleased with where that process leads.\n\nShortly before the Court, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, overruled Roe v. Wade , a synagogue filed suit in a Florida court, challenging, under the Florida constitution, the state's new law criminalizing pre-viability abortions. Among the plaintiff's claims is that the abortion ban violates the right of Jews \"to freedom of religion in the most intimate decisions of their lives.\" The suit states that Jewish law stipulates that life begins at birth, not before, and \"requires the mother to abort the pregnancy\" if there is a risk to her \"health or emotional well being.\" Thus, the plaintiff argues, the abortion ban infringes on Jewish free exercise of religion.\n\nMany post-Dobbs lawsuits can also now be expected to assert that abortion bans violate state constitutions, which may be more protective of individual rights than the federal Constitution is. Marriage equality, for example, was protected in Massachusetts by a state constitutional ruling twelve years before the Supreme Court declared a federal constitutional right to same-sex marriage. Republican-dominated state courts, no less than G.O.P.-led state legislatures, though, may well stymie such efforts to preserve abortion access. Last month, the Iowa Supreme Court simply overruled its own 2019 decision affirming a state constitutional right to abortion, leaving Iowa free to ban the procedure.\n\nBut the Jewish group's claim is a bellwether, because the Supreme Court has lately been exceedingly accommodating of people's religious views. This term, two cases resulted in historic expansions of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. The Court held that Maine, which provides tuition funds for students who reside in districts lacking public secondary schools to attend secular schools elsewhere, must also provide funds for such students who choose to attend religious schools. The Court also held, in the case of a football coach at a public high school in Washington State, who knelt and prayed on the field after games, that the school district could not stop him, even if it wanted only to avoid the appearance of endorsing religion. The upshot, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, in a dissenting opinion, is that the Court \"elevates one individual's interest in personal religious exercise . . . over society's interest in protecting the separation between church and state.\" And, in a free-speech case this term, the Court held that Boston must allow a group to fly a Christian flag on the flagpole outside city hall if it allows other groups to hoist non-religious flags, such as the pride flag.\n\nThe Supreme Court's expansion of religious liberty is long-running, but it has rapidly accelerated in the two years since the Court gained a conservative supermajority. At the start of the pandemic, in 2020, the Court repeatedly rejected claims of churches that objected to states' stay-at-home orders. But, after Justice Amy Coney Barrett was confirmed, in the fall of 2020, a majority-the same five conservative Justices who eventually voted to overrule Roe v. Wade-held in favor of Catholic and Orthodox Jewish organizations that objected to a state's stricter capacity limit for houses of worship than for essential businesses. Similarly, the courts have historically and routinely rejected religious free-exercise challenges to compulsory vaccinations, such as for admittance to schools. But, since last year, a number of courts have required religious exemptions to COVID -vaccine mandates. According to a recent Yale Law Journal study conducted by Zalman Rothschild, a fellow at the Stanford Constitutional Law Center, \"while every federal court in the country faced with the issue has rejected vaccine-mandate challenges brought under free-speech or substantive-due-process theories, free exercise challenges have succeeded in securing wins for vaccine objectors.\" He has since noted that \"free exercise has exploded out of proportion.\" Indeed, that expansion threatens to allow people to claim a religious free-exercise right to discriminate against L.G.B.T.Q. individuals. But it may also arm those who seek religious exemptions from abortion bans with powerful arguments that courts will have to grapple with. And some groups that make such arguments may be beyond the embrace of the general public-much less that of Republican-dominated courts.\n\nThe Satanic Temple, for example, headquartered in Salem, Massachusetts, claims seven hundred thousand registered members in congregations around the world. Courts and the I.R.S. have recognized the organization as a religion (which doesn't actually worship Satan as a deity but, instead, views him as a symbol of dissent against tyrannical authority). In keeping with one of its core tenets-that \"one's body is inviolable, subject to one's own will alone\"-TST has filed several lawsuits pressing a free-exercise claim that objects to abortion bans. Its position is that a state's imposition of a waiting period or counselling prior to an abortion is as much a violation of religious freedom as it would be prior to a baptism or a Communion.\n\nWe are accustomed to hearing religious objections to abortion. Religious objections to abortion bans also reflect the fact that, for many people, questions of when human life begins and whether to have a child are centrally informed by their religious beliefs. It is possible that these free-exercise claims won't succeed, because avoidance of hypocrisy is not a value that we expect from this Supreme Court, any more than we expect it from the man responsible for its composition. The Select Committee and the Department of Justice may yet force Trump to answer for some of his actions, but, notwithstanding the historic swearing-in of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson last week, we are stuck with his Court, and the damage it will do, for the next generation. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Why Conservatives Around the World Have Embraced Hungary's Viktor Orbán\n\nSince his second stint as Prime Minister of Hungary began, in 2010, Viktor Orbán has chipped away at the country's democratic systems. A proponent of what he calls an \"illiberal\" form of government, Orbán has imposed policies that are hostile to L.G.B.T.Q. people and immigrants, and has steadily increased his control of Hungary's public square by cracking down on the press, the academy, and the judiciary. But the end of his tenure could be near: Orbán is up for reëlection in 2022, and a coalition of six opposition parties, from the left to the far right, has formed to defeat him.\n\nStill, over the past decade, Orbán has become something of a hero to conservatives throughout Europe, and has piqued the interest of the American right wing as well. Last week, Tucker Carlson visited Hungary and, over dinner, lauded the Prime Minister as someone that the West could learn from. On Sunday, in the Times , the conservative columnist Ross Douthat explained some of Orbán's appeal. \"It's not just his anti-immigration stance or his moral traditionalism,\" Douthat wrote . \"It's that his interventions in Hungarian cultural life, the attacks on liberal academic centers and the spending on conservative ideological projects, are seen as examples of how political power might curb progressivism's influence.\"\n\nI recently spoke by phone with Kim Lane Scheppele, a professor of sociology at Princeton who is an expert on Hungarian politics and constitutional law. Scheppele met Orbán in the early nineteen-nineties, when she was a researcher working with the Hungarian Constitutional Court and he was a rising politician of the center right. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed why Orbán has become a model for conservatives around the world, how he could remain powerful in Hungary even after leaving office, and what makes him, in Scheppele's words, \"the ultimate twenty-first-century dictator.\"\n\nOrbán is frequently quoted as advocating for an \"illiberal democracy,\" but, in an academic article you published a few years ago, you argued that this was a mistranslation. What do you think he actually said, and what does it tell us about his style of rule?\n\nIn the speech where Orbán claimed to want an illiberal state, he was also talking about what he calls a force field of power. He was telling his supporters that what he hoped was for Hungary to eliminate political debate through a force field of power, by which he meant: Let's stop arguing over stuff in politics and let's just get stuff done. No point in taking different viewpoints into account, because I know what we should do. Which is to say that he was proposing in that speech to shut down ordinary, democratic political debate, which is exactly what he did as soon as he came to power.\n\nAnd then, because there was such a strong reaction to it, he backpedalled from that phrase into something that might be more politically acceptable. So first it was \"Well, we're an illiberal state because we've marginalized the liberals.\" It was like \"owning the libs\" in the United States, and since he was branding his opponents as liberals, therefore, he was an illiberal. And that didn't go over all that well in the E.U., so he eventually backed into this formulation of being a Christian Democrat, and one of the things being a Christian Democrat does is it gives you these values from Christianity that cannot be compromised and that are illiberal because they're opposed to liberal political views. So, if the liberal thing is multiculturalism, illiberalism means Hungary for the Hungarians.\n\nRight, he has said he's in favor of \"Christian democracy,\" and he translates that as something that's illiberal and anti-immigration. But can you talk about how important the Christian part is? \"Christian Democrat\" is also a phrase that we've heard for many, many years in Europe, and it generally implies a center-right politician committed to European democracy. How is this different?\n\nYeah, he came up with the formulation when the European People's Party, which includes, for example, Angela Merkel's party, was talking about trying to throw him out because he was becoming a dictator. So he agreed on this formulation. And then, when he quit the Party before they could throw him out, he said, \"Well, look, obviously the E.P.P., the European People's Party, has just gone over to the leftists.\" It's a thing that enabled him to position himself in European politics. But Christian Democracy is a very strange thing for Orbán himself to be arguing.\n\nNo one has ever seen him in a church. He is not at all religious. It's a bit like Trump, who also has never really been seen in a church. Hungary's Christians are about two-thirds Catholic and one-third Calvinist. And then, having executed a large amount of its Jewish population during the Second World War, Hungary still has a community of Jews-and nobody knows how many, because they don't count in the census. Orbán's family was Calvinist. He comes from the minority religion. And yet, in his statements about Christian Democracy within Hungary, he's always invoking the Catholic Church.\n\nGenerally, in Hungary, people aren't religious. The last survey I saw showed that about nine per cent of Hungarians attend religious services regularly. And part of that, of course, was that fifty years of Communism wiped religion out of the social fabric. But, also, Hungarians are an ironic, skeptical lot in general. Even if you go back to medieval Hungary, there's a lot of, shall we say, deviation from official church norms. So, it's just very odd for Orbán to be claiming that he represents the Hungarian people by virtue of being such a good Christian.\n\nSo then why is he doing it?\n\nThere is a whole rhetoric that he's employing that recalls the interwar period of the last century. Hungary became independent after the First World War in a small version of what it had been historically. The area where they could concentrate ethnic Hungarians was in the territory that became modern Hungary, and that meant that two-thirds of the territory that had traditionally been Hungarian fell to other countries. Miklós Horthy emerges in this interwar period with the claim that he's going to recover these territories and recover these peoples, and he governs as a regent in the name of the Holy Crown of St. Stephen, because, under medieval law, the crown stood for this territory that all Hungarians were claiming. Horthy then claimed that the crown given by the Pope to the first Christian king of Hungary was the symbol of Hungarian sovereignty.\n\nWhen Orbán was Prime Minister the first time, from 1998 to 2002, one of the things he presided over was moving the Holy Crown of St. Stephen from the National Museum to the Parliament. He wrapped himself in the crown, like we talk about American Presidents wrapping themselves in the flag. And the rhetoric that comes with that will be familiar from this interwar period, when Hungary's anger at being maltreated by the global community was played out through this heightened Christian symbolism and language. When Orbán does this now, every Hungarian understands that he's following in the footsteps of Horthy. Now, of course, Horthy joined World War Two on the side of Nazi Germany. This guy governed with the Hungarian Nazi Party. This guy presided over the deportation of Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz. So that's also part of the mix that every Hungarian will understand.\n\nWhat noises does Orbán make about non-Christians now?\n\nIn the middle of his last campaign, all his campaign posters had these terrible pictures of George Soros with the caption \"Don't let Soros have the last laugh.\" Invoking the laughing Jew, right? They were even passing a law called the Stop Soros law . And, of course, one thing Orbán did was sidle up to Bibi Netanyahu, who would show up in Hungary and say, \"No, Orbán's not anti-Semitic. We all hate Soros.\" But the coded language around the anti-Soros campaign was clearly anti-Semitic.\n\nI had assumed that much of the Christian talk was meant to mark Orbán as someone who opposed having Muslims immigrate to Hungary. How much-especially from 2015 on, when immigration in Europe became a much bigger political issue-has his approach been about being anti-Muslim?\n\nThat was a big thing in 2015, when immigration was in the news, but Orbán was doing that in 2014 in his election campaign, which is to say he was anti-migrant even before there were migrants. He was against taking in other peoples before they actually arrived at the doorstep. But, here again, Orbán is a hypocrite. At the same time that he's erecting walls, Orbán has created this program through which anyone can buy permanent residence in Hungary-they sold permanent residence during those same years to more than fifteen thousand Chinese people. This is not a policy I object to, but he was not, even on his own terms, being consistent with who was being let in. Later, after Venezuela collapsed, Hungary took in hundreds of Venezuelans. He has a very active foreign policy. He makes partnership agreements with some Gulf states.\n\nRight, this is reminiscent of Trump trying to ban Muslims at a time when he was making deals with Erdoğan and the Saudi royal family.\n\nExactly. But that's why Trump and Orbán are like birds of a feather. Not so much because they're outrageous but because they're doing it in such a way that it's opportunistic. It's completely transactional. Most of it is about putting money in the private pockets of the leader. And this other stuff is really a cover for money, which is the only thing that speaks in Orbán's world.\n\nI was going to ask you about that, because Orbán has obviously been accused of pretty gross examples of corruption, which makes for another comparison to Trump, who could be said to be more committed to his own corruption than to any particular ideology. Do you think that Orbán sincerely believes in a larger vision?\n\nNo, Orbán doesn't. I met him when I lived in Hungary in the nineties. And I know people who used to be in his party until, in fact, very recently. Everybody who knows Orbán personally says, \"This guy is not an ideologue. He doesn't really believe this stuff.\" That said, he knows he has to win elections. Hungary has a parliamentary system-it's like a British system, where you win in individual districts and party lists, and then the Prime Minister is the one who gets the most seats. So he needs an ideology to govern a party in that kind of system. But I don't think he believes it, because he changes what he says day to night. His Fidesz Party started off as the Hayekian liberal party in Hungary: small state, no regulation, freedom for everybody. The state, ideally, would wither away. And this is the opposite of what he's created.\n\nSo, no, he's an opportunist, but, as for the corruption, the difference between Orbán and Trump is, frankly, that Orbán is cleverer. He's also a lawyer. So everything Orbán has done in Hungary has been legal. Trump just kind of wakes up one morning, decides to do something, orders people to do it, and is vaguely annoyed if they don't just do it. Orbán wakes up one morning, decides to do something, drafts a law, rams it through the parliament, and then does it.\n\nAnd the difference is that a lot of the corruption has happened in completely legal ways. So he changes the structure of the public procurement agency, which hands out state money, and which is dominated by his appointees. He controls the State Audit Office. He controls the public prosecutor, so the complaints of corruption are never acted upon. He controls almost all the media, so none of it is reported. There have been some investigative journalists who have uncovered a lot about where the money goes, and have survived in Hungary against all odds. The richest Hungarian is Lőrinc Mészáros, Orbán's childhood best friend. There's a phrase in Hungarian that sounds funny in English, but it's a great phrase-they say this guy is Orbán's walking wallet.\n\nThe conservative writer Michael Brendan Dougherty wrote a somewhat favorable piece about Orbán in the National Review , arguing that his supporters aren't just opposed to immigration; they're disillusioned by rates of emigration-\"watching your children emigrate and lose their connections to their communities, families.\" Do you agree?\n\nOrbán may well have said that, and what he would have meant by it is different from what Dougherty thought. Hungary's a small country. Its population was about ten million people when Orbán came to power. The estimates are a little unreliable, but many people think that it's down a million since Orbán took office. People have left. And why have they left? It's because Orbán hits people economically. He doesn't arrest journalists and jail them. He doesn't torture his opponents. He doesn't use brutal methods of that kind. But he does deprive them of any possibility of an income. When he came to office, he fired huge numbers of people from the public sector. And then he went sector by sector through the economy and squeezed it, both the private sector and the public sector.\n\nI interviewed a bunch of people in 2012 who said that they were given lists by Orbán's people, and that if they hired any of the people on this list they would be ineligible for state contracts. And this is a country where the primary development funds-the primary money for doing anything in the country-is coming from E.U. funds. Most of these businessmen said they couldn't afford to hire anybody on the blacklist, because they couldn't afford to do without state contracts. So many, many Hungarians have left. The Hungarian government doesn't keep emigration figures, but other European countries keep immigration figures-how many moved to Germany, et cetera. And, based on this, my colleague Daniel Kelemen estimates that between eight hundred thousand and a million people left Hungary in the first ten years of Orbán's term. They've lost college students, because Orbán has started to charge tuition at universities, and stopped giving out fellowships. College used to be functionally free in Hungary, until Orbán came to power. Now it's not. So what happens is that ambitious students learn German and go to free German universities.\n\nThe people that he's lost are largely the Hungarians who would vote against him, because Orbán's base is like Trump's base: it's largely uneducated, it's rural, it's people who don't really have the option to go abroad. In the meantime, he's given citizenship to ethnic Hungarians in neighboring states. The voting population is about the same, but he lost a million voters who don't support him and he gained a million voters who do. And he did that by making it almost impossible for the people who left Hungary to vote in Hungarian elections. It's an incredibly brilliant strategy. So, yes, Orbán's there because of emigration.\n\nSo you're not sympathetic to Dougherty's argument that the country has lost people to more prosperous European countries for economic reasons, and that has caused certain resentments from the people who stayed?\n\nThe Baltic states have emptied out. Once they joined the E.U., lots of people just moved for the opportunity. Poland lost many of its plumbers, and its working-class tradesmen. There was a mass emigration from Eastern Europe once those countries joined the E.U., in 2004. Not so for Hungary. There were some, but a massive amount waited until Orbán came to power and started this economic drive against his opponents by firing them from any work they could have in the country.\n\nYou have offered up some reasons why Orbán may be popular with people on the right around the world, but is there anything else that explains his popularity among right-wingers abroad?\n\nWell, I think the public appeal is all this rhetoric, and the fact that he keeps winning elections. He wins with two-thirds of the seats in the parliament, which is a function of how he rigged the rules. But the other thing is, of course, that he's become a dictator, and he has concentrated power in his hands. Look at Trumpism: no need for an independent judiciary, because they might go after Trump's corruption. No need for liberals to be around at all. It is better if you just have one voice screaming in the wilderness. That's a strongman vision of politics, in which the things we think of as the basic requisites of the democratic order are missing. No need to have a pluralistic free press, because they should just say what the leader says. Orbán has done all of that. Orbán claims to be a man of the masses who is constantly getting reёlected by acclaim. That's not the story of what's happened in Hungary. So I worry that Orbán is the complete package. He uses the rhetoric that appeals to the right, the way that Trump's rhetoric appealed to the right wing of U.S. politics. But underneath it there is a dictator who is running things by himself. I'm concerned that that vision is what's actually appealing to the American right.\n\nI'm not trying to understate how bad things are, but you don't see journalists in prison, the way you do in Turkey, for example, and there is some sense that Orbán could lose the next election. So how would you define his regime?\n\nOrbán is the ultimate twenty-first-century dictator. Twentieth-century dictatorships were about ideology and repression: physical repression with this detestable ideology. Twenty-first-century authoritarianism works through economic means rather than physical means. So economic coercion is everywhere in Hungary. But, if you went there on vacation, you would never guess that it's a dictatorship. And that's because the way that Orbán exercises control is through money. Orbán has eliminated the system of welfare and unemployment insurance and so on, so that you only get those things if you pass his litmus test. With the media, his oligarchs have bought out all the media that were critical of him. They've consolidated the banking sector in their hands.\n\nAnd so this is the new form of oppression. It doesn't look like oppression if you're on the streets of Budapest. But if you live there and you have no money and you can't get an income because no one will hire you, then what happens? You have to leave. So, it's a combination of regulatory adjustments, but mostly it's economic measures, and those are not very visible. Human-rights groups are not really attuned to tracking those the way that they would track journalists in jail.\n\nI've read in your articles that you think that the opposition has to fully unite to beat Orbán. And the opposition has indeed done a fair amount of uniting, and there is an election next year.\n\nOne of the ways that Orbán governed was by positioning himself in the middle of the Hungarian spectrum, at least as his rhetoric goes. For the opposition to defeat him, they had to unite all of the other political parties. There is the Socialist Party, which is the former Communist Party and now has no Communists in it. Anybody who was a former Communist under the old regime is in Orbán's party, not in the Socialist Party. And then there are some liberal parties, and there's a little Green Party. And then there's the former neo-Nazis, Jobbik, who have moved a bit toward the center. In order for the opposition to win, given the way the election system is structured, all those parties have to work together. And after ten years of Orbán, they've finally decided to. In Tucker Carlson's interview, Carlson said, \"The former Communists are allied with anti-Semites, and they're running against you.\" And then Orbán said, \"You see, I'm the only sane guy around.\"\n\nOrbán is now trying to defeat the coalition by coming up with wedge issues. The L.G.B.T.Q. law, which has generated a lot of opposition in Europe, is one of those wedge issues. Jobbik, the far-right party, was enthusiastically in favor of that law, and all the parties to Orbán's left were opposed to it. The whole reason for bringing that up was to deepen a wedge in that coalition.\n\nThat said, Orbán has run out of room. He needs E.U. money to survive, and the E.U. has finally put in place a system through which they could cut funds to him-and there seems to be enough support to do that. If that happens, he doesn't have all this money to give out to his cronies. So what he's been doing in the last six months is setting up an alternative economic structure that will support him and his oligarchs while bankrupting the Hungarian state. They've given billions upon billions of dollars of state property to a set of newly created private foundations, which are run by Orbán's loyalists. These private foundations escape public audit. You can't get at them with freedom-of-information requests. And all but five of the universities in Hungary have been put into these so-called public-interest foundations, and the foundations can spend their resources any way they want. They've been given shares in the state oil company, for example, and they've been given lakes and resorts.\n\nThat's what makes me think Orbán may realize, first of all, that a united opposition may, in fact, defeat him-and that maybe it's a good thing for Orbán if they do, because then he can play victim, and he could say, \"Look, I'm not a dictator. The opposition won.\" But as soon as they come to power, he can bankrupt the state.\n\nWhat has the opposition learned over the past decade?\n\nThe only way you can win is if you don't have the typical three-way split in Hungarian politics. There's been a split between a center right, a center left, and then a far right. It's like a triangle instead of a bipolar system. And Orbán was benefitting from the fact that the population splits almost evenly between far right and center left when they're not voting for him. So that's why the far-right and the center-left parties only have a chance of winning against Orbán in those single-member districts if they join together. Orbán thought it would never happen, and for ten years, it didn't happen. Then, gradually, as this autocracy starts choking everybody, it choked Jobbik, the far-right party, too. They had a big internal battle and moved much more toward the center, which made it possible for these left parties to work with them.\n\nBut here's the problem: they can win an election, but can they govern? Orbán's created a legal structure that makes it almost impossible for the opposition to govern. For as long as Orbán has two-thirds of the parliament, he can amend the constitution every day. So, he amended the constitution to say that the law on his private foundations is a constitutional law. If the opposition wins, it will not win with two-thirds in this system; it'll win a bare majority, and then it can't change these private foundations, which are going to be the thing that will give Orbán all his money when he's out of power.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "What American Conservatives See in Hungary's Leader\n\nThis past April, the conservative writer Rod Dreher, who normally lives in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, travelled to Budapest for a four-month fellowship at the Danube Institute, a right-of-center think tank with close ties to the government of Viktor Orbán . Dreher, accompanied for part of the time by his college-aged son, Matt, was given an apartment near the National Museum. Having spent many years working from home, he bought several new suits for the trip, but he found that the Danube Institute had a casual dress code and brought him such easy access to Orbán's circle that, even on those occasions when he had interviews with ministers from Orbán's government or dinners with Hungarian political and cultural figures, he could usually leave the suits at the apartment.\n\nIt was an interesting time to arrive in Hungary. Orbán and his Fidesz party have controlled the government since 2010 and made major changes to its structure. First, in 2012, came a new constitution , which increased the number of justices on the Constitutional Court from eleven to fifteen and introduced a new process for selecting them; by 2013, Orbán's party had chosen nine of them. The new constitution also eliminated election runoffs, allowing Orbán's party-the largest of a half-dozen in the country-to convert vote totals of forty-four per cent and forty-eight per cent in the past two parliamentary elections into legislative supermajorities. Second has been an extension of political power into cultural spheres, a shift marked first by the strident anti-migrant position Orbán took in 2015 and his statement the previous year that a democracy need not be liberal. The landmark Central European University, founded in 1991 by George Soros, was effectively evicted from Hungary; theatre directors have been replaced by politically compliant figures; the largest newspaper in the country, Népszabadság , was shuttered, with journalists and opposition figures alleging that government pressure was responsible, and owners blaming declining sales. In its 2020 annual report , Freedom House concluded that these steady incursions against Hungarian freedoms meant that the country no longer met its definition of a democracy. Next year, Orbán will stand for reëlection; Hungary's other parties have formed an anti-Orbán coalition, making the vote especially high-stakes. Meanwhile, Orbán has begun taking stands against cultural progressivism-banning children's media deemed to be L.G.B.T.-friendly, granting broad subsidies to the country's churches, and refusing to let Muslim migrants settle in Hungary-that have made him the kind of figure whom American social conservatives could idolize, and drawn his politics nearer to their own.\n\nQuite quickly, in the course of his dinners and meetings and observational trips on Budapest's convenient public-transit system, Dreher began to form a dissenting opinion of the political situation in Hungary. \"I was there about ten days before I realized that eighty, ninety per cent of the American narrative about the country just isn't true,\" he told me recently. He had heard Hungary described as an authoritarian state, but in Budapest he saw everyone seemed free to speak their mind. Dreher noted that he had appeared at a conference with an opponent of Orbán, who was critical of the Prime Minister. What's more, Orbán, Dreher came to think, had a keener grasp of the \"crisis-political, even civilizational\" facing traditionalists than nearly any American conservative. Dreher liked how openly nationalist Orbán was, picking fights with his partners in the European Union when it grew too progressive, and how he had often set aside free-market principles in order to promote conservative social values-offering state subsidies to women to stay home and have more Hungarian children. \"I think he believes-and, as a reader of Michel Houellebecq, I think he's absolutely right-that there's no way Europe is going to survive long term unless it rediscovers its religion,\" Dreher said. I asked Dreher whether he believed America also faced a similar threat to its survival, and he said, \"Yeah, I do.\"\n\nDreher developed a very specific idea. He decided that the television host Tucker Carlson -\"the most important conservative figure in America,\" in Dreher's estimation-should come to Budapest as soon as possible and see it for himself. He texted Carlson and told him so; Carlson wrote back and said that he'd been meaning to come over, but the effort had become tangled in Hungarian red tape. Dreher made a point of telling government ministers that it would be good for Hungary if this important American journalist could come. Eventually, in July, the red tape evaporated, and Carlson spent a week in Hungary, taping episodes of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" in which he visited and praised a chain-link fence across Hungary's southern border and conducted an interview with Orbán himself. \"If you live in the United States, it is bitter to see the contrast between, say, Budapest and New York City,\" Carlson told his audience, from a set that looked out over a gorgeous expanse of Habsburg rooftops. In New York, he said, it was \"common\" to hire armed guards to protect you if you had conservative views, but in Hungary everyone was free to express themselves. In New York, a maelstrom ensued. From Budapest, Dreher tweeted a picture of a relaxed Carlson addressing a group of laughing Hungarian dignitaries on a pretty stone patio at a formal dinner, Rod Dreher himself among them.\n\nIf this encounter revealed something about Orbánism, it revealed some things about Dreher, too. Fifty-four years old, a career journalist and a midlife convert to the Eastern Orthodox Church, Dreher became known in the George W. Bush era for genial renderings of a fundamentally dour set of politics. Dreher saw a long cultural arc, in which Christianity, and the society it built, was being irretrievably lost in the stream of what, borrowing from a lineage of traditionalist thinkers, he called \"liquid modernity.\" In his 2006 book, \" Crunchy Cons ,\" Dreher argued that corruptions of secular-capitalist life compelled believing Christians to turn to localism; in 2017, in \" The Benedict Option ,\" he advised conservatives to seek meaning through retreat into like-minded communities rather than through politics. His writing, generally reflective and curious, is studded with hostility to contemporary liberal commitments: he has called transgender rights \"psychotic\" and argued that Muslim migration into Europe would \"obliterate\" local culture. There is something double-edged about his intent in these moments. They operate as sincere expressions of political commitments, and as provocations-they are invitations to liberal journalists, professors, and tweeters to prove that they are in fact as intolerant of conservative Christian views as Dreher believes them to be.\n\nDreher abhorred Donald Trump for his corruption and moral debasement, but the former President's rise and fall had the effect of elevating Dreher's profile. If conservative politicians and intellectuals were experimenting with a more skeptical stance toward free markets, a more overt cultural nationalism, and a more profoundly antagonistic view of modern liberalism, then Dreher had theories to offer. He still lives in Baton Rouge, he still drives a Honda, and he still writes primarily for a niche publication, The American Conservative , but now he can get Tucker Carlson to Hungary and draw sympathetic attention for the episode from the conservative opinion writers at the Times . Dreher's latest book, \" Live Not by Lies ,\" sets his themes abroad: rooted in interviews with natives of Communist regimes, it compares thought policing in the contemporary United States to the experience of living behind the Iron Curtain. His time in Hungary was interrupted by book events across Europe. Last week, he tweeted that he had met Pope Francis, briefly, in the Vatican. \"I said, 'Holy Father, I wrote \"The Benedict Option.\" ' He took my name tag in his hand, looked at it, then gave me a blank expression. His team trashed the book when it came out in Italy in 2018. C'est la vie.\" The depth and sincerity of Dreher's retreatism has, paradoxically, brought him very close to real power.\n\nBudapest has been the main stronghold of resistance to Orbán's politics, and it seemed to Dreher that the city wore its progressivism like armor. A few days before he'd arrived, Dreher recounted, a district government in Budapest had erected a temporary installation by the artist Péter Szalay, a replica of the Statue of Liberty painted in the colors of the rainbow flag and taking a knee, while holding a sign that read \"Black Lives Matter.\" The statue stood for just one day. \"Football hooligans came in and tore it down, which was unfortunate,\" Dreher said. But the district progressive leaders, he went on, \"knew it was going to happen. This was just being provocative.\" (Though of course Dreher, in travelling to Hungary, was being provocative, and knew what would happen, too.) Dreher said that he was struck by an exchange he had accessed through Google Translate, in which local journalists had asked the district's mayor what significance a Black Lives Matter statue had in her city, which is home to very few Black people, and she had said, as he recalled it, \"We must all be against racism.\" To Dreher, this suggested some of the totalizing instincts of the contemporary left. \"The Hungarians aren't Dutch, and they aren't Swedish,\" Dreher said, referring to the latter nationalities' views on diversity and L.G.B.T. visibility. \"Well, one thing I admire about Orbán is, he said, 'We're not going to do that here.' \"\n\nWhen I asked Dreher how he would characterize Orbán, he said immediately, \"Intense, and intellectually pugilistic.\" He remembered two things in particular from their first meeting, at a religious-liberty conference in Budapest in 2019. The first was that Orbán had described how Hungarians, during the Soviet era, had been exposed to a programmatic left-wing effort to create Homo sovieticus , the new Soviet man, and so recognized woke progressive ideology as a totalitarian ideology itself. Dreher was also very taken with Orbán personally: \"Really good English, discoursing in depth about political and cultural issues. Whatever you think about him, the idea that this guy is some sort of Magyar Trump, or even a Putin figure, it's just wrong.\" The second thing Orbán said that stuck with Dreher was an invitation. He told the group, \"We hope you will think of Budapest as your intellectual home.\"\n\nTo Hungarian and Western liberal observers of Orbán's regime, Dreher, Carlson, and their ilk are, basically, suckers. \"It's a soft twenty-first-century dictatorship,\" said András Bozóki, a sociologist who was Hungary's Minister of Culture in a center-left government in the mid-two-thousands and is now a professor at Central European University, which was exiled from Hungary and is now based in Vienna. Orbán, he went on, was a changeling and a pragmatist. As a recent law-school graduate, he was a leader in the student protests of 1989; he then became a politician and, in the kind of fast time line that is easier in a country scarcely bigger than New York, became Prime Minister in a joint government in 1998, before reinventing himself first as a staunch conservative and then as a nationalist-populist. Anyone who saw Orbán as a paragon of social conservatism, Kim Scheppele , a professor of sociology at Princeton and a scholar of Hungary, told me, was mistaking opportunism for conviction. She pointed to several events in which Orbán wasn't the social traditionalist he often played, including his expulsion of as many as three hundred churches from Hungary and a scandal in which his friend and close ally József Szájer left a gay orgy in Brussels when the police arrived to break it up, by sliding naked out a window. The ideology that had so attracted the American conservatives, she said, acted to \"mask a really pernicious set of anti-democratic changes to judicial and legislative processes that have allowed him to entrench minority rule.\" When I asked Dreher whether he was concerned by such complaints, he told me he was, but that \"we expect too much of these post-Communist countries if we judge them by Western standards of clean government.\"\n\nIn Hungary, Dreher largely moved through an élite and international milieu, close to the long-standing Prime Minister, which nevertheless thought of itself as representing a kind of folk reaction to international power. In the company of Orbán's son, Gáspár, Dreher took in a concert staged by a Catholic conservative rock star and Orbán supporter named Akos. In conversations with senior members of Orbán's political party, Fidesz, Dreher learned that they were genuinely fearful about the upcoming election, which gave Dreher a retort to Westerners who argued that Orbán's Hungary was authoritarian: authoritarians don't fear elections. Dreher visited a ministry office Orbán had created, to protect persecuted Christians overseas, and was moved when he was taken to the spare chapel that had been set up in the ministry basement. On a visit to Bucharest, he caught glimpses of the deeper Europe, nearly lost to modernity (\"more traditional, poorer\") that he believed Orbán was trying to protect. When I asked about Orbán's campaigns against the Roma-his government refused to pay court-ordered compensation to Roma children who had been confined to segregated schools, and his political party blamed George Soros when pressed about it-Dreher, who does not speak Hungarian, told me he had heard that many Roma supported Orbán, but \"I don't know much, to be honest.\"\n\nThough Dreher often speaks of traditional cultures, it is Christian conservatism, in particular, that he is adamant about protecting. Early in June, Dreher met with Orbán's Minister of Family Affairs, Katalin Novák, who told him that two days thence the government would move to ban L.G.B.T.Q. programming for children, and that she was expecting a big blowback. When the decision was announced, two days later, the blowback was fierce: the Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, said that if the Hungarian government did not retract the measure it ought to be expelled from the European Union. In Dreher's view, the speed and extremity of this reaction showed how ready Western liberals were to try to annihilate rather than engage with traditional culture. \"No discussion of the pros and cons of why they might have done this, or why they're wrong-it was just outrageous,\" Dreher said. \"Seeing how Hungary was treated over the L.G.B.T. media law-that pushed me more to the radical side.\"\n\nThe political opportunism in this relationship, between the Hungarians and the American conservatives, runs both ways. Dreher and Carlson were also using Orbán, or a certain image of him, to make a point about the United States. Dreher told me, \"Viktor Orbán is not Francisco Franco, nor is the Euro-positive Hungarian Left like the Spanish Communists. But the dynamic is quite similar. And it's true in America as well. We all seem to be barreling towards a future that is not liberal and democratic but is going to be either left illiberalism, or right illiberalism. If that's true, then I know which side I'm on: the side that isn't going to persecute me and my people. In Rome recently, I met a Syrian Catholic who fled to Europe to escape persecution back home. 'Do you think we love Assad?' he said, speaking of Christians like him. 'No. We support him because he is the only thing standing between us and the radical Muslims who want to kill us.' \"\n\nDreher makes for a very worldly religious retreatist-his round, bearded face and vertical shock of hair are set off by thick round glasses that make him look a bit like an impresario. I met him in Baton Rouge this August (as I.C.U.s in Louisiana were beginning to overfill with COVID cases, and just before Hurricane Ida arrived), and in the first few minutes of our conversation he brought up a New Yorker story of Truman Capote 's from the nineteen-fifties, the sixth part of Milan Kundera's \" The Unbearable Lightness of Being ,\" and the novels of Stefan Zweig, to which he'd been alerted by Wes Anderson's \" Grand Budapest Hotel .\" There is a basic disjunction in Dreher's person, in that he reads everything, stays in touch with intellectuals of all kinds from all places, and is in even mundane ways alert to changes in the modern world-when a recommendation for an especially great ice machine went viral, Dreher tweeted that he'd bought and loved it-and yet insists that the whole thing is going over a cliff. Again and again, he insists that liberal journalistic, academic, even corporate institutions are so intolerant that they would never employ someone like him. He tends to have a particular  effect on liberal intellectuals, whom he charms and spooks at once.\n\nSince Dreher's return from Hungary, he told me, he had been thinking about Orbán in terms of Huey P. Long, the famed Depression-era governor of Louisiana who denounced the oil companies, fired hundreds of bureaucrats, and replaced them with patronage appointments-another corrupt populist. Having met in downtown Baton Rouge, and spent a little while talking while looking out at the unvegetated Mississippi River, we eventually drove a few minutes to Long's monumental tombstone, on the grounds of the Louisiana statehouse, which was built by Long himself. The statehouse is the tallest building in Baton Rouge surrounded by twenty-seven acres of well-tended but mostly empty gardens; it's still probably the most interesting-looking structure in the city. We were looking at a monument to a pre-liberal politics while considering a post-liberal future.\n\nDreher recalled the memories that his late father, raised poor in Depression-era Louisiana, had of Long. \"He said, 'When I was a kid, the only reason we had schoolbooks, new schoolbooks, was because of Huey Long. And so what if Long skimmed a lot off the top? I didn't care because Long was someone who tamed the oil companies, and broke the oligarchy's hold on Louisiana's politics.' \" There was, Dreher admitted, a \"downside\" to Long's governance, in the institutional corruption that he bequeathed to the state. \"But you can't understand why Huey Long got into power until you understand why people voted for him. Same thing with Orbán.\"\n\nIt was ninety-five degrees out, shirt-drenching weather, and we didn't linger by Long's tombstone. Soon enough, we settled into an outdoor table at a sports bar called the Chimes, near L.S.U.'s campus. Dreher's son Matt, who was about to begin his junior year, texted that he'd seen us walking across the road into the Chimes, and would be joining us soon. The Little League World Series was on the television, but the conversation turned to Dreher's latest book, \"Live Not by Lies.\" In general, Dreher's subjects shared his view that whatever institutional power conservatives could muster was helpless against the soft totalitarianism of progressive media. \"Look, in my home town, St. Francisville, a friend of mine is sending me pictures of same-sex couples going to middle-school dances,\" he said. \"A Westerner who teaches in a Polish high school, he told me there is no institution in this country-not the state, not the church, not the family-that has more influence over children than social media. For better or worse.\"\n\nAmerican conservatives, Dreher went on, were just beginning to intuit how deep this soft totalitarianism ran. \"You might not be that political, you might not even be that religious, but you know that your kids, in order to gain access to élite circles in business or anywhere else, are going to have to disavow the things you taught them,\" he said. \"That's where you see the parallel between that and what the Romanians are thinking-that your way of life, your traditions, your religion, it's all unworthy.\" Dreher said that he was struck by \"how much more clear-eyed the European Christians are about what we're facing than the American Christians. American Christians are so lost in past glory, and the idea that we're only one election away from winning America back for Christ, but just not aware of how shallow and fragile the faith is here. Over there, they have lived through generations of de-Christianization.\" He talked it through for a little while longer. \"America is about ten years away from being where they are, I think.\"\n\nThe longer we talked about Hungary, the more Dreher returned to the analogy with America, as if by describing Orbán's struggle in terms of the culture war he might encourage American conservatives to see themselves as more existentially threatened. \"I don't believe anybody is coming to kill us social and religious conservatives,\" Dreher said. \"But it is beyond clear to me now that the woke left, which controls all the major institutions of American life, will use the power it has to push people like me to the margins, and congratulate itself for its righteousness in doing so.\" When I asked why he'd reached out to Carlson, he said, \"I'll tell you exactly what it was. I wanted to move the Overton window.\" Dreher said that he believed Orbánism couldn't work in the United States-we were simply too multicultural a society to rally around an explicit cultural nationalism-but he thought there were elements that American conservatives ought to learn from. (Carlson, in his broadcast, had emphasized the same point.) \"Trump fights like a drunk falling off a barstool,\" Dreher said. \"Orbán fights like people say Trump fights.\"\n\nWe were sitting, at that moment, less than three hours from the border of Texas, whose legislature had just effectively banned abortion , a measure that would soon be upheld by the United States Supreme Court-it certainly didn't seem to me that social conservatism was in its death throes, or that it needed an Orbán to defend it. The evidence was that it had plenty of effective attorneys. To Dreher, the more salient issue wasn't abortion, on which his side was winning, but gay and transgender identity. \"I don't know a single conservative who wants to push gay people back in the closet,\" Dreher said, but he believed that there had never been an \"honest conversation about the irreconciliability of gay rights with religious liberty\" for traditional believers of all faiths. I asked Dreher to explain why trans rights had become such a flash point for social conservatives, and he responded in part by saying that my own young daughter might someday lose out on an athletic scholarship to a \"pseudo-woman\"-a trans woman who had won entry into high-school athletic competitions. I said, \"I mean, so what?\" Dreher seemed unsure that he'd heard me correctly. \"What do you mean, so what ?\" he repeated. \"It's unfair.\"\n\nJust when it seemed that we might have reached a basic impasse, the tension was eased by the arrival of Matt Dreher-taller than his father, with the same observant manner and the same shock of hair, though redder. His father had introduced him, affectionately, as \"a Bernie bro\"; Matt turned out to be a pro-urbanist liberal who was thinking about a career in museums. We talked a bit about Hungary and then I asked Matt whether his experience of L.S.U. was that it was drenched in woke discourse. \"No,\" Matt said slowly. \"And this is why I think it's really useful to live one's life in the real world-offline.\" Dreher, who was listening intently, objected: L.S.U., a state school deep in the South, wasn't the worst of it; imagine the situation at Brown University, he said. He and Matt were affectionately interested in each other's observations, and, as they talked about their experiences in Hungary, I wondered whether Dreher had invited his son to provide me with a prelapsarian counterpoint to most contemporary political discourse-defined, in his view, by the fact that Americans no longer treat one another like family. Matt Dreher said that when he watched Tucker Carlson's special he was \"begging, begging!\" for Carlson to bring up Orbán's vaccine-passport policy, which is strict and might have challenged the anti-vax Fox News party line, but the host never did. His father, who is also pro-vaccination, laughed. Matt Dreher later told me that his and his father's politics were separated mostly by a matter of orientation: both believed that Christianity was disappearing as a key element of Western culture, and as a result the secularizing West was changing rapidly. The difference was that the father saw these changes as horrifying, while the son saw some possibilities among them, too.\n\nConservatism in 2021 has been a dark and fertile ecology, just beginning to bloom in the shadow of the Trump wars. Its central fights have been over critical race theory , and woke capitalism, and the school boards and public-health officials insisting on masking and pleading for vaccination; conservatives have often insisted that the progressive consensus amounts to a powerful and restrictive regime, one that forces dissenters to self-police or risk losing their livelihoods. If progressives fear that Trumpian populism might someday be powerful enough to drive those who disobey it from their jobs, the Times' Ross Douthat argued recently , conservatives \"fear that progressivism already exerts this power.\" Dreher's Hungary foray, and Carlson's, served as an invitation for conservatives to take their own loose talk about soft totalitarianism and the oppressiveness of cancel culture literally and to consider post-liberal political models. Dreher said, \"I'm supposed to be grieved over how Viktor Orbán is being mean to C.E.U.\"-Central European University-\"when, back in my own country, leftist professors and leftist administrators are making it all but impossible for any non-woke professor or student to thrive on campus or even to exist peaceably? Please.\" Hungary supplied a darkening, by analogy. \"Sides have to be taken,\" he went on. \"Orbán is no saint, but I know whose side I'm on.\"\n\nFor Dreher, there is always a precipice. In Hungary, Dreher told me, he was continually astonished by reminders-historical, architectural-of how glorious the Habsburg civilization had been, immediately before the First World War. He said, \"I can't get enough of it. To see how a civilization at the pinnacle of its power-cultural and technological power-can implode and destroy itself. I think I'm haunted by that all the time.\" He mentioned a scene that recurs often in his writing, of standing on the Brooklyn Bridge on the morning of September 11, 2001, and watching the World Trade Center's south tower come down. Dreher said, \"Everything can turn in just a few minutes. The whole world can change. And I probably am somewhat alarmist on this sort of thing. At the same time, I think I am more sensitive to it than other people.\"\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "J. D. Vance and the Empty Promises of Conservative Economic Populism\n\nIn the great sweep of American history, convention speeches by Vice-Presidential candidates don't figure prominently. Hand on heart, who can remember what Mike Pence said four years ago? Let alone what Joe Biden said in 2008, or Al Gore in 1992. The inglorious history of these speeches reflects the inglorious nature of the office of the Vice-Presidency. But is it possible that last Wednesday's address at the R.N.C., in Milwaukee, by J. D. Vance , Donald Trump's 2024 running mate , will prove an exception?\n\nAfter doing some obligatory bowing and scraping to the man at the top of the ticket, the thirty-nine-year-old junior senator from Ohio practically stomped on the grave of neoliberalism , the internationalist, corporate-friendly, free-market economic philosophy that dominated the Republican Party from 1980 to 2016. Vance criticized NAFTA , decried \"unlimited global trade,\" gave a shout-out to Social Security, used the term \"Big Business\" pejoratively, conspicuously avoided the budget deficit and the national debt, and proclaimed that Trump's G.O.P. was done \"catering to Wall Street.\" \"We'll commit to the working man,\" he added.\n\nIt should be noted immediately that, before Vance went into politics, he worked in venture capital. Was he asking us to seriously entertain the notion that his party-the party of Donald Trump, Stephen A. Schwarzman (Blackstone), Ken Griffin (Citadel), and the hedge-fund billionaires John Paulson and Paul Singer -is turning its back on Wall Street and trickle-down economics? Evidently, he was.\n\nHours before Vance delivered his speech, I spoke with Scott Winship, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, who reminded me that the Ohioan emerged in Washington policy circles about a decade ago as part of a \"tribe that everyone has forgotten about: the reform conservatives.\" Winship was also a part of this group, whose thought leaders included Yuval Levin, the founding editor of National Affairs , and Ramesh Ponnuru, who is now the editor of National Review . The basic thrust of the movement was that the Republican Party needed to move beyond the tax cuts and deregulation with which it had been associated since the days of Ronald Reagan and Milton Friedman , and that it should tackle pocketbook issues, such as child care, health care, and job displacement. Winship, who is an expert on inequality and poverty, noted that, back then, Vance was writing articles for the National Review about subjects that reform conservatives were interested in, including social mobility and education. But in 2016, Winship went on, the nascent movement got \"blindsided\" by the success of the nationalist and nativist appeals of the Trump campaign. \"What we were offering was clearly not what the Republican electorate was looking for at the time,\" he said.\n\nThat year, the publication of Vance's memoir , \" Hillbilly Elegy ,\" saw him hailed as the voice of the Rust Belt, a somewhat dubious coronation. The book described social breakdown, including drug use and unemployment, in white, working-class communities, placing much of the blame on the behavioral traits of the inhabitants themselves rather than on economic factors like globalization and offshoring. After the book's publication, Vance moved back to Ohio and considered getting into politics. But for several more years he stayed in venture capital, working for firms founded by Peter Thiel and Steve Case, two tech billionaires, and then co-founding a new firm, Narya Capital, with backing from Thiel and two more tech billionaires, Eric Schmidt and Marc Andreessen . When Vance ran for Senate, in 2022, he associated himself with a new movement on the right of the Republican Party, national conservatism, which combines economic nationalism and social conservatism with an embrace of the culture war. In this framework, the social problems afflicting working-class communities are seen as the product of larger economic factors rather than individual failings.\n\nTwo publications from 2022 and 2023 have sought to encapsulate the essence of national conservatism. One of them, a statement of principles from the Edmund Burke Foundation, says that \"globalized markets allow hostile foreign powers to despoil America and other countries of their manufacturing capacity, weakening them economically and dividing them internally.\" The other, a report from American Compass, a think tank founded in 2020 by Oren Cass, a former campaign aide to Mitt Romney, of all people, also lambastes the effects of globalization and adds an excessive focus on finance and financial markets to the list of modern capitalism's ailments. \"Financialization shifted the economy's center of gravity from Main Street to Wall Street, fueling an explosion in corporate profits alongside stagnating wages and declining investment,\" Cass wrote, in an introduction to the report. \"The decline of unions cost workers power in the market, voice in the workplace, and access to a vital source of communal support.\" American capitalism should be rebuilt, Cass says, so that it \"serves not only the family and community, but also the nation.\" Vance's convention speech was squarely in this vein. \"We're going to build factories again, put people to work making real products for American families, made with the hands of American workers,\" he said.\n\nSome of the language of national conservatism seems a lot closer to Trump's America First rhetoric than the wonky prescriptions of the original reform conservatives. \"Unfortunately, Vance has been wooed by this story that the folks at American Compass are telling,\" Winship told me, adding that the think tank's policy agenda was not grounded in evidence and likely wouldn't work. When I asked him to identify some breaking points between national conservatives and reform conservatives, he cited three: the former's rejection of free trade, their skepticism about economic growth as a promoter of working-class living standards, and their belief that reviving manufacturing employment is the key to reviving American communities. \"They have this nineteen-fifties view of work and marriage,\" Winship said, dismissively.\n\nFrom one perspective, it's easy to sympathize with Winship's critique. The modern U.S. economy is dominated by service industries; manufacturing output accounted for just 10.1 per cent of G.D.P. in the first quarter of 2024. It's surely unrealistic to think that American society can be reorganized on a model that last flourished a half century ago. At the same time, though, some of the language used by Cass and other national conservatives to describe certain aspects of modern capitalism mimics arguments long made by progressive Democrats. In theory, it's possible to imagine a world in which some members of the two groups formed an alliance of convenience to support certain efforts, including strong antitrust enforcement, increased funding for worker training, and expanded child tax credits, although the conservatives' insistence on strict work requirements could well be a sticking point on the last one. During Vance's brief time in the Senate, he expressed support for bipartisan pieces of legislation designed to strengthen the regulation of commercial railroads, eliminate tax breaks for corporate mergers, and break the Visa-Mastercard stranglehold on credit-card payments and reduce fees.\n\nOf course, being a junior senator and attaching your name to legislation that has little chance of being enacted-none of those have bills passed-is very different from being Vice-President and chief lickspittle to Trump. And there are serious doubts about Vance's actual commitment to the \"working man.\" His campaign for Senate was largely financed by Thiel and other right-leaning billionaires, and his voting record on issues of interest to the labor movement has earned him a rating score of zero from the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Last week, Politico reported that he may no longer advocate for the credit-card bill that would disrupt the Visa-Mastercard duopoly.\n\nTrump, of course, beyond an affinity for tariffs and tax cuts, has no real economic ideology. In his first Administration, he balanced economic nationalists, such as Steve Bannon, Peter Navarro, and Robert Lighthizer, with plenty of Wall Street types, including Steven Mnuchin, Gary Cohn, and Larry Kudlow. If Trump gets reëlected, he'll most likely do the same thing again. In an interview published last week, he told Bloomberg that he was eying Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, for Treasury Secretary.\n\nIt seems unlikely that Dimon-whom Trump described last year on Truth Social as a \"highly overrated Globalist\"-would take the Treasury job, but the mere fact that he brought him up is instructive. For all the lip service that the former President pays to standing up for the little guy, he has always held in great esteem , and aspired to improve his standing among, the financial élite and billionaire class. And his policies, if not his rhetoric, have reflected this reality.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2020, Trump talked frequently about reviving manufacturing, but he didn't do much about it. Now he is threatening to undo much of the Biden Administration's genuinely ambitious industrial-policy achievements. In his rambling convention speech last week, he repeated his pledge to eliminate federal subsidies for the purchase of electric vehicles, which have helped spark a spate of investments in new car plants . (Across a variety of bills, Biden has committed to spending more than a hundred billion dollars a year for five years on clean-energy technologies, semiconductors, and public infrastructure, doubling previous levels of spending.)\n\nWhat else would Trump do in 2025? In public speeches and meetings with donors, he has pledged universal tariffs on imported goods, which would raise prices; mass deportations, which would exacerbate labor shortages ; and an extension of tax cuts that were introduced in the G.O.P.'s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which are due to expire at the end of next year. In the Bloomberg interview, he also said he'd like to further reduce the corporate tax rate to fifteen per cent.\n\nThe 2017 bill already slashed the corporate rate from thirty-five per cent to twenty-one per cent. And it's worth being reminded of just how slanted toward the rich the bill's personal tax cuts were and are. In 2025, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center that was done at the time of the bill's passage, the cuts will boost the after-tax income of a typical middle-class household by $910, or less than twenty dollars a week. A household in the one per cent will enjoy a boost of more than sixty thousand dollars a year, and a household in the 0.1 per cent will see an annual gain of more than a quarter million dollars.\n\nThat's what conservative populism looked like during the first Trump Administration, and it's hard to imagine it would look much different in a second Trump term: tariffs, tax cuts for the rich, and mass deportations. Two other issues to watch would be financial regulation and antitrust. Vance has coupled his criticisms of Wall Street with praise for Lina Khan , the trust-busting head of Biden's Federal Trade Commission. But, if Trump gets reëlected, the Wall Street and corporate wings of the Republican Party, including some of Vance's billionaire donors, would be looking for regulatory relief and the appointment at the F.T.C. of someone more sympathetic to Big Business than Kahn. Would Vance have the power, or the inclination, to thwart them?\n\nAnother potential flash point would be government spending. Even if Vance could talk Trump into supporting some of the policies for which national conservatives have advocated, such as expanded tax credits to working families and subsidies to employers who provide worker training to non-college graduates, they would likely run into opposition from many Republicans on Capitol Hill. With the budget deficit running at more than six per cent of G.D.P. and another battle over raising the debt ceiling in the offing, the next Congress seems likely to be focussed on restricting spending rather than launching new programs.\n\nLast month, American Compass put out a new budget model , suggesting ways to cut spending and raise revenues. Its \"moderate case\" included returning spending on \"federal anti-poverty and means-tested programs\" to its 2019 level and capping it there. The areas affected would include child-nutrition programs, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and housing- and community-development programs, all of which are meant to help the poor. Regardless of the label attached to conservative thinking about policy, some elements of it don't change. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Why Are Conservatives More Susceptible to Believing Lies?\n\nPhoto illustration by Natalie Matthews-Ramo. Photos by FoxNews and FoxNews.com.\n\nMany conservatives have a loose relationship with facts. The right-wing denial of what most people think of as accepted reality starts with political issues: As recently as 2016, 45 percent of Republicans still believed that the Affordable Care Act included \"death panels\" (it doesn't). A 2015 poll found that 54 percent of GOP primary voters believed then-President Obama to be a Muslim (...he isn't).\n\nThen there are the false beliefs about generally accepted science. Only 25 percent of self-proclaimed Trump voters agree that climate change is caused by human activities. Only 43 percent of Republicans overall believe that humans have evolved over time.\n\nAnd then it gets really crazy. Almost 1 in 6 Trump voters, while simultaneously viewing photographs of the crowds at the 2016 inauguration of Donald Trump and at the 2012 inauguration of Barack Obama , insisted that the former were larger. Sixty-six percent of self-described \"very conservative\" Americans seriously believe that \"Muslims are covertly implementing Sharia law in American courts.\" Forty-six percent of Trump voters polled just after the 2016 election either thought that Hillary Clinton was connected to a child sex trafficking ring run out of the basement of a pizzeria in Washington, D.C., or weren't sure if it was true.\n\nIf \"truth\" is judged on the basis of Enlightenment ideas of reason and more or less objective \"evidence,\" many of the substantive positions common on the right seem to border on delusional. The left is certainly not immune to credulity (most commonly about the safety of vaccines, GMO foods, and fracking), but the right seems to specialize in it. \"Misinformation is currently predominantly a pathology of the right,\" concluded a team of scholars from the Harvard Kennedy School and Northeastern University at a February 2017 conference. A BuzzFeed analysis found that three main hyperconservative Facebook pages were roughly twice as likely as three leading ultraliberal Facebook pages to publish fake or misleading information.\n\nWhy are conservatives so susceptible to misinformation? The right wing's disregard for facts and reasoning is not a matter of stupidity or lack of education. College-educated Republicans are actually more likely than less-educated Republicans to have believed that Barack Obama was a Muslim and that \"death panels\" were part of the ACA . And for political conservatives, but not for liberals, greater knowledge of science and math is associated with a greater likelihood of dismissing what almost all scientists believe about the human causation of global warming.\n\nIt's also not just misinformation gained from too many hours listening to Fox News, either, because correcting the falsehoods doesn't change their opinions . For example, nine months following the release of President Obama's long-form birth certificate, the percentage of Republicans who believed that he was not American-born was actually higher than before the release. Similarly, during the 2012 presidential campaign, Democrats corrected their previous overestimates of the unemployment rate after the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the actual data. Republicans' overestimated even more than before .\n\nPart of the problem is widespread suspicion of facts-any facts. Both mistrust of scientists and other \"experts\" and mistrust of the mass media that reports what scientists and experts believe have increased among conservatives (but not among liberals) since the early '80s. The mistrust has in part, at least, been deliberately inculcated. The fossil fuel industry publicizes studies to confuse the climate change debate; Big Pharma hides unfavorable information on drug safety and efficacy; and many schools in conservative areas teach students that evolution is \"just a theory.\" The public is understandably confused about both the findings and methods of science. \"Fake news\" deliberately created for political or economic gain and Donald Trump's claims that media sites that disagree with him are \"fake news\" add to the mistrust.\n\nBut, the gullibility of many on the right seems to have deeper roots even than this. That may be because at the most basic level, conservatives and liberals seem to hold different beliefs about what constitutes \"truth.\" Finding facts and pursuing evidence and trusting science is part of liberal ideology itself. For many conservatives, faith and intuition and trust in revealed truth appear as equally valid sources of truth.\n\nTo understand how these differences manifest and what we might do about them, it helps to understand how all humans reason and rationalize: In other words, let's take a detour into psychology. Freud distinguished between \"errors\" on the one hand, \"illusions\" and \"delusions\" on the other. Errors, he argued, simply reflect lack of knowledge or poor logic; Aristotle's belief that vermin form out of dung was an error. But illusions and delusions are based on conscious or unconscious wishes ; Columbus's belief that he had found a new route to the Indies was a delusion based on his wish that he had done so.\n\nAlthough Freud is out of favor with many contemporary psychologists, modern cognitive psychology suggests that he was on the right track. The tenacity of many of the right's beliefs in the face of evidence, rational arguments, and common sense suggest that these beliefs are not merely alternate interpretations of facts but are instead illusions rooted in unconscious wishes.\n\nThis is a very human thing to do. As popular writers such as Daniel Kahneman , Cass Sunstein, and Richard Thaler have pointed out, we often use shortcuts when we reason, shortcuts that enable us to make decisions quickly and with little expenditure of mental energy. But they also often lead us astray-we underestimate the risks of events that unfold slowly and whose consequences are felt only over the long term (think global warming ) and overestimate the likelihood of events that unfold rapidly and have immediate consequences (think terrorist attacks ).\n\nOur reasoning is also influenced ( motivated , psychologists would say) by our emotions and instincts. This manifests in all kinds of ways: We need to maintain a positive self-image, to stave off anxiety and guilt, and to preserve social relationships. We also seek to maintain consistency in our beliefs, meaning that when people simultaneously hold two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values, one or the other must go. And so we pay more attention and give more credence to information and assertions that confirm what we already believe: Liberals enthusiastically recount even the most tenuous circumstantial evidence of Trump campaign collusion with the Russians, and dyed-in-the-wool Trump supporters happily believe that the crowd really was bigger at his candidate's inauguration.\n\nThese limits to \"objective\" reasoning apply to everyone, of course-left and right. Why is it that conservatives have taken the lead in falling off the deep edge?\n\nThe answer, I think, lies in the interaction between reasoning processes and personality. It's each person's particular motivations and particular psychological makeup that affects how they search for information, what information they pay attention to, how they assess the accuracy and meaning of the information, what information they retain, and what conclusions they draw. But conservatives and liberals typically differ in their particular psychological makeups. And if you add up all of these particular differences, you get two groups that are systematically motivated to believe different things.\n\nPsychologists have repeatedly reported that self-described conservatives tend to place a higher value than those to their left on deference to tradition and authority. They are more likely to value stability, conformity, and order, and have more difficulty tolerating novelty and ambiguity and uncertainty. They are more sensitive than liberals to information suggesting the possibility of danger than to information suggesting benefits. And they are more moralistic and more likely to repress unconscious drives towards unconventional sexuality.\n\nFairness and kindness place lower on the list of moral priorities for conservatives than for liberals. Conservatives show a stronger preference for higher status groups, are more accepting of inequality and injustice, and are less empathic (at least towards those outside their immediate family). As one Tea Party member told University of California sociologist Arlie Hochschild , \"People think we are not good people if we don't feel sorry for blacks and immigrants and Syrian refugees. But I am a good person and I don't feel sorry for them.\"\n\nBaptist minister and former Republican congressman J.C. Watts put it succinctly. Campaigning for Sen. Rand Paul in Iowa in 2015 he observed, \"The difference between Republicans and Democrats is that Republicans believe people are fundamentally bad , while Democrats see people as fundamentally good.\"\n\nThese conservative traits lead directly to conservative views on many issues, just as liberal traits tend to lead to liberal views on many issues. But when you consider how these conservative traits and these conservative views interact with commonly shared patterns of motivated reasoning, it becomes clearer why conservatives may be more likely to run into errors in reasoning and into difficulty judging accurately what is true and what is false.\n\nIt's not just that Trump is \"their\" president, so they want to defend him. Conservatives' greater acceptance of hierarchy and trust in authority may lead to greater faith that what the president says must be true, even when the \"facts\" would seem to indicate otherwise. The New York Times cataloged no less than 117 clearly false statements proclaimed publicly by Trump in the first six months of his presidency, with no evident loss in his supporters' faith in him. In the same way, greater faith in the legitimacy of the decisions of corporate CEOs may strengthen the tendency to deny evidence that there are any potential benefits from regulation of industry.\n\nSimilarly, greater valuation of stability, greater sensitivity to the possibility of danger, and greater difficulty tolerating difference and change lead to greater anxiety about social change and so support greater credulity with respect to lurid tales of the dangers posed by immigrants. And higher levels of repression and greater adherence to tradition and traditional sources of moral judgment increase the credibility of claims that gay marriage is a threat to the \"traditional\" family.\n\nConservatives are also less introspective , less attentive to their inner feelings, and less likely to override their \"gut\" reactions and engage in further reflection to find a correct answer. As a result, they may be more likely to rely on error-prone cognitive shortcuts, less aware of their own unconscious biases, and less likely to respond to factual corrections to previously held beliefs.\n\nThe differences in how conservatives and liberals process information are augmented by an asymmetry in group psychological processes. Yes, we all seek to keep our social environment stable and predictable. Beliefs that might threaten relationships with family, neighbors, and friends (e.g., for a fundamentalist evangelical to believe that humans are the result of Darwinian evolution or for a coal miner to believe that climate change is real and human-made) must be ignored or denied, at peril of disrupting the relationships. But among all Americans, the intensity of social networks has declined in recent years. Church attendance and union membership, participation in community organizations, and direct political involvement have flagged. Conservatives come disproportionately from rural areas and small towns, where social networks remain smaller , but denser and more homogeneous than in the big cities that liberals dominate. As a result, the opinions of family, friends, and community may be more potent in conservative hotbeds than in the more anonymous big cities where Democrats dominate.\n\nThe lack of shared reality between left and right in America today has contributed greatly to our current political polarization. Despite occasional left forays into reality denial, conservatives are far more likely to accept misinformation and outright lies. Deliberate campaigns of misinformation and conservative preferences for information that fits in with their pre-existing ideology provide only a partial explanation. Faulty reasoning and judgment, rooted in the interactions between modes of reasoning and judgment shared by all with the specific personality patterns found disproportionately among conservatives may also play a central role.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Even the Supreme Court's Conservatives Are Fed Up With the Garbage Coming Out of the 5th Circuit\n\nWhat happens when a lawless judge and a terrible appeals court embrace the dopiest First Amendment claim you've ever heard out of pure spite toward a Democratic president? That would be Murthy v. Missouri , a brain-meltingly dumb case that the Supreme Court was unfortunate enough to hear oral arguments in on Monday. Murthy poses a question so asinine that to ask it is to answer it: Can government officials encourage social media companies to moderate certain content that they deem harmful-most importantly, disinformation about COVID-19 in the middle of the pandemic?\n\nYes, of course they can: The First Amendment does not gag public officials from urging Facebook or the Washington Post or anyone else to publish or not publish certain information, especially when it contains dangerous lies about a once-in-a-century pandemic that could exacerbate the crisis. The First Amendment bars government censorship, not government persuasion, and the Biden administration planted itself on the latter side of that bright line. At least six justices grasped this basic constitutional principle on Monday. Several of them used arguments to highlight how this inane case illustrates so much of what's wrong with the judiciary today, and hinted at the dangers it could pose to American democracy in the future. That we should pay attention to. The rest was an unfortunate sideshow.\n\nLike so many Supreme Court cases these days, Murthy is built atop a heap of fake facts. The case began when Missouri and Louisiana sued agencies and officials across the Biden administration, falsely accusing them of coercing social media companies into censoring their residents' free speech. (These states later added a handful of fringe anti-vaxxers to the suit.) They filed their complaint in the Monroe Division of the Western District of Louisiana, where-surprise!-they were guaranteed to draw a Trump appointee, Terry Doughty, the one judge hearing cases in that division. Judge Doughty has a record of issuing nationwide injunctions against the Biden administration on the basis of dubious legal and factual analysis. Most notably, he issued a nationwide bar against Biden's vaccine mandate for health care workers in an opinion riddled with anti-vax nonsense (which the Supreme Court reversed ).\n\nDoughty, in other words, was certain to rule against Biden in the social media case. Even still, the opinion he handed down on July 4, 2023, was a humiliating mess of contradictions, fabrications , and (ironically) misinformation . Doughty adopted the plaintiffs' theory that the administration \"coerced\" social media companies into removing \"conservative\" speech about COVID, including posts promoting hydroxychloroquine and rejecting the efficacy of vaccines. He accused government officials of launching a \"coordinated campaign\" to silence conservatives by forcing private companies to take down anti-vax content, as well as false claims about election fraud. And he issued one of the most sweeping injunctions in the history of the American legal system, prohibiting any employee-including Homeland Security, the State Department, the Department of Justice, and the FBI-from \"engaging in any communication of any kind with social-media companies\" encouraging content moderation.\n\nDoughty, it turns out, grievously butchered the record to reach his conclusion. An exhaustive analysis by Mike Masnick proves that Doughty consistently misrepresented testimony and other evidence in the record to construct a conspiracy theory with zero basis in reality. He distorted emails and other exchanges to make them look coercive when they were nothing of the sort, cherry-picking and rearranging quotations to put them in a censorious light. Yet the hard-right U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5 th Circuit, where law goes to die , affirmed Doughty's conclusions and upheld much of his injunction (while narrowing it in part). That move sent the administration racing to the Supreme Court for an emergency stay, which it granted in October, over the dissents of Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Clarence Thomas. Monday's arguments confirmed that a majority is prepared to side with Biden on the merits.\n\nThe justices did not sound happy to have the case before them. Justice Sonia Sotomayor scolded Louisiana Solicitor General Benjamin Aguiñaga (a former Alito clerk) for his lack of candor. \"I have such a problem with your brief,\" she told him. \"You omit information that changes the context of some of your claims. You attribute things to people who it didn't happen to.\" Aguiñaga was unable to defend Doughty's more extreme deceptions. So he had to fall back on what Justice Elena Kagan called an \"extremely expansive\" argument: the notion that \"encouraging people to suppress their own speech\" violates the First Amendment, even if it isn't coercive. Kagan drew upon her past work in the executive branch to explain that, actually, government officials do this all the time . \"I've had some experience encouraging press to suppress their own speech,\" Kagan told Aguiñaga. Example: \"You just wrote a bad editorial. Here are the five reasons you shouldn't write another one.\" Is that really unconstitutional?\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh, a former White House staff secretary, also provided a real-world perspective after Alito fumed that officials had been too mean to the platforms and would never treat the traditional press so sharply. Kavanaugh gave Alito a reality check: \"I'd assumed, thought, [and] experienced government press people throughout the federal government who regularly call up the media and berate them,\" he told Deputy Solicitor General Brian Fletcher, who defended the administration. \"You said the anger was unusual. I wasn't entirely clear on that from my own experience.\" Translation: Government employees yell at members of the media all the time. The media can accept or reject their requests. That is how it works .\n\nBut did Biden officials berate social media employees? Only on a few rare occasions. Here's what really happened: The platforms in question, most prominently Facebook and Twitter, invited the government to help them identify and remove the most toxic disinformation. At the time, as Fletcher explained, these companies were eager to present themselves as \"partners\" with the administration in its push for COVID vaccination. Officials could \"flag\" questionable content, but the platforms made their own judgment calls, without any demonstrable fear of retaliation. Everyone agrees that the government violates free speech when it explicitly coerces companies into censoring expression under the threat of punishment. But, Fletcher persuasively argued, no such thing happened here.\n\nThat left Aguiñaga to lean on the theory that the government contravenes the First Amendment when it merely \"encourages\" specific content moderation. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a stickler for legible rules, sounded borderline aghast at this baggy, boundless standard; she lobbed a series of hypotheticals at Aguiñaga that showed he was pushing a meaningless and impracticable test. Chief Justice John Roberts tried to help Aguiñaga understand that multiple agencies with competing agendas may pressure platforms in contradictory directions; doesn't that \"dilute the concept of coercion significantly?\" (Aguiñaga just sounded confused.) Kavanaugh pointed out that the plaintiffs' position could prevent officials from urging the press to safeguard national security by, for instance, asserting that a forthcoming article might imperil the troops.\n\nEven Gorsuch, who started out sympathetic to Aguiñaga, was exasperated by the end, complaining that Doughty's \"universal injunction\" was part of the \"epidemic\" that had to be stopped. Only Alito and Thomas sounded like surefire votes for the plaintiffs after nearly two hours of arguments, and Thomas' heart was not fully in it. Alito stood alone in his increasingly uncontrolled and seething aggrievement .\n\nThe pandemic may be over, but Murthy remains a hugely relevant case. Perhaps most obviously, it is a cautionary tale about the extremism of Trump judges like Doughty, who keep issuing these lawless injunctions at the behest of red-state politicians, and the 5 th Circuit, which keeps upholding them. A disproportionate number of the Supreme Court's cases this term emerge from the 5 th Circuit, which keeps appeasing the Trump-appointed zealots attempting to seize unimaginable amounts of power from the democratic branches. The chief justice is attempting to crack down on the kind of judge-shopping that occurred here, but the fight is just beginning. The evident frustration of Roberts, Kavanaugh, Barrett, and even Gorsuch on Monday suggests that a majority of the court is fed up with this political manipulation of the judiciary by rogue judges with undisguised partisan loyalties.\n\nSo, yes, SCOTUS is likely to reach the right result in Murthy . Alarmingly, though, so much damage has already been done. In light of Doughty's injunction, the federal government shut down all of its efforts to combat disinformation, fearful of judicial sanctions. Bad actors have exploited this development to flood the internet with lies about the upcoming 2024 election. If foreign entities attempt to interfere with the election via social media, the Biden administration will have few tools left to fight them. It is just too late to revive the various task forces that worked with platforms before Doughty disbanded them last year. For the Murthy plaintiffs, then, a Supreme Court defeat may not matter much. They have already done immense damage to truth and transparency on the internet. And at this late date, the worst of it cannot be undone.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Why Are Conservatives So Obsessed With Gun Rights Anyway?\n\nWhy has support for gun rights become a hallmark of the Republican Party ? There is nothing inevitable about the combination of economic and foreign policy conservatism with social conservatism. As late as the mid-1980s, conservative icons including Ronald Reagan supported gun control measures such as the Brady bill and a ban on assault weapons . Support for gun control legislation actually increased among Republicans in the 1980s. Unambiguous support for gun \"rights\" didn't appear in the Republican Party platform until 1988 . Even the National Rifle Association did not become fanatically opposed to any and all gun regulations until the late 1970s .\n\nDuring his 2008 primary campaign against Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama famously proposed a crude psychological explanation for why traditionally Democratic-leaning groups of voters were being drawn to Republican positions on social issues. Industrial jobs had disappeared from the small towns of Pennsylvania and the Midwest, he noted, and Republicans and Democrats alike had failed to address the distress of these communities. So, he said, it's not surprising that \"they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion .\"\n\nObama's explanation was superficially plausible (and has been widely adapted to explain the appeal of Donald Trump), but the facts provide little support for it. For one thing, the increase in attachment to guns that Obama lamented never actually happened. The percentage of American households owning a gun has declined steadily since the mid-1970s. For another, support for gun \"rights\" is actually stronger among more affluent Americans than among poorer Americans, the very ones who are supposed to be \"bitter.\"\n\nIn any case, events do not precede their causes. It is hard to find much evidence of the \"Great Bitterness\" before the past two decades , long after the decline in manufacturing and agricultural employment was already underway and long after the Republican Party's shift to strong opposition to gun control .\n\nA more workable psychological explanation begins by noting that psychologists have found consistent differences between conservatives and liberals in personality traits, attitudes, and moral stances. To summarize some of the research findings , conservatives tend to be more likely than liberals to accept or even embrace authority that is perceived to be legitimate. Conservatives tend to be more moralistic and more conventional than liberals. They tend to have a stronger need for order and control and stability and a greater dislike of change.\n\nConservatives also tend to value equality less than liberals. They have less empathy and are more likely to see human nature as bad . Compared with liberals, their moral sense is less centered on fairness and kindness and more on loyalty, deference to authority, and moral and sexual purity . Conservatives also show a greater tendency than liberals toward dichotomous thinking and have a stronger need for certainty and cognitive consistency. (\"I don't do nuance,\" George W. Bush famously told Joe Biden. )\n\nThe differences are not universal, of course, and there is nothing intrinsically bad or intrinsically good in the characteristics typical of either camp. But conservatives tend to lean one way, liberals the other.\n\nAnd some of these differences appear to be directly expressed in divergent beliefs relevant to the gun control debate. For example, conservatives' greater need for social order and greater acceptance of aggression as intrinsic to human nature may lead to their taking a more punitive stance with respect to crime, including support for longer prison sentences and for capital punishment . Similarly, the lower value placed by conservatives on empathy and on equality, combined with their greater resistance to change, may lead to their having less sympathy toward the argument that inequality and poverty are breeding grounds for crime and gun violence.\n\nBut the connection between personality and political beliefs and beliefs about gun control is not entirely straightforward. If conservatives respect authority and rules more than liberals and have a greater need for order, why wouldn't they demand gun control rather than gun rights?\n\nA more complex exploration of the relationship between personality characteristics and political beliefs begins with the observation that all human beings, conservative and liberal alike, feel anxiety. And both conservatives and liberals have plenty of things to be anxious about, including financial worries, conflicts in interpersonal relationships, and concerns about physical health or mortality.\n\nConcern about violent crime, terrorism, and school shootings is legitimate, of course. Crime and terrorism are real sources of potential danger, and individual cases of \"illegal immigrants\" committing crimes are not fiction. But people tend to wildly exaggerate the frequency of crime and of terrorism , and the costs and dangers posed by immigrants . The exaggeration stems from several factors. First, we all overattend to especially salient events (and what could be more salient that school children getting mowed down?). We also all tend to overexaggerate the frequency of dangerous events . Second, the media have a profit-based incentive to sensationalize, and social media tends to amplify the panic.\n\nWe all exaggerate risk, but conservatives are especially prone to exaggerate risks. For one thing, conservatives generally tend to see the world as a more dangerous place than liberals do, so they are especially vulnerable to these distortions. They also tend to repress their own aggressive and sexual impulses more and to identify with aggressors . These forbidden impulses may be projected onto others, justifying the decision to see others as a source of danger and legitimizing aggressive responses.\n\nAnxiety about personal danger may resonate with other sources of anxiety. Conservatives are disproportionately concentrated in rural areas and small towns. These are the places that have been most hit by the decline in industrial and agricultural employment of recent decades, with concomitant economic insecurity and community disruption and breakdown. A brooding sense of grievance over no longer being central to American society and culture and a pervasive sense of disempowerment add to the feelings of anxiety.\n\nRegardless of whether or not the sense of threat is realistic, intense feelings of anxiety are intolerable, so people use various overlapping and intersecting strategies to assuage these feelings, to soothe themselves. The healthiest response to realistically based anxieties and other negative feelings would be to address the external sources of the uneasy feelings. As the Injury Control Research Center's director David Hemenway wrote in his book Private Guns, Public Health , \"Within the United States, a wide array of empirical evidence indicates that more guns in a community leads to more homicide.\" Contrary to widespread public belief, the high rate of gun violence in the U.S. has little to do with mental illness . Conversely, an enormous body of evidence shows that gun control- serious, sustained gun control , not merely banning bump stocks or closing the \"gun show loophole\"-effectively and quickly reduces the rate of gun violence of all kinds.\n\nBut it is hard for conservatives to accept these arguments. The interaction between characteristic conservative personality patterns and universally shared patterns of cognition leads to conservatives being disproportionately skeptical of evidence provided by \"experts\" and scholarly studies. So conservatives turn to other means to soothe their anxiety. Some project their own anger onto others, fantasizing that people of color, immigrants, and feminists are the cause of their own inner torments. Anger, if nothing else, makes them feel bigger and more powerful .\n\nOthers, as NYU social psychologist John Jost and his co-authors have pointed out , adopt beliefs that soothe. The beliefs any particular individual adopts must meet several criteria: First and foremost, they must be consistent with the individual's own particular personality structure, which, in turn, has been shaped by genetics and by the individual's upbringing and experiences of the world.\n\nBut as I have already observed , personality patterns are not randomly distributed among the population. The patterns typical of conservatives and liberals tend to diverge. And so the beliefs that can soothe anxiety systematically differ between the two groups.\n\nSecond, the beliefs an individual uses to deal with negative self-feelings must be consistent with already-held beliefs and values and with the need to sustain a positive self-image and a stable sense of identity. That is, we seek to avoid what psychologist Leon Festinger called \" cognitive dissonance .\" And an individual's beliefs are ideally also consistent with preserving their relationships with peers, family, and community. As Yale psychologist Dan Kahan puts it, \"Forming beliefs contrary to the ones that prevail in one's group risks estrangement from others on whom one depends for support, material and emotional.\"\n\nFinally, another particular source of people's beliefs may be identification with a charismatic political figure, such as a Ronald Reagan or a Donald Trump, who proclaims himself to be fighting the dragons on their behalf. Or they may reflect the shared beliefs of a specific organization or movement, in this case perhaps the Moral Majority and the Tea Party. These provide both a language and a narrative for beliefs.\n\nSharing in expressions of anger reduces anxiety and shame, validates one's own otherwise possibly unacceptable urges and feelings, and provides social validation for one's beliefs. But then the need for cognitive consistency takes over: Once you identify with figures or movements, their issues become your issues, regardless of their independent appeal. In any case, a strongly held belief about a specific issue such as \"gun rights\" can help assuage the anxiety that arises directly or indirectly from a felt sense of danger.\n\nThere's another element of the conservative movement that has primed this shift toward gun rights. Historically, the first line of defense against danger is the state. But the rise in individualism of recent decades, the growing paralysis of our national government over recent decades, and intense conservative campaigns to sow mistrust of government as too big, too bureaucratic, and too incompetent combine to make the government an uncertain ally. A superficially realistic and healthy response is for individuals to take matters into their own hands and arm themselves to protect themselves and their families.\n\nAnd then, when that same government that can't be relied on for protection seems about to remove our right to protect ourselves, it becomes yet another source of pseudorealistic anxiety. Anger and commitment to \"gun rights\" are a sure way to soothe oneself, and it becomes quickly fused with the rest of the conservative agenda.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Why Are There So Few Conservatives in Academia?\n\nPete Marovich/Getty Images\n\nThis question originally appeared on Quora , the knowledge-sharing network where compelling questions are answered by people with unique insights. You can follow Quora on Twitter , Facebook , and Google Plus .\n\nAnswer by Jordan Boyd Graber :\n\nI'm a professor. I'm fairly centrist (fiscally conservative, socially liberal, generally pro-market libertarian), which makes me very right-wing compared with my colleagues. I would have definitely been a Republican in the past century (before the Southern strategy) and was actually registered as one until recently, partially for game theoretic reasons. At the national level, I've donated to more Republicans (Mitt Romney, John Huntsman, and Ron Paul) than Democrats (Lawrence Lessig).\n\nThere are three big reasons that conservatives are hard to find in university faculties: intellectual consistency, anti-science trends by conservatives, and social pressure.\n\nIntellectual consistency. As professional \"thinkers\" (however pretentious that sounds), academics value intellectual consistency and people who can articulate sound policies. However, all of this century's top-ticket Republicans have lacked this essential trait. Thus, philosophical consistency has prevented me from voting for any Republican presidential candidate since I've been able.\n\nGeorge W. Bush, a big-government Republican, was unabashedly anti-intellectual and surrounded himself with evil, lying people; he expanded the debt and entitlements and brought more religion into government (all anathema to me). He also handled the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan completely incompetently.\n\nI really wanted to vote for John McCain, and I'm still upset about Bush's dirty tricks in South Carolina (see above) that stole the primary from one of the most honorable politicians in the U.S. I think campaign finance reform is the most important issue in America, and I think McCain would actually have the guts to do something about it. However, when such an old candidate chooses a vapid religious fundamentalist as his running mate, I simply cannot vote for him (if only he'd picked Joe Lieberman, Romney, Tim Pawlenty, or Huntsman).\n\nI liked Romney until he completely abandoned Romneycare, which was completely intellectually dishonest (it was developed by the Heritage Foundation!). I ended up voting for Gary Johnson instead out of protest.\n\n2016 is so much worse.\n\nI suspect that many of my centrist colleagues feel similarly.\n\n(The local level is a different matter. There, Republicans are more consistently pro-development and anti-NIMBY. They also are more supportive of nuclear energy and reasonable policies on GMOs. I've often voted for Republicans at county and city levels, but given the places I've lived they never have a chance anyway, so it's a bit of a protest vote.)\n\nAnother issue is that Republicans have been increasingly anti-science, hounding federal funding agencies looking for \"fraud\" and \"waste\" and pursuing witch hunts against climate scientists. That deeply offends intellectuals both at a philosophical level and at a practical level, since we depend on state and federal funding.\n\nSocial pressure. Finally, the few \"conservatives\" that are in academia tend to keep their mouths shut. If we're in a science discipline, we can just steer conversation to our personal lives or business to keep things running smoothly. Or we concentrate on issues where we agree with our peers (education, equal rights, immigration reform, how Donald Trump is a buffoon).\n\nWhy are there so few conservative university professors? originally appeared on Quora . More questions on Quora :\n\nAcademia : What's the easiest way to spot a bad professor? Politics of the United States of America : Is Hillary Clinton a nice person when there isn't a camera around? College and University Faculty : How do you approach and get to know professors at your university?\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Real Reason Why Republicans Keep Saying \"We're a Republic, Not a Democracy\"\n\nThe timeworn phrase \"we're a republic, not a democracy,\" once confined to campus political debates and the nerdier corners of the political internet, has been bubbling up to mainstream politics for some time now. But it was still jarring, during last week's vice presidential debate, when Sen. Mike Lee of Utah tweeted, simply, \" We're not a democracy .\" He later followed up , \"Democracy isn't the objective; liberty, peace, and prosperity are. We want the human condition to flourish. Rank democracy can thwart that.\"\n\nLee's comment triggered an uproar on social media, and other conservatives took up the line. During the first day of Amy Coney Barrett's Supreme Court confirmation hearing, Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana made the point that America is not a \"pure democracy\" and quoted newspaper columnist James Gill quipping that \"we don't all put on a clean toga and rush down to the forum to vote in person on every issue.\"\n\nAn even more extreme position was staked out, a few days before Lee, by Loren Culp , the long-shot Republican candidate for governor of Washington, who said in a recent interview that \"democracy is mob rule\" and that \"famous Chinese leaders like Mao Zedong and Mikhail Gorbachev loved democracy because democracy is a step toward socialism, which is a step towards communism.\"\n\nThe critique that too much democracy will inevitably lead to mob rule and tyranny is as old as Plato-hence the togas-and these men are right that it was very much on the minds of America's founders. But for anyone who lived through the era of George W. Bush and democracy promotion it's jarring to hear Republican candidates and politicians speak about democracy with such disdain. And it certainly seems significant that the democracy critique is picking up steam ahead of an election that could once again hinge on the difference between the Electoral College and the popular vote, as the president rails against \"ballots\" and refuses to commit to a peaceful transfer of power.\n\nTo discuss this latest anti-democratic turn, I spoke with filmmaker and author Astra Taylor, who in the 2018 documentary What Is Democracy? and the 2019 companion book Democracy May Not Exist, but We'll Miss It When It's Gone took a critical look at what true democracy would look like, and how closely our societies measure up to that ideal. The conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nJoshua Keating: A big part of your project, in both the film and the book, was talking to a wide range of people about what democracy means to them. Were responses like Mike Lee's something you encountered?\n\nAstra Taylor: Ah, yes. This phrase, \"We are a republic, not a democracy.\" I heard this phrase frequently, but always from a certain class of person. Always from a white man. I did quite a few interviews-what in the documentary film world we call \"streeters\"-where I would set up on a corner and talk to passersby. Often people were quite reluctant. I said, \"I'm talking about democracy. Would you like to sit and discuss with me?\" And I'd have to persuade people. They felt maybe a bit intimidated or they felt they lacked expertise. And often those interviews would be really interesting. People would actually be quite wise or have reasons for being politically disengaged or politically cynical that were actually pretty credible.\n\nThen there were these guys who were really eager. \"Yeah, of course you shall interview me about democracy!\" And after a question or two, they'd go flat and say, \"Well, we're a republic, not a democracy.\" That is a phrase that is uttered by people who, looking back on the sweep of American history, see themselves as safely at the center of the narrative, and typically they see their present privileges under threat. And so, they want to shore up the privileges that they possess, and they're looking for a sort of historic hook.\n\nDo you think there's a reason why it's bubbling up into high-level politics now?\n\nI think you're seeing a real shift in conservative rhetoric because they are giving up on winning majorities. If you go back 50 years, books like The Emerging Republican Majority , and even around the period of George Bush, there was this idea, \"OK, well, if Republicans want to keep winning majorities, we need to appeal more to the conservative Latino vote.\" And the party has just gone in the opposite direction of that. It's figuring out how to maintain dominance with a minority of support. And so, in that sense, I think the rhetoric is really telling. It's a way of rationalizing the further entrenchment of minority rule.\n\nAnd the thing is that there's something to their perspective. Political institutions in this country are not majoritarian. There is a long history of exclusion. And there are quite a few veto points in the political system that obstruct majoritarian policies. So they have a lot to draw on and it's not a novel political philosophy. It's a reversion to the American norm in some way. Because we haven't really been a fully inclusive democracy, ever. And to the degree that we have, it's been for just a generation-since the Voting Rights Act-and they're already giving up on that.\n\nAnd it's so fascinating to me that that period that I took for granted because of the moment in time I happened to be born in-this Cold War framework of \"capitalism is democracy versus communism is unfreedom\"-that paradigm is breaking down. So, you see people on the left becoming more self-consciously socialist and saying, \"Well, hold on, maybe socialism's not so bad.\" But on the right, you also see people who are like, \"Why do we even have to pretend to be democratic at all?\"\n\nIt is interesting, because, as you say, you expect people to at least pay lip service to democracy. You look around the world, even North Korea calls itself a \"Democratic People's Republic.\" It's just assumed that even the most autocratic movement has to at least claim some kind of democratic legitimacy. Is there something almost refreshing in hearing the other argument identified so blatantly in this way?\n\nThat's a funny kind of refreshing! I'd say there's something honest about it. I do think that it's not a rhetorical argument that is going to win over a majority of Americans, but it's not designed to.\n\nDemocracy is a term that has really deep roots in this country. It's going to be hard to turn people against it. So I think there is something powerful in this shift. And this is why I'm saying that it justifies future strategies, because I think what it helps us do is understand what we're up against. It helps us name the strategy that we're going to have to fight if we care about building a more democratic society.\n\nAnd this is why I'm frustrated with liberals who have spent the last four years warning about \"populism,\" which implies that the threat is the will of the majority. The real worry right now is not tyranny of the majority. If you look at the popular will in this country, the majority of people still want action on climate change, despite all of the disinformation and all of the millions of dollars that have been poured into misleading the public about the scientific consequences, right? People want better health care and public investment in health care. People want unions, et cetera. I think the problem is not the tyranny of the majority right now. The problem is the tyranny of an elite minority.\n\nDo these conservatives have a bit of a point when they argue that the Founding Fathers were concerned about too much democracy?\n\nThis is why it's important to understand the history of this country. The Founding Fathers were very concerned with protecting minority rights. They didn't understand the phrase minority rights as we understand it today-protections for trans people, immigrants, et cetera. But they were very concerned with the rights of the opulent. And that's one of their words, right? Madison said that it's very important to structure the Senate as they did to protect the rights of the opulent minority against the landless masses.\n\nJohn Adams wrote at length about how terrible it would be if you had a system where there's rule of the majority, because the impoverished masses would vote to redistribute wealth. That is a fact of this nation's history. And that is the history that these Republican figures are actually conjuring when they talk about the United States being a constitutional republic, not a democracy. Mike Lee is an economic libertarian, and in his tweet he emphasized liberty and prosperity. He didn't say equality or prosperity broadly shared, right? So it's all about protecting property from the masses who would seek redistributive reforms, and John Adams warned of that.\n\nPeople who are annoyed by that phrase, they tend to do this counter-originalist argument. They'll say, \"Oh, you stupid conservatives, don't you realize that actually the Founding Fathers meant representative democracy when they said republic, right?\" But the Founding Fathers did not want the United States to be a direct democracy, which is how they understood Athenian democracy, to be a purely direct form of democracy. They thought that that was very unstable and risky.\n\nI guess I have two responses to that. One is, I don't really care what the Founding Fathers thought. They also thought I should have no political rights. So I'm not here to live in their world forever. And there was a lot of disagreement among the people we count as the founders, right? There were some of them who were far more small-d democratic than others. But I think the point is that the battle was never just, \"Are we a direct democracy?\" But rather, \"How representative of a democracy are we?\" In my opinion, it's never been representative enough, but that's really what this conversation is about.\n\nSo, you're someone who argues that democracy is more than just casting a ballot every four years, that it requires constant engagement. But how does someone with that kind of small-d perspective approach something like the election we have coming up? Are you as existentially terrified as everyone else?\n\nOh, I am. I am very worried about this election. My framework for engaging electoral politics is that we have to engage with the system both as it is, while also keeping in mind a horizon of how we want it to be or how it could be transformed.\n\nI think this election is existential, and I hope it reminds the left that we can't take for granted even the basic political rights we think we have. I think for a while, there has been this sort of sense on the left that we are in this two-party system, it's a duopoly, it's not democratic.\n\nAnd that critique was right. Of course, the system is not democratic in so many ways. I don't think a society with the wealth inequality we have qualifies as democratic, just as a baseline. But we also have to vote. We can't take the progress that's been made for granted because there's a deeply undemocratic anti-democratic strain to American politics. That's what we're seeing with comments like the one from Mike Lee. There are elites who are more than happy to do away with democracy, to do away with regular people having any sort of power or say over their lives.\n\nDemocracy has always been a concept that has been held in contempt by elites, even in ancient Athens. And that attitude is alive and well. Democracy is an idea that we really have to put a lot of care into, and constantly be engaging with, and to me, that process absolutely does not require this weird, religious reverence for the Founding Fathers. That's why I end the book on the image that let us not aspire to be Founding Fathers, but to be perennial midwives, birthing democracy anew. If you don't renew it, if you don't reinvent it, then it's at risk of disappearing.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Conservative Justices Keep Winning. Why Are They So Mad?\n\nListen to Amicus:\n\nThe Supreme Court stands ready to hand down decisions in almost 30 cases this month, including blockbusters around abortion rights, gun rights, environmental protections, and religious liberty. On this week's Amicus podcast, Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed the big themes animating an end of term weighted down by an unprecedented leak, judicial infighting, public protests, and an investigation of Supreme Court clerks. Their conversation has been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nDahlia Lithwick: I am curious about why the justices seem to be simply unworried about some of the Supreme Court pathologies we've been talking about this year, whether it's unreasoned shadow docket orders, or reliance on unreasoned shadow docket orders as though they are now reasoned, or potshots by the justices at the press , potshots at each other , really acrimonious infighting , and the leak itself . And now Justice Clarence Thomas' recent love song to the much better court under Chief Justice William Rehnquist . What's the cause and what's the effect here? I am super curious whether the justices are now of the view that, good, the gloves are off, and now we're going to act like small children, or if their acting like small children-whether it's the partisan speeches or the fighting about wearing masks at oral arguments together-is causing the fiction to fall away.\n\nMark Joseph Stern: It's a great question because what we're seeing right now in terms of demeanor with the justices feels a little counterintuitive. People like Clarence Thomas and Sam Alito are about to get everything they want. They are winning so much. They are prevailing in almost every single major case and a lot of minor ones. Clarence Thomas is writing blockbuster opinions for the first time in his career because he can finally hold together a five-justice bloc, and yet Alito and Thomas have never sounded angrier. They go out and they do these wild partisan speeches complaining about how much they dislike the current court, about how they feel that even the judiciary is adrift, despite the fact that the judiciary has moved toward them, to the right, so dramatically over the last few years.\n\nMy theory of the case is essentially that they watched for decades while the court was center-right or moderate, or occasionally handed down liberal rulings, and the country largely accepted those decisions. The legal establishment accepted them. There was not a call generally to expand the court, and the court's approval ratings remained high. I think Alito and Thomas feel like they've now won fair and square, they're in the driver's seat, they're issuing all of the decisions that they think are right, that they believe are certainly no more radical than same-sex marriage or abortion, and suddenly their approval rating is plummeting.\n\nMultiple Democratic lawmakers are talking about expanding the court. There is a huge amount of unprecedented and brutal candor in the dissents, not just of Justice Sotomayor, but also Kagan and Breyer, who are finally calling it like it is. I think these conservative justices are deeply frustrated and annoyed that they don't get the kind of deference and praise that they believe they're owed, that now that they are in the driver's seat, people are realizing that the court is, in fact, a corrupted and partisan institution, more so now than in living memory.\n\nI don't know if that directly answers your question, but I think that contributes to this dissension among the justices and this discord that we're hearing about constantly, because I think that they are really mad at the liberal dissenters for pointing out that what they're doing is, in some ways, illegitimate and incredibly dishonest. I think they're mad at Chief Justice Roberts for sometimes stepping up, like in that Clean Water Act shadow docket order and signing onto Elena Kagan's dissent saying this is BS. I think they feel that they are owed a lot more respect than they are currently getting, and that is making them very publicly angry.\n\nDahlia: That's insanely interesting. It also really does explain why Justice Thomas says, Oh, I long for the days of good fellowship and good cheer when I was writing all these angry dissents but I had no power. And now that I have the power, I'm not writing lone, angry dissents. Now I am the guy, and I miss those days. It's not quite that he misses those days. He just doesn't quite know what to do with the fact that now that he's finally won, people don't like it. It goes to these democracy, minoritarian conversations we've been having all year .\n\nMark: I agree.\n\nDahlia: So let's talk about some of the cases, because there's a holy-hell, big-deal gun case about to come down, and that the court in a weird way is now playing this-and I don't mean to laugh because it's a freaking tragic kind of game of Frogger , where they have to come down with a decision in Bruen that doesn't also coincide with another day of gun carnage. I don't know how this decision can come down, massively expanding gun rights, when we are in the middle of a catastrophic amount of national attention to gun death. But can you, before we do that, just for folks who aren't paying the attention you are, lay out what's at stake in Bruen ?\n\nMark: Bruen is a challenge to New York's very strict concealed carry law, which does not allow individuals to carry a concealed firearm in public unless they can show good cause, some heightened reason why they are fearful for their lives and need to carry a weapon with them. I think it's very clear that there are five or six votes to strike down this law and require New York to grant a concealed carry permit to any gun owner who wants one. In the process, they will be striking down laws in about seven or eight other states, including California, and affecting millions and millions of people who currently live in jurisdictions where you are not, in fact, generally allowed to carry a lethal weapon with you, hidden in your purse or coat, and pull it out when you personally feel that you are in danger.\n\nThe gun carnage in this country is sick and horrific. But there is a mildly amusing side note about how every time you might expect this decision to come down, there's another mass shooting. I think that this goes to the #YOLO court. They know that there's never going to be a good time to hand down this opinion, so I think they're just going to do it when they're ready and say to hell with it. If that coincides with some horrific mass shooting that is furthered by their decision, meaning that they will facilitate even more gun violence through this ruling, they don't care.\n\nThey feel like they're standing up for the poor little man on the New York City subway at midnight who feels threatened by the Black person who's standing on the other side of the car. That's the guy they empathize with. The rest of us, who are afraid of being shot to death, are just not factored into their consideration.\n\nDahlia: I want to come back to that empathy point, Mark, because it is such a connector to what we saw in the Dobbs leak, about who gets empathy at this court. It's something else we talk about a lot. But one of the most memorable clips from the oral argument in Bruen , of Sam Alito making exactly the point that you're making, was about who is the real loser in New York. It's not anybody other than the office worker who wants to have a gun on the subway and can't, while all these lawless murderers and thugs around him have weapons. Mark, this feels like it's very much of a piece with where you started, about even when you're winning, you're still the victim under this construction of the facts.\n\nMark: Yes. People like Alito, justices and members of the conservative legal movement, came up in their careers with this victimhood complex. They feel perpetually aggrieved. They feel like the entire legal profession in much of the country is pitted against them, despite the fact that they know the one true way to interpret the Constitution. Here, Alito sounds genuinely outraged on behalf of this imaginary person who, thanks to twisted liberal attacks on the Second Amendment, is not able to defend himself in the dangerous and hellish, Mad Max -style dystopia that he appears to imagine the New York City subway to be. We could go through almost every case and identify who gets empathy and who doesn't.\n\nIt's interesting that progressive jurists do sometimes acknowledge that empathy can play a role-famously Justice Sotomayor said so and then had to walk it back to get confirmed. But there is a strain of progressive jurisprudence that says that criminal defendants, the underprivileged, the less powerful, actually do deserve some measure of empathy and consideration about the facts of their lives, their circumstances, when they are going up against, often, a giant corporation or prosecutors who have way more power than they do.\n\nWhereas the conservative justices have long said that empathy is illegitimate in judging, that there should be absolutely no consideration of an individual's circumstances which might draw some sympathy, and yet here we have the conservatives very openly empathizing with the guy on the subway facing a mugger, or whatever, and just refusing to extend any empathy to the rest of us who are afraid that someone with a concealed gun is going to murder us in public. They pretend that empathy plays no role, even as it so clearly drives their analysis of the constitutional issues at hand.\n\nDahlia: One of the things that was really hard to listen to in Bruen was this kind of comedy routine about what kinds of places are sensitive places where you might, in fact, be allowed to regulate guns. It felt like, Ha ha ha, the Columbia University campus, the NYU campus. Ha ha ha, Times Square on New Year's Eve. This sounded as though a) the justices have already determined for themselves that a sensitive place where you can regulate gun possession is at the Supreme Court; and then b) that we can just spitball based on our own fleeting sense of whether Times Square at New Year's Eve is or is not a sensitive space, when guns should be regulated. It's not just empathy. It's just absolute feelings, impressions, hunches-the opposite of justice.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "How the Right Won Podcasting\n\nFor decades, American liberals have been waiting for a presidential election without the red-cast shadow of Rush Limbaugh. Between 1984 and 2021, the megawatt talk-radio star hosted the most popular program in the country. An estimated 15.5 million people tuned in to The Rush Limbaugh Show every day to listen to him parrot a comprehensive list of Republican talking points, and many of them internalized his uniquely cranky brand of conservatism. With his thumb finally off the scale following his death from lung cancer-related complications, some hoped that the audio monopoly of conservative media was finally breaking. Maybe, just maybe, a reliable progressive could step up to the plate and reshape the American airwaves.\n\nThree years after Limbaugh's death, it's clear that those dreams haven't come true. Terrestrial radio might not be as important to American psychology as it once was, but that's only because conservatives have taken their talents elsewhere: to radio's heir, podcasting. Scroll through Spotify's Top Podcasts chart these days, and, at any given moment, at least half of the most popular shows are hosted by figures friendly to the MAGA cause. As of this writing, Tucker Carlson's show is the fourth most-listened-to show on the platform, while anti-woke entrepreneur Patrick Bet-David lingers a few rungs below him, and Candace Owens sits comfortably between them both. Further down you can find firebrands like Charlie Kirk, Ben Shapiro, and Dan Bongino cranking out new shows every day. Similarly, Joe Rogan, with his eternally inscrutable, RFK Jr.-adjacent brand of populism , continues to dominate the top spot, while a variety of other comedians forged in Rogan's fratty mold-Theo Von, Andrew Schulz-round out the list. Even if these podcasters don't market themselves as explicitly political, many of them have recently welcomed Trump to their respective shows as part of the former president's outreach to the podcasts' core demographic of disaffected young men. Tony Hinchcliffe, another comedian turned podcaster in this milieu, was even invited to speak at Trump's Madison Square Garden rally this past Sunday. ( It went poorly. )\n\nTellingly, members of the reliably liberal podcasting commentariat are few and far between on the charts alongside their opposition. The long-running Pod Save America , famously founded by a quartet of former Obama staffers, is currently stalled out somewhere in the 30s and 40s, while Ezra Klein, the patron saint of liberal wonks, is sitting outside the top 50. At its advent, podcasting appeared to be the realm of Warby Parker-bespectacled urban millennials, but this is no longer the industry of Serial or Savage Love . While podcast charts are admittedly fluid and not exactly consistent-Apple's top chart looks different from Spotify's, for instance-and the calculations behind each of them are nearly inscrutable to outsiders, today's dominance of a certain type of podcast is hard to refute. (Spotify did not respond to a request for comment on the data behind the platform's Top Podcasts chart, or on how conservative-leaning podcasts appear to dominate much of the ranking.)\n\nThe age of Rogan is firmly upon us, and it's not ending anytime soon.\n\nAnalysts aren't sure how the right wing achieved such a stranglehold on the podcast industry, but many have conceded that the grasp conservatives held over the airwaves during the Limbaugh era has proven to be surprisingly durable. \"They were dominant in the 1990s with talk radio and Fox, and then they replicated what they had with a different medium,\" said Angelo Carusone, president of the left-leaning watchdog Media Matters for America. Republicans have adjusted their news-gathering habits accordingly-according to data from the Pew Research Center , 46 percent of conservative podcast listeners say they trust the news they hear in their audio diet more than news from other sources, compared to just 19 percent of Democrats.\n\nIt makes sense. The American conservative movement and its corresponding media arm have historically been defined by an unquenchable thirst for the counternarrative. National Review, one of the country's leading conservative publications, was born in 1955 due to right-wing author and political commentator William F. Buckley Jr.'s insistence that the other publications on the newsstand-the Nation and the New Republic in particular-were tainted with a bone-deep pinko bias. (He gathered a team of libertarians and anti-communists in order to, in his words, stand \"athwart history, yelling, 'Stop. ' \") Nicole Hemmer, author of multiple books about right-wing media, told Slate that Buckley's fundamental thesis has been integral to the reactionary cause ever since: In order to identify as a conservative in the United States, one must ravenously consume explicitly branded conservative news, while the same does not necessarily hold for liberals.\n\n\"It's much more central to Republican politics compared to the inverse,\" Hemmer said. \"There isn't a sense that, like, Rachel Maddow commands millions of voters. Liberals have a different media diet. They aren't seeking out whoever the left-wing equivalent of Candace Owens is.\"\n\nBut while the conservative podcast apparatus shares heritage with the columnists and talk-radio cranks of yore, it isn't bound by the same dictums and restraints. Unlike terrestrial broadcasting, podcasts are not regulated by the Federal Communications Commission , meaning that there is no check on a show's ability to spread misinformation. The ramifications of that shift have already become clear. When the Brookings Institution audited 8,000 political podcast episodes in 2021 , it estimated that more than one-tenth of the sample were potentially espousing false reporting. Naturally, in another study published by Brookings, the research found that the podcasts most likely to share unsupported claims were almost exclusively ideologically conservative . The leading culprit in that study was Steve Bannon's War Room , a repository for QAnon-esque charges on everything from the COVID vaccine to the patents held by Bill Gates. Nearly 20 percent of his episodes were found to contain \"false, misleading, or unsubstantiated statements.\" In an ominous symptom of that trend, a Pew report from 2023 found that 40 percent of Republican podcast listeners agree that the news they gather from their podcast diet covers stories \"they wouldn't have heard elsewhere.\"\n\nHemmer agreed that as the conservative media nucleus has migrated to the podcast charts, it has breached some of the guardrails that once kept it connected to reality. In particular, she's been paying close attention to Tucker Carlson, whose wingnut tendencies have intensified since striking out on his own. \"His podcast allows him to be crazy in a way he hasn't been before. He's talking quite explicitly about demons, in an Alex Jones type of way,\" said Hemmer. She pointed to an episode last year where Carlson interviewed a convicted felon who claimed to have had sex with Barack Obama. That segment would've almost certainly been quashed by even the editorial firewalls at Fox, but in the lawless content ecosystems of 2024, it furthers Carlson's overarching promise to his listeners: No matter what he says, he will remain eternally un-canceled.\n\nIn that sense, the sheer unaccountability of the podcast medium doubles as the primary allure for a conservative media industry-and an audience of conservative consumers-existentially concerned with their own autonomy. More than anything else, this lack of oversight is what keeps some analysts up at night. If right-wing thought leadership is being delegated to an unmoderated, unchecked, and largely fragmented broadcasting sector-brimming with an increasingly mystic brand of conservatism-then maybe Rush Limbaugh was the least of our concerns.\n\nIt's hard to know for sure how the most popular conservative podcasts have engineered their seemingly outsized success. Nick Quah, a critic and reporter who covers the podcast industry for New York magazine, can identify a couple of different indicators. First and foremost, the biggest names in this world-Megyn Kelly, Tucker Carlson, even Glenn Beck-originally cultivated their fame on cable news, and therefore possess much more name recognition than those who earned their stripes exclusively in the audio realm. Additionally, some of the more adroit operators on the right have mastered a variety of different formats across multiple disciplines and their respective algorithms-TikTok, Instagram-allowing them to flood the airspace with content. (Ben Shapiro publishes a daily podcast and, at minimum, two clips per day on his YouTube channel.) Quah also noted that some conservative podcasts are partnered with major players in terrestrial radio. For instance, The Dan Bongino Show airs nationally on the NFL-affiliated radio network Westwood One, dramatically widening the on-ramp to the conservative commentator's brand for older, less tech-savvy patrons.\n\n\"Compare that to the only major center-left media company, Crooked Media, [the company behind Pod Save America ,] which only just began getting distributed through SiriusXM,\" Quah pointed out. \"They don't have a pact with traditional broadcast media companies that can get them in front of more people.\"\n\nBut none of that changes the fact that much of the more extreme messaging contained in these podcasts-conspiracies both absurd and fascistic, like Charlie Kirk spreading rumors of Haitians eating pets -are, well, extreme, and don't necessarily hold mass appeal in and of themselves. The secret sauce, so to speak, is in how these podcasts sneak those ideas into a much more general entertainment product that is far-ranging enough to capture the attention of millions of listeners. As Carusone put it to Slate, \"Those podcasts aren't making policy statements, but they are telling a story about the respective ideologies of the political parties. ... They are like sandpaper smoothing out the edges of fascism.\"\n\nOne case study is Candace Owens' eponymous podcast Candace . Owens became famous for a number of deranged controversies after originally making a name for herself with the \"Blexit\" movement in the early days of the Trump presidency. (Blexit was a combination of the words Black and Brexit, and it referred to Owens' efforts to encourage more Black Americans to defect from the Democrats.) But in March, Owens crossed one of the very few red lines in conservative media when she alloyed her criticism of Israel's invasion of Gaza with a healthy dose of esoteric antisemitism, asserting that an elite cabal of \"political Jews\" were some of the \"most vile, dishonest, manipulative people\" she's ever met. Later on, she appeared to endorse the idea that rabbis are drinking the blood of Christians . This was apparently a bridge too far for the Daily Wire, the MAGA new-media company where Owens was a star broadcaster, and the site cut ties with her. In a parable that's become eerily familiar, Owens quickly made herself more popular than ever before, launching her podcast Candace , which has averaged more than a million downloads per episode since its debut in June. Owens has continued to advance heavy-duty antisemitic thinking on her new platform. In a July episode titled \" Literally Hitler. Why Can't We Talk About Him? ,\" she called into question the veracity of the fact that human experiments were conducted on Holocaust victims.\n\nBut, for all its extreme political whiplash, Candace is not a strictly partisan production; Owens occasionally dabbles in hard-left conspiratorial thinking , coupled with plenty of pop-culture intrigue. (She has done multiple shows on the murky P. Diddy sex-trafficking investigation, and recently, she hosted a conspiratorialist of minor renown who believes that the disappearance of Malaysia Flight 370 had something to do with the suppression of free energy.) It's a mélange of content whose ethos is less \"explicit right-wing political indoctrination\" than \"salacious background noise keeping ordinary Americans entertained in between laundry and dishwashing\"-the podcasting equivalent of Larry King sitting across from psychics and palm readers in his CNN studio.\n\n\"Everyone is talking about the Trump trial, and I'm saying 'Women shouldn't wear yoga pants.' I don't like to stay within one box, because you get bogged down by talking about one topic all the time. I just ask myself what I'm actually interested in,\" said Owens in an interview with Slate. \"Someone once described my show to be like calling up a friend and catching up with them. ... I want it to feel like that.\"\n\nHemmer calls this trend the \"Joe Rogan Effect,\" referring to another figure who has become aligned with the MAGA project without commanding a content portfolio purely defined by its caucus. Rogan, after all, maintains a Rolodex of guests that range from UFO experts to anti-trans activists to Bernie Sanders. \"You see this with Megyn Kelly, too,\" added Hemmer. \"She does whole shows that are like Dateline episodes. It makes the show something similar to lifestyle broadcasting. Mixed in with really hardcore political messaging, you can get something else.\"\n\nWhat Rogan and the like are selling is not so much a concrete ideology, but a nostalgia for an edgy, anti-PC social order that began to go out of style around the turn of the millennium-a way of life, in other words. That same attitude has been replicated by the other comedian-cum-commentators in his wake. (Theo Von, who recently had J.D. Vance on his podcast This Past Weekend , is another such figure who has integrated a dash of un-wokeness into his brand.) So I wasn't surprised that, during our interview, Candace Owens said that she wants to resurrect what she calls \"'90s gay,\" referring to a time period-the \"golden decade,\" in Owens' words-when the general populace used the term \"gay\" as a casual insult between friends rather than a denigration of sexual orientation. In the anti-woke imagination, those were the good old days, before political correctness and paralyzing partisanship made the social contract harder to navigate.\n\nThis sentiment behind many of the top right-leaning podcasts reflects a broader rift in the culture wars. Over the past two decades, the Democrats have been cast as the no-fun party, standing athwart Barstool Sports, Zyn pouches, Luke Bryan, and Hawk Tuah. There has been a growing sense among Americans who aren't strictly confined by ideology-or aren't even all that politically activated-that the mainstream corporate-liberal gestalt presents a world where your thoughts and interactions must be exclusively filtered through the prism of identity and social justice. These podcasts, then, do a good job at flavoring boilerplate civic inertness with a tinge of MAGA conservatism. So far, liberals haven't been able to crack that code. Consider Pod Save America , which has a content portfolio thoroughly defined by anxiety about Trump, the Electoral College, and the fading vitality of democracy itself. There is little room for digression or levity. It is all policy, all the time, for a country that has grown exhausted by the discourse. The show's reach is limited to the only audience it could ever hope to capture: wonks who look, talk, and think like the hosts themselves.\n\nTo be fair, there are some podcasts on the left that are doing what the right has excelled at. The venerable socialist podcast Chapo Trap House and the prodigious leftist Twitch streamer Hasan Piker, for instance, both command large audiences-predominantly made up of young people-and produce shows that feel much more like casual conversations with friends than unrepentant pro-Democrat platform messaging. But they are not wreathed with the same institutional support that once enshrined Limbaugh. (In the years after his diagnosis, Limbaugh was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Meanwhile, in a viral moment from the 2024 Democratic National Convention, Piker was removed from the premises .) Having power brokers from the liberal media enclave extend an olive branch to the few new-media lefties that young people are excited about could be a way to cultivate more effective counterprogramming against the waves of right-leaning broadcasting that continue to dominate the charts.\n\nBut not everyone is so optimistic. \"Everyone is moving closer to and closer to Alex Jones. The incentive structure is shifting. All of these right-wing voices are increasingly disconnected from reality, and it isn't as visible in this fragmented media environment,\" said Hemmer. Perhaps the war hasn't been lost yet-or maybe, as she posits, the damage has already been done, and \"there's not much you can do about it.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Conservatives have long been at war with colleges\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nA brief history of the right's long-running battle against higher education.\n\nby Fabiola Cineas\n\nIn the wake of the resignations of two university presidents; campaigns against diversity, equity, and inclusion programs; and a Supreme Court ruling ending affirmative action , conservatives are vowing that their crusade against higher education is far from over.\n\nConservative activist Christopher Rufo, who played a role in smearing critical race theory and in pushing out Harvard President Claudine Gay last month, told students at the University of Colorado Boulder recently that America must \"lay siege to the institutions\" to root out radical liberal policies that were established in the 1960s - an idea he's been repeating for years. According to Rufo, those policies include diversity and inclusion initiatives that are bringing America down today.\n\nAt a time when colleges and universities are facing criticism from all sides over rising tuition costs and resulting student debt, decreasing enrollment, and admissions challenges, conservatives want to spearhead the changes that lie ahead for the institutions. But the desire of Rufo and others to remake higher education in their conservative vision isn't new.\n\nAccording to historian Lauren Lassabe Shepherd, who is the author of Resistance from the Right: Conservatives and the Campus Wars in Modern America and casts a sometimes critical eye on the conservative assault on higher education, the playbook has existed for decades.\n\nLassabe Shepherd and I discussed the parallels between the current moment and the early 20th century, when conservatives first grew suspicious of colleges and universities. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat's one word you would use to describe conservatives' relationship with higher education today?\n\nAntagonistic.\n\nThere's a culture war being fought right now by people like Chris Rufo and, in the K-12 sphere, Moms for Liberty . These people aren't shy, and they're not discreet. They're writing op-eds and saying exactly what their plans are.\n\nBut they're not trying to dismantle public higher education brick by brick, as some commentators have suggested. They want to keep these institutions, but they want them to look like Hillsdale [a small conservative Christian college in Michigan]. They want to do what they're doing at the New College of Florida . I think they do like these institutions - they just don't like that they don't control them.\n\nWhat do you make of polling from Pew that shows that Republicans have lost confidence in higher education in a matter of a few years? Why do you think the shift toward believing that colleges have a harmful effect on the nation has been that quick in recent times?\n\nI think there was a big shift after 2016, when [political] strategists looked at election data and realized Trump didn't do so well with college-educated people. So now strategists have framed this as \"College-educated people are the problem.\" They're saying, \"We need to make higher education a bogeyman, attack it and reform it into what we want it to look like.\"\n\nLet's take a step back and talk about how we got here. Historically, what's been the function of colleges and universities? Was there a version of these elite institutions that conservatives aligned with?\n\nThe Ivies, our very first institutions, like Harvard - which is 150 years older than we are as a nation - were set up privately with charters. The idea was to train white men, usually second, third, fourth sons, and sometimes first sons, for the ministry, sometimes for medicine, sometimes for law, and also for public service.\n\nIn addition to educating them, there was also a social component. It was about getting elite young men together through social clubs, like supper clubs, dining clubs, and secret societies, many of which are still around today.\n\nGetting a degree wasn't always the outcome. This was mostly for men from wealthy upper-class families, but you would occasionally have someone who came from a farming family. Christianity was also a really strong component. What we think of as the modern model of colleges didn't emerge until after the Civil War. Before then, college was really like private high school.\n\nSo what would you say is the first major moment when conservatives begin to question the aims of colleges and universities?\n\nIn the 1950s, William F. Buckley Jr., who is widely regarded as the father of the modern conservative movement, pens his first book, God and Man at Yale . The whole premise of the book is that America's elite institutions have lost their way, deviated from Christianity, and are teaching young men to be more liberal, open-minded, worldly, and more socialist. This is where we see the beginning of a concerted movement of the right being a little bit suspicious about the curriculum in higher ed. They began wondering, \"What are they teaching these kids?\"\n\nWhat happened in the decades before built up to this. During the Red Scare , there were suspicions about Jewish professors being communist or anti-American. There was also the effort to create Bob Jones College, a college for Christian men where the Bible is the curriculum. This was similar to today's plan to make colleges look like Hillsdale. That means a biblical curriculum, but what they also want is \"Western tradition.\" They want students studying old classics written by and for white men.\n\nWhat role did outside organizations play in fighting to uphold conservative ideals in higher education?\n\nAround the time of the Great Depression, they created parallel academic programs to promote conservative ideas. Those institutions still exist now. The big one today is ISI, the Intercollegiate Studies Institute . Its whole purpose as a nonprofit is to identify conservative students and provide stipends or fellowships for their credentials so that they can become faculty themselves.\n\nYou've also talked about the late 1960s as being a time when conservatives organized for their causes. When I think about that time, I think about liberal student movements that protested the Vietnam War or advocated for ethnic studies. So what were conservative students doing, and how does it inform what conservatives want to do with higher education today?\n\nConservative students were part of groups like the Young Republican National Federation and the College Republicans National Committee. They were the pro-war voice on campus, and they framed themselves as being anti-communist. There was also Young Americans for Freedom, still around today as Young America's Foundation .\n\nThose students in the '60s, like Newt Gingrich and Bill Barr , that was their entry into politics. That's where they cut their political teeth and learned how to organize and fundraise and set up counterdemonstrations. They had a hand up in the sense that there was lots of mentorship - a very welcoming and deep-pocketed set of advisers who helped them on their political journey.\n\nKarl Rove is a really good example because he didn't finish his degree at the University of Utah. He dropped out in that period and moved to Washington, DC, and immediately became a lobbyist working for the national College Republicans. That kind of activism and membership were career funnels. What the uniting factor is between them is they all don't like the left. And when they say they don't like the left, they're actually just talking about liberals.\n\nSo did conservatives basically build on this activism inside and outside of higher ed institutions? I'm specifically thinking about the rise of affirmative action, too.\n\nSo, in that sense, the right's worst fears came true. The campuses did diversify - very, very slowly, but they did.\n\nAnd even still, campuses broadly - when we're talking about the sum total of American higher education, the average college student goes to a large state public or community college. And they're probably not even a traditional 18- to 21-year-old student, either. Harvard, MIT, Penn, and others have consumed the news. But those institutions are absolutely not representative of what the landscape of colleges and universities is in the country.\n\nGoing forward, the conversation about conservatives and higher education has always been there, though it didn't always make headlines. Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell, in his 1971 Powell Memorandum , laid out this plan for fixing America's institutions. He basically said, \"We need to tear them apart brick by brick, and we do that through defunding and then placing our people in positions of power.\" The Powell Memo is a document that definitely lays this plan all out, but the sentiment was certainly there before.\n\nComing back to today, is the conservative fight to claim colleges and universities mostly happening at Harvard and Penn, as so much of the mainstream media would have us believe?\n\nHarvard is an easy target for headlines, but when it comes to practical application, like where the right can really have impact, it's the large state public universities that are most at risk. Those institutions that don't make headlines and can slowly be changed behind the scenes, and it's almost like no one notices. In red states, legislators have direct control over public education budgets. This is why New College in Florida was so easy to tear apart.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

      "text": "How conservatism conquered America - and corrupted itself\n\nThe past month's conservative victories were decades in the making. Three books about the right reveal what it cost the movement.\n\nby Zack Beauchamp\n\nThe January 6 committee has been investigating, among other things, how it is that such a grievous attack on the Capitol could have happened in the first place. A key answer to that question will be found not in White House call records or intercepted Proud Boys texts, but in a document released publicly last week: the Supreme Court's ruling overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nThat Donald Trump would incite violence in pursuit of power was not only predictable but predicted - including by his Republican opponents in the 2016 primary . Yet Republicans elevated him to the world's most important job, and have made no secret of why. \"The first thing that came to my mind [after Trump's general election win] was the Supreme Court,\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told the Washington Post in a recent interview.\n\nWith Trump's election, the conservative establishment succeeded in cementing its control over the Court. But this victory required that they cede control over their movement to an unstable demagogue.\n\nAmerican conservatism is thus simultaneously ascendant and in crisis. The right has extraordinary political power, but its traditional leadership seems less capable than ever of imposing limits on how it is wielded. The GOP's future belongs to the radical forces represented by Trump and the members of the establishment most willing to cater to them. Those few Republicans in power willing to stand up to the rot of Trumpism - like Rep. Liz Cheney, Rep. Adam Kinzinger, and Sen. Mitt Romney - find themselves on the outside looking in.\n\nThis state of affairs is perhaps the inevitable endpoint of the American right's decades-old strategy for attaining power. Conservative doctrine never truly captured the hearts of a mass audience; to attain power, the movement needed to ally itself with forces of far-right reaction who raged against the idea of equality at the heart of modern democracy.\n\nAmerican conservatism was an attempt to tame the untamable: to domesticate this reactionary impulse and channel it into electoral politics in service of an elite-driven agenda. Its leaders managed to exercise some control over radicals in the specific context of Cold War America - but the effort was fated to fail eventually.\n\nAnd now it's threatening to bring American democracy down with it .\n\nModern democracy is, at heart, premised on the liberal ideal of equality: that because no person is inherently superior to any other, all deserve to help shape the rules that govern society as a whole.\n\nThat this idea will strike many readers as banal speaks to the success of the liberal democratic project, which has taken a premise that challenges every historical hierarchy and elevated it to the level of received wisdom.\n\nThese hierarchies, however, are not without their defenders. Anti-egalitarian politics have regularly proven to be politically potent, with many citizens in seemingly advanced democracies repeatedly showing themselves willing to support political factions that challenge liberalism's most cherished ideals.\n\nMatthew Rose's recent book A World after Liberalism tells the story of a handful of \"radical right\" thinkers who built intellectual foundations for anti-egalitarian politics. The writings of the people he highlights - German cultural essentialist Oswald Spengler, Italian quasi-fascist Julius Evola, American Nazi sympathizer Francis Parker Yockey, French philosopher Alain de Benoist, and the proto-Trumpian pundit Sam Francis - range from mystical treatises about cultural symbology to conspiracy theorizing to more conventional political journalism.\n\nBut according to Rose, a scholar of religion by background, they share key traits in common: most fundamentally, a belief in the group as the primary unit of political life. The group they champion happens to be European peoples or, for some, the white race.\n\nLiberalism centers individuals, treating them as equals and granting them rights against the state in order to be able to live their lives in the way they choose. Radical right theorists see this as a terrible mistake.\n\n\"Liberalism is evil in principle because it destroys the foundations of social order,\" Rose writes, summarizing his subjects' views. \"Political life does not depend on truths or values that transcend our identities [but rather] recognizing that human identity, at its most primordial level, is something inherited.\"\n\nTheir reasons for arriving at this conclusion differed, but virtually all venerated Western culture and deplored its alleged corrosion by liberal thought.\n\nEvola's pre-World War II work, for example, argued that humans by their nature require rituals and a sense of the sacred to achieve meaning in their lives. He believed that liberalism destroyed this most profound source of human significance by subjecting what Evola called capital-T Tradition to rational scrutiny and arguing for the political equality of all persons.\n\nMeanwhile, Yockey, writing in the late '40s and '50s, argued that rationality is an expression of Western man's most fundamental feature: a drive toward mastery and domination. He blamed a deformed \"Jewish\" form of reason, embodied in the work of Marx and Freud, for corrupting the West - seeding a corrosive self-doubt about its own heroic past that has put Europe and North America on the road to cultural suicide.\n\nSuch ideas may seem far removed from the mainstream, but you hear their echoes in today's berserk politics. Steve Bannon has cited Evola as an influence; Rose sees in Yockey's writing the seeds of the \"cultural Marxism\" theory popular on the culture warrior right.\n\nMore importantly, a dive into their work reveals that these thinkers capture something real: a politics that's felt, on a more instinctual level, by millions of ordinary people across the Western world.\n\nWe have ample evidence from social science that large swaths of the white population across Europe and North America find cultural and demographic change unsettling. This sense of cultural displacement has powered the rise of a particular kind of reactionary nationalism, from Trump to Brexit to the continental far-right.\n\nThe thinkers of the radical right were at once too intellectual, too bizarre, and too unfashionable to ever really gain a mass following in their lifetimes. But they intuited something that many mainstream thinkers failed to see - that there is a persistent constituency for illiberal cultural politics in advanced Western democracies.\n\nThis insight comes out most clearly in Rose's chapter on Sam Francis, an American political writer who died in 2005. Francis was once a member in good standing of the mainstream conservative movement. Yet Francis came to see the Reaganite GOP as a sham opposition - \" beautiful losers \" unable to grapple with the looming demographic threat to American civilization posed by a rising non-white population.\n\n\"The civilization that we as whites created in Europe and America could not have developed apart from the genetic endowments of the creating people, nor is there any reason to believe that the civilization can be successfully transmitted to a different people,\" he said at a 1994 white nationalist conference .\n\nThis racism got him booted from the ranks of mainstream conservatism; Rose describes a 1995 op-ed Francis wrote offering a \"biblical defense of slavery\" as the breaking point. Yet Francis's viciousness also made him perversely prescient. He believed that, for Republicans, \"trying to win non-whites, especially by abandoning issues important to white voters, is the road to political suicide.\"\n\nInstead, he argued that the GOP would need to awaken the slumbering consciousness of the so-called \"Middle American Radicals\" - middle- and lower-class white voters who were core supporters of right-wing extremists like Joseph McCarthy and George Wallace.\n\nThe best way to do so, Francis argued, was \"to make use of a Caesarism and the mass loyalties that a charismatic leader inspires.\"\n\nWhen Donald Trump first came down that golden escalator in 2015 to announce his candidacy, most observers dismissed him as a joke. As he rose in the polls, the mainstream right saw him as less funny and more of a threat. In January 2016, the flagship conservative magazine National Review dedicated an entire issue, titled \" Against Trump ,\" to reading him out of the movement.\n\nBut as we came to learn, elite disapproval proved unable to withstand Trump's ability to harness the rage of Francis's Middle American Radicals. The conservative movement, conquered, bent the knee - bringing the radicals out from the shadows and into positions of power.\n\nA few lifelong conservatives have since come to ask themselves: \"How did it come to this?\"\n\nMatthew Continetti has an insider's perspective on this question. Founder of a right-wing news site called the Washington Free Beacon, he is currently a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. The conservative movement is not just his professional career, but also personal: he is the son-in-law of Bill Kristol, a leading light of the movement turned Never Trumper.\n\nContinetti's new book The Right , a history of (as the subtitle puts it) \"the hundred-year war for American conservatism,\" tells the story of a mainstream conservative movement that tried to include the far right in its political coalition while maintaining control - a balancing act that started failing the second Trump began running.\n\nFor his part, Continetti has played the Trump ascendancy coyly. He has both effusively praised Trump, writing in 2018 that \" for Republicans, it doesn't get much better than this ,\" and called for the president's impeachment after the events of January 6 - making him the embodiment of the internal conflict at the heart of his book.\n\nThe bulk of The Right is devoted to explaining how modern conservatism rose to challenge the hegemonic liberalism of FDR, eventually emerging as a dominant force in American politics. Scholars like libertarian economist Friedrich Hayek developed the raw intellectual materials for what would become conservatism. Popularizers like National Review founder William F. Buckley synthesized these ideas into a coherent whole and brought them into the political realm. Leaders like Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan applied conservative doctrine to the political realm, seizing the reins of one of America's two major parties.\n\nIn broad strokes, this is the fairly standard origin story that conservatives tell about themselves. What sets Continetti's account apart is a willingness to engage more honestly with the darker side of the movement - how a movement that claimed to venerate the American founding and Constitution repeatedly aligned itself with forces that stood against some of its most cherished principles.\n\nTake Joe McCarthy, the communist-hunting demagogic senator. At the height of McCarthy's powers in 1953, Buckley and co-author L. Brent Bozell wrote a book - titled McCarthy and His Enemies - that criticized his excesses but mostly defended him from his critics. Years after McCarthy's fall from grace, in 1968, Buckley still described him as a man ultimately pushing a decent anti-communism.\n\nIn one of Continetti's deftest passages, he draws a subtle equivalence between the reasoning behind the conservative defense of McCarthy and its contemporary embrace of Trump:\n\nMcCarthy had enveloped the Right in his elaborate conspiracy theory. He fed off conservative alienation from government, from media, from higher education. For a time, it seemed as though this strategy of condemning American institutions as irrevocably corrupted was popular and might succeed. It could not, of course. Ultimately fantasies cannot withstand the pressure of reality.\n\nHere Continetti exposes a central danger for the conservative movement: Its alliance with the radical right over shared antipathy to the mainstream tends to bleed over, inexorably, into outright sympathy for the radicals.\n\nIn the late 1950s and 1960s, the John Birch Society - a grassroots radical right organization that pitched a McCarthy-style conspiracy theory about a creeping communist takeover - emerged as a potent political force.\n\nAt first, conservatism's most prominent leaders chose to tolerate the organization. Barry Goldwater said he disagreed with Birchers on some issues but saw \"no reason to take a stand against\" them; Buckley said he hoped the group \"thrives\" (with the caveat that they tone down conspiracy theories directed at Republicans like Eisenhower). In private, Continetti records, these men would admit that the Birchers were absurd and dangerous - but necessary for the movement's cause.\n\nConservatives did eventually break with the Birchers after using them to gain a political foothold. And for some time, they really did have success channeling the radicals without succumbing - keeping the fringe \"cabined off,\" as Continetti puts it, due in no small part to America's rivalry with the Soviet Union.\n\nBut almost immediately after the Cold War, the equilibrium began to wobble. In 1992 and 1996, Pat Buchanan - an anti-immigration extremist who had held important positions in the Nixon and Reagan White Houses - ran for the Republican presidential nomination. Those radical right campaigns, both advised by Buchanan's friend Sam Francis, were more successful than many expected.\n\n\"There was no doubt that Buchanan connected with large numbers of grassroots conservatives and GOP voters,\" Continetti writes. \"That Republican leaders sought to handle him with kid gloves ... signified a malaise within conservatism.\"\n\nThis is an admirably frank assessment, but one that also lets the conservative center off a little too easy - treating them as merely accommodating illiberal forces rather than acting illiberally themselves, as they frequently did in the post-Cold War era.\n\nIn 1994, a new crop of hard-right conservatives entered Congress and, under House Speaker Newt Gingrich, reoriented the party toward a no-holds-barred legislative style scornful of historic norms . In Bush v. Gore , the Supreme Court's conservatives embraced dubious legal logic to elevate George W. Bush to the presidency; once in office, Bush proceeded to shred civil liberties in the name of fighting terror . After Barack Obama's election, the rise of the Tea Party led to another far-right resurgence in the Republican Party - one embraced, despite its clear racist overtones , by the party leadership.\n\nMainstream conservatives were not pure victims of a hostile radical right takeover: Their in-principle commitment to democracy and liberal rights was always thinner than their paeans to the Constitution made it seem. A movement with a history of sacrificing democratic principles in pursuit of policy and political victories was always vulnerable to a demagogue - as Donald Trump would prove in 2016.\n\nContinetti seems to condemn the Trump presidency in the book's penultimate chapter, but his assessment is colored by the tendencies in conservatism he himself diagnosed. In Continetti's view, the Trump presidency was not necessarily rotted from the core, but was a largely successful enterprise ruined almost single-handedly by the Capitol riot:\n\nIf Trump had followed the example of his predecessors and conceded power graciously and peacefully, he would have been remembered as a disruptive but consequential populist leader who, before the coronavirus pandemic, presided over an economic boom [and] reoriented America's opinion of China ... Instead, when historians write about the Trump era, they will do so through the lens of January 6.\n\nIn the final chapter, he argues that the future of conservatism rests in a kind of Trumpism without Trump: one that incorporates \"the modifications to conservative policy positions that Donald Trump forced on the movement [while] untangling the Republican party and conservative movement from Donald Trump.\"\n\nContinetti's faith in the movement's power to channel the forces behind Trumpism, even after January 6, is an unintentional vindication of one of his book's core lessons: that riding the radical right tiger is fundamental to conservatism's political strategy.\n\nUnlike Continetti, Tim Miller has made a decisive break with Trump and the Republican Party. A longtime Republican campaign operative who worked for John McCain in 2008, the Republican National Committee in 2012, and Jeb Bush in 2016, he was one of the authors of the now-infamous \" Republican autopsy \" after the 2012 election, which argued that the party should embrace a more socially moderate agenda (especially on immigration) to win over younger voters and people of color.\n\nMiller's just-released book Why We Did It attempts to tell the story of how he went from Republican stalwart to Never Trumper - and why the overwhelming majority of his friends and coworkers did not.\n\nMiller points to the strategy laid out by Continetti as a key source of rot: that decades of courting far-right supporters helped convince Republicans that they could stoke reactionary fervor while simultaneously controlling their real-world influence.\n\n\"Those of us at the Republican National Committee, on the Hill, and throughout various GOP campaign high commands were under the impression that we were wise enough to be the self-imposed limits on the base's excesses,\" he writes.\n\nMiller uses himself as an example of the psychology at work - a long-closeted gay man who worked for a party that opposed his fundamental rights. He describes himself, and most political operatives, as coping with such tensions by treating politics as more of a game they played for a living than something with real-world stakes.\n\nOnce you start playing the game, it's very hard to quit. Your professional success and financial well-being depend on continued advancement in the party. The demanding nature of the job leaves limited time for socializing and hobbies. Your coworkers become your social circle, your job your entire identity.\n\nWhen your entire life centers on the party, you contort your own psychology to justify unconditional allegiance - even when someone you despise becomes its leader. Miller illustrates the power of this psychology, and the way in which it contorted the entire Republican Party, through a series of vignettes and case studies of high-profile Republicans he knows personally.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) - who Miller recalls cornering him and Jeb Bush in a New York bar for hours to rant about Trump - believed converting to Trumpism would better position him to influence key decisions. Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY), the formerly moderate lead author of the GOP autopsy report, correctly judged Trumpism to be the best way to advance her career.\n\nThe most affecting such portrait in Miller's book is of his formerly close friend Caroline Wren, a top Trump fundraiser who helped plan the January 6 rally . Miller describes Wren as kind and empathetic; in 2015, she was so affected by the Syrian refugee crisis that she flew to Germany to help resettle children seeking asylum.\n\nYet this person, somehow, ended up as an enabler for Donald Trump. Today, she still refuses to admit that Biden won the election.\n\nWhen Miller presses her on why, she says her attraction to Trump was \"probably all negative\" - that she had come to despise liberals so much that she was willing to help Trump burn it all down. This idea, that America's greatest enemy is overweening liberalism, is what justified the political alliance with the far right even among the most high-minded conservative intellectuals.\n\nJoe McCarthy had the right enemies, so his excesses could be forgiven. The Birchers could help fight the liberals, so they needed to be tolerated and even appeased (for a time). Trump may have tried to undermine democracy, but at least he can give us the Supreme Court.\n\nIn creating or capturing a series of institutions - think tanks, magazines, activist groups, and above all the Republican Party - the conservative movement built a political entity that could help it challenge liberalism. But this body was so oriented toward anti-liberal politics that it could muster little resistance against a radical right infection; once a serious enough case presented, the virus swiftly consumed the host. And after it did, the social and professional structure of these institutions compelled nearly everyone involved to get with the program - even at the cost of abandoning democratic institutions.\n\nThe Supreme Court's rulings on abortion, guns, and religion may have many conservatives thinking it was all worth it: Despite the indignities, their partnership with Trump got them the policy victories they wanted. And with Trump facing mounting legal trouble while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis continues rising in the 2024 primary polls , they may believe in their power to create a Trumpism without Trump .\n\nBut the split screen last week between the January 6 hearings and the Supreme Court's seismic decisions couldn't have been more instructive on the dangers of this belief - twinned reminders of what the Republicans were willing to countenance and what it won in the process. The only two Republicans who dared to join the January 6 committee, Reps. Adam Kinzinger and Liz Cheney, are (respectively) retiring and facing a daunting primary challenge . A Republican who stood up to Trump's lies - Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers - nonetheless affirmed he'd still vote for the former president in 2024 .\n\nWhat America faces now is a conservatism unbounded. While the movement of the past regularly partnered with the radical right, and even shared some of its beliefs, it also would on occasion police it - belatedly turning out the Birchers and Sam Francis. Today's conservatism has jettisoned that modicum of caution. It's a conservatism that isn't conservative but downright revolutionary.\n\nAnd having had a taste of victory, there is no sign that the Republican Party is willing, or even capable, of reimposing the limits that once made it safe for democratic politics.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nJD Vance and like-minded conservatives are theorizing a kind of \"neopatriarchy.\"\n\nby Zack Beauchamp\n\nWhen you look at what the right's rising leaders are saying, it's clear that conservatives have become increasingly obsessed with the fate of the American family . From Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance assailing \" childless cat ladies \" to Elon Musk fretting about a birth rate apocalypse , there is a deep and abiding sense that the family is in dire need of defense.\n\nRecently, a loose group of conservatives has emerged with a solution: that the family can be defended by boldly reasserting the importance of old-school gender roles. The movement tells men to be strong and women to have babies without overtly insisting that women must submit to their husbands or stay at home. It's an effort to revive an older model of gender relations without the explicitly sexist baggage (though it often resurfaces in a more subtle form).\n\nThe ideas and trends driving the conservative movement, from senior correspondent Zack Beauchamp.\n\nI call this loose movement \"neopatriarchy,\" and have come to believe that it is at the root of both some of the modern right's biggest ideas and its most interesting internal conflicts.\n\nConcerns about the family's health are hardly new on the right. Speaking in 1977, influential conservative writer Russell Kirk claimed that a nearly enacted universal daycare bill threatened to disintegrate the family and substitute the state.\n\n\"We would be foolish to ignore a drift in what we call 'the West' toward the supplanting of the family by the Universal Orphanage,\" Kirk said, warning that the daycare bill specifically \"would have encouraged even affluent mothers to consign their little children to the baby-bin and spend their days at bridge-clubs.\"\n\nKirk's fears reflected the central conservative preoccupation of the time: the threat from communism and the ever-growing powers of the modern state. It was \"compulsory collectivism,\" for Kirk, that threatened to tear familial bonds apart.\n\nModern neopatriarchy begins from the opposite fear; the concern is not communist collectivism, but liberal individualism.\n\nThe neopatriarchs believe we live in an age where people prioritize self-actualization and fulfillment above all else. Young adults, they argue, live in extended adolescence, lost in some combination of video games, drugs, and casual sex; as they age, raw hedonism is replaced by single-minded foci on money and career. According to neopatriarchs, this liberal social model fails men and women alike, funneling them toward a spiritually empty existence that all but guarantees disappointment and depression, and it fails society by discouraging the production of children who are quite literally required if the country is to have a future. (Immigration, needless to say, is not seen as an acceptable solution.)\n\nThe solution, for neopatriarchs, is to return to the past. Men need to rediscover the old John Wayne vision of masculinity, making traditional male gender markers (including acting as fatherly provider) into defining aspects of their identity. The state should play a role in encouraging this reversion, primarily by changing policy to cultivate \"masculine\" virtues and incentivizing marriage and child-rearing.\n\nIn his recent book Manhood , Republican Sen. Josh Hawley urges men to embrace strength and stoicism as routes for self-improvement, calling on them to take on the roles of \"warrior\" and \"builder\" in their everyday lives. The psychologist Jordan Peterson has long dispensed similar advice , helping turn him into a conservative guru. In his forthcoming book Dawn's Early Light , Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts argues that contraceptive technologies \"break the most basic functioning elements of civilization\" by liberating individuals to have consequence-free sex out of wedlock. Vance, who wrote the forward to Roberts's book, has mused about eliminating no-fault divorce for similar neopatriarchal reasons.\n\nNeopatriarchy can be distinguished from straight-up patriarchy primarily through its treatment of women. Unlike some Christian fundamentalists or alt-right scribblers , neopatriarchs do not assert that women are obligated to be homemakers as a result of divine commandment or natural law. All they insist on explicitly is that women have lots of children, and that choosing to focus primarily on raising said children is no worse than having a career.\n\nIt's obvious why liberals and leftists would have problems taking this seriously. If Americans are supposed to be having more kids, and American men are supposed to be more traditionally masculine, then who's supposed to be doing the work of raising all of these kids? The answer, of course, is wives (as it's certainly not immigrants). Neopatrarichy may not explicitly call for a reversal of the feminist revolution, but that's basically what it's going for.\n\nIndeed, neopatriarchal writing rarely floats the idea that more men should be homemakers - and often suggests that women are happier at home . The choice to work is theoretically left up to women, but the traditional option is at the very least suggested. The neopatriarchal vision for women is thus most clearly expressed through popular \" tradwife \" and big-family TikTok influencers: women who became social media evangelists for a family-first lifestyle, occasionally giving up formal careers in order to do so.\n\nBut it's not just feminists who have problems with neopatriarchy.\n\nThere's a class of conservatives, mostly men, who despise the left primarily because it tells them what to do: that it's offensive to ogle women or use male pronouns for a transgender woman. This group, famously termed \" Barstool conservatives \" after the bro-y Barstool Sports website, enjoys partying and casual sex - and resents people telling them to knock it off.\n\nThis has led to some real skepticism about neopatriarchal ideas. When Vance's comments calling for non-parents to pay a higher tax rate came to light, Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy called Vance a \" moron \" in a post on Twitter/X.\n\n\"You want me to pay more taxes to take care of other people's kids? We sure this dude is a Republican?\" Portnoy asked. \"If you can't afford a big family don't have a ton of kids.\"\n\nWith Republicans out of the White House, these divisions have largely been confined to posting wars. But should Trump retake the presidency, his administration would likely include prominent neopatriarchical voices - including Vance himself. That would launch a high-stakes national debate over an issue some may have thought settled: whether the state should favor families with traditional gender roles.\n\nThe ideas and trends driving the conservative movement, from senior correspondent Zack Beauchamp.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue. But the benefits of fighting his lawless deportations are worth the political risks.\n\nTrade wars are easy to win - if you're China.\n\nHow Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.\n\nCanary Mission, the controversial organization targeting student activists, explained.\n\n3 theories for Gen Z's return to God and faith.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nSupreme Court journalists should tell the truth about what's going on at the Court.\n\nby Ian Millhiser\n\nMy more perceptive readers may have noticed that I've started referring to the justices of the Supreme Court as \"Republicans\" and \"Democrats,\" breaking with the traditional journalistic norm of labeling the justices \"conservative\" or \"liberal.\" In the interest of transparency, I want to explain why.\n\nThe short answer is that the words \"Republican\" and \"Democrat\" help convey what has happened to the Supreme Court in the last several decades. The Court has always been a political institution, but for most of its history there were not the hardline distinctions between justices chosen by a president of one political party, and justices chosen by the other party that we see today. As recently as 2010, for example, the Court included Justice John Paul Stevens, a Gerald Ford appointee who typically voted with the Court's liberal wing.\n\nGet the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.\n\nGone as well are relatively moderate jurists like Justices Lewis Powell, Sandra Day O'Connor, and Anthony Kennedy. These were the sorts of justices who voted to limit abortion rights , but not to eliminate them . They placed strict restrictions on affirmative action , but didn't kill it entirely .\n\nNow, however, this kind of moderation is anathema, especially to Republican legal elites, many of whom still use the battle cry \" No More Souters \" to describe their approach to judicial appointments - a reference to Justice David Souter, a George H.W. Bush appointee who turned out to be a moderate liberal.\n\nThe Republican Party's highest officials certainly haven't behaved as if they think that justices are nonpartisan. Why else would Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell make up a fake rule to stop President Barack Obama from confirming a Supreme Court justice in the final year of his presidency? McConnell claimed that justices may not be confirmed in a presidential election year. Then he abandoned this fake rule four years later to place Trump appointee Amy Coney Barrett on the high court.\n\nNor have Democrats failed to police their own nominees' ideological conformity. None of the Supreme Court justices appointed by presidents Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, or Joe Biden broke with the Democratic Party's approach to judging in the same way that Souter broke from the GOP's. All of them generally supported abortion rights, affirmative action, marriage equality, and the Affordable Care Act. Every Democrat on the Supreme Court opposed Donald Trump's claim that he could commit crimes while he was in office . All of the Court's Democrats oppose the Republican justices' decisions giving themselves a veto power over any regulatory decision made by the executive branch.\n\nThe word \"conservative,\" which is typically used to signal caution or an allegiance to the status quo, is a particularly inappropriate term to describe this Court's Republican majority. What, exactly, are the Republican justices \"conserving\" when they overrule multiple seminal precedents in a single term ? What is \"conservative\" about abandoning the Court's procedural norms to hand down revolutionary new legal rules on the Court's shadow docket ? What is \"conservative\" about rushing out half-baked legal standards that are incomprehensible to lower court judges ?\n\nI am a journalist. That means it is my job to convey truth to my readers, and to describe the Court that I cover as accurately as I possibly can. And the unfortunate truth is that the Supreme Court of the United States is now a partisan institution. I would do my readers a disservice if I covered up this reality. Or if I used euphemistic language like \"conservatives\" and \"liberals\" to describe fundamentally partisan political appointees.\n\nAnd so I will not. And I encourage other journalists to do the same.\n\nIt's astonishing how little thought many past presidents put into their Supreme Court appointments. In the past, justices were often chosen for idiosyncratic personal reasons, or to please a particular interest group or voting bloc, and without much, if any, inquiry into how the nominee was likely to decide cases.\n\nPresident Woodrow Wilson, for example, appointed Justice James Clark McReynolds - an awful judge and an even worse human being who Time magazine once described as a \" savagely sarcastic, incredibly reactionary Puritan anti-Semite \" - in large part because Wilson found McReynolds, who was US attorney general before he joined the Court, to be so obnoxious that the president promoted him to get him out of the Cabinet .\n\nSimilarly, President Dwight Eisenhower complained late in his presidency that appointing Justice William Brennan, one of the most consequential left-liberal jurists in American history, to the Supreme Court was among the biggest mistakes he made in office . But Ike's White House never vetted Brennan for his ideological views, and Brennan was selected largely because Eisenhower was running for reelection when he made the nomination, and he thought that appointing a Catholic like Brennan would appeal to Catholic voters .\n\nEven in 1990, after top Republican officials had published lengthy documents laying out their party's vision for the Constitution, they still hadn't developed a reliable system for vetting Supreme Court nominees to ensure that they were on board with the party's agenda. Bush chose the center-left Justice Souter over other, more right-wing candidates largely due to misguided advice from his top legal advisers.\n\nAs journalist Jan Crawford Greenburg reported in a 2007 book , Souter beat out early frontrunner Ken Starr - the same Ken Starr who would go on to hound President Bill Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky investigation - in large part because Bush's right-wing advisers feared that Starr was too liberal. According to Crawford Greenburg, then-Deputy Attorney General Bill Barr opposed Starr because of a low-stakes dispute over \"a federal law that permitted private citizens to sue for fraud against the federal government.\"\n\nMuch has changed since 1990. On the Republican side, the Federalist Society - a kind of bar association for right-wing lawyers with chapters on most law school campuses and in most major cities - now starts vetting law students for elite legal jobs almost as soon as they begin their studies. And Republican presidents can rely on the Federalist Society to identify ideologically reliable candidates for the bench. As Trump said in 2016 while campaigning for president, \"We're going to have great judges, conservative, all picked by the Federalist Society.\"\n\nNor is the Federalist Society the only way Republicans vet potential Supreme Court nominees. Every single one of the Court's current Republican members except for Barrett previously served as a political appointee in a GOP administration , roles that allowed high-level Republicans to observe their work and probe their views.\n\nDemocrats' vetting process, meanwhile, is more informal. But it's been no less successful in identifying Supreme Court nominees who reliably embrace their party's stance on the most contentious issues. The last Democrat appointed to the Supreme Court who broke with the party's pro-abortion rights stance, for example, was Justice Byron White - a dissenter in Roe v. Wade appointed by President John F. Kennedy in 1962 .\n\nThe result is a modern-day Supreme Court where every single member was carefully selected by their party to ensure that they will not stray on any of the issues where the two parties have settled views. Every Republican justice voted to abolish affirmative action on nearly all university campuses, with every Democratic justice in dissent. Every Republican voted to give the leader of the Republican Party broad immunity from criminal prosecution , with every Democrat in dissent. Every Republican except for Roberts voted to overrule Roe (and Roberts merely argued that the Court should have waited a little longer), while every Democrat dissented.\n\nSo, with all this evidence that the Supreme Court has become no less partisan than Congress or the presidency, what are the arguments against speaking of the justices in the same way we speak of presidents or members of Congress?\n\nLet's start with the worst - albeit fairly common - argument for labeling the justices as nonpartisan actors: the claim that the justices are merely carrying out a particular \"judicial philosophy\" when they make decisions, and not making decisions based on what outcome their political party would prefer.\n\nAs a descriptive matter, it's probably true that most of the justices imagine themselves as devotees to a particular philosophy of judging, rather than as partisans carrying out a predetermined agenda. The six Republican justices who ruled that Trump was allowed to do crimes while he was in office, for example, would probably claim that they were applying a legal theory known as the \" unitary executive \" when they ruled in Trump's favor - and not that they were reflexively protecting their own party leader.\n\nBut this distinction is entirely academic, and it says nothing about how judges actually behave on the bench. As a practical matter, the difference between a hypothetical justice who consistently votes for the Republican Party's preferred outcomes because they've adopted a \"judicial philosophy\" that reliably leads to those outcomes (we'll call this hypothetical justice \" Clarence Thomas \"), and a hypothetical justice who votes for the same outcomes because they are a party loyalist (we'll call this hypothetical justice \" Samuel Alito \"), is nonexistent.\n\nA slightly more sophisticated rebuttal is that the Court's Republicans often vote with the Court's Democrats. This is especially true in cases that do not raise politically contentious issues, but it also occasionally happens in cases involving divisive issues such as abortion . As Sarah Isgur and Dean Jens argue in an early June article making this claim, in the Court's 2022-23 term, \"about 50 percent of the court's cases were decided unanimously.\"\n\nIt is true that the Court still hears a decent share of cases involving technical legal questions - such as when someone seeking certain veterans benefits should file a particular form, or when certain bankruptcy cases may be appealed - that do not divide the justices along partisan lines. But the same can be said about the other branches of government.\n\nIn the month of July alone, for example, Congress enacted, and President Joe Biden signed, 13 new laws . None of these laws divided the two parties, and all of them were passed overwhelmingly - in some cases by a voice vote or by unanimous consent. Yet political reporters have no problem with labeling members of Congress \"Democrats\" or \"Republicans\" even though those members frequently agree about which bills should become law.\n\nSimilarly, if you look at the schedule of, say, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, you will find that it is dominated by the sort of ordinary governance issues that come before governors of either party. DeSantis recently awarded an $8 million grant to help build roads in a Miami park , for example. And he touted the fact that emergency responders in Florida \"pumped more than 194 million gallons of floodwaters\" from Florida communities hit by Hurricane Debby.\n\nIt's likely that, if Florida's governor was a Democrat, the state would have had a similar response to a hurricane. But the fact that DeSantis frequently oversees nonpartisan activity does not make him any less of a Republican.\n\nIt's also true that the Supreme Court, despite its Republican majority, sometimes reverses lower court decisions that would have moved the law aggressively rightward. In its most recent term, the justices reversed several fairly extreme decisions from the far-right United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, including one that could have triggered a second Great Depression .\n\nBut, again, the fact that the Republican justices do not always take maximally right-wing views does not make them less Republican. Nor does it distinguish them from Republicans in other parts of the government. Many GOP members of Congress, for example, oppose providing military aid to Ukraine. But, when a Ukraine aid bill finally reached the House and Senate floors this spring, it was supported by 101 Republican House members and 31 Republican senators .\n\nSimilarly, in 2023, DeSantis proposed unconstitutional legislation that would have limited press freedom in the state of Florida . Yet, while some Florida Republicans backed DeSantis, the bill died after conservative media organizations lobbied Republican lawmakers , warning them that the bill might hurt right-wing outlets.\n\nIt is entirely normal, in other words, for Republican officials to disagree about specific issues, even if they share a partisan identity and a general approach to governance. The fact that the Republican justices also sometimes disagree with each other, or with more extreme Republicans elsewhere in the judiciary, does not make them any less Republican.\n\nThe Republican justices, in other words, behave just like Republicans in other policymaking roles. They sometimes disagree with their fellow Republicans on important issues, but they also share a broad theory of governance, as well as a fairly granular agenda that includes (among other things) eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion, implementing a \" colorblind \" theory of the Constitution, and centralizing regulatory authority in the judicial branch of government.\n\nThis shared agenda, moreover, did not happen by coincidence. It happened because Republicans developed a coherent view of the Constitution and the role of the judiciary, and then built sophisticated institutions to ensure that their judicial appointees share this view.\n\nJournalists do not hesitate to label, say, former Attorney General Bill Barr a \"Republican\" just because he was appointed to high office and not elected, and we should not treat the political appointees on the Supreme Court any differently. We should call the Republican justices \"Republicans,\" and the Democratic justices \"Democrats,\" because that is the best way to educate our readers about how the modern-day Supreme Court actually functions.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nTrump's lawyers asked the Supreme Court to reinstate his ban on trans military service, after a lower court blocked it.\n\nMany of the justices seemed eager to impose impossible burdens on schools.\n\nThe two Republican justices appeared open to an attack on Obamacare, but ultimately seemed likely to reject it.\n\n﻿In an unusual overnight order, most of the justices voted to halt several illegal deportations.\n\nHow can you punish Trump officials for violating the law, when federal law enforcement is controlled by Trump?\n\nThe Oklahoma charter school case is one of two April cases seeking to remake schools in the religious right's image.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

      "text": "The conservative push for \"school choice\" has had its most successful year ever\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nWhy did it break through after decades of effort - and what comes next?\n\nby Andrew Prokop\n\nWith little national attention, the conservative movement has racked up a remarkable series of victories on one of their long-held policy dreams.\n\nFor decades, activists on the right have pushed to steer state money toward alternatives to the public school system. Typically, they proposed vouchers, in which the state would pay part or all of a child's private school tuition.\n\nBut despite all this effort, conservatives could only get limited and targeted voucher programs into place - vouchers for low-income families, or those in low-performing school districts, or for students with disabilities.\n\nEven in the reddest states, they fell short of their true Holy Grail: public money funding private school tuition, for all who want it, including middle-class and wealthy families.\n\nVery suddenly, that has changed. It started with West Virginia in 2021 and Arizona in 2022, and then continued with a flood this year - Iowa, Utah, Arkansas, Florida, Oklahoma, Ohio, and Indiana. More may follow. \"It's happening!\" Corey DeAngelis, a conservative activist who describes himself as a \" school choice evangelist ,\" regularly tweets, joyfully chronicling each new victory.\n\nThe reform sweeping red America is slightly different from a voucher - it's called an education savings account, or an ESA. In a voucher system, public funds go directly to schools. With ESAs, parents who opt out of the public school system get several thousand dollars in an account that they can use for private school tuition, homeschooling, or other education-related expenses.\n\nBut the biggest change is in who can use them: everyone. \"It's really hard to overstate how different from any kind of previous legislation these programs are,\" said Liz Cohen, policy director for Georgetown University's FutureEd think tank. \"It's not income-tested; it's not about getting the lowest-income kids in the worst schools. Prior to three years ago, I would have bet a lot of money you would have never seen this happen.\"\n\nThe aftereffects of the Covid-19 pandemic and an unfolding culture war shook up the status quo enough that a longstanding, well-financed conservative advocacy effort could finally defeat longstanding resistance. Now, in many red states and the occasional purple state, we're seeing what could prove the most sweeping change in K-12 education policy in decades.\n\n\"We're ending up with, really, two different systems for arranging our schools,\" said Morgan Polikoff, an associate professor at USC Rossier School of Education. Blue states are sticking with the traditional state-funded public education system, while red states are increasingly creating an option for government-subsidized private school tuition - the full consequences of which won't be clear for some time.\n\nCritics of these changes argue they amount to a wealth transfer to families with kids in private schools, and they fear it will result in the weakening or even the eventual privatization of public school systems. They also voice concern over the separation of church and state, since many ESA funds will go toward sending children to religious education.\n\nFor many supporters, those are features, not bugs. They characterize the new ESA laws as letting parents take \"their money\" - the dollars that would have been used to educate their kids - out of public schools they have no interest in using. They call this \"funding students instead of systems.\" Their critics say it's the destruction of the common good.\n\nPublic schools have long been treated as a public resource. They are typically administered by local governments, free to all, and funded by taxpayers generally, including those who don't have children.\n\nBut in a 1955 paper , economist Milton Friedman proposed a different model. The government should stop running schools, and instead merely give parents vouchers worth a certain amount that could be redeemed at \"approved\" educational institutions. This, he asserted, would create free market competition, expand the choices available to parents, and produce better outcomes than the current government-funded monopolies.\n\nIn the ensuing decades, various groups dissatisfied with the public school system would come to embrace vouchers as an alternative, as journalist Cara Fitzpatrick writes in her new book The Death of Public School . The coalition included free market enthusiasts like Friedman, but also devout families preferring religious schooling for their children. And as school desegregation was taking place, some Southern white parents hoped voucher-like policies could help fund their kids' exit to mostly white private schools. These policies were eventually blocked by courts, meaning \"white flight\" had to occur without government help.\n\nThe most effective converts to the voucher cause were several deep-pocketed conservative donors - members of the DeVos , Koch , and Walton families, and leaders of the Bradley Foundation , among others. Some appeared to be motivated by free market ideology and others by religious belief, but the common thread was a disdain for government.\n\nThese donors' largesse and consistency ensured that, whichever way the political winds were blowing, there would always be a well-funded network of voucher supporters refining policy arguments, shaping advocacy strategy, and conducting research that would produce results showing vouchers \"work.\" Over the past few decades, these donors spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the cause - promoting vouchers as well as other policies, like charter schools, under the banner of \"school choice.\"\n\nWhen the quality of American schools became a nationwide concern in the 1980s and onward, conservatives pitched vouchers as a solution, framing them now as a civil rights cause . Too many poor or minority children, they said, were trapped in dysfunctional public schools. Vouchers could give some of them other options - and perhaps they could even create competitive pressures to make the public schools better. This argument prevailed in Wisconsin in 1990, when Republicans joined with a few Democrats to create the nation's first modern voucher program , for low-income kids in Milwaukee (an idea promoted by the Wisconsin-based Bradley Foundation).\n\nBut most Democrats were anti-voucher. They argued that voucher programs would harm the public school system, draining funds and students from it. Teachers unions , a powerful Democratic-aligned interest group, were staunch opponents because private schools were non-unionized.\n\nSo at the peak of the education reform movement in the 2000s, most of the bipartisan action was on other issues. President George W. Bush's No Child Left Behind Act focused instead on testing and accountability for schools deemed to be \"failing\" - Bush supported vouchers, but Democrats largely didn't, and he needed them to pass the bill. President Barack Obama notably backed charter schools , which are public schools administered by independent operators, but he was hostile to vouchers.\n\nWhen a few Republican-controlled states, such as Ohio, Florida, Arizona, Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Indiana, did pass statewide voucher programs, they came with sharply restricted eligibility. These were specialized programs for low-income people, those in districts with poor-performing schools, foster children, or children with special needs.\n\nFor vouchers' biggest backers, this was never just about helping the disadvantaged. They wanted vouchers for all. And yet, despite all that conservative money and activism, not a single state had managed to create such a program by 2020.\n\nThe simplest reason is that proposals to radically disrupt public schools were unpopular. The opposition was typically led by Democrats and teachers unions, but even many Republican voters were deeply skeptical about anything that could be framed as weakening their own public schools.\n\nOften, suburban parents had moved to an area specifically for high-quality public schools. Meanwhile, in rural areas, there could be few private options, the public schools were often significant employers, and a loss of students could mean a painful loss of funding. \"The main opposition to these programs in Republican-dominated states has come from rural superintendents,\" a recent Heritage Foundation paper stated . So typically, proposals for statewide vouchers ended up watered down or blocked even in Republican-controlled legislatures.\n\nWhen voucher proponents took their case to the public, it went even more disastrously.\n\nIn 2000, Betsy DeVos (who would later go on to become President Donald Trump's education secretary) and her family spent about $5 million on a Michigan voucher ballot initiative, but it failed by a 69 percent to 31 percent margin. A similar measure in California that same year failed 70-30 . Out of about two dozen voucher ballot initiatives, none were approved .\n\nMeanwhile, the few programs that passed the legislature faced court challenges, nationally and on the state level, often over government funding of religious schools. Some were struck down - including Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's prized voucher program and a fledgling Arizona voucher program for special needs students. An alternative policy scheme involving tax credits for families who donated to nonprofits that would provide private school scholarship money gained steam in some states .\n\nThe obstacles for vouchers seemed so daunting that, in 2005, Dan Lips, an education policy expert at the Arizona-based Goldwater Institute, proposed a new spin on the policy : education savings accounts (ESAs). Now, instead of a voucher coupon that would be given directly to a private school, parents would get an account in which actual money would be deposited, and the money could also be spent on tutoring, homeschooling, or other education-related expenses.\n\nAdvocates hoped this would address the Arizona Supreme Court's concern over funding religious schools, which had undone the state's voucher program. Now the state money would be given to parents, not to schools directly.\n\nESAs were also a helpful rebranding. \"Part of my job was to actively call reporters and try to get them to take the word 'voucher' out of their stories,\" said Charles Siler, a former lobbyist for the Goldwater Institute who has since become a critic of his onetime allies.\n\nIn 2011, Arizona Republicans passed the nation's first ESA program, limited to special needs students. They immediately went to work expanding eligibility to other groups - just one year later, nearly 20 percent of the public school population was eligible (though far fewer actually chose to participate).\n\nBut a 2018 attempt to make every Arizona student eligible ran into the Red for Ed movement of teacher activism and walkouts in conservative states. Opponents of the new law gathered enough signatures to put it up for a statewide referendum before it could go into effect. The result was similar to the other referendums: a lopsided defeat , 65 to 35 percent.\n\nEven in red states, it seemed, you still couldn't mess with the public schools.\n\nIt's a cliché to say the pandemic changed everything, but for the politics of K-12 education that happens to be true.\n\nUniversal voucher bills had long failed because most parents didn't want radical disruption of the public school status quo. The pandemic brought this radical disruption. Polarizing battles unfolded over school closures, mask and vaccine requirements, and (after reopening) how long kids should be kept home if classmates tested positive.\n\nThen the culture war that erupted over race, gender, and sexuality teaching in schools in 2020 and beyond ensured that things never entirely returned to \"normal.\" Activists like Christopher Rufo argued that \" critical race theory \" concepts were pervading teaching about race, Twitter accounts like Libs of TikTok spread videos of educators discussing gender identity , and such matters became omnipresent on Fox News and in conservative media.\n\nIn the right's narrative, parents reasonably recoiled against the incompetence or ideological extremism of educators. In the left's narrative, conservatives targeted the public school system with a strategic and unrelenting campaign of vilification, laden with exaggeration and moral panic . \"The overriding message has been to drive a wedge between parents and public schools,\" Polikoff said.\n\nConservative activists saw opportunity. \"It is time for the school choice movement to embrace the culture war,\" the Heritage Foundation's Jay Greene and James Paul wrote in 2022 .\n\nIn a 2019 survey, 31 percent of Republican respondents said they had very little or no confidence in public schools; in a 2022 survey, that number had risen to 50 percent. Democratic and independent voters, in contrast, remained roughly as confident in the public school system as before the pandemic.\n\nBut the drop in Republican support shifted the previous political status quo, especially in red states, making rank-and-file GOP voters less hostile about proposals to shake up the system.\n\nIn June 2021, Joel John was a few months into his first term in the Arizona House of Representatives, when the state's governor, Doug Ducey, took another shot at greatly expanding ESAs. Though a Republican, John wasn't on board. He was concerned that public schools had to compete with unregulated private schools that lacked accountability measures. Two other Republicans, citing similar objections, joined him and blocked the proposal .\n\n\"It was my first term; it takes time to get your bearings and to understand how things work,\" John told me in an interview. He would soon learn. Afterward, John and the other two holdouts were attacked in YouTube ads funded by an outside group: the American Federation for Children (AFC).\n\nThe American Federation for Children has long been the leading advocacy group trying to get vouchers passed into law. It was initially funded, founded, and chaired by Betsy DeVos, who was for many years the main financial force behind the voucher movement. (The group's name is a dig at the American Federation of Teachers - meant to imply that the union represents teachers' interests, while the group represents children's.)\n\nInvestor Bill Oberndorf, who took over as board chair when DeVos became education secretary, outlined AFC's strategy on a 2021 podcast . Statewide referendums were hopeless, he said: \"There has never been a ballot initiative that's passed.\" Instead, AFC would identify \"states where we feel that, over a three- to five-year period, we can change the legislative composition to be favorable to choice and where we can help elect a governor who is receptive to signing such legislation.\" That legislation, it became increasingly clear, was ESAs for all who wanted them.\n\nIn Arizona, a sympathetic governor was already in place: Ducey. Ambitious Republican governors seeking to cultivate the conservative base have long been drawn to the school choice issue - it's important to both big donors and the religious right, two key factions in GOP power politics, and it earns positive press in conservative media outlets . John's impression, he told me, was that Ducey was \"hoping to build a national platform\" off the issue.\n\nIn 2021, West Virginia Republicans had created an ESA for which 90 percent of students would be eligible (students currently attending private schools were excluded ). Implementation there was delayed due to a lawsuit . So in 2022, his final year in office, Ducey took another shot at getting the nation's first truly universal ESA program - in which even families already sending their kids to private school could get money - off the ground in Arizona.\n\nDucey faced the same three GOP holdouts in the state House. But he and his party's legislative leaders deployed carrots and sticks. The carrot was a historic boost in funding to the public education system, made possible due to a large budget surplus. The stick was pressure from party leaders and outside groups before the primaries. In the end, all three of the holdouts flipped, voting for the bill . \"To be frank, I have regretted it ever since,\" John told me.\n\nAll three went on to lose their primaries that year anyway. Meanwhile, liberal activists tried to gather signatures to force the new law onto the ballot, as they did during the Red for Ed days, but they fell short . So the nation's first universal ESA program went into effect in Arizona in the fall of 2022.\n\nIt would not be the last. AFC intervened in state legislative primaries across the country that year, hoping some attention-getting defeats of incumbents could scare others into going along. In Iowa, after Gov. Kim Reynolds's ESA bill failed in the state House, she backed primary challenges against several holdout Republicans. Assisted by campaign ads funded by AFC and other conservative groups like the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity, they defeated four of them.\n\nOne, Jim Thorup, was a solid conservative but feared the bill would harm rural school districts. \"I think if I agree with the governor on nine out of ten issues, that tenth issue, if we disagree on it, that should be okay,\" Thorup had told the Iowa Capital Dispatch before the election.\n\nAFC's goal was to make sure that wasn't okay - they wanted to make \"universal school choice\" a litmus test issue for Republicans, as previous generations of anti-abortion, pro-gun rights, and anti-tax activists had successfully done for their own causes. Yet the groups could only succeed in this if enough Republican voters felt the same way, and largely, they now did.\n\nThe midterms didn't end up producing a GOP wave, but as 2023 began, a wave of ESA bills rippled through red states. Corey DeAngelis, a senior fellow at AFC, became the public face of the effort, traveling from state to state, holding rallies, making media appearances, and tweeting constantly. After getting his PhD at the University of Arkansas's ( Walton-funded ) education reform program, DeAngelis concluded that he could \"make more of an impact\" in an advocacy role. \"You can write a thousand white papers and politicians won't even read it,\" he told me.\n\nIowa was the first domino to fall this year, with Gov. Reynolds finally getting her ESA bill through the now-more-pliable legislature in January. Republicans in Utah, Arkansas, Florida, Oklahoma, Ohio, and Indiana soon followed with their own universal or near-universal ESA laws (though some will phase in eligibility gradually over a few years).\n\nOther GOP-controlled states didn't go quite so far, but took steps in that direction - South Carolina created its first ESA program, New Hampshire expanded eligibility for the program it created in 2021. In other states like Georgia and Texas, advocates have fallen short for now, but they will try again.\n\nArizona's universal ESA program, which went into effect in fall 2022, is the furthest along so far. Arizona families who already sent their children to private schools or homeschools were immediately eligible for the $7,000-per-student benefit, if they signed up. Many have.\n\nAfter John left office, he told me, he spoke with a local banker about the bill: \"I told him it was such bad policy, I was embarrassed I supported it,\" John said. \"He said he was happy about it: it saved him seven grand per kid on tuition.\"\n\n\"In the short term, mostly it's just going to be a funding giveaway to families that were already sending their kids to private schools,\" said Douglas Harris, an economist at Tulane University who studies education policy. \"In the long run, there's potentially a much bigger story here.\"\n\nBy mid-May 2023, about 61,000 Arizona students were enrolled in an ESA, and the state department of education estimated that number would rise to 100,000, about 8 percent of school-aged children in the state, over the next year.\n\nShortly after the universal program was opened, the state superintendent (then a Democrat) said that 75 percent of applicants had never attended public schools in the state. More recently, the current superintendent (a Republican) said 49 percent of enrollees had been in public schools . All we know for sure is that some families who weren't using the public school system are now getting money to do what they were already doing, and some families who had been attending public schools are now getting money to go elsewhere.\n\nWhat is the money producing? Again, the answer is unclear. The Goldwater Institute bragged in 2022 that Arizona's ESA bill \"does not have any testing requirements.\" (Iowa legislators, in contrast, did include some .)\n\nCritics fear state money will go to low-quality private schools that don't actually educate children well - and that, without transparent testing requirements, we'll never find that out for sure. \"These policies being passed now are almost being evidence-proofed,\" said Polikoff. \"You won't be able to say, 'This isn't working, we need to do something different,' because there won't be the data. The data will just be, 'Look at all these people who've enrolled their kids.'\"\n\nPublic school enrollment will likely decline somewhat now that funds are available to go elsewhere, with the question being exactly how much. In the short term, an overwhelming exodus from public to private schools likely won't materialize simply because the existing private school infrastructure can only support so much. (Tuition will surely increase, as is already happening in Iowa .)\n\nBut already, Arizona's superintendent Tom Horne has said he would push to close some public schools if enrollment dropped, which is just what rural school voucher skeptics long feared.\n\nAs time passes, there could be greater change. For-profit K-12 schools will likely expand, eager to get their hands on newly available state funding (Arizona's program is now estimated to cost $900 million). \"In some places where similar things have been tried for low-income kids, there were not enough private schools, so new low-quality private schools opened,\" said Cohen of FutureEd.\n\nMany controversies surely lie ahead as well. Private schools have wide latitude to discriminate in admissions (though it's illegal to do so based on race) - can it truly be called \"universal school choice\" if children can't get into the school they want?\n\nThe politicized curriculum controversies that have dogged public schools could also soon hit private schools, with more scrutiny from the left about what certain private schools are teaching. And there will be questions about the appropriateness of some spending (one article names \"chicken coops, trampolines and tickets to SeaWorld\" as among homeschooling parents' claimed education-related expenses).\n\nThere's also the budget question. In many of these states, universal ESAs were passed at a time when state budgets were flush with Covid aid. States could create what was essentially a new benefit for families who weren't previously utilizing government money to educate their children, while often increasing funding and teacher pay at public schools, in \"have your cake and eat it too\" fashion.\n\nBut the Covid aid is ending, which will eventually present a math problem for states if revenues slow down. Either taxes will have to go up, or something - ESAs, public schools, or other state spending - will have to be cut. \"The federal money drying up is going to be a big deal, and the whole tenor of the conversation is going to change,\" said Andrew Rotherham of Bellwether Education Partners.\n\nDemocratic opposition to ESAs remains high, but in states where they've been implemented, Republicans have staunchly defended them (Katie Hobbs, Arizona's new Democratic governor, couldn't get her effort to roll back ESAs past the GOP-controlled legislature). The wind could change in purple states, but in red states, the GOP is highly likely to hold onto legislative majorities, so ESAs are likely here to stay.\n\n\"I'd like to see the legislature roll it back and reconsider the soundness of this policy, for sure,\" said John, the former Arizona legislator. \"But while Republicans have a majority, don't count on that. No one's gonna break ranks on this where a lot of people have an interest in it and there's so much money behind it.\"\n\nRobert Enlow, president and CEO of the group EdChoice and a supporter of the new laws, put it a different way: \"Once you give choice to families, it's going to be very hard to take it away.\"\n\nEven in states that have passed \"universal school choice,\" advocates may keep pushing for more. Milton Friedman, in his original voucher article from 1955, mused about getting government out of the business of administering public schools altogether.\n\nOnce the market of educational options was up and running, Friedman wrote, the role of the government could be something more like a restaurant inspector ensuring \"certain minimum standards\" are met. We're a long way from that happening. But perhaps not as far off from it as we once were.\n\nFor now, DeAngelis still has more battles to fight. His home state, Texas - Republican-controlled, and home to 5.4 million students - is currently embroiled in controversy over Gov. Greg Abbott's ESA proposal. There's a similar story of rural reluctance among legislators, and Abbott has said he will call for a special session to try to force action. Advocates may well fail - but if there's one thing the past few decades have proved, it's that they'll keep at it until they succeed.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nA recent essay in a prominent right-wing outlet gives an unusually clear window into the modern right's anti-democratic worldview.\n\nby Zack Beauchamp\n\nThe right-wing rebellion against American democracy is often subtle, expressing itself through tricky changes to election law without a full-throated acknowledgment of what lawmakers are actually doing. But sometimes, the mask slips - and someone in the conservative movement openly tells you what's really going on.\n\nOne such slippage took place last week when the American Mind - a publication of the Claremont Institute, an influential conservative think tank based in California - published an incendiary essay arguing that the country has already been destroyed by internal enemies.\n\n\"Most people living in the United States today - certainly more than half - are not Americans in any meaningful sense of the term,\" Glenn Ellmers , the essay's author, writes. \"They do not believe in, live by, or even like the principles, traditions, and ideals that until recently defined America as a nation and as a people. It is not obvious what we should call these citizen-aliens, these non-American Americans; but they are something else.\"\n\nThese seditious citizens are opposed, according to Ellmers, by \"the 75 million people who voted in the last election against the senile figurehead of a party that stands for mob violence, ruthless censorship, and racial grievances, not to mention bureaucratic despotism.\"\n\nIf Trump voters and conservatives do not band together and fight \"a sort of counter-revolution,\" then \"the victory of progressive tyranny will be assured. See you in the gulag.\"\n\nWhat exactly this counter-revolution entails is unclear, but Ellmers has some tips. \"Learn some useful skills, stay healthy, and get strong,\" he writes. \"One of my favorite weightlifting coaches likes to say, 'Strong people are harder to kill, and more useful generally.'\"\n\nVox's German Lopez is here to guide you through the Biden administration's burst of policymaking. Sign up to receive our newsletter each Friday .\n\nEllmers's essay has been widely discussed in American media and intellectual circles , due to its bracing honesty about the modern right's worldview and the prominence of the outlet that published it. Claremont is an influential institution of the right; one of its publications, the Claremont Review of Books, published the notorious \" Flight 93 \" essay arguing that the 2016 election was a choice between Trump and national extinction. (\"2016 is the Flight 93 election: charge the cockpit or you die,\" that essay declared in its opening line.)\n\nIn the post-Trump era, the type of hard-right politics preached in Claremont publications \"is simply conservatism writ large,\" as Jane Coaston writes in a Vox essay on the California right. They've become the intellectual organ of Trumpist conservatism - an organization whose mission looks more and more like manufacturing an intellectual justification for the GOP's right-wing populist.\n\nThe rhetoric of national emergency and decline that you hear in Claremont publications permeates mainstream GOP rhetoric. Minutes before the January 6 assault on Capitol Hill , former President Donald Trump told his assembled supporters that \"if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.\" In a 2019 speech , Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) warned that \"we have come again to one of the great turning points in our national history, when the fate of our republican government is at issue.\" In a 2020 Facebook post , House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy declared that \"Democrats want to defund, destroy, and dismantle our country.\"\n\nAs absurd as it may seem, Ellmers's essay should be taken seriously because it makes the anti-democratic subtext of this kind of conservative discourse into clearly legible text. And it is a clear articulation of what the movement has been telling us through its actions, like Georgia's new voting law : It sees democracy not as a principle to respect, but as a barrier to be overcome in pursuit of permanent power.\n\nInasmuch as there is a central argument in Ellmers's piece, it is this: The label \"conservative\" no longer accurately captures what the American right should be about. This is because \"conservatism\" implies preserving or protecting something already in place, when in fact America is so hopelessly corrupted that there's little worth saving.\n\n\"The US Constitution no longer works,\" Ellmers writes. \"What is actually required now is a recovery, or even a refounding, of America as it was long and originally understood but which now exists only in the hearts and minds of a minority of citizens.\"\n\nMany traditional conservatives, in his mind, are blind to this fact. Trump's victory represented the true people rising up against an establishment that was unwilling to openly state how precarious the country's situation is:\n\nThe great majority of establishment conservatives who were alarmed and repelled by Trump's rough manner and disregard for \"norms\" are almost totally clueless about a basic fact: Our norms are now hopelessly corrupt and need to be destroyed . It has been like this for a while-and the MAGA voters knew it, while most of the policy wonks and magazine scribblers did not... and still don't. In almost every case, the political practices, institutions, and even rhetoric governing the United States have become hostile to both liberty and virtue. On top of that, the mainline churches, universities, popular culture, and the corporate world are rotten to the core. What exactly are we trying to conserve?\n\nTrump's main failing, on Ellmers's telling, is not that he was destructive - but that he was too ignorant and poorly advised to attack the right targets.\n\n\"As if coming upon a man convulsing from an obvious poison, Trump at least attempted in his own inelegant way to expel the toxin,\" Ellmers writes. \"By contrast, the conservative establishment, or much of it, has been unwilling to recognize that our body politic is dying from these noxious 'norms.'\"\n\nEllmers is not all that interested in the mechanisms of how and why the country has become so broken. He doesn't really explain in any detail the nature of the nefarious forces that have polluted most American minds; he rails against \"the progressive, or woke, or 'antiracist' agenda that now corrupts our republic\" and takes it as a given that his audience will agree that this threat is apocalyptic.\n\nHe is more interested, instead, in rallying the forces of Real America against enemies he describes in strikingly dehumanizing terms.\n\n\"If you are a zombie or a human rodent who wants a shadow-life of timid conformity, then put away this essay and go memorize the poetry of Amanda Gorman,\" Ellmers writes. \"Real men and women who love honor and beauty, keep reading.\"\n\nEllmers is hardly the only person on the right to see the opposition in a starkly negative light. A February poll found that a solid majority of Republicans, 57 percent, preferred to describe Democrats as \"enemies\" rather than as the \"political opposition.\" One of the central attitudes underpinning democracy - that sometimes the other side wins, and that's okay - is buckling on the right.\n\nThe implications of Ellmers's worldview are chilling. In a January 2020 essay , he predicted - more in sorrow than in anger, of course - that a civil war is coming.\n\n\"Not for the first time in our nation's history, if this state of affairs continues force may be embraced as the only alternative when reason fails,\" Ellmers writes. \"We must fervently hope that things will change before they become violent. But if the clueless attitudes of our sclerotic elite remain unaltered, it is not hard to see what's on the horizon.\"\n\nIf the extremism of Ellmers's essay strikes you as similar to what you've heard from authoritarian political movements of the past, you're not alone.\n\nJohn Ganz, a perceptive critic of American conservatism, recently wrote that Ellmers's essay should properly be termed \"fascist.\" Excommunicating a large percentage of the population from the body politic, describing once-idyllic society hopelessly corrupted by the forces of change, describing one's enemies as animals or diseases, invoking the threat of physical force in a political context - these are all historically hallmarks of fascist rhetoric.\n\nThis analysis holds despite the fact that Ellmers speaks in a democratic idiom, portraying himself as a defender of the American democratic tradition against its enemies. Ganz notes that calls to restore \"freedom,\" \"liberty,\" and even \"democracy\" were used by fascist intellectuals and movements in interwar Germany, France, and Italy because they were culturally powerful - a way of recruiting the people to one's way of thinking by speaking their language.\n\n\"In the US context it also makes sense that the reactionary mind would inevitably mythologize a 'truer' version of our republican and democratic traditions as the author does in this piece, because those are the basic symbols of our political tradition,\" he writes. \"In the French context, many fascist and para-fascist groups declared fealty to the 'republican' tradition, which is as nearly predominant in that country as it is in our own.\"\n\nOne does not need to go to Europe to see political oppression defended in democratic terms. In 1963, Alabama Gov. George Wallace delivered an inaugural address in Montgomery , casting the South's long tradition of oppression of African Americans as integral to southern freedom:\n\nToday I have stood, where once Jefferson Davis stood, and took an oath to my people. It is very appropriate then that from this Cradle of the Confederacy, this very Heart of the Great Anglo-Saxon Southland, that today we sound the drum for freedom as have our generations of forebears before us done, time and time again through history. Let us rise to the call of freedom- loving blood that is in us and send our answer to the tyranny that clanks its chains upon the South. In the name of the greatest people that have ever trod this earth, I draw the line in the dust and toss the gauntlet before the feet of tyranny . . . and I say . . . segregation today . . . segregation tomorrow . . . segregation forever.\n\nEllmers's essay is in line with this tradition, identifying freedom as a right that only a certain section of the population deserves. Those outside of it, either because they come from the wrong background or think the wrong way, have no just claim on our political system. When they wield power, it is by definition oppression.\n\nIn some ways, this is the central animating idea of the broader conservative movement in America. Ellmers is a radical who sees himself as opposed to \"establishment\" conservatism, but in reality, many on the broader right share a more attenuated version of his worldview - and pursue the disempowerment of their political opponents.\n\nBarack Obama's 2008 victory, and the attendant talk of a coalition of minorities and young voters creating a \"permanent Democratic majority,\" helped spread anxieties about declining electoral power on the political right . After the 2010 midterm elections, which swept Republicans into power in statehouses across the country, they acted - drawing gerrymandered maps and passing laws, like voter ID, seemingly designed to suppress Democratic-leaning constituencies.\n\nThe state-level Republican lawmakers were often quite honest about their aim of locking Democrats out of office.\n\n\"I think electing Republicans is better than electing Democrats,\" former North Carolina Rep. David Lewis, who chaired the state's recent redistricting committee, once said . \"So I drew this map in a way to help foster what I think is better for the country.\"\n\nThe January 6 attack on the Capitol was a pure expression of Ellmers-ism, a violent lashing out against a system that conservatives believe to be fraudulent and corrupt. The new round of voter suppression bills represents the more subtle 2010 variant of Republican anti-democratic attitudes: that the system can be rigged such that the Democratic threat is locked out of power for good.\n\nThere are at least eight proposals from Republican lawmakers in state legislatures around the country to seize partisan control over electoral administration. One of the most egregious examples , in Georgia, was passed into law last week. More broadly, there are over 250 state bills under consideration that would curtail voting rights in one way or another.\n\nThat these proposals are justified in the language of \"restoring confidence\" in elections and \"preventing fraud\" does not make them actually defensible in democratic terms - anymore than Ellmers's thinly-veiled pining for a civil war is \"democratic\" because he wants to wage it in defense of a warped conception of liberty.\n\nIn a sense, Ellmers is right that America's political system no longer works. He's just wrong about who broke it - and why.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nA historic defeat brings in new UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer as the Tories pick up the pieces\n\nby Joshua Keating\n\nFourteen years of Conservative rule in the United Kingdom ended with a bang, not a whimper, on Thursday as the party suffered a landslide defeat at the polls, winning just 121 seats while the opposition Labour Party took 412.\n\nThe last of the five prime ministers of this period, Rishi Sunak, who moved into 10 Downing Street less than two years ago, will step down, saying in a post-election speech , \"\"To the country I would like to say first and foremost, I am sorry.\" Labour's Keir Starmer will now take over as prime minister with a significant mandate\n\n\"'The work of change begins immediately,\" Starmer said in his first speech as prime minister, acknowledging this would not be as as simple as \"flicking a switch\"\n\nSunak also stepped down as leader of the Conservative party and the Tories are likely in for a brutal internal battle over their future, with some right wingers calling for a merger with Trumpian gadfly Nigel Farage's right-wing Reform UK party, which won four seats but came in third in terms of vote share with 14 percent of the national vote.\n\nThe Conservatives ended up suffering a historic loss the way Hemingway described going bankrupt: Gradually, and then suddenly. The Tories had been underwater in the polls since late 2021 , but Sunak only called this election in late May , likely sensing his party's prospects were not likely to improve any time soon. It was a swift, though not exactly painless, end to a political era that radically changed a country and its place in the world. The consensus view is that it has not changed for the better.\n\nA just-released book , The Conservative Effect, 2010-2024: 14 Wasted Years? , co-edited by Anthony Seldon, a veteran chronicler and biographer of contemporary British prime ministers, attempts to take stock of the legacy of this period. Seldon is unsparing in his concluding essay, writing, \"By 2024, Britain's standing in the world was lower [compared to 2010], the union was less strong, the country less equal, the population less well protected, growth more sluggish with the outlook poor.\" He concludes: \"Overall, it is hard to find a comparable period in history of the Conservatives which achieved so little, or which left the country at its conclusion in a more troubling state.\"\n\nSo how, exactly, did we get here?\n\nThis 14 year period of Conservative rule was really two different periods : pre- and post-Brexit.\n\nThe first period began in 2010, when Prime Minister David Cameron, leading a coalition government consisting of the Conservatives and the centrist Liberal Democrats, moved into 10 Downing Street, ending 13 years of Labour rule under Tony Blair and his dour successor Gordon Brown. Relatively youthful at 44, Cameron, a self-described \"liberal conservative,\" distinguished himself from previous generations of conservatives with stances like his support for gay marriage and calls for action on climate change .\n\nBut his economic policies were anything but moderate. Cameron's government came into office in the wake of the global financial crisis facing a budget deficit of some $225 billion. In response, the government carried out a program of fiscal consolidation and budget cuts that the UK budget office has described as \"one of the biggest deficit reduction programs seen in any advanced economy since World War II.\" Public spending fell from around 41 percent of GDP to 35 percent, with deep cuts to social programs, infrastructure and international diplomacy.\n\nHeading into the 2015 election, Cameron was also coming under pressure from the insurgent UK Independence Party, led by Farage, and from his own party's right-flank, to hold a referendum on whether the UK should remain a member of the European Union. Though Cameron personally opposed withdrawing from the EU, in part to respond to dissidents from his right he vowed that if he won, he would attempt to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the EU and then hold an \"in/out referendum\" on whether Britain should stay.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nAs a short-term political move, it worked out great. The Conservatives won an overall majority in 2015, ending the coalition era. But Cameron was less successful in convincing Brussels to give Britain \"special status\" within the EU. Cameron won only minor concessions on sovereignty and immigration. There has always been an undercurrent of Euro-skepticism in British politics, but it grew stronger in the 2000s and 2010s. The financial crisis of 2008 and the eurozone debt crisis that followed undermined the appeal of the EU as an economic union. The unprecedented number of migrants who attempted to reach Europe in 2015 reduced support for the EU's open border policies.\n\nIn retrospect, it was a perfect storm for Brexit, but it was still stunning when the country voted 52 to 48 percent in 2016 to leave the EU. Cameron, who had campaigned for the \"Remain\" side, resigned as prime minister. He was replaced by Theresa May, previously the home secretary and a fellow Remainer, who had the unenviable task of negotiating Britain's withdrawal from the EU while simultaneously presiding over a civil war within her own party over how exactly Brexit should be implemented.\n\nModerates wanted a \"soft Brexit\" that would preserve Britain's access to Europe's common market. Hardliners wanted a \"hard Brexit\" that would prioritize ditching EU regulations and controlling immigration. European negotiators in Brussels were not going to let the Brits have both. Further complicating the process was an issue that few anticipated before the referendum: the economic and political status of Northern Ireland - the only part of the UK with a land border with the EU. Finding a way to avoid a hard border across the island of Ireland - a key pillar of the Northern Irish peace process - while also removing the UK as a whole from the EU turned out to be excruciatingly difficult.\n\nMay stepped down in 2019, and after an internal party leadership election, was replaced by former London mayor and omnipresent media figure Boris Johnson. Johnson is not exactly known for holding consistent views.\n\nIn a 2014 interview for Slate , two years before the Brexit vote, he told me that when it came to the EU, \"We may want to change our relationship a bit, but fundamentally we will remain within the European common market.\" Just a few years later, he would be one of the most visible and enthusiastic campaigners for \"Leave.\"\n\nA few months after taking office, Johnson called a national election, campaigning on a pledge to \"get Brexit done\" - and won a landslide victory. It didn't hurt that Labour at the time was led by the veteran left-winger Jeremy Corbyn, who had both failed to take a strong stance on Brexit and was beset by accusations of anti-semitism .\n\nArmed with his new large majority, Johnson did something unusual for him: He did what he said he would do, and indeed got Brexit done. Britain formally left the EU on January 31, 2020. Just two years later, however, Johnson left as well, forced to resign over a scandal over allegations that he misled parliament over parties held in his office during Covid-19 lockdowns.\n\nThat was followed by the 50-day reign of Prime Minister Liz Truss, which was the shortest in British history - so short, in fact, that she was famously outlasted by a head of lettuce . Truss is mainly remembered for a proposed set of tax cuts so extreme it triggered weeks of panic in global bond markets and the kind of upbraiding from the IMF normally reserved for failed states.\n\nTruss was then replaced by Sunak, who made history as the first prime minister of Asian descent, as well as the youngest one since William Pitt (the Younger, of course) in 1783. Under Sunak, the lingering effects of the pandemic and the shock to energy markets caused by the war in Ukraine have contributed to a cost-of-living crisis that has disproportionately impacted the poorest Britons . Sunak has tried to make the case that the UK economy is turning the corner - and indeed inflation is now starting to ease - but it's almost certainly too little too late.\n\nTo some extent, Sunak's biggest crime was simply to be in office during a widespread anti-incumbent trend throughout the Western democratic world. He was deeply unpopular, but not significantly more so than G7 counterparts like France's Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Olaf Scholz.\n\nDefenders of the Conservatives' time in office will point to the external shocks the party had to contend with, including the legacy of the 2008 financial crisis, the Covid pandemic, and the economic impact of the war in Ukraine. But every major economy had to deal with those shocks. Only one country - and one party - chose Brexit.\n\nDisentangling the effects of the withdrawal from other post-2020 shocks isn't easy, but a recent study from Britain's National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR), an independent think tank, estimated that the UK's real GDP is about 2 to 3 percent lower today, compared to a scenario where it stayed in the union. Real income is about 8 to 9 percent lower.\n\nAccording to the government's own figures , Britain's GDP today is only about 1.7 percent higher than it was pre-pandemic, compared to 3.7 percent for the Eurozone and 8.7 percent for the United States.\n\nIronically, Brexit didn't even accomplish the goal that motivated many of its supporters to vote for it: Net migration to the UK has actually increased since the withdrawal. Much of the debate around immigration policy has focused on the government's bizarre and inhumane plan to fly asylum seekers to Rwanda to have their claims processed, as a means of deterring them from trying. But asylum seekers are only about 11 percent of the UK's immigrants , and half of those are Ukrainians who entered under a specially tailored system and significantly more public support.\n\nThe real driver of migration is economic - including the economic needs of Britain itself. As migration researcher Hein de Haas has written , while \"Brexit successfully curtailed free inflows of EU workers, it did not eliminate labor shortages that had been driving increasing migration to the UK ever since the 1990s.\" Some jobs staffing Britain's stores and its much-beloved National Health Service have been filled by non-EU migrants instead of European ones; some European migrants who previously traveled back and forth between the UK and the continent have stayed put.\n\nBrexit's advocates had argued that the benefits of trade with Europe could be offset by a free trade agreement that a new \"global Britain,\" unshackled from the EU, could pursue. But other than new deals with Australia and New Zealand, progress has been slow on that front . Johnson and Truss both promised a new free trade deal with the United States as a benefit of Brexit, but badly misjudged the changing mood in Washington , where both the Republicans and Democrats have taken a turn toward protectionism. (Credit where it's due: Johnson did get the US to lift a ban on the imports of British lamb.)\n\nMore than 60 percent of British voters, including more than a third of \"Leave\" voters, now say Brexit has been more of a failure than a success . But the damage is done.\n\nThe reality is that far from broadening Britain's horizons, Brexit has forced it to confront what it really is: a mid-sized country with a mid-sized economy that has a mid-sized influence on the world.\n\nAsked what role foreign policy and national security have played in this election, Nick Witney, a former British diplomat and defense official now with the European Council on Foreign Relations, told Vox, \"Not much, because we don't have much of a foreign or defense policy at the moment. And there's going to be no money available to buy ourselves one for a number of years under new government.\"\n\nIndeed, for all Johnson's talk of a \"global Britain\" recovering its \"buccaneering\" spirit, the UK cuts a more modest profile on the world stage today than it did when Conservatives took over. London has cut funding to the foreign office , foreign aid , and one of the country's most significant soft power assets: the BBC . Defense spending has increased since Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine but the size of the military in terms of manpower has shrunk. A last-ditch campaign proposal by Sunak to mandate national service for 18-year-olds did not go over well.\n\n\"No one talks about 'global Britain' anymore,\" said Witney. \"It's extraordinary how our horizons have shrunk. If you go back 20 years, there was practically not a sparrow that fell anywhere around the globe where the British didn't feel they would have something to say about it. Nowadays, we are an impoverished and ultimately less ambitious country.\"\n\nOne very notable exception has been the war in Ukraine, where the UK has been a significant provider of military aid, training, and economic support - often taking a more aggressive stance than the US on providing new weapons systems and capabilities to the Ukrainians. Johnson may be persona non grata in British politics right now, but there are streets named after him in Ukraine .\n\nProbably due in part to the fact that the result wasn't in doubt, the election itself was heavily dominated by gaffes and scandals, including Sunak's ill-advised decision to leave D-Day commemorations in France early and the revelations that candidates in both parties have been betting on the election.\n\nIt's also true that compared to figures like Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair, or even David Cameron - all of whom came into power in landscape-shifting change elections - Starmer isn't exactly promising radical change. Starmer has managed to stabilize his party after the politically disastrous Corbyn years, and - perhaps not surprisingly given that he entered the race with a huge lead - he ran on a relatively modest policy platform . It's too modest for some allies, who accuse of him of \" limping into No. 10 ,\" while the party also angered progressives by barring several left-wing candidates, including two women of color, in the run-up to the election.\n\nIt would be a stretch to say voters seemed inspired by Labour's message. The party won a lower share of the national vote than they did in 2017, when Theresa May defeated Jeremy Corbyn, but benefited from the UK's \"first-past-the-post\" election system and Tory defections to other parties. The Conservatives lost this election more than Labour won it.\n\nThough the party opposed Brexit during the referendum, Labour does not plan to try to rejoin the European Union . Ahmet Kaya, an economist with the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, told Vox that wouldn't really be practical in the near term anyway, and that the focus should be on negotiations with Europe aimed at \"reducing the barriers on trade and facilitating some of the free movement of people,\" particularly students. Steps like these, he said, could \"reduce the overall negative impact of Brexit.\"\n\nThere won't be a huge shift on foreign policy either. Unlike in the US, support for Ukraine is pretty bipartisan in the UK. In the wake of the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter on British soil in 2018 as well a flurry of coverage of how Russian oligarchs have manipulated the British financial system , there's little pro-Russian sympathy in the UK, though Farage recently caused a media uproar with remarks suggesting NATO was partly to blame for the invasion of Ukraine. Starmer has also taken some criticism from Muslim Labour supporters over being slow to call for a ceasefire in Gaza. This hasn't mattered much for his election chances, but his choices on this and other contentious issues are going to get a lot tougher when he's actually in power.\n\nAbove all else, Starmer will face the challenge of overcoming the perceptions built up during the past decade. \"Brexit has kind of defined how the UK is perceived internationally by many of our partners,\" Evie Aspinall, director of the British Foreign Policy Group, told Vox. \"We're seen as a more isolated nation than we were prior to Brexit.\"\n\nThere are some parallels here with the Biden administration, which came into office promising allies that \" America is back \" following the isolation of the Trump years. As with the Democrats in 2020, Labour has gone with a broadly popular - if somewhat dull - candidate, whose promise is that he can turn down the political temperature after a period of chaos and upheaval.

      "text": "Why are liberals more afraid of the coronavirus than conservatives?\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nCovid-19 and the complex politics of fear.\n\nby Ezra Klein\n\nIn recent years, there's been an explosion of academic work on the psychological foundations of our politics. The basic theory goes like this: Some people are innately more suspicious of change, of outsiders, of novelty. That base orientation will nudge them toward living in the town where they grew up, eating the foods they know and love, worshipping in the church their parents attended. It will also nudge them toward political conservatism.\n\nThe reverse is true, too. Some people are naturally more oriented toward newness, toward diversity, toward disruption. That base orientation will push them to live in big cities, try exotic foods, travel widely, appreciate weird art, sample different spiritualities. It will also nudge them toward political liberalism.\n\nIn Predisposed: Liberals, Conservatives, and the Biology of Political Differences, John Alford, John Hibbing, and Kevin Smith summarize the evidence:\n\nNumerous studies have linked these personality dimensions to differences in the mix of tastes and preferences that seem to reliably separate liberals and conservatives. People who score high on openness, for example, tend to like envelope-pushing music and abstract art. People who score high on conscientiousness are more likely to be organized, faithful, and loyal. One review of this large research literature finds these sorts of differences consistently cropping up across nearly 70 years of studies on personality research. The punch line, of course, is that this same literature also reports a consistent relationship between these dimensions of personality and political temperament. Those open to new experiences are not just hanging Jackson Pollock prints in disorganized bedrooms while listening to techno-pop reinterpretations of Bach by experimental jazz bands. They are also more likely to identify themselves as liberals.\n\nResearchers have sliced, measured, and analyzed these psychologies through dozens of schemas. NYU's Jon Haidt is known for moral foundations theory , which emphasizes the value structures underpinning our political beliefs. Political scientists Marc Hetherington and Jonathan Weiler study \"fixed\" and \"fluid\" personalities. Michele Gelfand tracks \"tight\" and \"loose\" societies. Some scales measure \" openness .\" Others measure \" authoritarianism .\"\n\nBut all of them converge on the same psychosocial cleavage. Put simply, conservatives are psychologically tuned to see threat, and so they fear change. Liberals are tuned to prize change, and so they downplay threat.\n\n\"Liberalism and conservatism are rooted in stable individual differences in the ways people perceive, interpret, and cope with threat and uncertainty,\" write Christopher Johnston, Howard Lavine, and Christopher Federico in Open versus Closed.\n\n\"Of the many factors that make up your worldview, one is more fundamental than any other in determining which side of the divide you gravitate toward: your perception of how dangerous the world is,\" write Hetherington and Weiler in Prius or Pickup.\n\n\"Conservatives react more strongly than liberals to signs of danger, including the threat of germs and contamination, and even low-level threats such as sudden blasts of white noise,\" writes Haidt in The Righteous Mind .\n\nIf that's true, though, why is it conservatives who are downplaying the coronavirus, and liberals who are sheltering in fear of it?\n\nA virus isn't just any threat, some researchers say. It is the threat at the root of these psychological cleavages.\n\nInfectious disease has, historically, been humanity's most lethal foe. Our immune systems have evolved to protect us, but so, too, have our cultures, societies, and psychologies. As Haidt writes, \"It's a lot more effective to prevent infection by washing your food, casting out lepers, or simply avoiding dirty people than it is to let the microbes into your body and then hope that your biological immune system can kill every last one of them.\"\n\nTo some researchers, much of human civilization is a lightly disguised effort at pathogen avoidance: The purity laws of the Old Testament are, from this perspective, a spiritually branded public health campaign. Spicy foods are more common in pathogen-rich areas because they kill bacteria.\n\nHow a society treats strangers is of particular importance. Strangers carry novel pathogens, diseases to which you and your community have amassed no immunity. A mix of psychologies helps strike the right balance between being overrun by outsiders spreading infection and reaping the benefits of trade and cooperation.\n\nDozens of studies have confirmed the relationship between the rate of disease and political attitudes. For example, in a 2008 paper titled \"Pathogens, Personality, and Culture,\" Mark Schaller and Damian Murray showed that worldwide, people were less open, less extroverted, and more sexually conservative in regions rich with disease. In another study , Randy Thornhill, Cory Fincher, and Devaraj Aran found that a \"high prevalence of infectious disease\" regionally predicted more conservative political values. Gelfand has looked at US states and found the \"tightest\" political cultures are in the states \"with the most disasters and pathogen prevalence.\"\n\nBut here we are, in the midst of a pandemic, and it's conservatives seemingly dismissing the danger, opening states and counties prematurely, refusing to wear masks, waving off the deaths of older people as a small price to pay. \"One day, it's like a miracle, it will disappear,\" said President Trump.\n\nAnd, more often, it seems to be liberals who're locked in their homes, who are warning the worst is yet to come , who are shaming anyone who dares step foot on a beach or forgets to don personal protective equipment. A recent Pew poll showed 61 percent of conservatives fear that state restrictions won't be lifted quickly enough, while 91 percent of liberals worry they'll be lifted too quickly.\n\nThis is the opposite of what a straightforward read of decades of political psychology research would predict. Early in the pandemic, it was plausible to argue that the divide reflected the virus hitting blue cities first, and sparing red counties its punishments. But Covid-19 has made its way into Trump country, and at any rate, studies show that political beliefs are a more powerful driver of views on the virus than personal experience.\n\nSo I asked political psychology researchers: Why are liberals more afraid of the coronavirus than conservatives? And what does that say about political psychology more broadly?\n\nIn conversations with more than half a dozen political psychologists, three theories dominated.\n\nOne is that we aren't seeing anything unexpected at all. John Jost, at New York University, suggested that my reading of the reaction was mistaking its psychological foundations. Liberals were acting out of care, not fear. And conservatives are panicked, he suggested, but showing it in odd ways.\n\n\"The fact that liberals are taking the scientific evidence and medical recommendations seriously does not, in itself, mean that they are more threat sensitive than conservatives,\" he wrote over email. \"All of the liberals I know have been self-sequestering to 'flatten the curve' - to save other people's lives.\"\n\nAs for the right, \"some conservatives are denying and repressing fear, but that doesn't mean they are cool cucumbers. Fears of economic devastation (and the anger by conservative activists in Michigan and elsewhere) may even reflect displacement of the fear. For all we know, Americans who are explicitly denying the problem are experiencing (even) more stress and anxiety than those who are not.\"\n\nA second camp argued that the tension is real, but it was being swamped by partisanship. Perhaps, in laboratory conditions, conservatives would be more afraid of the virus. But politics doesn't play out in laboratory conditions. Trump is the leader of the Republican Party, and his decision to downplay the threat, his dismissal of masks, and his clear desire to reopen is the stronger signal.\n\n\"Yes, I would expect conservatives to be more worried about virus X coming in from abroad,\" said Haidt. \"When Obama was president and America was threatened by Ebola, it was conservatives freaking out, demanding a more vigorous government response to protect us, while Obama kept steady on following scientific advice.\"\n\nTrump, it's worth noting, was at the forefront of the Ebola panic. \"Ebola is much easier to transmit than the CDC and government representatives are admitting,\" he tweeted in October 2014. \"Spreading all over Africa - and fast. Stop flights.\"\n\nHere, though, it's been the opposite. \"Trump laid out his view of reality very early: This is nothing to worry about, it's a plot to discredit me, and it will magically go away,\" Haidt continued. Trump's leadership \"overwhelms the small average difference in disgust sensitivity which would, ceteris paribus, have Republicans more concerned about contagion.\"\n\nFederico made a similar point. \"Chronic sensitivity to threat, disgust, and disease is one factor that should influence concern about Covid-19, [but] it is not the only one. Partisanship itself is perhaps the most important factor in shaping how people respond to issues or public concerns.\"\n\nGelfand said much the same. \"Even though groups tighten up under threat, that signal can be weakened. Groups follow their leaders.\"\n\nThis would confirm what we've seen throughout the Trump presidency. A 2018 paper by Michael Barber and Jeremy Pope showed that the more conservative someone believed themselves to be, the more likely they were to follow Trump when he took an unexpectedly liberal position on an issue. Trump's connection with his base has often, well, trumped his heterodoxies.\n\nA third argument, which acts in some ways as a bridge for the first two, is that everyone was scared, but for conservatives, fear was coming out more through acts of xenophobia than epidemiology - in part because that's where fear of the virus and Trump's natural politics find harmony.\n\n\"I can't resist noting that current events are perfectly consistent with my claim that those on the right, and especially the Trumpian right, are not generically more threatened but rather only more attentive to those threats they believe to be emanating from human outsiders (defined broadly to include welfare cheats, unpatriotic athletes, norm violators, non-English speakers, religious and racial minorities, and certainly people from other countries),\" wrote Hibbing. \"Thus, disembodied threats such as climate change, Covid-19, and economic inequality are not primary sources of concern for them.\"\n\nThat would explain why Trump oscillates between downplaying the threat of the coronavirus and escalating tensions with China over its response to it. When Trump wants to bludgeon the Chinese, he plays up the threat of the virus; when it comes to domestic governance, he plays it down. More than 70 percent of Republicans now hold an \"unfavorable\" view of China, a doubling of anti-Chinese sentiment since George W. Bush's presidency.\n\n\"In some ways, this pandemic was tailor-built for right-wing xenophobia, and we are fortunate (thus far, at least) that Trump's response was to downplay it solely to keep the stock market from tanking completely,\" said Jost.\n\nAnd that \"thus far\" is ending quickly. \"The National Republican Senatorial Committee has sent campaigns a detailed, 57-page memo authored by a top Republican strategist advising GOP candidates to address the coronavirus crisis by aggressively attacking China,\" reported Politico , and Stephen Miller is using the coronavirus to push a broader anti-immigration agenda.\n\nHere's my view: Political psychology is like the soil in politics. There are differences in the liberal and conservative soil - particularly in how they view threat, change, tradition, outsiders, and diversity - so different kinds of politicians, tactics, and movements take root on the two sides.\n\nTrump is, at his core, a suspicious, threat-oriented, traditionalist figure - he's nostalgic for the way things were, hostile to outsiders, angry over demographic change (he's even, in normal times, a germaphobe ). There's a reason he took root in conservative soil.\n\nBy contrast, former President Barack Obama is optimistic, cosmopolitan, and temperamentally progressive - he looks at change and sees hope, he looks at other countries and sees allies, he sees diversity as a strength. There's a reason he took root in liberal soil.\n\nBut once a politician captures a party, other dynamics take over. For one thing, partisans trust their leaders and allied institutions. Very few of us have personally run experiments on the coronavirus, or gone around the world gathering surface temperature readings over the course of decades. We have to choose whom to believe, and once we do, we're inclined to take their word when describing contested or faraway events.\n\nFor another, we all fall prey to motivated reasoning, in which we shape evidence, arguments, and values to align with our incentives. As Upton Sinclair said, \"It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.\"\n\nMany Republican officeholders, led by Trump, think the coronavirus threatens their reelection because the lockdown threatens the economy. As such, they're motivated to believe that reopening the economy sooner is better, and attracted to evidence and arguments that support that position. Sometimes that means downplaying the coronavirus. Sometimes that means accepting its risk but suggesting the costs of reopening are worth it . In both cases, the argument is working backward from the desired conclusion.\n\nThe political tragedy for the Republican Party, and the actual tragedy for America, is that the politics and the substance here should have been aligned. If Trump had taken the disease seriously from the outset and mounted a competent and consistent response, his approval ratings would be higher today, and the country would be in a better position to reopen safely, and sooner. As it is, Trump has been denied the polling bounce other governors and world leaders have seen, and he's split his own coalition, forcing them to choose between their fear of the disease and their trust in him.\n\n\"The thing people often miss about moral foundations theory is that the foundations are just foundations,\" says Haidt. \"People don't live in the foundation of their house. A house must be built upon those foundations. Moral and political entrepreneurs build structures, over time, and invite people to live in them.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

      "text": "How Andrew Tate's release is splintering the American right\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe far-right influencer's return to America has sparked new divisions among some of Donald Trump's biggest supporters.\n\nby Christian Paz\n\nThere's an intra-MAGA fight playing out right now over Andrew Tate, a far-right influencer and self-described misogynist who arrived in Florida on Thursday morning.\n\nTate, along with his brother Tristan, had been awaiting trial in Romania on human trafficking charges, but they were allowed to return to the United States overnight. Some of his supporters in the online right celebrated: It was a triumph for the rule of law, the conservative commentator Candace Owens posted on X . But some conservatives have criticized his release and the alleged role of the Trump administration in securing his return.\n\nThose critics have tended to be pretty mainstream conservative thought leaders and commentators - folks like the podcaster Ben Shapiro, who complained that \" America does not need more self-proclaimed pimps and terror supporters with outstanding criminal allegations of sex trafficking and a history of pornographic distribution.\" The critics include members of Trump's own party, such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis .\n\nThese split reactions to Tate's arrival are revealing an underlying schism on the right: between the more conventional social conservative wing of the coalition, and the more provocative, manosphere-adjacent realm of tech bros and podcasters who seem ascendant in the second Trump term.\n\nTate became a far-right podcasting star in the 2020s with his explicitly sexist philosophy of masculinity . He quickly gained a wide following among both young men specifically, and several prominent MAGA figures , including Trump's own former personal attorney and current adviser Alina Habba , Elon Musk , and Donald Trump Jr .\n\nHe and his brother were arrested in 2022, when Tate was charged with rape and the brothers were accused of leading a human trafficking operation . (Both have denied the allegations.)\n\nBut reports had been circulating that people in Trump's orbit were taking on the task of trying to free them. The Financial Times reported that US special envoy Ric Grenell raised the Tates' case to Romania's foreign minister at the Munich Security Conference earlier this month.\n\nBut not everyone was pleased with the Tates' return.\n\nIn Congress, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley was among the critics. \"I would hope our government wasn't involved in any way,\" he told reporters . \"I don't think conservatives should be glorifying this guy at all.\"\n\nDeSantis also condemned them, and asked the state's attorney general to see what legal recourse they had to respond.\n\n\"Florida is not a place where you're welcome with that type of conduct,\" he said. \"I don't know how it came to this. We were not involved. We were not notified. Clearly the federal government has jurisdiction whether they want to rebuff his entry into the United States.\"\n\nThroughout the first month of Trump's presidency, Trump has been nearly universally praised by his coalition. The Republican base has remained loyal, even as his popularity among other segments of the American electorate have steadily declined. So this split among elites in the coalition stands out - and raises questions about just how durable these pro-Trump bonds will be.\n\n\"We should wait and see, but I can say that if Trump really did bless allowing the Tate brothers to come to the US, it would be the primary exhibit that his administration is guided by a hyper-online right that is very out of touch with the real world and needs to touch grass,\" the conservative radio host Erick Erickson posted on X .\n\nTrump, at least, for now, seems to be distancing himself. When asked if he had intervened, Trump was curt . \"I know nothing about that,\" he said. \"I didn't know anything about it.\"\n\nWe may still get more details about how or why Tate's restrictions were lifted, and the Romanian charges haven't been dropped. But as he reenters the American public square, this schism may continue to widen - especially as both sides vie for more influence over Trump's policy, over the Republican Party, and over the future of conservatism.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

      "text": "What does 'woke' mean and why are some conservatives using it?\n\nThe definition of \"woke\" changes depending on who you ask.\n\nThe definition of \"woke\" changes depending on who you ask.\n\nThe term has recently been used by some conservatives as an umbrella term for progressive values , often using it with negative connotations.\n\nHowever, the term was originally coined by progressive Black Americans and used in racial justice movements in the early to mid-1900s.\n\nTo be \"woke\" politically in the Black community means that someone is informed, educated and conscious of social injustice and racial inequality, Merriam-Webster Dictionary states.\n\nA historical recording of the protest song \"Scottsboro Boys\" by Lead Belly in the 1930s -- as captured by Smithsonian Folkways, the non-profit record label of the National Museum -- is often cited as one of the earliest uses of the term. The Scottsboro Boys were nine Black teenagers falsely accused of raping two white women aboard a Southern Railroad freight train in northern Alabama in 1931 in a case that lasted decades, according to the National Museum of African American History and Culture.\n\nIn the recording of the Lead Belly song several years after the incident, \"stay woke\" urged Black Americans to be aware of the potential for racist violence in the South.\n\nThe term, in one of its contemporary meanings, began to gain more popularity at the start of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2014, according to Merriam-Webster Dictionary . The Ferguson, Missouri, protests that year spotlighted the social injustices and police brutality faced by the Black community following the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown.\n\nBrown's death was shortly followed by the fatal police encounters of Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, and others -- which continued the growing popularity of the phrase and its use in protest and activist circles for many years to come, according to research from Ohio State University on the rhetoric of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nThe term has since been co-opted by some Republicans as a pejorative term since last year's midterm elections to signify the identity-based social justice issues that some Democrats and progressives push for, representatives from the Democratic Governors Association and Working Families Party tell ABC News.\n\n\"Woke\" has been used by several presidential GOP candidates including former President Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, and Vivek Ramaswamy who penned a book \"Woke Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam.\"\n\nWoke is defined by the DeSantis administration as \"the belief there are systemic injustices in American society and the need to address them,\" according to DeSantis' general counsel, as reported by The Washington Post.\n\n\"We reject woke ideology,\" DeSantis said in his election 2022 night speech. \"We will never ever surrender to the woke agenda. People have come here because of our policies.\"\n\nThe pressure against \"woke\"-ness in Florida has already led to restrictions of race-related content in education, including the rejection of an AP African American history course in state high schools and vows from college presidents against including some race-related content that covers \"intersectionality, or the idea that systems of oppression should be the primary lens through which teaching and learning are analyzed and/or improved upon.\"\n\nFor example, DeSantis has implemented policies in schools that restrict the topics of race, oppression, gender and sex in the classroom through the Parental Rights in Education Law and the \"Stop WOKE\" Act. His administration also banned spending on diversity, equity and inclusion programs (DEI) from public college campuses.\n\nAcross the country, hundreds of conservative-led legislative efforts have restricted programs, classes and trainings that touch on race, diversity and equity in recent months.\n\nIdentity has been at the heart of the so-called culture wars being seen across the country, as Democrats and Republicans go head-to-head on issues such as LGBTQ+ rights , racial education in schools , and more.\n\nSome argue that conservatives are depicting \"woke\"-ness, or being educated on social injustice, as a bad thing. Maurice Mitchell, the national director of the Working Families Party and the Social Movement Strategist with Movement 4 Black Lives, called the use of \"woke\" in that context a racial \"dog whistle.\"\n\n\"Because 'woke' is associated with Black people, it's been a useful club for those who want to beat those seeking justice over the head with white grievance politics to win elections without deploying explicitly racist terms,\" said Mitchell.\n\nDavid Turner, the communications director of the Democratic Governors Association, said Republicans' use of the term can make them appear as \"bullies.\"\n\n\"Republicans, time and again, have overstepped where they think the average voter is and where most Americans are on mainstream issues,\" Turner said. \"This also applies to their hyper-focus on niche cultural war issues.\"\n\nThe Republican National Committee, Republican Governor Association and DeSantis' office did not respond to ABC News' requests for comment.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Trump takes a victory lap with young conservatives\n\nTrump celebrates election results and looks ahead to delivering on promises.\n\nIn his first rally-style speech since winning the 2024 election, President-elect Donald Trump raved about his election victory for nearly 10 minutes before transitioning to confidence that he would deliver on his administration's promises, as well as touting his Cabinet selections.\n\nTrump spoke at AmericaFest, a political festival for conservatives put on by Turning Point, the conservative organization run by Charlie Kirk that was instrumental in helping Trump garner support among younger voters through its get out the vote initiatives in battleground states.\n\nTrump's speech was essentially many of the proposals he has already released on his Truth Social social media platform, including his threats on tariffs and taking back the Panama Canal, as well as bragging about the amount of people that have reached out to him since his victory.\n\nHe said his remarks were \"just a small preview of the common sense revolution.\"\n\n\"Because that's what I call it, a common sense revolution that's coming soon to America, to a theater near you, right? But it's coming to you through your president, Donald J. Trump,\" he said.\n\nThroughout his 75-minute remarks, Trump made no mention of the recently passed government funding bill, which did not include his last-minute demand to raise the debt ceiling or eliminate it. After vocally opposing the original bill, Trump has yet to make any comments on the legislation that passed early Saturday.\n\nHowever, speakers ahead of Trump had something to say on the issue. Trump's allies called for Speaker Mike Johnson to lose his speakership role over working with Democrats, called for the Republican lawmakers who voted against the package to be primaried, along with threats to Republican senators who were on the fence about confirming some of Trump's Cabinet picks.\n\n\"Johnson's not up to the task. He's got to go, right? He's got to go. Should Johnson be speaker of the House?\" Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser who served time in jail for contempt of Congress, asked the crowd, which responded with a resounding \"No.\"\n\n\"We don't need partisanship now. We need hyperpartisanship now. The conversation is over. We have nothing else to discuss. It's only about the execution of President Trump's plan,\" he added.\n\nHowever, when Trump took the stage, he spent most of his time touting his transition efforts.\n\n\"We have accomplished so much in just 47 days since the election. But that's only the beginning of what we will achieve together as the 47th president of the United States of America,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump said his second administration would \"turn the page\" on what he called four failed years under the Biden administration.\n\n\"I campaigned on an agenda of delivering profound change to Washington, and last month, the American people voted for change like they've never voted before, and in overwhelming numbers, numbers that nobody saw coming. I saw them coming because I think we all saw coming,\" Trump said.\n\nAs tech entrepreneur Elon Musk has become more vocal about the future of the country, including a series of tweets criticizing the government funding bill, many lawmakers and pundits have started quipping that Musk is actually running the country. Trump laughed about the idea on Sunday, calling it the new \"hoax\" from the media and saying he likes to have smart people around him.\n\n\"And no, he's not taking the presidency. I love having smart people...No, no, that's that happening. But Elon's done an amazing job. Isn't it nice to have smart people that we could rely on?\" Trump quipped, celebrating Musk's role with the newly created Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nTrump applauded Musk for his campaign contributions in Pennsylvania, helping North Carolinians during hurricane relief by providing Starlink, and his endeavors with SpaceX.\n\n\"No he's not going to be president, that I can tell you,\" Trump repeated. \"I'm safe. You know why? He wasn't born in this country. Ha, Ha.\"\n\nTrump spent time praising several of his embattled Cabinet picks, including his defense secretary selection Pete Hegseth, saying he thinks he will do \"great\" in the role.\n\n\"Over the past few weeks, I've nominated an all star Cabinet of some of the most determined and brilliant individuals ever to step forward for public office, and we're getting great reviews I have to say, they're all doing well, but we're getting fantastic reviews on the people that we chose,\" Trump said.\n\nHe again shared misinformation about vaccines being linked to a rise in autism and said Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, would be in charge of investigating it.\n\n\"Think of this, 25 years ago, autism, one in 10,000 children today is one in 36 children. Is something wrong? I think so,\" he said. \"And Robert and I and all, we're going to figure it out...\"\n\nTrump provided a one-sentence remark on Tulsi Gabbard, his choice for director of national intelligence, mentioning her nomination without any additional commentary. He added that he thinks Kash Patel, his selection to lead the FBI, \"may be the greatest director of them all.\"\n\nWhile Trump was going through his Day 1 priorities, he highlighted Russian President Vladimir Putin's comments in which he said he is ready to speak with the president-elect.\n\n\"President Putin said that he wants to meet with me as soon as possible. So we have to wait for this. But we have to end that war. That war is a horrible...\" Trump said, appearing to allude to public comments Putin made on Thursday.\n\nTrump also reiterated his tariff threat against Canada, Mexico, and China if they don't \"step up and stop the illegal aliens and illegal drugs from pouring into our country.\"\n\n\"They can't treat us that way. They're not going to be treating us that way for long that, I can tell you, because we're not going to let them turn the United States into a dumping ground.\"\n\nTrump also doubled down on his threat to take back the Panama Canal, complaining about the fees being charged to the U.S. Navy and American businesses: \"This complete ripoff of our country will immediately stop. It's going to stop,\" he said.\n\nAs Trump spent the last couple months of his campaign emphasizing anti-transgender rhetoric, he said he will sign executive orders on Day 1 to end child sexual mutilation, get transgender people out of the military, and keep \"men out of women's sports.\"\n\n\"Under the Trump administration, it will be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female. Later, Trump railed against the \"woke,\" calling wokeness \"bull----.\"\n\nWhile emphasizing his tariff threat, Trump also once again talked about migrants by labeling them as violent criminals, going on to assert that he would designate Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations, which he attempted to implement during his first term but halted after Mexico's president at the time urged him not to.\n\n\"Every foreign gang member will be expelled, and I will immediately designate the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. We're going to do it immediately. And we'll unleash the full power of federal law enforcement.\"\n\nTrump also vowed that his immigration policies would include a robust campaign on the flow of fentanyl into America and its devastating effects.\n\n\"We're going to show what these drugs are doing to you. Nobody's done that before, and we're going to do it.\"\n\nOne of his Day 1 priorities, he said, will be a \"historic slate of executive orders to close our border to illegal aliens and stop the invasion of our country.\"\n\n\"And on that same day, we will begin the largest deportation operation in American history, larger even than that of President Dwight Eisenhower,\" he said, calling it \"Operation Aurora,\" after the Colorado city that he referred to often on the campaign trail where he said immigrant gangs had taken over apartment buildings.\n\nWhile touting his victory, Trump also expressed gratitude to Charlie Kirk, the Turning Point USA executive director, who led some of the largest pro-Trump ground efforts among younger voters.\n\n\"I want to express my tremendous gratitude to Charlie Kirk. He's really an amazing guy, amazing guy and his whole staff for their relentless efforts to achieve this very historic victory... It's not my victory, it's your victory. It's a great honor.\"\n\nTrump continued his victory lap, going on to praise the demographic shifts that happened towards Republicans while promising to unite the country. He also went on a tangent about the reach he was able to have through TikTok.\n\n\"Tiktok, and we had a great response with billions of views, billions and billions of views,\" he said. \"They brought me a they brought me a chart, and it was a record, and it was so beautiful to see. And as I looked at it, I said, 'Maybe we got to keep this sucker around a little while.'\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Justice Stephen Breyer's blunt message to Supreme Court conservatives: 'Slow down'\n\nThe retired liberal justice spoke to ABC News Live Prime.\n\nAssociate Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer retired from the high court in 2022 but isn't finished prodding his former conservative colleagues to abandon what he sees as an aggressive tack to the right in how they interpret the law.\n\n\"Slow down. Period,\" Breyer, 85, said bluntly of his message to the court's majority in a wide-ranging interview with ABC News Live Prime .\n\n\"You're there a long time,\" he added, addressing the three justices nominated by former President Donald Trump . \"It takes three years, four years, five years, maybe, before you begin to adjust.\"\n\nBreyer has been on an all-out media blitz with the release of his 10th book, \"Reading the Constitution: Why I Chose Pragmatism, Not Textualism,\" an attack on the method of judging favored by his former colleagues that now threatens generations of established legal precedent .\n\nAs the U.S. Supreme Court prepares to release major rulings in a historic series of cases this spring, Breyer pulls back the curtain on the embattled institution at a critical juncture and offers an optimistic assessment of its future. What follows is a selection of questions and answers lightly edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nWell, of course, but, I mean, you reach a certain age, and that's the human condition.\n\nI just had lunch with them. [The mood] has always been pleasant, and it's probably, as far as I know, still true.\n\nYeah, I think there is a role. So, how do I help? I write this book. That's how.\n\nThat's right. And it's slow down, period. You're there a long time. It takes three years, four years, five years, maybe, before you begin to adjust.\n\nNo way to say. I say, Byron White said, that with every new judge, it's a new court. That's true.\n\nI tend to think, over time, they are less at risk than people worry about at the moment.\n\nI have had 40 years of experience.\n\nI say there's reason for thinking they won't change, and reasons for thinking they will. They won't perhaps give up being a more conservative person than some other person. But they may modify a little. Why do I say that? Because I think they'll find [their approach] doesn't work.\n\nThat's a good question. Politics in the sense in which it was used when I worked for Senator Ted Kennedy: Are you a Republican? Are you a Democrat? Are you popular? Are you unpopular? How will this decision over here play into your general image? How will it over here play into more votes? - that's not there. But there are things there you see, which depending on the case, you might say 'politics,' though I don't think that's the right word. What Paul Freund, a great professor at [constitutional] law, said that politics enters the judiciary this way: No judge decides a case based on the temperature of the day, but every judge is affected by the climate of the season.\n\nNo. But Brown did a lot of other things, like taking Jim Crow out of the law. You can't say it's nothing; it's pretty important. But there are a lot of other things, too, before people become really equal, and there's a lot of room for improvement there.\n\nPresident Eisenhower had to send troops. He sent the 101st Airborne. It took Elizabeth Eckford and the others to walk into that school. So, it was a happy day, right? Integration took place. We have the Little Rock Nine in the school. It's going ahead. Happy day. Yeah, that would be true if I could end the story here, but I can't.\n\nThree presidents have defied the court. Andrew Jackson and the case of the Cherokee Indians in Georgia is one example ... But do you think George Bush liked the decision of the Supreme Court, deciding in favor of people in Guantanamo and against him, the president, and the secretary of the defense and so forth? No, he didn't like it, but he said, I don't like it but I'll follow it.\n\nBecause the only way you can really punish a federal judge is by impeachment. They wrote that in the Constitution.\n\nWell, let's change the Constitution. Do you want the judges to be deciding on the basis of public opinion? Well, do you? No! Of course not. Of course not.\n\nI didn't say that. What I said was there was only one real way of punishing the judge, and that's to impeach.\n\nSuppose that your wife wants to give $100 to candidate X, and you're a member of the court. Can she do it?\n\nIt doesn't say she can't. But it's not just what the ethics code says. I thought this was a period when women made their own decisions. I thought this was a period when they were not just doing whatever there was best for their husband.\n\nI thought so. I thought so.\n\nThere were instances of someone who was caught who had flown from the West Coast with weapons with the intent of attacking one of the justices .\n\nYes. So, of course, it's a concern, and it's a serious, serious problem. You don't want any of the disagreements among people, which are many and can be healthy, to turn into violence. Totally wrong, totally wrong, totally wrong.\n\nI don't know, because they [Supreme Court Police] take the letters.\n\nNo.\n\nTwo years ago you faced a lot of pressure from liberals and Democrats to retire. There was even a van driving around the Supreme Court with a billboard saying, 'Breyer retire now.' Did you hear any of the calls to retire? And, were you concerned that if you had left in the midst of that, that it might appear that you were bowing to political pressure?\n\nBoth of those things somewhat. So, yeah.\n\nPeople can say what they want. They can say what they want. That's their decision to say whatever they want. I don't have to agree with it.\n\nIt's not the first time. And Senator Kennedy used to say -- as the country goes like this, you know, it's wavering but survives. And Churchill said the United States always does the right thing -- after trying everything else. There is a lot to learn before you become too depressed.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Britain's Conservative Party ousted after 14 years, marking big victory for Labour\n\nU.K. support for Israel and Ukraine is unlikely to change, one observer said.\n\nLONDON -- After 14 years in power with five consecutive prime ministers, the U.K.'s Conservative Party was voted out of power on Thursday, ceding control to Labour, a center-left party that had run on a platform calling for \"change.\"\n\nThe results were widely expected , as public support for the Conservatives, or Tories, had eroded amid Brexit, COVID and a rise in inflation.\n\nVoters in 650 constituencies cast ballots for members of the House of Commons. With almost all the votes counted, Labour candidates were expected to win 412 seats, while Conservatives would take 120 seats, according to the Press Association. Liberal Democrats were expected to have 71 seats.\n\nThe election was the country's first national vote since 2019. Prior to Thursday's voting, opinion polls in Britain had for more than two years predicted the Conservatives are heading for a \"heavy defeat,\" Pippa Catterall, a professor of history and politics at the University of Westminster, told ABC News.\n\n\"The Conservatives nonetheless went into the election with the hope that, as usual, the polls would narrow in their favor,\" Catterall said. \"Instead, it got worse.\"\n\nThe Labour Party's leader, Keir Starmer, who is now expected to become prime minister, said he hoped to put an end to the Conservative \"chaos.\" He'll replace Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who has been in office since 2022.\n\nStarmer's campaign released a \"manifesto\" laying out some of his government's plans, including cutting hospital wait times, ushering in a greener economy and improving the U.K.'s post-Brexit trade deals with the European Union.\n\n\"From Ukraine to Gaza, Labour's foreign and defense policy essentially mirrors the current government's,\" Dr. David S. Moon, senior lecturer in politics at the University of Bath, told ABC News. \"Starmer's Brexit plan lacks specifics beyond promising to negotiate a 'better deal.'\"\n\nMoon and other political observers said it's little surprise the Labour Party had focused its messaging on what the Conservatives did with their time in office rather than campaigning solely on what they hoped to accomplish.\n\nSince David Cameron's victory in the 2010 general election, the center-right Tories have led the country through a period of economic \"austerity,\" its exit from the European Union, the COVID pandemic and the current cost of living crisis.\n\n\"A Starmer victory seems more the product of a media backlash against the Conservatives following the scandal-plagued Johnson and Truss years rather than excitement about policy proposals, with Labour now seen across newsrooms as a safe alternative following Starmer's shifting of the party to the right,\" Moon said.\n\nCameron had called for the Brexit referendum before stepping down from power in 2016. He was followed in office by Theresa May, who put together a Brexit deal but stepped down before the deal could be completed. Johnson, in his 2019 campaign, promised to \"Get Brexit Done,\" and the country left in January 2020.\n\nBut the Tory's leadership during the U.K.'s messy exit from the European Union is likely only one of many reasons that support for the party has waned, said Sean D. Ehrlich, associate professor of political science at Florida State University.\n\nJohnson oversaw a chaotic rollout of COVID restrictions, which were then broken by Johnson himself during a Christmas gathering at 10 Downing Street, the prime minister's official residence.\n\nTruss introduced a \"mini-budget\" in 2022 that included a series of tax cuts aimed a growing the economy, but she reversed course within days amid public backlash.\n\nBritish inflation then spiked under Sunak, rising to a high of 11% in late 2022, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\n\"The Conservatives are deeply unpopular in large part because they are no longer viewed as competent,\" Ehrlich said. \"Their struggles to implement Brexit play a large role in this decline in support but the election should probably not be viewed as a repudiation of Brexit itself.\"\n\nAbout six weeks ago, as Sunak announced he was calling a general election for July, he was caught in the rain in front of Downing Street without an umbrella.\n\nThe prime minister, who came to power in 2022 via an internal party election, has said Labour's election would lead to weaker border security and higher taxes. He said Thursday that a Tory defeat could mean \"higher taxes for a generation.\"\n\n\"Labour would increase taxes on every part of your life, including your death,\" he said on social media.\n\nAs former Prime Minister Boris Johnson addressed a Conservative Party rally in London on Tuesday, he made clear that opinion polls were predicting his party was expected to be swept out of power with Thursday's election.\n\n\"I think and hope the British people will show more sense on Thursday and draw back from the brink,\" Johnson said during his first campaign speech in support of Sunak.\n\nOne of Sunak's cabinet members, Home Secretary Suella Braverman, put the party's prospects more succinctly the following day, writing in an op-ed published Wednesday that \"it's over.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

A bill that would force transgender people to use bathrooms that align with their assigned sex at birth has been stalled since January.\n\nLegislation to block state identification documents from ever using nonbinary gender markers failed after Arizona state House Speaker Russell Bowers voted against it in February.\n\nIn Utah, Republican Gov. Spencer Cox has long expressed his plan to veto a ban against transgender girls' participation in sports that align with their gender identity.\n\n\"We care deeply about Utah's female athletes and our LGBTQ+ community,\" Cox said in a Facebook post. \"To those hurting tonight: It's going to be OK. We're going to help you get through this.\"\n\nAt least 19 Republicans voted against the legislation.\n\nIn Wisconsin, a bill to ban transgender children from receiving gender-affirming care has been left untouched by the Republican-controlled state legislature.\n\nStill, many Republican-led efforts across the country continue to target LGBTQ groups.\n\nAnd many -- including the so-called \" Don't Say Gay \" bill against LGBTQ content in schools popularized this year in Florida and quickly replicated by other states -- have been quickly backed by Republican-led state legislatures.\n\n\"These actions by state lawmakers also exacerbate the already inadequate, inefficient and confusing patchwork of nondiscrimination laws which presents challenges to American businesses,\" Conservatives Against Discrimination said.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

It took place against a background of growing uncertainty over the future of Ukraine and Europe's alliance with the United States .\n\nGermany is the most populous country in the 27-nation European Union and a leading member of NATO. It's been Ukraine's second-biggest weapons supplier, after the U.S. It will be central to shaping the continent's response to the challenges of the coming years, including the Trump administration's confrontational foreign and trade policy.\n\nThe Reuters news agency reports that, on his Truth Social platform, President Trump said, \"Much like the USA, the people of Germany got tired of the no common sense agenda, especially on energy and immigration, that has prevailed for so many years. This is a great day for Germany.\"\n\nReuters reports that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in a post on X three years after Russia's invasion of Ukraine , congratulated Merz and said, \"We look forward to continuing our joint work with Germany to protect lives, bring real peace closer to Ukraine, and strengthen Europe.\"\n\nAnd, Reuters pointed out that, while congratulating Merz in a post on X, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said he's \"looking forward to working with you in this crucial moment for our shared security. It's vital that Europe step up on defense spending and your leadership will be key.\"\n\nThe results released by the electoral authority showed Merz's Christian Democrats and the center-left Social Democrats winning a combined majority of seats in the national legislature after small parties failed to make the electoral threshold.\n\nThat gives Merz the best chance of becoming the country's next chancellor. He said on election night that he hopes to form a government by Easter at the latest.\n\nHe has ruled out a coalition with the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, which Mr. Trump's adviser Elon Musk has backed in the elections and which is now Germany's second-largest party after its best showing ever.\n\nMerz's conservatives won 208 seats in the 630-seat Bundestag, while the AfD won 152. The incumbent Social Democrats won 120 seats and the Left party got 64.\n\nThe left-wing Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance came in just barely under the 5% hurdle needed to get seats in parliament, while the pro-business Free Democrats also failed to reach 5%.\n\nThe AfD was jubilant on Sunday night, with leaders vowing to become the country's main party in the next election as its appeal expands. The anti-immigrant, far-right party has established itself as a significant political force in the 12 years since it was founded, but it hasn't yet been part of any state or national government.\n\nThat's the result of what is often called a \"firewall\" against Alternative for Germany. Other parties say they won't work with the AfD, which is under observation by the domestic intelligence agency for suspected right-wing extremism, something that AfD objects to strongly. Its branches in three eastern states are designated \"proven right-wing extremist\" groups, which is particularly sensitive in view of Germany's Nazi past.\n\nFor the time being, outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz, whose SPD party suffered a stinging defeat, will remain.\n\nThe election took place seven months earlier than originally planned after Scholz's unpopular coalition collapsed in November, three years into a term that was increasingly marred by infighting. There was widespread discontent and not much enthusiasm for any of the candidates.\n\n\"I am aware of the responsibility,\" Merz said Sunday evening. \"I am also aware of the scale of the task that now lies ahead of us. I approach it with the utmost respect, and I know that it will not be easy.\"\n\n\"The world out there isn't waiting for us, and it isn't waiting for long-drawn-out coalition talks and negotiations,\" he told cheering supporters.\n\n© 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

This is either an act of lunacy or a shining example of standing for conservative principle.\n\nAs it happens, there are just about the same number of Republican governors across the United States, and their representative was in Washington on the third day of the government shutdown with a very different conservative message: We get things done. \"Thirty Republican governors are applying conservative principles,\" says Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, the chairman of the Republican Governors Association. \"Here in D.C. they talk about it, but outside the nation's capital we're actually doing it. For too long for the Republican governors, we feel like we've outsourced our brand management to the Republicans in D.C. It's time for us to stop doing that. It's time for us to take control of our own destiny. We want folks to know that when we're talking about Republicans, it's not just the dysfunction that's happening in Washington, D.C., it's the results that are happening in our state capitals.\"\n\nIn the roiling debate among Republicans between principle and pragmatism, the governors are weighing in. Jindal was in town to start the launch of a new ad campaign touting the success of the GOP brand in the states. \"Republican governors are driving America's comeback\" is the tagline. Their intent is to highlight their solutions-oriented records and get themselves re-elected. In this cause, they are clearly using Sen. Cruz and House Republicans as a foil. When Jindal says, \"We are not the party of no,\" the first thing that comes to mind is the group that has become associated with that phrase: Republicans in Congress.\n\nIn New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie was selling the same message. After leaving a meeting with Jindal, I received a press release from Christie's office touting his cooperation with the Democratic Senate leader Steve Sweeney. \"A tale of two cities,\" it read. \"On day three of the government shutdown, folks in Washington are reading headlines like 'W.H. Meeting With Lawmakers Goes Nowhere.' ... Meanwhile here in New Jersey, it's a much different story.\"\n\nJindal and the Republican governors are not alone in bashing Washington Republicans. That's what Sen. Cruz is doing, too. But the GOP governors are making a different case. Their argument is based on results, conservative policies that are sometimes the result of hard-won compromise. Or, in some cases, they are boasting about lawmakers who have pushed for conservative legislation dealing with unions or removing regulatory barriers, but who have also decided to accept federal Medicaid money as a part of Obamacare. That kind of apostasy would not be tolerated by conservative purists in Washington, but it's also the kind of purity that governors don't have the luxury for. In 2016 the four biggest governor's races for Republicans will take place in Pennsylvania, Florida, Ohio, and Michigan. Those Republican governors all accepted Medicaid funds.\n\nJindal isn't the only one selling the governors. When the Republican Party commissioned its famous autopsy shortly after the 2012 presidential election loss , the bias toward the governors was clear. \"At the federal level, much of what Republicans are doing is not working beyond the core constituencies that make up the Party. On the state level, however, it is a different story. ... Republican governors are America's reformers in chief. ... It is time for Republicans on the federal level to learn from successful Republicans on the state level. It is time to smartly change course, modernize the Party, and learn once again how to appeal to more people, including those who share some but not all of our conservative principles.\"\n\nThat was Jindal's explicit message on Thursday. Though he had plenty of criticism for the president--who he said liked to play the \"victim in chief\"--his message for his own party was not about the incumbent he disapproves of. In the states, he said, \"You see a party that is fighting for every single vote, that is fighting to help the American people join and thrive in the middle class ... a party that is not just the party of no, and those are the things that we need to do as a party if we want to earn the right to govern and we want to be a majority party. It's not happening in D.C. right now, but it is happening in our state capitals.\"\n\nThere are several ways for the Republican Party to evolve. The new firebrands who have captured the attention of the nation may be at the start of a conservative constitutional revolution in the party. Or they may be taking a party that is shrinking and driving it to an ever-narrower base of Tea Party loyalists that represent about a fifth of the country. Or, Washington is a sideshow and the Republicans in the states who actually have to accomplish something are where the real long-term energy in the party is. That was the message Jindal came to town to sell. It remains to be seen whether he or another pragmatic Republican governor can get back behind the steering wheel.\n\nAward-winning journalist and author John Dickerson is co-anchor of the\" CBS Evening News\" and chief political analyst for CBS News.

      "text": "Conservatives win Germany election, far-right in second place, exit polls show\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  February 23, 2025 / 3:28 PM EST / CBS/AP\n\nGerman voters have chosen a new direction in a crucial federal election that will reshape the country's political landscape.\n\nExit polls show opposition leader Friedrich Merz's center-right Christian Democratic Union party leading the votes with the far-right Alternative for Germany party heading towards the strongest showing of the far-right since World War II.\n\nMerz was quick to claim victory, saying he is aware of the dimension of the task he faces and said that \"it will not be easy.\"\n\nChancellor Olaf Scholz, whose three-party coalition collapsed in November, conceded defeat.\n\nThe exit polls for ARD and ZDF public television show Scholz's center-left Social Democrats on track for their worst postwar result in a national parliamentary election and expected to be in third place.\n\nThe polls, issued right after the last polling stations closed, put support for Merz's Union bloc at 28.5-29% and Alternative for Germany, or AfD, at 19.5-20% - roughly double its result from 2021.\n\nThey put support for Scholz's Social Democrats at 16-16.5%, far lower than in the last election. The environmentalist Greens were at 13.5%.\n\nOut of three smaller parties, one - the hard-left Left Party - appeared certain to win seats in parliament with 8.5-9% of the vote. Two other parties, the pro-business Free Democrats and the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance, were around the threshold of the 5% support needed to win seats.\n\nWhether Merz, who is the frontrunner to become the next German chancellor, will need one or two partners to form a coalition government will depend on how many parties get into parliament.\n\n\"I am aware of the responsibility,\" Merz said. \"I am also aware of the scale of the task that now lies ahead of us. I approach it with the utmost respect, and I know that it will not be easy.\"\n\n\"The world out there isn't waiting for us, and it isn't waiting for long-drawn-out coalition talks and negotiations,\" he told cheering supporters.\n\nIt's unlikely that any single party will garner anywhere near the outright majority of seats in the parliament, or Bundestag, in this election that would be required under Germany's electoral system to form a new government on its own.\n\nInstead, parties must negotiate alliances to form a government, with the party that takes the most seats generally putting its leader as chancellor. Coalition governments often require compromises between parties with starkly different policy priorities, making governance a process of negotiation.\n\nDespite their swelling popularity, all the mainstream German parties, including Merz's CDU, have categorically ruled out forming a coalition with the AfD - which President Trump's advisor Elon Musk has backed in the elections - citing the party's links to far-right extremism . That exclusion means it is virtually certain that the AfD will not be part of the next government.\n\n© 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

      "text": "Supreme Court's conservatives assert control as momentous term comes to an end\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  June 30, 2022 / 7:24 PM EDT / CBS News\n\nWashington - Five years after Neil Gorsuch joined the Supreme Court, nearly four years after Brett Kavanaugh replaced a retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy and 20 months after Amy Coney Barrett was confirmed days before the 2020 election, the Supreme Court's expanded conservative majority exerted its power across a blockbuster term marked by major decisions on abortion, the Second Amendment and religious rights.\n\nThe term that kicked off in October officially came to a close Thursday, with the justices issuing its final two decisions - one curbing the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and a second paving the way for the Biden administration to roll back the so-called \"Remain in Mexico\" immigration policy - before recessing for the summer.\n\nBut it was the rulings issued on successive days last week to wipe away the constitutional right to an abortion and expand gun rights for the first time in more than a decade that underscored how the Supreme Court's conservative majority is making its mark on the law.\n\n\"What we saw this term, at least in the guns and abortion and religion cases, is a bold court, a court that's bold in tone and also in agenda. They're overruling precedent and they're making big changes, including to existing methodology, where we look for rights or how we evaluate gun regulations - they changed what the lower courts are doing,\" Allison Orr Larsen, a law professor at William & Mary, told CBS News.\n\n\"When a court takes big bites like that, big changes in doctrine, it's hard to characterize that as 5-4 or 6-3. It feels different than what we've seen in the past. The tone of the opinions seem different. Dramatic, consequential,\" she continued. \"It doesn't seem to be completely aligned with what we think of as Chief Justice Roberts's court. He prefers conservative steps, but not big steps at a time, big jolts. These decisions are big-jolt decisions.\"\n\nIn their decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark decision that legalized abortion nationwide, in particular, the court's conservatives cast aside Roberts' approach of seeking incremental changes to the law rather than major shifts.\n\nIn a concurring opinion, Roberts said he would uphold the Mississippi law banning abortion after 15 weeks at the crux of the court fight, but called the decision to overrule Roe a \"serious jolt to the legal system.\" A \"narrower decision,\" he said, \"would be markedly less unsettling.\"\n\n\"When Chief Justice Roberts was the fifth conservative vote, it was not such a headlong rush, partly because he is an incrementalist and partly because he cares about the legitimacy of the court, particularly a court with his name on it,\" said Caroline Mala Corbin, a constitutional law professor at the University of Miami. \"He is no longer a deciding vote. His vote is no longer necessary.\"\n\nIn addition to reversing Roe and invalidating New York's restrictions on carrying a handgun outside the home, the Supreme Court also ruled in favor of religious rights in four disputes: siding with a Texas death row inmate who wanted his pastor to audibly pray and lay hands on him during his execution; finding the city of Boston violated the First Amendment when it rejected a request from an organization to fly a Christian flag outside of City Hall; striking down a Maine tuition assistance program that excluded schools that provide religious instructions; and backing a former high school football coach who lost his job after praying on the 50-yard-line after games.\n\nIn the cases involving the Texas inmate and Boston City Hall, the court ruled 8-1 and 9-0, respectively, while it broke along ideological lines in the other two disputes.\n\nCorbin said the decisions in the religious liberty cases indicate the Supreme Court's conservative majority will \"eviscerate\" rights they dislike. But Mark Rienzi, president of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, believes the latest rulings in favor of religious rights are a course-correction rather than an indication that the court's conservative majority is pro-religion.\n\n\"The court is engaged in a long clean-up enterprise of decades of religious liberty law that went far astray,\" he told reporters this week. \"I think they really are committed to pluralism and to respecting people's ability to live out a different life and not always go where the majority wants them to go.\"\n\nRienzi lamented that the nation is in an era that is \"unfortunately tending to be intolerant of differences.\"\n\n\"If I were governments or I were opponents of religion or religious people, I might look at it and say, maybe I should stop picking those fights because it's pretty clear that the court actually believes in the First Amendment,\" he said.\n\nAccording to an analysis of the court's term by Adam Feldman, founder of the website Empirical SCOTUS, 17 decisions were unanimous, while the three liberal members of the court - Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan - dissented together in 13 decisions. Roberts and Kavanaugh, meanwhile, were in the majority most often, at 94.9% of the time.\n\nWhile the term was packed with significant, earth-shaking decisions, the justices are already poised to hear blockbuster disputes involving religious liberty , affirmative action , voting rights and state legislatures' power to set federal election rules when they convene for their next term in October.\n\nOne of the cases involves a web designer from Colorado who does not want to offer services for same-sex weddings because of her religious beliefs, in violation of a state anti-discrimination law. The web designer, Lorie Smith, argues the law violates her free speech and religious rights, and the justices will weigh whether applying a public-accommodation law to compel an artist to speak or stay silent violates the First Amendment.\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to continue its trend of bolstering religious rights, but Larsen said the case could be one where the justices take a more incremental approach.\n\n\"Instead of overruling Obergefell, they might increase accommodations for people with religious objections to participating or using their services at a wedding between a gay couple,\" she said, referencing the landmark 2015 decision that legalized same-sex marriage. \"That's an example where we could return to that step to the right for sure, but not a leap to the right.\"\n\nThe court's membership is also changing with the retirement of Breyer, which took effect Thursday , and appointment of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who was sworn in just hours after the final opinions were issued. Jackson is the first Black woman to serve on the high court.\n\nShe is joining the Supreme Court at a time when the secrecy surrounding it has been pierced and the trust among its members breached with the leak of the draft majority opinion in the abortion case. Roberts ordered an investigation into the source of the disclosure, but the identity of the person who shared the document with reporters from Politico still remains unknown to the public.\n\n\"She is entering a new family at a time when the family dynamics are quite tense,\" Larsen said of Jackson.\n\nJackson filling Breyer's seat will not change the ideological makeup of the court, and the Supreme Court's conservative majority is expected to endure for years.\n\n\"The dissenting justices have to take the long view and realize that they will not always be in the minority, and at some point their dissenting opinions will become a blueprint for a majority opinion,\" Corbin said. \"They continue to point out the weaknesses of the majority's reasoning and the ways they deviate from acceptable practices, and to write the blueprint for decisions that may be far in the future, but may nonetheless become a majority opinion.\"\n\nWhile Mr. Biden has put his own historic stamp on the court with Jackson's appointment, the reversal of Roe and expansion of Second Amendment rights demonstrated the transformation of the court made possible by Senate Republicans and former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"Had President Obama been able to appoint the Supreme Court justice that he was entitled to appoint, they would not have had a majority [to overturn Roe], because Chief Justice Roberts would have written the majority in Dobbs and perhaps the court would have eliminated abortion rights eventually, but it wouldn't have done it on Friday,\" Corbin said. \"Whose legacy is it really? Is it Mitch McConnell's or is it Donald Trump's?\"\n\nMelissa Quinn is a politics reporter for CBSNews.com.

      "text": "Liberals and conservatives are suing to remove Biden's new border policy - for very different reasons\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nMay 26, 2023 / 3:49 PM EDT / CBS News\n\nImmigration advocates said President Biden's new border policy is a draconian restriction that will \"effectively eliminate asylum\" for most migrants. Republican officials in Texas, however, said the opposite is true, warning that the regulation will trigger an \"influx of migrants\" with unvetted asylum claims.\n\nBoth groups were describing the same Biden administration policy in separate lawsuits, but their reasons for challenging it were completely different.\n\nEnacted earlier this month, the Biden administration rule disqualifies migrants from asylum if they did not first seek refuge in a third country before reaching the U.S. southern border. Those who cross the border unlawfully and fail to prove they deserve an exemption to the rule face swift deportation and a five-year banishment from the U.S.\n\nThe rule is the centerpiece of the administration's broader effort to reduce illegal border crossings, which recently reached record levels. It penalizes those who enter the country without permission, while expanding opportunities for migrants to come to the U.S. legally.\n\nIn their lawsuit earlier this month, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and other advocacy groups said Mr. Biden's rule, just like two Trump administration asylum restrictions blocked in federal court, violates laws Congress passed in 1980 to protect refugees fleeing persecution.\n\nIn a separate lawsuit filed this week, Texas' Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton also argued the regulation was unlawful, but he focused his criticism on a provision that instructs migrants to wait in Mexico until they secure an appointment via a phone app to enter the U.S. at an official border crossing. Those who enter the U.S. with one of roughly 1,000 appointments distributed each day are not disqualified from asylum.\n\nThe strange bedfellows' lawsuits, both of which seek to block the asylum restriction in its entirety, could imperil Mr. Biden's strategy to manage migration to the U.S. southern border, where migrants have been coming in greater numbers and from more countries than ever before amid mass displacement in Latin American and the Caribbean. Federal judges in Oakland and Del Rio, Texas, could rule on these cases later this year, setting off a high-stakes legal battle that could reach the Supreme Court.\n\nBut beyond their legal and practical implications, the lawsuits illustrate the thorny political spot the Biden administration finds itself in on border policy.\n\nProgressive advocates say Mr. Biden has been too tough on migrants and too reliant on deterrence policies embraced by former President Donald Trump. Republicans, meanwhile, continue to argue the current migration crisis is one of Mr. Biden's own making, accusing his administration of lax border enforcement.\n\nThe lawsuits also highlight the perils of federal immigration policy-making amid decades of congressional inaction on the issue. Like his predecessors, Mr. Biden has exercised his executive authority broadly to enact major immigration policies, at the southern border and in the interior. And like his predecessors' unilateral changes, Mr. Biden's policy agenda has been challenged, and at times derailed, by lawsuits.\n\n\"Before you get to the point of another administration coming in, a court will wipe out a rule or policy with an injunction and it has to be changed immediately,\" said Theresa Cardinal Brown, a former U.S. immigration official under former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. \"It's a whip-sawing effect on policy.\"\n\nA Texas lawsuit, for example, prevented the Obama administration from giving work permits and deportation protections to unauthorized immigrants whose children were American citizens or permanent U.S. residents. The Trump administration's numerous asylum restrictions, migrant family separation policy and efforts to slash legal immigration faced dozens of often successful legal challenges from Democratic-led states and advocacy groups like the ACLU.\n\nThat trend has continued, if not intensified, under Mr. Biden. During his first two years in office, Texas and other Republican-led states convinced judges to block a 100-day moratorium on most deportations, rules limiting arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the termination of a Trump-era policy known as \"Remain in Mexico\" that forced asylum-seekers to wait for their court dates outside the U.S.\n\nRepublican state officials prolonged the termination of the Title 42 public health order - which allowed border agents to expel migrants without asylum screenings - for a year. The pandemic rule only ended this month because the expiration of the COVID-19 national emergency nullified the legal challenges.\n\nMore recently, a federal judge granted Florida's request to halt a Biden administration migrant release policy that was intended to mitigate overcrowding inside Border Patrol facilities. Another federal judge in Texas is also expected to rule soon on a request by Republican-led states to force the Biden administration to terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program for 600,000 immigrant \"Dreamers.\"\n\nOther cases remain unresolved, including Texas' bid to shut down a popular program that allows up to 30,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans with U.S.-based financial sponsors to come to the country lawfully each month.\n\nCardinal Brown, now a senior adviser at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said Congress' failure or reluctance to change immigration law in any significant way since the 1990s has led states and groups that disagree with the administration in power to stage policy fights in the federal court system.\n\n\"The main reason we're seeing these particular lawsuits by the states is a political and policy difference of opinion,\" Cardinal Brown said. \"The judiciary is not supposed to be a policy-making body, and we're asking it to essentially make policy.\"\n\nIn a recent briefing, Blas Nuñez Neto, the highest-ranking immigration and border policy official at the Department of Homeland Security, said the lawsuits \"clearly demonstrate just how fundamentally broken our immigration system is.\"\n\nThe administration, Nuñez Neto argued, is employing \"innovative\" executive actions to deter illegal border entries, which dropped sharply after Title 42 lapsed on May 11. Asked by CBS News if the administration had a Plan B or C to manage border crossings if the lawsuits prevail, Nuñez Neto pivoted to Congress.\n\n\"At the end of the day, we are just clear-eyed that there is no lasting solution here that does not involve the U.S. Congress,\" he said.\n\nCamilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

      "text": "Germany's election won by conservatives, and far-right AfD party surges, official results show\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  February 24, 2025 / 9:08 PM EST / CBS/AP\n\nBerlin - Provisional results confirmed that mainstream conservatives led by Friedrich Merz won Germany's national election , while a far-right party surged to become the nation's second-largest.\n\nThe campaign was dominated by worries about the yearslong stagnation of Europe's biggest economy and pressure to curb migration, something that caused friction after Merz pushed hard in recent weeks for a tougher approach. It took place against a background of growing uncertainty over the future of Ukraine and Europe's alliance with the United States .\n\nGermany is the most populous country in the 27-nation European Union and a leading member of NATO. It's been Ukraine's second-biggest weapons supplier, after the U.S. It will be central to shaping the continent's response to the challenges of the coming years, including the Trump administration's confrontational foreign and trade policy.\n\nThe Reuters news agency reports that, on his Truth Social platform, President Trump said, \"Much like the USA, the people of Germany got tired of the no common sense agenda, especially on energy and immigration, that has prevailed for so many years. This is a great day for Germany.\"\n\nReuters reports that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in a post on X three years after Russia's invasion of Ukraine , congratulated Merz and said, \"We look forward to continuing our joint work with Germany to protect lives, bring real peace closer to Ukraine, and strengthen Europe.\"\n\nAnd, Reuters pointed out that, while congratulating Merz in a post on X, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said he's \"looking forward to working with you in this crucial moment for our shared security. It's vital that Europe step up on defense spending and your leadership will be key.\"\n\nThe results released by the electoral authority showed Merz's Christian Democrats and the center-left Social Democrats winning a combined majority of seats in the national legislature after small parties failed to make the electoral threshold.\n\nThat gives Merz the best chance of becoming the country's next chancellor. He said on election night that he hopes to form a government by Easter at the latest.\n\nHe has ruled out a coalition with the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, which Mr. Trump's adviser Elon Musk has backed in the elections and which is now Germany's second-largest party after its best showing ever.\n\nMerz's conservatives won 208 seats in the 630-seat Bundestag, while the AfD won 152. The incumbent Social Democrats won 120 seats and the Left party got 64.\n\nThe left-wing Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance came in just barely under the 5% hurdle needed to get seats in parliament, while the pro-business Free Democrats also failed to reach 5%.\n\nThe AfD was jubilant on Sunday night, with leaders vowing to become the country's main party in the next election as its appeal expands. The anti-immigrant, far-right party has established itself as a significant political force in the 12 years since it was founded, but it hasn't yet been part of any state or national government.\n\nThat's the result of what is often called a \"firewall\" against Alternative for Germany. Other parties say they won't work with the AfD, which is under observation by the domestic intelligence agency for suspected right-wing extremism, something that AfD objects to strongly. Its branches in three eastern states are designated \"proven right-wing extremist\" groups, which is particularly sensitive in view of Germany's Nazi past.\n\nFor the time being, outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz, whose SPD party suffered a stinging defeat, will remain.\n\nThe election took place seven months earlier than originally planned after Scholz's unpopular coalition collapsed in November, three years into a term that was increasingly marred by infighting. There was widespread discontent and not much enthusiasm for any of the candidates.\n\n\"I am aware of the responsibility,\" Merz said Sunday evening. \"I am also aware of the scale of the task that now lies ahead of us. I approach it with the utmost respect, and I know that it will not be easy.\"\n\n\"The world out there isn't waiting for us, and it isn't waiting for long-drawn-out coalition talks and negotiations,\" he told cheering supporters.\n\n© 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "Britain's Conservative Party picks Kemi Badenoch as leader after crushing election defeat\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  November 2, 2024 / 9:55 AM EDT / AP\n\nBritain's Conservative Party on Saturday elected Kemi Badenoch as its new leader as it tries to rebound from a crushing election defeat that ended 14 years in power.\n\nThe first Black woman to lead a major British political party, Badenoch (pronounced BADE-enock) defeated rival lawmaker Robert Jenrick in a vote of almost 100,000 members of the right-of-center Conservatives.\n\nShe got 53,806 votes in the online and postal ballot of party members, to Jenrick's 41,388.\n\nBadenoch replaces former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak , who in July led the Conservatives to their worst election result since 1832. The Conservatives lost more than 200 seats, taking their tally down to 121.\n\nThe new leader's daunting task is to try to restore the party's reputation after years of division, scandal and economic tumult, hammer Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer's policies on key issues including the economy and immigration , and return the Conservatives to power at the next election, due by 2029.\n\n\"The task that stands before us is tough but simple,\" Badenoch said in a victory speech to a roomful of Conservative lawmakers, staff and journalists in London. She said the party's job was to hold the Labour government to account, and to craft pledges and a plan for government.\n\nAddressing the party's election drubbing, she said \"we have to be honest - honest about the fact that we made mistakes, honest about the fact that we let standards slip.\"\n\n\"The time has come to tell the truth, to stand up for our principles, to plan for our future, to reset our politics and our thinking, and to give our party, and our country, the new start that they deserve,\" Badenoch said.\n\nA business secretary in Sunak's government, Badenoch was born in London to Nigerian parents and spent much of her childhood in the West African country.\n\nThe 44-year-old former software engineer depicts herself as a disruptor, arguing for a low-tax, free-market economy and pledging to \"rewire, reboot and reprogram\" the British state.\n\nA critic of multiculturalism and self-proclaimed enemy of wokeness, Badenoch has criticized gender-neutral bathrooms and government plans to reduce U.K. carbon emissions. During the leadership campaign she drew criticism for saying that \"not all cultures are equally valid,\" and for suggesting that maternity pay was excessive.\n\nTim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, said the Conservative Party was likely to \"swing towards the right both in terms of its economic policies and its social policies\" under Badenoch.\n\nHe predicted Badenoch would pursue \"what you might call the boats, boilers and bathrooms strategy .... focusing very much on the trans issue, the immigration issue and skepticism about progress towards net zero.\"\n\nWhile the Conservative Party is unrepresentative of the country as a whole - its 132,000 members are largely affluent, older white men - its upper echelons have become markedly more diverse.\n\nBadenoch is the Tories' fourth female leader, after Margaret Thatcher , Theresa May and Liz Truss , all of whom became prime minister. She's the second Conservative leader of color, after Sunak, and the first with African roots. The center-left Labour Party, in contrast, has only ever been led by white men.\n\nIn a leadership contest that lasted more than three months, Conservative lawmakers reduced the field from six candidates in a series of votes before putting the final two to the wider party membership.\n\nBoth finalists came from the right of the party, and argued they can win voters back from Reform U.K., the hard-right, anti-immigrant party led by populist politician Nigel Farage that has eaten away at Conservative support.\n\nBut the party also lost many voters to the winning party, Labour, and to the centrist Liberal Democrats, and some Conservatives worry that tacking right will lead the party away from public opinion.\n\nStarmer's government has had a rocky first few months in office, beset by negative headlines , fiscal gloom and a plummeting approval rating.\n\nBut Bale said that the historical record suggests the odds are against Badenoch leading the Conservatives back to power in 2029.\n\n\"It's quite unusual for someone to take over when a party gets very badly beaten and manage to lead it to election victory,\" he said. \"However, Keir Starmer did exactly that after 2019. So records are there to be broken.\"\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated to include Theresa May on the list of previous female prime ministers.\n\n© 2024 The Associated Press.

      "text": "SCOTUS conservatives appear open to siding with Planned Parenthood in fight over South Carolina's funding cut\n\nFollow:\n\nSeveral key conservatives on the Supreme Court left open the possibility on Wednesday that they could side with Planned Parenthood in a dispute with South Carolina over its decision to yank that organization's Medicaid funding because it provides abortions.\n\nThough the case technically doesn't deal with abortion - federal and state law already bar Medicaid from paying for the procedure - it had become swept into that fraught national debate when South Carolina decided in 2018 to pull the group from its Medicaid program.\n\nThe court's liberal wing appeared to be solidly aligned with Planned Parenthood's position that people should be able to sue states that cut funding to the group. And several key conservatives - including Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett - left open the possibility that they could side with the group, even though they raised concerns about expanding the ability of people to sue over requirements in federal spending laws.\n\nBarrett, who asked difficult questions of both sides, laid out a hypothetical in which she wanted to see see a \"Dr. Jones\" for care but the state had disqualified the practice.\n\n\"That's the provider of my choice,\" she said, but \"there's no mechanism, am I right, for the beneficiary to say you're depriving me of my ability ... to see the provider of my choice, and nobody's disputing that Dr. Jones can provide the services in a competent way.\"\n\nA ruling from the Supreme Court, expected by the end of June, could have profound implications for the ability of patients to access care at Planned Parenthood clinics across the country because it would likely prompt other Republican governors to cut Planned Parenthood funding and limit the ability of patients to challenge those decisions.\n\nLiberal Justice Elena Kagan worried that states could set all sorts of limits on providers to gain or block entry into state Medicaid programs. A state could cut off providers that offer contraception, for instance, or gender affirming care. Democratic states, meanwhile, could impose similar requirements on providers that do not offer those services.\n\n\"Every state could split up the world by providers like that,\" Kagan said. \"That does not seem what this statute is all about.\"\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh, a member of the court's conservative wing, repeatedly tried to get the lawyers on both sides of the case to articulate a clear standard for when people may sue to enforce such requirements and when they could not.\n\n\"The broader separation of powers concerns is the Congress creates rights of actions and remedies, not the court,\" Kavanaugh said, adding that the court has been hesitant to expand the right of people to sue in other contexts. At one point, Kavanaugh asked the lawyer for Planned Parenthood how \"we should just deal with the fact that we no longer really engage in the process of creating implied rights of action.\"\n\nThe appeal has attracted enormous attention from groups engaged on abortion. In one telling sign of that dynamic, the director of the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services will be represented at the Supreme Court by Alliance Defending Freedom, a religious legal group that helped orchestrate the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022.\n\nA crowd of protesters supporting and opposing abortion showed up at the Supreme Court on Wednesday in advance of the arguments - one of the larger gathering of the court's current term.\n\nRelated article Trump and allies celebrated court orders against Biden they now claim are 'tyrannical'\n\nAt issue is an executive order South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster signed in 2018 that yanked Medicaid funding for the state's two Planned Parenthood clinics. The Republican governor argued that those payments amounted to a taxpayer subsidy for abortion.\n\nMcMaster's order had the effect of also blocking patients from receiving other services from Planned Parenthood. A patient named Julie Edwards, who has diabetes, and Planned Parenthood South Atlantic sued the state, noting that federal law gives Medicaid patients a right to access care at any qualified doctor's office willing to see them.\n\n\"It's not about abortion,\" Catherine Humphreville, senior staff attorney at Planned Parenthood Federation of America, told CNN. \"It's about peoples' ability to access basic services like birth control, like well-person exams, like cancer screenings. Many patients just don't have access to these services.\"\n\nIf the court sides with South Carolina, it will likely embolden other conservative governors to cut Planned Parenthood from their Medicaid programs, blocking beneficiaries from accessing those services, said Sonia Suter, a George Washington University law professor and the founding director of the school's Health Law Initiative.\n\nThat, she said, would have a \"huge impact on access to care.\"\n\nAn irony of that outcome, she said, is that it could limit access to contraceptive care.\n\n\"What's really going to end up happening is an increase in unintended pregnancies,\" she said.\n\nRelated article 'Only this Court': How Trump is begging the Supreme Court to approve his agenda\n\nGroups that oppose abortion have weighed in with a bevy of briefs at the Supreme Court arguing that because money is fungible, the Medicaid payments to Planned Parenthood indirectly support the procedure. Lawmakers in South Carolina have enacted a ban on most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy.\n\n\"By filing this lawsuit, they made it an abortion case,\" said Katie Daniel, director of legal affairs and policy counsel with Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.\n\nThe idea that preventing Medicaid payments to Planned Parenthood \"prevents women or families from receiving contraception or other types of health care relies on the premise that Planned Parenthood is the only game in town,\" Daniel said. \"That's absolutely not true.\"\n\nThe technical legal dispute for the court deals with whether Medicaid patients have a right to sue to enforce requirements included in spending laws approved by Congress - in this case, the \"any-qualified provider\" requirement. The Supreme Court has long moved cautiously on that question in other contexts, though a 7-2 majority found such a right in a related case two years ago .\n\nThat appeal involved a nursing home patient whose wife sued over what she said was inadequate care. In an opinion written by liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson that was joined by both conservative and liberal colleagues, the court found that the Federal Nursing Home Reform Act gave the plaintiff a right to sue.\n\nBarrett wrote separately - joined by Roberts - to say that while she agreed with the outcome in that case, the court should \"tread carefully\" before allowing parties to sue to enforce requirements in other spending laws.\n\nCritics say that without giving beneficiaries a right to sue it would be virtually impossible to enforce requirements Congress includes in spending laws. The federal government could cut its share of Medicaid funding to a state for noncompliance, but that is impractical given the wide reliance on the program.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration told the Supreme Court in February that it supports South Carolina's position, which is a break from the Biden administration. In the home care case, Biden's Justice Department told the Supreme Court in a footnote that the Medicaid provision at issue now would allow Americans to sue.\n\nSeveral of the court's liberal justices questioned an attorney representing the Trump administration about that switch. The justices generally frown on the Justice Department taking different positions from administration to administration, though it happens regularly.\n\nSouth Carolina has repeatedly lost its effort to defend the governor's order in court. A unanimous panel of the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Planned Parenthood most recently last year. But the state believes that the Supreme Court's decision in the nursing home case could strengthen its hand.\n\nReading a right to sue into the federal Medicaid law, South Carolina told the Supreme Court in written arguments, \"would undermine the relationship between the states and the federal government.\"\n\n\"The court has set a high bar for recognizing private rights in spending statutes,\" the state said, \"and the any-qualified-provider provision doesn't clear it.\"\n\nThis story has been updated following oral arguments.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "How conservatives use 'verbal jiu-jitsu' to turn liberals' language against them\n\nThe two frontrunners for the White House in 2024 are tied in a hypothetical rematch. Congress is paralyzed. Every big election seems to be decided by razor-thin margins.\n\nBy almost any measure, the struggle for political dominance in the US seems deadlocked between Republicans and Democrats. At times, the two parties resemble a pair of punch-drunk boxers, slugging away at one another in a contest that neither can end.\n\nBut there is one political battleground where Republicans triumph virtually every time - and control of this arena could determine who wins the White House in 2024.\n\nRepublicans are masters of verbal jiu-jitsu. It's a form of linguistic combat in which the practitioner takes a political phrase or concept popularized by their opponent and gradually turns into an unusable slur. Like the Japanese martial art known as jiu-jitsu, its devotees avoid taking opposing arguments head on and instead redirect their opponents' momentum to beat them.\n\nIf this sounds abstract, consider the evolution of \" woke.\" The word is defined as being \"actively aware of social injustice.\" But it has been transformed into a contemporary scourge , one that a politician compared to a \" virus more dangerous than any pandemic, hands down.\"\n\nMention almost any touchstone phrase adopted by the left in recent years - \"critical race theory,\" \"diversity,\" \"global warming,\" even the word \"liberal\" itself - and it has been redefined or tarnished by conservatives.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans continue to proudly use words and pet phrases such as \"family values,\" \"conservative\" and \"patriot\" - no matter who or what is associated with the terms.\n\nAs candidates prep for the first 2024 GOP presidential debate Wednesday in Milwaukee, it's a good time to ponder this question: Why are Republicans so  good at this form of verbal combat, and Democrats so bad?\n\nPart of the answer comes down to effort and discipline - Republicans devote more time to turning words into weapons and do a better job of sticking to their message, says Lindsey Cormack , a political scientist who focuses on race, gender, communications and politics at Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey.\n\n\"I've been studying their communications for 15 years and it sort of blows me away because I think Democrats are good at doing plenty of things, but they really dropped the ball on the communications piece a lot,\" Cormack says.\n\nCormack says conservatives have built a think-tank ecosystem of linguists and focus groups to test words and phrases for political battle . Democrats do some of the same, but with not the same level of commitment, she says.\n\n\"They (conservatives) think about what words resonate, what words cue other sorts of thoughts or what sort of images come to mind with people when they're hearing messages,\" Cormack says. \"They seem to have more invested in that, and they have more people who write about that sort of work and linguists who do these sorts of things for them.\"\n\nVerbal jiu-jitsu is not new in American politics. Conservatives have long employed it on racial issues. During the civil rights movement of the '50s and '60s, conservatives in both the Democratic and Republican parties often used a series of verbal feints that changed the direction of their opponent's moral arguments.\n\nThey didn't say they opposed integration; they said they were for \"state's rights.\"\n\nThey didn't say they didn't want their children sitting next to Black or brown kids when opposing desegregation of public schools; they said they were against \"forced busing.\"\n\nThey didn't say they opposed civil rights leaders' efforts to make the US a genuine multiracial democracy; they called those leaders \"communists\" or \"socialists.\"\n\nThey flipped the script by offering new words to replace other terms that were hard to attack head-on.\n\nSometimes they disarmed a liberal phrase by transforming its meaning .\n\n\"Social justice warrior,\" for example, didn't start off as an insult. What's wrong with someone fighting on behalf of the poor and exploited? Then the term was turned by conservatives and internet culture into something else: a \" whiny,\" self-righteous progressive who can't take a joke.\n\nRecent years have brought numerous headlines about another liberal term that has been dismantled by the right.\n\nCritical race theory was once an obscure academic discipline that insisted that racism is more than individual prejudice; it's embedded in laws, policies and institutions. But conservatives redirected the discussion and turned the term into a catchall phrase that criticizes virtually any examination of systemic racism or history that could make White people uncomfortable.\n\nWhatever the method, this form of verbal jiu-jitsu is used for one purpose, says Robin DiAngelo, author of \"White Fragility,\" a popular book that spawned another popular liberal catchphrase.\n\n\"The function is to silence the conversation and to protect the status quo,\" DiAngelo says. \"It doesn't have to make sense. It just has to work and get race off the table and prevent any challenges to the status quo.\"\n\nNext on the hit list are two other terms favored by liberals: \"diversity\" and \"equity,\" DiAngelo says.\n\nThose words originally meant values that were virtually universally accepted. Not many people would openly argue for exclusion or inequity.\n\nIn recent years many institutions have launched initiatives around Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) to make their workplaces more fair and diverse.\n\nBut Republican leaders are now comparing DEI initiatives to \"wokeness\" and \"loyalty oaths .\" They have introduced bills cutting DEI programs in public universities and corporate America.\n\nPaulette Granberry Russell, president of the National Association of Diversity Officers and Higher Education, recently told a reporter she doesn't use the acronym DEI anymore because it's been \" weaponized.\"\n\nRepublicans also have sought to reframe \"equity,\" which means \"being fair or impartial,\" by calling the word \"a \"mandate to discriminate.\" And they have attempted to delegitimize \"diversity\" by expanding the term to \" diversity industrial complex ,\" which a critic described as \"a bureaucratic juggernaut running roughshod over every aspect of national life.\"\n\n\"I'm going to tell you as somebody who's been in this work for decades, there's no diversity industrial complex,\" DiAngelo says. \"When an organization has a diversity program, there's often one person up against the entire institution. And they maybe have a staff of one or two people on a minimal budget. But using language like that implies that it's some kind of getting over on people, like it's some kind of trick.\"\n\nSome of the most skillful practitioners of verbal jiu-jitsu are able to disarm their opponents without them knowing that they've given ground. As a result, liberals eventually end up using the terms favored by their conservative opponents.\n\nThe phrase \"global warming\" was popularized by the media and some scientists in the 1980s. It's been virtually eliminated from public discourse by verbal jiu-jitsu. Some of that change is due to science. Some scientists believe climate change is a more accurate description of the environmental challenges facing the planet.\n\nBut it was Republicans who initially pushed for the name change, for reasons that had little to do with scientific accuracy. Instead of acknowledging the science pointing toward a looming environmental disaster, one Republican pollster offered another phrase to mute the alarm: climate change.\n\nThat term was popularized in part by Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster who advised GOP politicians in the early 2000s to stop using the term \"global warming\" because it had \"catastrophic connotations\" and reframe the issue as the more benign \"climate change.\" (Luntz has since disavowed his efforts to cast doubt on global warming.)\n\nTwo decades later , many liberal politicians and activists continue to use the phrase \"climate change, the cognitive scientist George Lakoff noted.\n\n\"The word 'climate' sounds nice - like palm trees or something - and the word 'change', well, 'change' just happens,\" Lakoff said in an interview . \"It's not a big deal. Nothing you can do about it. Not humanly caused. So, the term itself is a right-wing position that people on the left just innocently adopted instead of saying, well, this is a climate disaster that's approaching.\"\n\nLakoff, an authority on political language and author of \"Don't Think of an Elephant: Know Your Values and Frame the Debate,\" says Democrats consistently get outplayed by Republicans on the linguistic battleground because they make a false assumption about human nature.\n\n\"They assume all you have to do is tell people the facts and they will reason to the right conclusion,\" he said in another interview . \"This is utterly ridiculous. Thought is mainly metaphorical. The frames trump all the facts.\"\n\nTake the word liberal, which is defined as someone who is \"open-minded,\" \"tolerant,\" someone who believes in \"personal freedom\" and that society should change \"so that money, property and power are shared more fairly.\"\n\nBy the 1960s conservatives had successfully twisted liberalism's connotations to what one commentator described as a \"bureaucracy-loving, freedom-depriving, taxation-and-entitlement ideology of largesse.\"\n\nBut one famous Democrat knew better. He gave a master class in defeating attempts to tarnish him with the word \"liberal.\"\n\nJohn F. Kennedy met that perception head-on when he ran for president in 1960, in a speech at a New York hotel. Instead of dodging the label, Kennedy proudly embraced it.\n\n\"If by a 'liberal' they mean someone who looks ahead and not behind, someone who welcomes new ideas without rigid reactions,\" he said, \"someone who cares about the welfare of the people - their health, their housing, their schools, their jobs, their civil rights and their civil liberties... if that is what they mean by a 'liberal,' then I'm proud to say I'm a liberal.\"\n\nKennedy may have been a profile in linguistic courage, but many left-leaning people in recent decades still chose to call themselves \"progressives\" in subsequent decades after conservatives continued tarnishing the term.\n\nThe term, though, is making a comeback. Kennedy's lesson endures.\n\nDebates over the meaning of words and phrases may seem trivial given the high-stake political battles ahead. But the 2024 presidential election and former President Trump's looming court battles won't just be fought in the voting booth or in the courts - they'll also be fought on the verbal battlefield.\n\nIf that sounds like hyperbole, consider some momentous recent political battles around the meaning of words and phrases.\n\nWas what happened at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, an \"insurrection\"? Or was it what some GOP leaders have called \" legitimate political discourse \"?\n\nWas former President Trump exercising \" free speech \" when he questioned the 2020 presidential election results? Or did he attempt to \" defraud\" the US?\n\nAnd will words like \"diversity\" and \"inclusion\" be turned into another version of \"woke\" - terms so tarnished by relentless attacks that even their proponents are reluctant to use them?\n\nSome form of verbal jiu-jitsu may determine the answers to those questions. It's shaped the nation's history more than many people realize.\n\nJohn Blake is the author of \"More Than I Imagined: What a Black Man Discovered About the White Mother He Never Knew.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Conservatives are on a roll in their quest to remake America through the courts\n\nConservatives - despite their limited federal elected power - racked up another huge win in the great political battle of the early 21st century.\n\nThe Supreme Court's gutting of affirmative action in college admissions on Thursday toppled another pillar of America's liberal social infrastructure. Two more setbacks followed on Friday: the high court struck down the Biden administration's student loan forgiveness program and dealt a blow to LGBTQ rights when it sided with a Christian web designer in Colorado who refuses to create websites to celebrate same-sex weddings out of religious objections.\n\nDemocrats have had their successes over the last 20 years - including earlier this month with decisions ordering the redraw of Alabama's congressional map and rejecting a Trump-backed election law theory - but it often seems as though conservatives have the momentum.\n\nRepublicans only control one chamber of Congress, and narrowly so, while Democrats hold the White House and the Senate. And yet Thursday's ruling further weakened a core principle of Democratic politics that unites the party's presidents dating to Franklin Roosevelt - that the government should use its power to ease social injustices and lift up the disadvantaged. Civil rights advocates saw the decision as re-erecting barriers based on race that their forbears fought for decades to remove and a step back into tortured history.\n\nOriginalist conservatives, however - who argue that the text of the Constitution makes no consideration for prevailing social or racial realities - say justices upheld a core founding principle that everyone is created equal.\n\nRelated article John Roberts doesn't want race to matter as he ends affirmative action for college admission programs\n\nThe decision saying colleges can no longer take race into account as a specific basis for admissions - programs that advocates said had helped elevate underrepresented Black and Latino students in higher education - sent shockwaves across the country.\n\nIt was a generational decision comparable to another precedent-busting move a year ago, when the court's conservative majority took away the constitutional right to an abortion by throwing out the half-century-old, society-molding decision of Roe v. Wade.\n\nBoth rulings, and a flurry of other right-wing jurisprudence by the court's bold new majority - often on freedom of religion cases that please conservative Christians - are the product of decades of activism by the conservative judicial movement. Unlike liberals, right-wing legal activists prioritized the ideological reconfiguring of the high court as a litmus test in federal elections at all levels and fast-tracked cases on key issues through courts to exploit the Supreme Court's new makeup.\n\nNow, the nature of America itself is being remade in sweeping doses of conservative doctrine handed down in early summer morning bombshells each year.\n\nThe court's activism is being complimented by increasingly radical conservative legislatures in many states. Those bodies are reshaping laws in other areas - firearms regulations, for instance - often with the support of the judicial nominees of Republican presidents. Any future Republican president who also has a GOP Congress is likely to try to take advantage of the court's rightward march to pass laws on abortion and other issues that would further fundamentally change the nature of American life. One Republican presidential candidate, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, is pioneering an assault on transgender rights and the teaching of sexuality in schools that he has vowed to replicate nationwide if he wins the White House.\n\nRepublicans - as seen in the reaction to Thursday's decision - argue that the court is merely dismantling what they see as an aberrant set of laws and jurisprudence that it itself contradicts everything for which they believe America stands. They are embracing, for instance, Justice Clarence Thomas' concurrence in the majority opinion in the affirmative action decision that argued that \"racialism simply cannot be un-done by different or more racialism\" to benefit minorities since it would contradict the constitutional principle that everyone is born equal.\n\n\"Today's decision, in combination with Dobbs, serve as a triumphant return to restoring our tattered Constitution,\" Conservative Political Action Coalition chairman Matt Schlapp said in a statement.\n\nCritics of the decision argue that the Thomas position perversely ignores the reality of a nation where racial discrimination and the inequality of opportunity still run deep.\n\nThe affirmative action and Dobbs decisions recall another early summer moment, in 2015, when it appeared that the country was heading in an opposite direction. The Supreme Court ruled that June that same-sex couples could marry in all 50 states and upheld the Affordable Care Act .\n\nAt the time, it seemed as though political and social conventions were being swept away in a validation of the grassroots change that then-President Barack Obama had championed.\n\n\"Sometimes, there are days like this, when that slow, steady effort is rewarded with justice that arrives like a thunderbolt,\" Obama said, referring to the legalization of same-sex marriage.\n\nEight years on, the thunderbolts are flying in a more reactionary direction. And President Joe Biden's view of the conservative majority on the bench could hardly be more dark.\n\n\"This is not a normal court,\" Biden said.\n\nThe comparison between two banner moments for the liberal and conservative movements helps explain a major theme of modern American politics: the clash between a more diverse, socially liberal and sometimes more secular society embodied by Obama/Bidenism and the backlash engineered by ex-President Donald Trump and conservatives, who believe that such social progress represents an existential threat to their beliefs.\n\nIt plays into the idea that the country is increasingly split between Democratic and Republican bastions. The divide lives on a national map but is also especially pronounced within states ideologically separated between liberal urban areas and conservative rural regions. Recent clashes over race and gun politics between liberal lawmakers and conservative majorities in state legislatures like Tennessee's, for example, have exemplified this split.\n\nBoth sides of the political aisle raise the fear that America is in danger of being destroyed. But it is especially pronounced among the Republican base.\n\nIn recent years, the party's blind loyalty to Trump's radicalism - especially his election lies - has caused it to even challenge the structure of democracy. A sense of national crisis and imminent political extinction, for example, ran through Trump's rhetoric in the aftermath of the 2020 election, prompting some of his followers to use violence as a way of settling their political grievances on January 6, 2021.\n\nConservative Supreme Court decisions over the last two years have been especially hard for liberals to accept because they believe that the current majority is ill gotten.\n\nThe right's dominance of the court happened in large part because then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to even grant a confirmation hearing to Obama's final pick for the top bench, Merrick Garland, who now serves as attorney general in the Biden administration. This allowed Trump to name Justice Neil Gorsuch as his first Supreme Court nominee in 2017. But McConnell later turned his back on his own questionable principle that Supreme Court nominees should not be elevated in an election year by rushing through the confirmation of Trump's final pick, Amy Coney Barrett, in 2020 - which enshrined the current 6-3 conservative majority.\n\nThe move not only confirmed Trump's status as a consequential president whose influence will be felt decades after he left office. It cemented McConnell among the ranks of the most significant Republican Party figures in decades and ensured conservative policies will endure even under Democratic presidencies and congressional majorities.\n\nRecent revelations about questionable ethics practices by some of the conservative justices have further fueled fury about the legitimacy of the court among liberals.\n\nBut not all of the court's recent decisions have infuriated the White House and Democrats. Earlier this week, for instance, liberals were hugely relieved when the court rejected a long-dormant legal theory that held that state courts and other state entities have a limited role in reviewing election rules established by state legislatures when it comes to federal elections. The so-called Independent State Legislature Theory , a favorite of the Trump campaign, had led to fears that Republican state legislatures in some states could simply decide how to allocate electoral votes regardless of results.\n\nStill, the broad trajectory of the court - on issues including gun control, race, business, regulation, climate and many other issues - is firmly to the right.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Veteran legal conservatives rush to Justice Barrett's defense amid MAGA backlash\n\nProminent legal conservatives on Friday sought to tamp down a wave of sudden criticism directed at Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett over her vote to reject President Donald Trump 's attempt to freeze nearly $2 billion in foreign aid.\n\nBarrett, a former appeals court judge and law professor who Trump placed on the bench during his first term, joined Chief Justice John Roberts and the court's three liberals in upholding - for now - a lower court ruling that required the administration to quickly spend the contested aid.\n\nThe backlash over that decision from some Trump allies was swift, with one prominent conservative describing Barrett on a podcast as a \"rattled law professor with her head up her a**.\" Others took to social media to describe her as a \"DEI hire\" and \"evil.\"\n\nTrump has scored many significant wins on a court that is the most conservative it has been in decades, with six of nine justices nominated by Republican presidents, including three Trump himself picked. But he's also regularly lost , including with the first two emergency appeals to reach the high court in his second term.\n\nSeveral well-known conservatives who for years have sought to push the law to the right told CNN that the criticism was an overreaction to a relatively modest ruling that simply kept the fight over foreign aid percolating in lower federal courts. The majority did not indicate how it would vote in the likely event that the case makes it back to the Supreme Court - possibly in a few weeks.\n\nThe reaction appeared to be at least partly a response to a sharply worded dissent from Justice Samuel Alito who accused a lower court that sided against Trump of \"judicial hubris.\" Three other conservatives - Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh - joined that opinion.\n\nLeonard Leo, a prominent conservative legal advocate and board co-chairman of the influential Federalist Society, told CNN he felt that Alito's dissent was \"persuasive\" and that the stalwart conservative and former prosecutor \"had the better argument.\"\n\nBut, Leo added, \"that doesn't mean that Justice Barrett isn't among the most distinguished conservative jurists of the past 100 years.\"\n\n\"She's been in the vanguard of conservative jurisprudence on abortion, racial preferences, the administrative state, religious freedom, Trump immunity, guns and the Second Amendment,\" said Leo, who advised Trump on Supreme Court nominees during the president's first term.\n\nThe quarrel in the foreign aid spending case, he said, was \"a procedural disagreement - and those things happen quite often among conservative justices.\"\n\nEd Whelan, a conservative legal commentator, described Barrett as \"an outstanding justice\" and said the \"criticisms of her are myopic.\"\n\nBarrett was viewed as a hero to the conservative legal movement just a few years ago. Weeks after taking her seat, the court shifted positions in a series of emergency cases dealing with how Covid-19 crowd restrictions applied to churches and synagogues. Before liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, the court upheld those restrictions. Once Barrett was in place, it began striking most of them down.\n\nA little more than a year later, Barrett joined her conservative colleagues in overturning Roe v. Wade and significantly expanding Americans' rights under the Second Amendment.\n\nLast summer, she was one of six justices who voted to grant Trump sweeping immunity from criminal prosecution for official actions - though she did write a concurring opinion suggesting she thought the case could have been decided more narrowly in Trump's favor.\n\nBarrett voted with the court's two most conservative justices - Thomas and Alito - more than 80% of the time in the term that ended last year, according to data compiled by the Empirical SCOTUS blog . She was slightly more likely to side with Roberts and Kavanaugh, two conservatives who are often viewed as sitting at the court's ideological center. Roberts in particular has also faced sharp scorn from the right in recent years, even though he remains a reliable vote for conservative outcomes.\n\nBy comparison, Barrett voted with Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the court's senior liberal, less than 70% of the time.\n\nBoth during oral arguments and in her opinions, Barrett often displays a penchant for delving into procedural issues. Among the conservative wing, she has appeared the most concerned about use of the court's emergency docket to decide sweeping questions with national implications.\n\nIn one of the court's first significant early opinions this year, Barrett joined a mix of liberals and conservatives in backing a death row inmate in Oklahoma who the Republican attorney general said was entitled to a new trial in light of withheld evidence. But she moved to the right of Kavanaugh and Roberts in that case, saying that she would have sent the matter back to a lower court for further consideration rather than throwing out the conviction.\n\nBut there have other recent examples in which Barrett has veered to the left. Barrett, joined by three liberals, partially dissented in a decision Tuesday about the Environmental Protection Agency's ability to police sewage that can flow into the Pacific Ocean after San Francisco experiences heavy rainstorms.\n\nHiram Sasser, executive general counsel for First Liberty Institute, a group that has brought successful religious appeals to the Supreme Court, noted that the foreign aid case was in a very preliminary posture.\n\n\"It's hard to read into procedural decisions where someone is going to be on the substantive part of the issue,\" Sasser told CNN.\n\nSasser recalled that his group suffered an initial setback at the Supreme Court when it was representing Joe Kennedy, a high school football coach who lost his job after leading prayers on the 50-yard line after games. The court initially turned away Kennedy's appeal.\n\nIn 2022, when the case was ultimately decided, Kennedy won with a 6-3 majority that included both Barrett and Roberts.\n\n\"We overturned a 50-year-old precedent in a landmark win, but it started off with what was a technical, procedural loss,\" he said. \"I wouldn't forecast anything other than what President Trump just learned is exactly what we learned in the Coach Kennedy case: He's got four votes.\"\n\nThat means to get a majority, Sasser noted, Trump \"only needs one more.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Supreme Court conservatives signal willingness to roll back the power of federal agencies\n\nFollow:\n\nThe Supreme Court's conservative supermajority spent several hours Wednesday attacking a longstanding legal doctrine that gives federal agencies wide latitude to create policies and regulations in various areas of life.\n\nThe justices heard two cases concerning the so-called Chevron deference, which emerged from a 1984 case. Oral arguments in the first case went well beyond the allotted hour, with the conservatives signaling their willingness to overturn the decades-old case and their liberal colleagues sounding the alarm on how such a reversal would upend how the federal government enforces all kinds of regulations.\n\nNeil Gorsuch has a grudge against federal agencies. He holds their fate in his hands\n\nCongress routinely writes open-ended, ambiguous laws that leave the policy details to agency officials. The Chevron deference stipulates that when disputes arise over regulation of an ambiguous law, judges should defer to agency interpretations, as long as the interpretations are reasonable.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch , a conservative who has long expressed misgivings about the Chevron deference, at one point boiled his understanding of the doctrine down to one simple outcome when courts examine ambiguous statutes under its terms: \"The government always wins.\"\n\n\"Chevron is exploited against the individual and in favor of the government,\" Gorsuch said, arguing that the doctrine allows agencies to win disputes brought against them by Social Security Disability applicants or veterans seeking benefits.\n\n\"I didn't see a case cited - and perhaps I missed one - where Chevron wound up benefiting those kinds of peoples,\" he said. \"And it seems to me that it's arguable - and certainly the other side makes this argument powerfully - that Chevron has this disparate impact on different classes of persons.\"\n\nIt's not always possible to determine how the court will rule based on what unfolded at oral arguments, but given the court's posture on Wednesday, supporters of Chevron have good reason to believe the doctrine faces a real threat at the high court.\n\nAs the liberals on the bench peppered Roman Martinez, an attorney for one of the fisheries, with questions about how federal agencies would proceed with policymaking should the Chevron deference be axed by the court, Chief Justice John Roberts instead wondered how much the doctrine still mattered in the federal court system.\n\n\"I saw some study that said we haven't relied on Chevron for 14 years,\" he told Martinez. \"Judges are used to deciding things and when they get around to doing it they tend to think what they've come up with is not only the best answer, but it's the only answer. I just wonder how often this comes up.\"\n\nMartinez said that although Roberts' court \"hasn't relied on Chevron since 2016,\" lower courts still have to use it to navigate tricky cases concerning agency power, including, he noted, the two heard on Wednesday.\n\n\"The reason that the problem is there is because you've told lower courts how to do their interpretation and as long as that instruction is out there, there are going to be a lot of cases that get it wrong and you're not going to want to be in the business of sort of error correction on each one,\" he added later.\n\nThe three liberal justices warned during Wednesday's pair of arguments that overturning the 1984 decision in Chevron would force courts to make policy decisions that they argue are better left for experts employed by federal agencies.\n\n\"I see Chevron as doing the very important work of helping courts stay away from policymaking,\" Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said, adding later: \"I'm worried about the courts becoming über legislators.\"\n\nFellow liberal Justice Elena Kagan, who took the lead in pressing Chevron's challengers over their position, stressed that federal judges were not equipped to make decisions in some complex areas, offering artificial intelligence as one place she thought experts, not judges, should be making critical policy decisions.\n\n\"Congress knows that this court and lower courts are not competent with respect to deciding all the questions about AI that are going to come up in the future. And what Congress wants is, we presume, for people who actually know about AI to decide those questions,\" she said. \"We don't even know what the questions are about AI, let alone the answers to them.\"\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who argued in defense of Chevron in both cases heard Wednesday, similarly warned of the \"instability\" in US law that would be unleashed if the court decides to do away with the doctrine.\n\n\"Overruling Chevron,\" she told the justices, \"would be an even greater and unwarranted shock to the legal system.\"\n\nAt various points on Wednesday, Justice Amy Coney Barrett raised concerns about the fate of past cases in which judges applied the Chevron doctrine and eventually deferred to an agency's interpretation of a statute when it created a new policy if the court overturns the 1984 case.\n\n\"Isn't it inviting a flood of litigation, even if for the moment those holdings stay intact?\" she asked Martinez.\n\n\"I think it's true that people could come and say, 'look, the interpretive methods have changed since this bottom-line holding was issued. And we think that that, you know, a different result now should apply.' And that's why courts consider requests to overturn precedent,\" he replied.\n\nThe conservative justice later posed a similar question to Paul Clement, an attorney representing the fishery in the other case, asking what he thought about \"the disruptive consequences of overruling (Chevron).\"\n\nNotably, the Atlantic fishery litigants at the center of the disputes didn't dominate the arguments on Wednesday. Instead, the justices focused largely on the straightforward question before them: whether they should overturn Chevron.\n\nThe pair of cases test a National Marine Fisheries Service mandate that the fishing vessels pay the cost of certain onboard observers who monitor catches. The two fisheries claim the agency lacked authority to force vessel owners to pay for third-party monitoring services.\n\n\"I think what we really care about is prospectively, both with respect to the fishing regulation here, but also with respect to other cases that come forward to the courts, making sure that courts are the ones doing the interpreting and not agencies,\" Martinez told the justices.\n\nAnd, in a quirky twist, Justice Gorsuch's late mother, Anne Gorsuch, was brought up early on by Martinez.\n\nThe court's 1984 ruling in Chevron grew out of challenges to Environmental Protection Agency policy regarding \"stationary sources\" of air pollution (such as factories and power plants) under then-administrator Anne Gorsuch.\n\nAs Kagan asked the attorney about various scenarios involving a court's deference to agency interpretation of a law, she raised the facts of the Chevron case, saying: \"Is a 'stationary source' in the Clean Air Act - does it refer to whole plants or to each pollution-emitting device within the plant?\"\n\n\"We think that the decision in Chevron was ... reflected the best interpretation, with much respect to Justice Gorsuch's mother's EPA,\" Martinez replied. \"We think that that was the best interpretation.\"\n\nCNN's Joan Biskupic contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "American conservatives embrace Hungary's authoritarian leader at Budapest conference\n\nFollow:\n\nAt a conference center plastered with slogans like \"Let's drain the swamp,\" Republican after Republican endorsed harsh immigration policies, crackdowns on LGBTQ rights, and a battle against \"woke ideology.\"\n\nThe scene could have been any recent GOP event - except it was taking place roughly 4,000 miles away from the US at the Conservative Political Action Conference's third annual gathering in Hungary.\n\nThe visiting GOP dignitaries' praise for Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and his authoritarian government showed how the small central European country has become an unlikely model for a potential Trump second term - despite what international observers have described as an alarming backsliding of democratic rights.\n\nThe American right's growing embrace of Orbán builds upon millions of dollars that his government has spent on lobbying in the US, and new connections between Hungarian and American conservative think tanks.\n\nRelated video Time Magazine: Trump says he was too nice during first term\n\nIn his opening speech at the CPAC conference in Budapest last week, Orbán endorsed former President Donald Trump's reelection bid and painted this year's elections in the US and European Union in militaristic terms.\n\n\"Make America great again, make Europe great again!\" Orbán declared in English, before continuing in Hungarian: \"Go Donald Trump! Go European sovereigntists! Let us saddle up, don our armor, take to the battlefield and let the electoral battle begin.\"\n\nTrump, who hosted the Hungarian leader at his Mar-a-Lago resort in March, sent a pre-recorded video message to the conference that echoed similar themes. The former president called Orbán \"a great man\" and hailed \"so many patriots in Hungary who are proudly fighting on the frontlines of the battle to rescue Western civilization.\"\n\nThe bromance between the two leaders comes as some Trump allies are turning to the Orbán playbook as they plan for his potential return to the White House. In his own video message, Trump confidant Steve Bannon described Hungary as \"an inspiration to the world\" and called Orbán \"one of my heroes in the world today, in addition to President Trump.\"\n\nAfter Trump's loss in 2020, \"American conservatives started to look for what would be a successful conservative governing agenda,\" said Gladden Pappin, a conservative political theorist who moved from Dallas to Budapest and now leads the Hungarian Institute of International Affairs, a state-run research organization. \"When American conservatives look to Hungary, they see a prime minister in a government that actually delivered on the slogans that they promised.\"\n\nOver his 14 years in power, Orbán has transformed Hungary into a laboratory for conservative policies and eroded democratic rights and civil society protections, according to his critics and European Union officials.\n\nOrbán has centralized power by dismissing judges, changing election rules to favor his party, cracking down on NGO's and appointing loyalists to key institutions. His government built a fence along the country's southern border amid a migrant crisis in 2015 and passed stricter immigration policies. It tightened its grip on state media, reducing space for dissent.\n\nThe prime minister has also promoted a Christian nationalist view of Hungarian society, passing laws restricting transgender rights and adoption by same-sex couples, redefining marriage in the constitution to only cover unions between a man and a woman, and banning materials related to LGBTQ issues in schools.\n\nThose are policies that some Trump allies would love to see him adopt if he returns to the White House next year. (Trump himself has previously called same-sex marriage settled law.)\n\nOrbán's policy platform \"shows you what the recipe is for maintaining your national identity in a conservative way,\" Pappin said in an interview. \"Conservative politicians in America had this negative mindset toward government. They need to think about how to use government,\" as Orbán has done.\n\nThe rhetoric on display at CPAC Hungary - a branch of the decades-running political confab in the US - showed that the American right is increasingly onboard with that idea. Conservatives from around the US, Europe and beyond traveled to Budapest for the two-day event, which was organized by a Hungarian government-funded think tank.\n\nThe meetings and speeches took place at a conference center inside a sprawling park on the west bank of the Danube River. The venue featured posters with English slogans that would have been right at home at a Trump rally, like \"Let's drain the swamp!\" and \"We win, they lose.\" At least one attendee wore a shirt emblazoned with Trump and Orbán's faces that declared the two leaders \"saviors of the world.\"\n\nSecurity guards told reporters to stop filming in the park and organizers denied CNN's request to attend the conference, writing in an email that the venue was \"a NO WOKE ZONE.\"\n\n\"We look forward to welcoming you to future events when and if your organization becomes significantly less woke,\" the email read. Several other independent news outlets received similar denials.\n\nThree Republican members of Congress spoke at the conference, and prominent GOP figures including Bannon, Arizona Senate candidate Kari Lake, and Trump's former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows sent video messages that were played for attendees.\n\nThe Republicans lauded Orbán despite his authoritarian bent. Lake gushed about how her experience meeting the prime minister \"changed my life.\" Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland said that \"Hungary has become one of the most successful models as a leader for conservative principles and governance.\"\n\n\"Hungary's immigration policy should serve as a model to the United States in terms of border, border security and immigration enforcement,\" said Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona. \"I hope and pray one day that the United States might take a similar prioritization to the safety and security of its citizens.\"\n\nHosting CPAC is just one example of how Orbán and his allies have worked to build ties with conservatives in the US. Since Orbán became Hungary's prime minister in 2010, his government has paid American lobbyists at least $4.4 million, according to a CNN review of disclosures filed with the Department of Justice. The lobbyists met members of Congress, pitched Hungary's economy and strict border policies, and coordinated appearances by Hungarian officials in right-wing US media, the filings show.\n\nMore recently, pro-Orbán groups have also made connections that aren't reported as foreign lobbying. According to documents obtained by the Southern Poverty Law Center, a Hungarian government-funded foundation has paid grants to American conservative writers and activists like Christopher Rufo, who inspired the right's movement against \"critical race theory\" in schools.\n\nRelated video Trump says he should be on the campaign trail instead of in court. Hear where he is on his off days\n\nTwo American nonprofits that are actively planning policies for a second Trump term have shown an interest in Hungary and Orbán's model. The Heritage Foundation, which has released a 900-plus-page policy roadmap called \"Project 2025,\" and the America First Policy Institute, another nonprofit that is working to prepare for a second Trump term, have both partnered with think tanks that receive funding from the Hungarian government.\n\nThe collaborations include visits to Hungary by researchers from the pro-Trump groups to learn about its policies. István Kiss, the executive director of the Orbán-linked Danube Institute, told a Hungarian publication that the partnerships showed the interest that American conservatives had in his country and suggested that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' policies limiting the discussion of LGBTQ issues in schools was inspired by the Orbán government.\n\n\"Hungary has become the beacon of what it would be like if Trumpists ruled the world,\" said Princeton sociologist Kim Lane Scheppele, an expert in Hungarian politics. Orbán, she said, \"wants a friendly government that won't demand that Hungary become a democracy again.\"\n\nIn Budapest, critics of Orbán's regime argued in interviews with CNN that Americans should see Hungary as a warning sign - not a model to emulate.\n\nZsuzsanna Szelényi, who was once a member of Orbán's political party but broke with him and now works at a pro-democracy group, said that the policies the prime minister is pushing have stripped away Hungarians' fundamental rights.\n\n\"Democracy means there is a fair competition of political forces to get into power,\" Szelényi said. \"This we do not have.\"\n\nOrbán has pushed rhetoric about LGBTQ issues and migrants to avoid talking about \"the problems with our hospitals, the problems of our social care services, the problems of the teachers, the problems of all of these essential institutions of the country, which are in a deep, deep trouble right now,\" said Márton Gulyás , a left-leaning political commentator who runs a popular YouTube channel.\n\nBut some of the American conservatives who flew into the country for CPAC seemed more focused on the optics of Budapest than on democratic rights. Right-wing influencers strode the banks of the Danube and marveled at what Joey Mannarino, a conservative political strategist who attended the conference, described in a social media video as an apparent absence of homelessness and crime.\n\n\"We need to figure out whatever this country did,\" he declared, \"and we need to get it back.\"\n\nKyung Lah and Anna-Maja Rappard reported from Budapest, Casey Tolan from New York and Curt Devine from Washington.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

We follow the law and guidance from our regulators and have long said there are problems with the current framework Washington must address.\"\n\nTrump's comment came after Brian Moynihan , Bank of America's CEO, asked how the Trump administration would prioritize GDP growth and reducing inflation amid his dozens of executive orders .\n\nTrump responded that his executive orders would do just that while encouraging companies to move in. He said he would work to bring the corporate tax rate down to 15% from 21%, provided companies manufacture their products in the US.\n\nTrump's pushback comes after debates have accelerated surrounding debanking , or closing the accounts of people who are thought to pose a risk to the bank, such as money laundering or corruption. Senate Banking Chair Tim Scott is leading organization efforts on an upcoming debanking hearing .\n\nThe debanking debate goes back to the Obama administration, during which the so-called \" Operation Choke Point \" discouraged banks from engaging with payday lenders and gun sellers. In 2022, a banking regulator asked banks to pause \"crypto asset-related activity.\"\n\nState attorneys general in 2024 alleged major banks canceled accounts of people with conservative views. Last April, Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach accused Bank of America of canceling accounts of gun manufacturers, Immigration and Customs Enforcement contractors, and Christian ministry groups.\n\n\"Bank of America's practice of cancelling the bank accounts of conservatives and even turning over information about customer's purchases to federal law enforcement undermines free speech, religious freedom and the right to privacy,\" Kobach said in the letter. \"It's discriminatory and likely illegal. As state attorneys general, we will vigorously defend the constitutional rights of all Americans when they are threatened by big business.\"\n\nBank of America responded at the time that de-banking accounts sometimes happens when they fail to verify some documents or change an account's stated purpose.\n\n\"We would like to provide clarity around a very straightforward matter: Religious beliefs or political view-based beliefs are never a factor in any decisions related to our client's accounts,\" the bank wrote at the time.\n\nVenture capitalist Marc Andreessen also said on Joe Rogan's podcast that 30 tech and crypto founders have said their companies were cut off by banking regulators during the Biden administration.\n\nOn JPMorgan Chase's \" The Unshakeables \" podcast released on January 21, chair and CEO Jamie Dimon said of debanking, \"There should be far cleaner lines about what we have to do, and we don't have to do.\" He added, \"We need to fix it.\"\n\nJump to"

      "text": "I'm a liberal who moved to a conservative town - here are the most shocking things I discovered about how conservatives see the world\n\nI still vividly remember the political \"conflict\" my household experienced during the 2007 Democratic presidential primary season.\n\nI loved Barack Obama, my dad liked John Edwards, and my mom adored Hillary Clinton.\n\nThis dispute was indicative of my upbringing: I grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina, an urban, blue district within a purple state, and in a hyper-liberal household to boot.\n\nSo it was with much hesitation that I accepted my first job out of college as a newspaper reporter in Hall County, Georgia, one of the reddest counties within a red state - and not because of rampant University of Georgia fandom.\n\nAs the hometown of former two-term GOP Gov. Nathan Deal, Hall County is a particularly interesting slice of red-state politics, especially because of its growing diversity .\n\nRelated: I'm a conservative who moved to a liberal city, and I was surprised to see my views change on several issues\n\nDuring my time there, I found my views challenged in several ways, and I was shocked by some of the aspects of the political culture there. By the end, I understood where conservatives are coming from on divisive issues like guns and healthcare, even if I didn't agree with them.\n\nThese were the things I learned as a political junkie cast from a liberal haven to an uber-conservative small town in Georgia.\n\nI resigned myself to saving my energy when it came to debating the ease with which Americans can get guns as a political issue after living in Gainesville, Georgia.\n\nWhy? Because I saw how unbelievably emotionally attached the vast majority of gun owners - even across the political spectrum - are to their guns.\n\nBefore moving to Hall County, I had never in my entire life, beyond cops, been in the vicinity of a handgun, much less shot one. My editors, on the other hand, were so shocked that I had never pulled the trigger of a firearm that they insisted I do just that for a story.\n\nSo I shot my first gun ever as part of a sidebar to an article about skyrocketing gun sales in town in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut.\n\nAnd in all honesty, I felt the same way after shooting a gun as I tend to feel after yoga: relaxed and great. Probably because I was essentially standing in Warrior One position while mindfully breathing.\n\nWriting this, I even Googled if others had shared this view about similarities between yoga and shooting a gun. Instead, I found articles about a 2018 mass shooting at a Florida yoga studio.\n\nThat was pretty depressing.\n\nI now see the gun-control issue as wholly irreconcilable and have tried to focus my political energy toward other issues.\n\nLiving in small-town Georgia made me realize something about the national healthcare debate that I had misconceived before.\n\nBefore, I assumed conservatives thought that when it came to healthcare, the government should never mess with private markets. Instead, I learned that conservatives just want the federal government to stay out of healthcare.\n\nState intervention, on the other hand, is still up for debate.\n\nThis was once made especially clear to me when a legislator explained his outrage that health insurers were willing to cover only certain types of chemotherapy and not others. His solution was to pass a law mandating insurance companies to cover all forms of chemotherapy in the state.\n\nI thought this was a curious stance, given his steadfast opposition to Obamacare, a hallmark of which are mandates requiring insurers to cover more procedures and people than they might otherwise care to.\n\nBut I realized that this stance came down to a distrust of federal intervention - not a blind trust in the profit-first mindset of private insurance companies.\n\nI still think it's wrong for states like Georgia and others to refuse federal funds that would expand access to Medicaid for hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nBut at least I see now that there are more guiding principles driving their decision-making, and not a petty desire to undermine Obamacare.\n\nBusinesses definitely felt empowered to express their views on several political issues, given how deeply conservative the area was.\n\nThere was a Subway close to the courthouse that I went to often. I remember one day a printed sign appeared taped to the clear case enclosing the toppings station. The sign was offering an apology for the new upcharge to add cheese to a sandwich - thanking Obama and the Affordable Care Act for the increase.\n\nIn addition to being a funny instance of the \"Thanks, Obama\" meme before it took off , it struck me as something that would be framed differently in a more liberal ZIP code.\n\nThere is a perception that in the South, particularly in the small towns, everyone walks around being openly racist.\n\nNot to make excuses, but in reality you see less of the sort of brazen racism and xenophobia than you might expect given media portrayals of the region.\n\nA lot of that is the product of diversity. If you grew up in Gainesville, Georgia, the people you sat next to in school, work with, have your hair cut by, were coached by - the list goes on - are way more likely to be people of another race than they would be in many liberal enclaves.\n\nThat doesn't mean there wasn't racism at all. But there was a widespread belief that institutions didn't cause, and were powerless to stop, the racism and inequality that was rampant in Gainesville.\n\nThis was especially true in my area of coverage at the newspaper, the courts. Juries were disproportionately white and defendants were not, mandatory minimum sentences are enormously high in Georgia, and the public defenders' offices are overworked and underpaid.\n\nI will never forget witnessing a judge matter-of-factly stating in open court - though not in front of the jury - that he couldn't imagine that a person would knowingly sleep with a person with HIV, even if they were being treated.\n\nThe case involved a woman who was ultimately convicted of felony reckless conduct by a person with HIV .\n\nI'm pretty sure that sort of statement would be swiftly condemned in other ZIP codes, given what we know about HIV transmission rates . But in that Superior Court courtroom, the declaration was seen as fairly benign.\n\nJudges in my town rarely faced opposition in elections and therefore could state their opinions pretty plainly - as, for the most part, could the county's all-Republican legislators, who rarely if ever faced a primary challenger.\n\nI had a fantastic dentist while I lived in Hall County. He also happened to be a Republican legislator.\n\nGeorgia, by state constitutional mandate, caps the number of days its legislators can serve. That means more people with day jobs end up in the Georgia House and Senate than you typically see, since the representatives don't have to forfeit their careers to accommodate the time commitment.\n\nThere's a particular benefit to this that I think the framers of the Constitution would approve of: There's little time for big changes. The vast majority of time in session instead has to be spent hammering out the budget.\n\nBut every so often, a highly controversial bill unrelated to the budget squeezes its way through. This year, that bill was a harsh, sweeping abortion bill .\n\nI was once assigned to cover a fundraiser for a pro-life group, as many local leaders and politicians would be in attendance.\n\nAt the end of the night, right before it was time to turn in donations, a clip from Steven Spielberg's Holocaust movie \"Schindler's List\" was played as a way to stir emotions and bigger checks - specifically, the scene where an anguished Schindler, filled with regret, says he wishes he had sold all his belongings to fund saving more lives.\n\nEvery liberal I tell this story to finds that move in extremely bad taste, so much that they kind of miss my point of the story: To the people at that fundraiser, playing that clip wasn't in bad taste, because to them, an abortion prevented is equivalent to a literal life saved.\n\nSo these days, if I'm ever in a discussion about the issue, I like to emphasize that abortion rates tend to be the same regardless of its legality . Yes, I believe in the inherent right of a woman to be in control of her healthcare. But I learned that you won't convince a conservative that women have the inherent right to do what, in their minds, constitutes murder.\n\nIn Gainesville, there was a statue of a Confederate general, James Longstreet. Many buildings were also named after him too.\n\nYet Longstreet's legacy was accepting Confederate defeat, favoring Reconstruction, and converting to the Republican Party after the Civil War.\n\nFor that very reason, his legacy was erased in much else of the South , save for his adopted hometown of Gainesville.\n\nI learned that people in small towns don't feel FOMO over not living in a bustling, large city. Not in the least.\n\nIn fact, whenever I would mention that I was taking a trip to Atlanta, people would often ask why, and throw in qualifiers like \"Why? Do you need to expedite your passport?\"\n\nWhile I felt like I was constantly missing out by not being in such a vibrant cultural and commercial hub, for most folks, the idea of spending time in Atlanta was downright unappealing.\n\nOn my first day on the job, my coworkers and I had to evacuate the newspaper building because of a bomb threat accusing the newspaper of being overtly pro-Obama.\n\nThis by no means was true. But I did learn this truth that day: The liberal-media myth is alive and well in small-town Georgia. Even when it comes to the local paper.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Scientists have discovered two simple psychological differences that make you liberal or conservative\n\nPolitical battles in the US are often portrayed as a clash between \"bleeding heart\" liberals and \"pull yourself up by your bootstraps\" conservatives.\n\nVoters who favor opposing parties see various issues differently, but does that mean liberals and conservatives actually process the world through different emotional lenses?\n\nScientists are beginning to zero in on a few key differences in the ways that people on opposite ends of the political spectrum react to stimuli. A handful of new studies, some still under review, explore some of the subtly different ways that socially conservative and liberal voters respond to images and think about their friends and family.\n\nA study published in the journal Behavioural Brain Research in January suggests that you might be able to tell whether someone is liberal or conservative simply by the way they react to pictures of gross things like blood, feces or vomit.\n\nThe authors found that socially conservative students will physically look away from \"disgusting\" images more quickly than their liberal peers (but the same didn't hold true for people with fiscally conservative beliefs). The self-reported social conservatives also stared longer at images of faces reacting in disgust to that same potentially pathogenic stuff.\n\nThe trend didn't hold up for sad or scary scenes, though - there were no notable differences in how people reacted to those based on their political ideology.\n\nFor years, social scientists have known that conservatives tend to be more easily grossed out. President Trump, a well-known germaphobe who once advocated for banning the handshake, is perhaps a prime example. There's also evidence that the areas of the brain that process and express fear are more active in conservative voters, which might make them more likely to quickly turn away from something that could make them sick.\n\nResearch has also shown that self-identified conservative thinkers may be more hostile to what social scientists call \"outgroups\": people (or animals) that don't come from the places they do or think like them. That trait may be tied to the tendency to get disgusted more easily - if you're more likely to turn away from a foreign pathogen, you're probably also more likely to be averse to unfamiliar groups.\n\n\" Conservatives, in their tendencies toward closure, order, and stability should expend empathy toward smaller, more well-defined, and less permeable social circles,\" Psychologists Adam Waytz, Jesse Graham, and their colleagues wrote in the 2016 book \"Social Psychology of Political Polarization.\"\n\n\"Liberals, in their tendencies toward openness, tolerance for ambiguity, and desire for change, should seek larger, less well-defined, and more permeable social circles,\" they said.\n\nNew research on compassion is de-bunking the myth that liberal voters might inherently be more empathetic and kind-hearted people than conservatives. In fact, previous studies have shown that conservatives and liberals are equally generous with their money and their time, they just dole it out in different ways.\n\nSome of Waytz's forthcoming research provides even more evidence that conservatives can be just as compassionate as liberals. His findings suggest that conservatives are simply more likely to extend that empathy only to their kin.\n\nIn an unpublished study , participants first indicated whether they considered themselves \"very conservative\" or \"very liberal\"on a scale from 1 to 7. Then they were asked to report how empathetic they felt towards different groups. Conservatives tended to agree with statements like \"I often have tender, concerned feelings for my family members who are less fortunate than me.\"\n\nThe liberal study subjects more frequently reported feeling that same tenderness toward less fortunate people in general, beyond those in their own families.\n\nConservatives were also more likely to tell the researchers that they had more empathy for family members over friends, endorsed their fellow countrymen over foreigners, and took the side of humans over non-human subjects.\n\nThis research suggests anyone's heart can \"bleed\"; conservatives just might be a little more selective about who they'll bleed for. And they might not want to look at that blood.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "16 times musicians have faced backlash from conservatives over their music\n\n\"Rainbowland\" was originally released in 2017 as the third track on Miley Cyrus' sixth album \"Younger Now.\"\n\nThe song is a celebration of acceptance and individuality; Cyrus, who identifies as pansexual , duets with her godmother about a world \"where we're free to be exactly who we are.\"\n\nBut when a first-grade class in Wisconsin wanted to sing \"Rainbowland\" for their spring concert, school administrators axed the plan .\n\nIn a statement provided to Insider by school-district superintendent James Sebert, he said the teacher who suggested the song \"Rainbowland\" checked with the school principal \"to determine if the song would be acceptable to use in a first grade concert.\"\n\nWhen the principal reviewed the song alongside a district policy about \"Controversial Issues in the Classroom,\" they \"determined that the song could be deemed controversial in accordance with the policy,\" the statement said.\n\nLil Nas X's \"Montero (Call Me by Your Name)\" rode a wave of conservative backlash to a No. 1 debut on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nThe song is about \"gay sex,\" in Lil Nas X's own words. He told Genius that he intentionally included some explicit lyrics to help \"normalize\" queer lust in music .\n\nThis angered some parents , who claimed Lil Nas X betrayed children who loved his hit debut single, \"Old Town Road.\"\n\nThe music video - which shows Lil Nas X riding a stripper pole down to hell and giving Satan a lap dance - also sparked outrage from conservative pundits and politicians , including Candace Owens, a right-wing media personality, and Kaitlin Bennett, better known online as the Kent State \"gun girl,\" as well as commentators on Fox News.\n\nThe controversy even elicited a response from South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem , who slammed Lil Nas X for promoting the song by releasing a limited line of \"Satan Shoes.\"\n\nRight-wing media personalities had a collective meltdown in 2020 when Cardi B released \"WAP,\" her hit collaboration with Megan Thee Stallion .\n\nThe song delights in filthy wordplay and explicit expressions of lust, with both rappers bragging about their healthy signs of arousal .\n\nConservative talk-show host Ben Shapiro even took the time to read the lyrics of \"WAP\" out loud on his live radio show, declaring, \"This is what feminists fought for.\"\n\nCardi wasn't fazed : \"I can't believe conservatives soo mad about WAP,\" she tweeted, and reposted a collection of fan-made memes about Shapiro reciting her \"vulgar\" lyrics.\n\nMegan told Time she was \"taken aback\" by the backlash: \"Like, why is this your focus right now? If you have an issue with what I'm saying don't listen to it. Tune out, 'cause I didn't ask you to tune in.\"\n\nCardi also responded to the outrage surrounding their rendition of \"WAP\" at the 2021 Grammy Awards , which reportedly drew more than 1,000 complaints to the FCC . Fox News host Tucker Carlson told viewers, \"they're intentionally trying to degrade our culture and hurt our children,\" while Candace Owens called the performance \"a destruction of American values.\"\n\n\"Yaaaayyyyyyy WE MADE FOX NEWS GUYS !!! Wap wap wap,\" Cardi wrote on Twitter.\n\nTaylor Swift became a target for conservative politicians and members of the alt-right when she broke her political silence in 2018 , endorsing two Democratic candidates in her home state of Tennessee .\n\n\"Let's say that I like Taylor's music about 25% less now,\" President Donald Trump told reporters at the time .\n\nThe following year, Swift built upon this momentum with \"You Need to Calm Down,\" a pro-gay song that explicitly advocated for the Equality Act , a bill that would create anti-discrimination regulations for LGBTQ Americans.\n\nConservative websites like The Daily Signal slammed the song's message , while Kellyanne Conway, then serving as senior counselor to the president, used Swift's own lyrics to mock her activism .\n\nHowever, \"You Need to Calm Down\" was also criticized by progressive audiences. Some said the song trivialized the fight for LGBTQ rights - using the word \"shade\" to describe dangerous homophobia, for example - and that Swift's allyship came at a professionally convenient time .\n\nChildish Gambino's 2018 single \"This Is America\" became an overnight cultural phenomenon , praised for its harsh commentaries on gun violence and racism in America.\n\nHowever, not all reactions were positive. Everyday conservatives called it \"evil garbage\" on Twitter , while professional conservatives wrote scathing essays about its \"superficial\" lyrics and \"paranoid\" message .\n\nFar-right political commentators like Alex Jones and Gavin McInnes were similarly scandalized, describing the music video as a \"voodoo dance\" and declaring, \"Black violence is a bonfire.\"\n\nBeyoncé's \"Formation\" sparked such a pronounced white-person panic that it earned its own \"Saturday Night Live\" parody .\n\nThe surprise single, which Insider named the third-best song of the 2010s , was described by music critics as a \"celebration of southern fried blackness\" and \"a tapestry of Black women's colorful, textured lives.\"\n\nBut the visuals that accompanied the song became particularly contentious. Beyoncé performed \"Formation\" at the 2016 Super Bowl alongside dancers in black berets, paying homage to the Black Panther Party , who fought for Black liberation in the '60s.\n\nThe \"Formation\" music video also contains explicit references to the Black Lives Matter movement, police brutality, and Hurricane Katrina's disproportionate devastation in Black communities.\n\nDuring an appearance on \"Fox and Friends,\" Rudy Giuliani called these visuals \"outrageous.\" In a post on Facebook, US Rep. Peter King decried Beyoncé's \"anti-police\" attitude. Many conservatives and cops called for fans to boycott her music .\n\nLater, Republicans would attempt to use Beyoncé's lyrics about having sex with her husband to paint Democrats as hypocrites - including Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama - for criticizing Trump's offensive language in the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape .\n\nFox News pundits were up in arms after Kendrick Lamar's powerful performance of \"Alright\" at the 2015 BET Awards .\n\nThe song includes lyrics condemning racism and police brutality (\"We hate po-po / Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho\").\n\n\"This is why I say that hip-hop has done more damage to young African-Americans than racism in recent years. This is exactly the wrong message,\" Fox News anchor Geraldo Rivera said .\n\nLamar later responded to Rivera's comments during an interview with TMZ.\n\n\"How can you take a song that's about hope and turn it into hatred?\" he said. \"Hip-hop is not the problem. Our reality is the problem of the situation.\"\n\nThe rapper also sampled the news segment on his 2017 album \"Damn.\"\n\nIn 2010, one year before \"Hannah Montana\" ended , Cyrus released a new single called \"Can't Be Tamed.\"\n\nThe electro-pop song celebrates freedom and self-expression , especially in the face of scrutiny. In the music video, Cyrus plays a caged bird who's gawked at and photographed.\n\nIn response, the Media Research Center issued a statement titled \"The Miley Cyrus Effect: Young Girls Acting Like (Trashy) Adults.\"\n\nThe right-wing group, which describes itself as \"America's media watchdog,\" slammed Cyrus for \"dancing provocatively\" and apparently normalizing \"highly sexualized representations of women.\"\n\n\"I Kissed a Girl\" was released as Katy Perry's official debut single in 2008.\n\nHowever, she had previously released contemporary Christian music under her birth name, Katheryn Hudson.\n\nThe queer fantasy in \"I Kissed a Girl\" inspired a small moral panic from her former audience. Adam Holz of PluggedinOnline - a division of the conservative and anti-gay organization Focus on the Family - condemned the song in an article titled  \"A Tale of Two Katys.\"\n\n\"At the moment, Katy Hudson's flirty and 'dirty' alter ego is in the ascendant. Whether or not she'll ever 'come to her senses' as the Bible says the prodigal son did in Luke 15 remains to be seen,\" Holz wrote.\n\nHe added: \"Katy is indeed living down to a damaging, demeaning stereotype, one that our culture has already branded as 'girls gone wild.' Perhaps one day she'll recall the wisdom of her youth.\"\n\nInstead, as the years went on, \"I Kissed a Girl\" was seen as increasingly problematic on the other side of the aisle. Many progressives have criticized the song for trivializing lesbian relationships and feeding a biphobic narrative.\n\nPerry told Glamour in 2018 that she would change the lyrics if she were to release the song today: \"Lyrically, it has a couple of stereotypes in it. Your mind changes so much in 10 years, and you grow so much.\"\n\n\"I'm a Slave 4 U,\" the lead single from Britney Spears' third album, was met with a radio boycott and a tidal wave of concern for \"the children.\"\n\nSpears told Rolling Stone that the song is about being a slave to music , but as writer Jenny Eliscu noted, \"the lyrics are soaked with double-entendre.\"\n\nPaired with the seductive production and a scantily clad, dimly lit music video, \"I'm a Slave 4 U\" arguably launched the backlash era of Spears' career.\n\nThen just 19 years old, she was loudly condemned by the Parents Association of America, and her python-assisted performance of the song at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards was criticized for \"overt sexuality.\" Entertainment Weekly called Spears \"a lightning rod for parental concern.\" The University of Oregon's student newspaper opined , \"She is an adolescent boy's wet dream and a feminist's nightmare.\"\n\nKendel Ehrlich, wife of former Maryland governor Robert Ehrlich, even said that if she \"had an opportunity to shoot Britney Spears, I think I would.\"\n\nTwo years later, Diane Sawyer played that audio clip during an interview with Spears , saying the singer \"has upset a lot of mothers in the country.\"\n\n\"Goodbye Earl\" is now known as one of The Chicks' most iconic hits, but when it was released as a single in 2000, some people were alarmed.\n\nThe song, written by Dennis Linde and initially recorded by Sons of the Desert , tells the story of two women named Mary Ann and Wanda, who murder Wanda's abusive husband with poison.\n\n\"The debate centers on whether the record sheds light on the problem of domestic violence or condones a murder by the abuse victim and her friend,\" the Los Angeles Times wrote at the time .\n\nIndeed, many country radio stations refused to play the song.\n\nThe backlash even compelled The Chicks to include a disclaimer in the album's liner notes: \"The Dixie Chicks do not advocate premeditated murder, but do love getting even.\"\n\nThree years later, The Chicks came under far-heavier fire for condemning the Iraq War and President George W. Bush. Conservative fans began boycotting their music, demanding radio stations do the same. A group of protestors even bulldozed their CDs .\n\nBruce Springsteen wrote \"American Skin (41 Shots)\" after Amadou Diallo, a 23-year-old Black man, was shot and killed by New York City police in 1999.\n\nThe four officers fired 41 shots after Diallo, who was unarmed, apparently reached for his wallet. They were indicted on charges of second-degree murder and reckless endangerment, but eventually acquitted of all charges .\n\nThe song includes the lyrics, \"You get killed just for living in your American skin.\"\n\nSpringsteen performed \"American Skin\" at Madison Square Garden in 2000, which prompted fury from the NYPD.\n\nAs the New York Times reported , Springsteen was criticized by then-Mayor Giuliani, then-Police Commissioner Howard Safir, and Patrick J. Lynch, then-president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, who urged officers to boycott Springsteen's concerts.\n\nIce-T's hard-rock project Body Count is most famous for their 1992 single \"Cop Killer,\" a protest song about racial profiling and police brutality.\n\nShortly after its release, President George H. W. Bush condemned \"sick\" rap songs and other forms of \"filth\" that \"rejoice in standing up against law enforcement.\"\n\n\"It is wrong for any company,\" he said, apparently referring to Ice-T's label Time Warner, \"to issue records that approve of killing a law enforcement officer.\"\n\nVice President Dan Quayle also criticized the song as \"outrageous.\" Senator Al Gore's wife Tipper Gore, who's partially responsible for \"Parental Advisory\" labels on CDs, wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post that compared Ice-T's rhetoric to Hitler's .\n\n\"As Nasty as They Wanna Be,\" the 1989 album from rap group 2 Live Crew, was banned from sale in southern Florida after a U.S. District Court declared the album \"legally obscene.\"\n\nIn his opinion, U.S. District Judge Jose A. Gonzales Jr. of Fort Lauderdale wrote that 2 Live Crew's lyrics \"are replete with references to female and male genitalia, human sexual excretion, oral-anal contact, fellatio, group sex, specific sexual positions, sado-masochism, the turgid state of the male sexual organ, masturbation, cunnilingus, sexual intercourse, and the sounds of moaning.\"\n\nAs the Washington Post reported , possession of obscene material in Florida was punishable by up to 60 days in jail and a $500 fine. Some record store owners were arrested and convicted for selling the album.\n\nMembers of 2 Live Crew group were also arrested for performing songs from the album in Broward County.\n\nThe 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the ruling in 1992 on the grounds of artistic value.\n\nN.W.A.'s iconic protest song \"Fuck Tha Police,\" which appeared on their 1988 album \"Straight Outta Compton,\" was so reviled by law enforcement that it elicited rebuke from the Federal Bureau of Investigation .\n\nMilt Ahlerich, assistant director of the FBI office of public affairs, mailed a letter to the group's label, Priority Records, calling the song \"discouraging and degrading.\"\n\n\"Advocating violence and assault is wrong,\" he wrote, \"and we in the law enforcement community take exception to such action.\"\n\nIndeed, many police officers boycotted N.W.A. and refused to provide security for their concerts .\n\nIn 1977, amid Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee celebrations, the Sex Pistols released a song calling her reign \"the fascist regime.\"\n\nThe anti-monarchy sentiments of \"God Save the Queen\" were immediately condemned by conservatives across the nation - as well as media companies, like the BBC, which instituted a total ban of the song from its radio stations .\n\nLondon Councilor Bernard Brook Partridge, a high-profile Conservative Party politician, described The Sex Pistols as \"the antithesis of humankind\" and said he wished for their \"sudden death.\"\n\nAccording to the Guardian, the band was \"hassled by police and attacked by nationalist thugs.\" Some tabloids even accused them of treason.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "High-profile conservatives debunk Trump's 2020 election claims: there was 'no fraud that changed the outcome in even a single precinct'\n\nA 72-page report released on Thursday by a group of eight prominent conservatives challenged a slew of election fraud claims former President Donald Trump has made about the 2020 election results.\n\n\"Donald Trump and his supporters have failed to present evidence of fraud or inaccurate results significant enough to invalidate the results of the 2020 Presidential Election,\" the report says. \"We do not claim that election administration is perfect. Election fraud is a real thing; there are prosecutions in almost every election year, and no doubt some election fraud goes undetected.\"\n\nThe report continues, \"But there is absolutely no evidence of fraud in the 2020 Presidential Election on the magnitude necessary to shift the result in any state, let alone the nation as a whole. In fact, there was no fraud that changed the outcome in even a single precinct.\"\n\nThe report, titled \" LOST, NOT STOLEN: The Conservative Case that Trump Lost and Biden Won the 2020 Election ,\" includes the voices of lawyers, retired federal judges, and former senators who analyze the over 60 court cases Trump and his allies filed in the six battleground states he lost, costing him the election. The report was first reported on by CNN .\n\n\"It is wrong, and bad for our country, for people to propagate baseless claims that President Biden's election was not legitimate,\" the report says.\n\nAmong the conservatives who contributed to the report is Michael Luttig, a retired federal judge who testified before the House Select Committee investigating the Capitol attack on January 6 during its third public hearing . Luttig, along with several of the other authors of the report, expressed criticism of the former president on many occasions.\n\nOther well-known contributors include former Sen. John Danforth of Missouri, lawyer Benjamin Ginsburg, Thomas Griffith, former federal judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, David Hoppe, chief of staff for former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, Michael W. McConnell, former judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, former US solicitor general Theodore B. Olson, and former Sen. Gordon H. Smith of Oregon.\n\nThe report is broken down by state and analyzes cases in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Each case analysis includes an addendum showing the case filed, the claim that was made, and the ending result. Many of the cases listed in the report were dismissed on merit or dropped voluntarily by plaintiffs, Trump and his supporters, or by state judges. The writers of the report also looked at how missing mail-in ballot situations were handled by each county election office.\n\n\"Fraud, irregularities, and procedural deficiencies formed the basis for challenging the results in five of the six highly contested Electoral College battleground states,\" the report says. \"Trump verbally attacked the elections as fraudulent, but his lawyers never filed such charges in court ... We conclude that Donald Trump and his supporters had their day in court and failed to produce substantive evidence to make their case.\"\n\nThe report included a plea to other conservative Republicans to reconsider their priorities and change their tune on the election.\n\n\"We urge our fellow conservatives to cease obsessing over the results of the 2020 election, and to focus instead on presenting candidates and ideas that offer a positive vision for overcoming our current difficulties and bringing greater peace, prosperity, and liberty to our nation,\" the report says.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Conservatives used critical race theory to influence voters and win elections. Critics warn the propaganda is working\n\nCritical race theory, a legal framework that looks at how racism has shaped public policy has been misrepresented as simply teaching about slavery and other historical events with any mention of race.\n\nScholars say these efforts are veiled attempts to whitewash the US's shameful history with different communities of color.\n\nResults from elections and ballot initiatives all across the country show the effort appears to be working.\n\nWhereas from 2006 to 2020, there had only been countrywide efforts to recall 52 school board members, in 2021, there have been efforts to remove 215 school board members, according to Ballotpedia , a nonpartisan political forum.\n\n\"What we're finding is that critical race theory is being used to mobilize white racial resentment,\" Sekou Franklin, an associate professor at Middle Tennessee University told Insider. \"It's becoming a major wedge issue and a strategy to collect white, suburban, swing votes.\"\n\nGoogle searches for critical race theory surged during and after last Tuesday's elections , one indicator that the academic framework emerged as a central election issue.\n\nExperts say that as long as \"weaponizing\" critical race theory provides a useful blueprint to winning office, mostly-conservative politicians will continue to employ it.\n\nDespite the fact that critical race theory is seldom, if ever, taught at the elementary, middle, or high school levels of US education, the academic concept became a flashpoint of the Virginia gubernatorial election.\n\nRepublican Glenn Youngkin defeated Democrat Terry McAuliffe in Virginia's high-profile gubernatorial election after making critical race theory a significant part of his campaign - going so far as vowing to ban its use in classrooms.\n\nMcAuliffe took a defiant stance, stating during a debate that he didn't believe \"parents should be telling schools what they should teach\" - a move experts say derailed his election, particularly since exit polls showed education as the top issue for Youngkin's supporters.\n\nWhile Virginia received outsized attention, critical race theory also emerged as a prominent issue in school board elections across the country.\n\nConflict in school boards were not just centered on critical race theory; responses to the coronavirus pandemic, and access to sex and gender education and facilities were also hot-button issues in these elections .\n\nHowever, critical race theory appeared to emerge as a defining issue in local school board elections as approximately three-fourths of candidates endorsed by the 1776 Project PAC - an organization centered on banning the teaching of critical race theory, won their races Tuesday.\n\nThe 1776 Commission was implemented by the Trump administration to counter the 1619 Project, which examines the role of slavery in America's historical narrative. The 1776 Project PAC is a separate project borne out of the ethos.\n\nSince its 2019 publication, the 1619 Project has received ample right-wing criticism and sparked conservative backlash against critical race theory, which the 1776 Project defines as \"a radical belief that pushes the idea that ... white Americans are stained with the sin of racism for which they can never be cleansed,\" per its website.\n\nThe winning candidates endorsed by the 1776 Project PAC span from Colorado to Kansas and are based in both traditionally red and blue areas.\n\nAs Axios noted, several candidates backed by the PAC won \"in solid blue counties,\" including Montgomery County, Pennsylvania; Passaic County, New Jersey; and Johnson County, Kansas.\n\n\"Conservatives saw that critical race theory was a way to mobilize their base and they're going to keep using that playbook in 2022 and 2024,\" Franklin said. \"They're not going to run away from that.\"\n\nCritical race theory wasn't the only racial issue that defined elections this cycle. Policing also took center stage as candidates across the country made public safety a pivotal aspect of their campaigns.\n\nSuch candidates saw major wins, racking up mayoral positions in cities like New York and Kansas City, as Eric Adams and Tyrone Garner respectively did .\n\nPublic safety initiatives also appeared as several ballot measures to varying degrees of success.\n\nWhereas Minneapolis voters rejected a ballot measure to replace its police department with a Department of Public Safety, Clevelanders overwhelmingly voted for a Community Police Commission that would have final say in police policies and discipline.\n\nThough the latest elections saw candidates of color making history , Franklin told Insider that if there's any takeaway to glean from the 2021 elections, it's that the growing diversity of the US won't necessarily translate to Democratic wins or progressive stances on issues of racial justice.\n\n\"Democrats have to reclaim control of their narrative, because right now, it's running away from them with conservative narration of progressive causes,\" Franklin cautioned.\n\nHe added progressives \"have to counteract inaccurate defund the police and critical race theory narratives, otherwise they won't be able to win on these issues.\"\n\nEmory professor Gillespie added that Democrats need to avoid \"shutting down the issue.\" She highlighted that in Virginia, Democratic incumbent Terry McAuliffe did just that when pressed about critical race theory - missing an opportunity to debunk propaganda\n\n\"Glenn Youngkin can make a promise to ban critical race theory, but in response, politicians might point out that K-12 school curriculums don't teach it anyway,\" Gillespie said.\n\nExperts say it's paramount that Democrats address the Conservative propaganda over critical race theory, while at the same time acknowledging that issues like critical race theory are frequently straw man arguments.\n\nAs Gillespie notes, the fear mongering over critical race theory often has less to do with school curriculum and more to do with stoking racial resentment.\n\n\"We need to get people to understand that issues like CRT are symbolic issues that are standing in for other types of anxieties like racial resentment and power and status,\" she said.\n\nJump to"

The publication reported that the Freedom Caucus does not expect any such maneuvers but is remaining vigilant just in case any of their colleagues try to be silent but deadly to their cause.\n\nConservatives' tensions with Johnson have surged since the $1.2 trillion government funding bill to avert a partial shutdown. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene , a Georgia Republican and former Freedom Caucus member, filed a motion to potentially remove Johnson from power in response to the funding bill. The situation has only grown worse after Johnson made clear he would allow the House to vote on additional US aid to Ukraine.\n\nGreene could force a vote on Johnson's future at any time. Earlier this week, Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican with a libertarian bent, became the first Republican to pledge to join Greene's effort publicly. Massie is also not a member of the Freedom Caucus, whose membership is technically secret, but he does support many of the caucus' broader aims.\n\nThe team does not appear to be a new creation. The X account PatriotTakes, which frequently trolls Republicans, posted a clip in 2022 of Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Colorado Republican and Freedom Caucus member, discussing a FART team.\n\n\"Myself and other members of members of the House Freedom Caucus, we have a Floor Action Response Team,\" Boebert said during an appearance on a Blaze Media show. \"F-A-R-T, I'm a mother of four boys, I can appreciate that.\"\n\nFormer Speaker Kevin McCarthy initially resisted setting the \"motion to vacate\" at the threshold of just a single lawmaker before reversing himself to wrap up the votes to what ultimately became his doomed speakership. Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida made history by successfully using the motion to vacate to force McCarthy's ouster. Gaetz teamed up with seven other House Republicans and House Democrats to boot McCarthy from power.\n\nFART is also worried that more centrist GOP lawmakers could move to strip Massie, Rep. Chip Roy, and Ralph Norman from the powerful House Rules Committee. In another McCarthy-era concession, Republicans allowed the three conservative lawmakers to serve on the panel responsible for determining how most legislation reaches the floor. In recent weeks, the trio has increasingly used their power to effectively block Johnson from carrying out his agenda.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican who represents a swing district, said the three lawmakers should either resign from the panel or be formally removed by their colleagues.\n\n\"They are there on behalf of the conference, not themselves,\" Lawler wrote on X.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Trump still hasn't locked down the support of 42% of conservatives who are open to a GOP primary challenger\n\nThe vast majority of Republicans think President Donald Trump is doing a great job - Gallup polls consistently place his approval rating among his party at around 90% - but a surprisingly large contingent of conservatives have said they're receptive to a GOP challenger.\n\nIn April, an Insider poll found that 42% of conservatives were open to considering a qualified primary contender against Trump. Five months later, we polled again - and the number hasn't changed.\n\nOut of a sample of more than 1,100 American adults, Insider's most recent poll asked non-Democratic-voting respondents about their views on the Republican primary. Here's how those who self-identified as \"slightly\" to \"very\" conservative responded:\n\nDespite the five months of campaigning that have elapsed between the two polls - which include plans for a social networking app for Trump supporters - hardly anything has swayed the sector of right-leaning Americans who are amenable to the idea of throwing their weight behind another Republican candidate for president.\n\nNearly a quarter of conservative respondents said they would \"probably\" or \"absolutely\" support a qualified contender. That's roughly the same, with a one percentage point increase for those who said they would \"absolutely\" back a competent adversary.\n\nThe Republican presidential primary is finally starting to ramp up, and the polls results might offer hope to the three contenders have entered the race to challenge President Donald Trump: former Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina, former Rep. Joe Walsh of Illinois, and former Gov. Bill Weld of Massachusetts.\n\nTrump's allies in the Republican party are already taking measures to thwart opposition, with four states planning to cancel their 2020 GOP primaries or caucuses, meaning that Trump will be guaranteed the party's nomination in those states. The announcements have prompted the three challengers to pen an opinion column in The Washington Post condemning their party for being undemocratic.\n\nNone of the contenders come close to rivaling Trump when it comes to name recognition, and no sitting president has lost his party's nomination for a second term since the 19th century. But a strong competitor emerging in the primary has often weakened an incumbent's standing, partly leading them to lose re-election. That reason alone might make it harder for the president to sleep at night.\n\nSurveyMonkey Audience polls from a national sample balanced by census data of age and gender. Respondents are incentivized to complete surveys through charitable contributions. Generally speaking, digital polling tends to skew toward people with access to the internet. Total 1,142 respondents collected September 17 - September 18, 2019, a margin of error plus or minus 2.98 percentage points with a 95% confidence level.\n\n42% of polled Republicans said they're at least open to a GOP challenger to Trump. That's a big problem for the president.\n\nTrump challengers accuse GOP of rigging 2020 election in the presidents favor by canceling primaries in four states\n\nTrump will likely survive his primary challenge from Joe Walsh - but history suggests that it could hurt him in the general election\n\nBusiness Insider's GOP presidential debate will run from 7 PM to 8:30 PM EST on September 24, and will be exclusively live-streamed on Business Insider Today's Facebook Watch page.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Conservatives are poised to win the German election, with Musk-backed AfD in second\n\nGermany's center-right alliance appears set to win the country's latest federal election, which comes at a critical moment for Europe's largest economy .\n\nThe latest exit polls show the Christian Democratic Union and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, with roughly 29% of the vote, with the Elon Musk-backed Alternative for Germany in second with around 21% of the vote.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz's center-left Social Democratic Party is set to come in third, the polls showed.\n\nThis means the CDU's Friedrich Merz is poised to become Germany's next chancellor.\n\nSingle parties rarely win majorities in German elections, so Merz will need the support of one or more parties to secure a majority in government. Merz's most likely options for a coalition will be with the Social Democrats or the Green Party, with the possibility of a three-party coalition pending the final results.\n\nThe snap election followed the collapse of Germany's governing coalition in November after Scholz fired then-Finance Minister Christian Lindner, the chair of the Free Democratic Party, after Lindner rejected Scholz's demand to suspend Germany's debt brake, which requires the federal government to limit annual net borrowing to 0.35% of GDP.\n\nScholz called a vote of confidence which he then lost in December, paving the way for early national elections.\n\nThe CDU/CSU bloc had been projected to win the vote, polling at about 30% in the run-up to the election.\n\nThe CDU's popularity seems to have been boosted by its harder line on major policy issues such as migration, pledging to enforce stricter border controls and accelerate asylum proceedings.\n\nIt also wants to retain Germany's debt brake, cut corporate tax rates to a maximum of 25%, and \"eliminate unnecessary red tape.\"\n\nThe CDU has also pledged continued support to Ukraine.\n\nThe vote comes at a pivotal time for Berlin, which faces an increasingly assertive Trump administration that has threatened tariffs on the European Union and looked to sideline Europe on negotiations with Russia over the Ukraine war.\n\nGermany is a leading NATO member and a key provider of military aid to Ukraine - and it will play an important role in carving out Europe's future relations with the Trump administration.\n\nMerz has pledged to bolster Germany's role on the world stage. In televised remarks on Sunday, the businessman outlined his view of the United States' posture toward Europe.\n\n\"My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA,\" he said. \"I never thought I would have to say something like this on a television program. But after last week's comments from Donald Trump, it's clear that this administration is largely indifferent to Europe's fate, or at least to this part of it.\"\n\nTrump on Sunday congratulated the CDU/CSU bloc on his Truth Social platform - and then praised himself.\n\n\"Much like the USA, the people of Germany got tired of the no common sense agenda, especially on energy and immigration, that has prevailed for so many years,\" he said. \"This is a great day for Germany, and for the United States of America under the leadership of a gentleman named Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nThe far-right AfD party came into Election Day in good spirits, buoyed by support from Musk and several strong showings in regional elections.\n\nMusk - who appeared virtually at a party campaign event alongside AfD leader Alice Weidel in January - has praised the group's staunchly anti-immigration stance.\n\n\"Only the AfD can save Germany,\" Musk posted on X in December.\n\nHowever, despite the AfD posting its best-ever result, it is unlikely to have a role in coalition talks.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Under Trump, conservatives reignite a battle over race and the Constitution\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nWASHINGTON - As part of President Donald Trump's new war on diversity programs, conservatives are renewing a long-running legal battle over the meaning of the Constitution's guarantee of \"equal protection\" that dates back to the post-Civil War era.\n\nTrump, as previewed in one executive order purporting to target diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies, is seeking in some instances to overturn decades-old policies aimed at protecting and empowering minority groups, both within the federal government and outside.\n\nHis administration is also likely to radically change the federal government's enforcement priorities by using laws enacted during the Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s and '60s to target diversity programs.\n\nAt the same time, conservative groups are pursuing court cases challenging policies they view as unlawfully promoting racial preferences. The Trump administration could throw its weigh behind some of those efforts.\n\nWith a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court, which has already ended the consideration of race in college admissions , the Trump administration is likely to have a sympathetic audience when cases on race-related issues arise.\n\n\"It's shocking and appalling what this administration is doing,\" said Jin Hee Lee, a lawyer at the Legal Defense Fund, the group that won landmark cases during the civil rights era under the leadership of future Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall.\n\n\"I would hope that the Supreme Court, regardless of their ideologies and so forth, would recognize that this is antithetical to the rule of law,\" she added.\n\nConservatives, meanwhile, are hopeful the court will continue on the path of striking down what they view as unlawful racial preferences.\n\n\"I'm confident the court is going to subject race-based government action to the strictest of scrutinies,\" said Jonathan Berry, a conservative lawyer who wrote about unwinding DEI policies as part of Project 2025, which was designed to be a blueprint for the second Trump term.\n\nWrit large, the fight is over what exactly the 14th Amendment's promise of \"equal protection of the laws\" means. It has been raging since the amendment was ratified in 1868, when the Reconstruction period, which progressives hoped would usher in a new era of racial equality, was swiftly followed by the Jim Crow era, in which Southern states enforced racial segregation by law.\n\n\"This is a fight over Reconstruction,\" said Evan Bernick, a professor at Northern Illinois University College of Law, who co-wrote a book about the 14th Amendment. \"It's an old fight; it's a continuing one.\"\n\nIn short, liberals believe the 14th Amendment is a progressive statement that empowers the government to act not just to protect minorities but to lift them up. That view underpinned key Supreme Court rulings such as Brown v. Board of Education, the 1954 case argued by Marshall that outlawed racial segregation in schools.\n\nBut conservatives who think the 14th Amendment is an entirely race-neutral measure are in control throughout Washington, including on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe court notably invoked the 14th Amendment in 2023 in ending affirmative action in college admissions, leading the court's two Black justices - conservative Justice Clarence Thomas and liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson - to engage in a fierce debate over their differing views of what it encapsulates.\n\nThomas touted his vision of a \"colorblind Constitution\" that outlaws any consideration of race, while Jackson said such a pronouncement is not reflected in the lived experience of Black people in America.\n\nIt is Thomas' view that currently holds sway on the court, as reflected in Chief Justice John Roberts' famous quote in a 2007 ruling in which the court invalidated a program aimed at ensuring racial diversity in Seattle schools.\n\n\"The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race,\" he wrote. The court ruled then that it was a 14th Amendment violation to deny a student a place at a preferred school even if it was part of a plan to remedy past discrimination.\n\nTrump's executive order states that DEI programs aimed at fostering diversity that have become widespread in government and the private sector are \"dangerous, demeaning, and immoral race- and sex- based preferences.\"\n\nAmong other things, the order rescinded another executive order issued by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965 that sought to tackle discrimination in federal contractor hiring practices. It required contractors to take affirmative action to ensure equal opportunity.\n\nThe Department of Labor, which enforces employment law that bars discrimination in the workplace, quickly announced it would \"cease and desist all investigations and enforcement activity\" related to the now-rescinded executive order. A department spokesman said he had no further information to share about enforcement priorities.\n\nThe executive order specifically called on the Justice Department to develop a new plan for enforcing civil rights laws and asked various agencies to identify possible targets for investigation. A spokesman for the department did not respond to a request seeking further information on its plans.\n\nThe chapter on the Labor Department authored by Berry for Project 2025 calls for the administration to use its enforcement authority to \"prohibit racial classification and quotas\" such that it could target some DEI programs.\n\nEd Blum, a conservative activist who led the college admissions challenge, said there are dozens of ongoing cases challenging DEI policies.\n\n\"It is our hope that the leadership throughout the Trump administration supports all litigation that challenges the use of race and ethnicity in our nation's public policies,\" he added.\n\nOne pending issue, left unresolved by the recent Supreme Court ruling, is whether the nation's military academies can consider race in their admissions policies. Cases are currently ongoing in lower courts.\n\nAnother area of the law that could be subject to litigation under Trump is whether to end liability for actions that lead to discriminatory results even if there was no intent to discriminate.\n\nConservatives have long criticized so-called disparate impact claims, which can be brought under several federal laws, including the Civil Rights Act, for race discrimination, as well as other forms of bias.\n\n\"A lot of modern DEI is traceable to disparate impact liability and the pressure it creates for racial balancing in the workforce,\" Berry said.\n\nOne legal organization on the right that has active litigation seeking to end policies it believes promote unlawful racial discrimination is the Pacific Legal Foundation.\n\nExamples of its cases include a challenge to a law in Tennessee that is aimed at ensuring a medical board has at least one member from a racial minority group. Another involves a loan program for first-time homebuyers in Washington state that is limited to minorities.\n\nJoshua Thompson, one of the group's lawyers, expressed hope that - via litigation, and with Trump's help - race-conscious government policies could be eliminated within five years.\n\n\"That's something we should celebrate,\" he said.\n\nLawrence Hurley is a senior Supreme Court reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

He just wants to pass what the Senate wants so that we avoid any conflict,\" Good told NBC News, saying that Johnson, R-La., wants to \"join hands with the Dems\" to \"increase spending\" and yield \"no policy wins.\"\n\n\"The speaker is unwilling to tell the Senate no,\" he said. \"It doesn't matter what we offer.\"\n\nBut Good didn't have a solution when asked what the right flank can do about it, saying: \"I'm open to ideas.\"\n\nWhen asked pointedly if that includes a motion to vacate the speaker's chair, Good, one of eight Republicans who used the tool to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, ended the conversation. \"Thank you,\" he replied.\n\nThe shift in mindset indicates that reality is setting in for a band of fiery rabble-rousers who came into the new Republican majority with high expectations of bending Congress to their will. The right-wing members continue to believe that a small House GOP majority can force the Democratic-led Senate and White House to accede to their wishes, but they're slowly recognizing that many of their Republican colleagues don't support the aggressive spending cuts they want. And they're beginning to doubt that any speaker can change that.\n\nRep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, a Freedom Caucus member and right-wing thought leader on fiscal policy, said the newly passed government funding bill was \"more of the same games, a lot of smoke and mirrors.\" And he predicted the next package of bills will similarly be \"garbage.\"\n\n\"It is business as usual,\" Roy said, despite some \"modest strides\" toward a more normal process in developing the bills.\n\nBut when asked if he blames Johnson, Roy said, \"I think the speaker reflects a conference that likes to give lip service to fiscal restraint and refuses to act on it. That's what I think.\"\n\nAs for a motion to vacate? Roy isn't going there: \"I think it's a tool that should always be on the table, as an historical matter. I think it should be sparingly used. ... I think we need to just keep working forward to try to get somewhere.\"\n\nRep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas, an ardent Donald Trump ally who wore a T-shirt with the former president's mug shot to the State of the Union address, was more blunt about why Johnson's job isn't in danger: Nobody wants it.\n\n\"Let's just go down to Disney and see if Daffy Duck or maybe Goofy would want the job,\" Nehls said. \"Maybe Mickey! Maybe Mickey would want the job.\"\n\nRep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., another Freedom Caucus member, doesn't blame Johnson for spending bills he dubbed \"irresponsible,\" and said that a motion to vacate isn't on the table.\n\n\"He inherited a lot of this. No, I don't blame him,\" Norman said. \"It's like herding cats up here.\"\n\nMcCarthy, R-Calif., passed one short-term government funding bill as speaker, and the far right took away his gavel within days. His successor,  Johnson, has passed three stopgap bills and a major appropriations package that falls short of their demands.\n\nNorman said the two situations are different because McCarthy and Johnson operate differently.\n\n\"McCarthy had a lot of other issues other than that. He would tell us one thing of the top line, and then he had side deals. That was not right. Johnson, to his credit, does not do that,\" Norman said.\n\nRoy said things haven't changed much since Johnson replaced McCarthy, starting with the spending bill that just passed.\n\n\"We know it's going to spend more money than the [Nancy] Pelosi omnibus,\" Roy said. \"And all these little cuts, like the FBI - that was one building in Alabama!\"\n\nThe FBI faces a 6% cut relative to 2023. But almost all of it comes from the \"construction\" part of the budget, which sources said was previously boosted by the now-retired Senate Appropriations Vice Chair Richard Shelby, R-Ala., for a project in his home state. Just 0.3% is cut from the FBI's main \"salaries and expenses\" budget.\n\n\"There's no cut,\" Roy said. \"Just admit it!\"\n\nDemocrats are pleased to see Johnson side with the majority of his conference and against the far right on funding the government.\n\n\"I think people have come to realize that you come here to govern. We come here to do the work of the American people,\" said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., the top House Democratic appropriator.\n\nThey say he should do the same on aid for Ukraine and allow a bipartisan bill to come up.\n\n\"The speaker said that the House should do this. Well, we have a security package out there that he could put on the floor too, if he wants the House to do it,\" said Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., the chair of the House Democratic campaign arm. \"Well? Let us vote.\"\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., had threatened to remove Johnson through a motion to vacate if he brought funding for Ukraine to the House floor, calling it \"an absolute no-go.\" But she's since sought to clarify her threat, saying it only applies if he brings up the Senate bill that includes Ukraine funding and border security .\n\n\"It wasn't a stand-alone threat on Ukraine funding,\" she said.\n\nSahil Kapur is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

It took place against a background of growing uncertainty over the future of Ukraine and Europe's alliance with the United States .\n\nThe results released by the electoral authority showed Merz's Christian Democrats and the center-left Social Democrats winning a combined majority of seats in the national legislature after small parties failed to make the electoral threshold.\n\nThat gives Merz the best chance of becoming the country's next chancellor. He said on election night that he hopes to form a government by Easter at the latest.\n\nHe has ruled out a coalition with the far-right Alternative for Germany , or AfD, which is now the country's second-largest party after its best showing ever.\n\nFor the time being, departing Chancellor Olaf Scholz , whose Social Democratic party suffered a stinging defeat, will remain.\n\nMerz's conservatives won 208 seats in the 630-seat Bundestag, while the AfD won 152. The three parties in the former governing coalition lost seats, with the SDP falling to 120 seats and the Greens to 85. The pro-business Free Democrats, which triggered early elections by pulling out of the coalition, failed to reach the 5% of the vote required to win seats.\n\nThe Left party got 64 seats, while the left-wing Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance came in just under the 5% hurdle.\n\nThe AfD was jubilant on Sunday night, with leaders vowing to become the country's main party in the next election as its appeal expands. The anti-immigrant, far-right party has established itself as a significant political force in the 12 years since it was founded, but it hasn't yet been part of any state or national government.\n\nThat's the result of what is often called a \"firewall\" against Alternative for Germany. Other parties say they won't work with the AfD, which is under observation by the domestic intelligence agency for suspected right-wing extremism, something that AfD objects to strongly. Its branches in three eastern states are designated \"proven right-wing extremist\" groups, which is particularly sensitive in view of Germany's Nazi past.\n\nThe election took place seven months earlier than originally planned after Scholz's unpopular coalition collapsed in November, three years into a term that was increasingly marred by infighting. There was widespread discontent and not much enthusiasm for any of the candidates.\n\nMerz said Sunday night that his top priority is to unify Europe in the face of challenges coming from the U.S. and Russia. Both Vice President JD Vance and Trump ally Elon Musk openly supported the AfD.\n\n\"I have no illusions at all about what is happening from America,\" he told supporters. \"Take a look at the recent interventions in the German election campaign by Mr. Elon Musk.\"\n\nHe added that \"the interventions from Washington were no less dramatic and drastic and ultimately outrageous than the interventions we have seen from Moscow. So we are under such massive pressure from two sides that my absolute priority now is really to create unity in Europe.\"\n\nGermany is the most populous country in the 27-nation European Union and a leading member of NATO. It has been Ukraine's second-biggest weapons supplier, after the U.S., and will be central to shaping the continent's response to the challenges of the coming years, including the Trump administration's confrontational foreign and trade policy.\n\nThe conservative leader said that \"the most important thing is to reestablish a viable government in Germany as quickly as possible.\"\n\n\"I am aware of the responsibility,\" Merz said. \"I am also aware of the scale of the task that now lies ahead of us. I approach it with the utmost respect, and I know that it will not be easy.\"\n\n\"The world out there isn't waiting for us, and it isn't waiting for long-drawn-out coalition talks and negotiations,\" he told cheering supporters.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Rather they voted to punish the Conservatives - a guttural expression of democratic anger after 14 years of scandals and failed policies that have left the world's sixth-largest economy stagnant and decrepit.\n\n\"People will be pleased to see the back of Truss,\" postman Mick Callaghan, 61, told NBC News as he did his rounds. \"This town has gone to pot, with the mortgages going up and the general mess the Conservatives have made.\"\n\nNearby, Glenis Stevenson, a retired housekeeper, debated the night's drama with a group of friends outside Thetford's local Baptist church.\n\n\"We used to always vote Conservative, but not this time,\" the 90-year-old said. \"They don't bother to help people like us; they only care about the rich, not working-class people.\"\n\nThe narrative in Thetford is Britain in microcosm.\n\nThursday's election saw Labour win 412 seats - nearly a record haul - to the Conservatives' 121 - the lowest since its founding in the 1830s. It was a remarkable shift from 2019, when Labour's defeat was so comprehensive that pundits predicted it would take years or decades to recover.\n\nThat was not the case, such is the dizzying volatility of modern British politics. In both elections, places once considered \"safe\" seats for both parties have seen their supposed tribal alliances turned upside down, and then in some cases flipped back again.\n\nTruss stands accused of playing a major role in the Conservatives' deep malaise.\n\nWhile she won a 26,000-vote majority at the 2019 election, and had not been expected to come under serious pressure this time around, she lost her seat to the Labour candidate, Terry Jermy, by 640 votes.\n\nPart of that likely owed to her ignominious reputation following her brief and haphazard stint as prime minister in 2022.\n\nTruss lasted just 49 days in office , taking Britain's top job following the resignation of her predecessor, Boris Johnson, after months of rolling scandal.\n\nShe had by far the shortest tenure of any prime minister in history, jettisoned by her own lawmakers after announcing unfunded tax cuts that spooked markets and triggered a financial catastrophe that spiked people's mortgage rates.\n\nThis had a direct impact on people like Lucy Howe, 26, who said her monthly payments have gone up by 500 pounds ($640) a month, crushing for a preschool worker on maternity leave.\n\n\"I haven't ever voted before, but I voted Labour this time,\" she said, pushing her 4-month-old baby, Louis, in a stroller along Thetford's main street. \"I'm not somebody who's really into politics,\" she added, but \"we haven't had a great few years and it was time for a change-up.\"\n\nBrexit looms over all of this, with most economists saying it continues to hamper the U.K.'s efforts to recover from its financial stagnation. Paradoxically, the 2016 decision to leave the European Union was barely mentioned during this campaign, with most parties cautious to reopen a messy chapter in Britain's history that most here now say was a mistake.\n\nAlthough Labour has a huge majority in the House of Commons, the lower house of the U.K. Parliament, Labour knows the roles could be reversed next time around. It didn't win this election by drumming up millions more votes; in fact, its vote share actually dropped from 2019.\n\nWhat changed was an unprecedented collapse in Conservative support.\n\nSome went to the centrist Liberal Democrats. Most went to Reform U.K., the populist anti-immigration party headed by the insurgent Donald Trump ally Nigel Farage . Reform was only founded four years ago and only won five seats despite its impressive 4 million votes.\n\nNonetheless, Farage is eyeing this year as a springboard into the next elections in 2029.\n\n\"Reform is certainly going to be in power at some point,\" said James Lumley, 61, a farmer who voted for the hard-right upstarts after a lifetime backing the Conservatives.\n\nHe was talking politics on a bench outside a local pub, proudly dressed in a Union Flag T-shirt, camouflage trousers and a tan corduroy sports jacket. He said that mainstream politicians \"have treated us like mushrooms: kept us in the dark and fed us on pig swill.\"\n\n\"I'd rather have Conservatives than Labour, but the Conservatives are still as much use as a chocolate fire guard,\" he said. With relish, the self-described eccentric who said he left his British-flag pants at home added: \"The Conservatives are finished.\"\n\nIt's quite a statement in South West Norfolk, the parliamentary constituency in which Thetford sits. Conservatives have dominated in the region since the 1880s. And Liz Truss has been local lawmaker since 2010, sitting on a colossal, seemingly unassailable majority.\n\nThe town's architecture and winding alleyways might seem like a museum to a visitor, with some buildings dating to the 1400s. The town evokes a bygone, perhaps part-imaginary England, one portrayed in the 1970s sitcom \"Dad's Army\" about homefront soldiers in World War II, which was filmed nearby.\n\nThetford was also the birthplace of American founding father Thomas Paine in 1737, and his gold statue surveys the town square.\n\nIn a story familiar to countless other towns, some of Thetford's \"olde worlde\" buildings have been taken over by low-rent stores with names like TIME2VAPE. Others are vacant altogether, casualties of the high taxes on local businesses and online shopping that's smashed main-street retail nationwide.\n\nWhile Labour won the seat, Reform candidate Toby McKenzie was close behind with just under 10,000 votes, almost as many as the former prime minister, splitting the right wing and handing Labour victory.\n\nBrexit's specter is felt not just in economics but immigration, which has continued to rise despite promises by advocates that Brexit would see it fall.\n\n\"Everything we have worked for, and our fathers fought for in the war, is now being taken over by foreigners,\" said Shirley Johnson, 78, a retired chef dressed in the style of Betty Boop and sitting on her mobility scooter.\n\nShe said she wasn't racist. Her late husband was a Black American from Houston, Texas, and the couple has five children. \"I'm not blaming the people: If I was in a war zone and had three kids, of course I would try to come here,\" she said. \"It's the government's fault.\"\n\nThis tension is visible in the slew of Eastern European food stores that now dot the town's thoroughfare. The Lithuanians, Bulgarians and Romanians say they don't get too much hassle.\n\n\"In any case, if they send us back home, I wouldn't care,\" said Ineta Omel, 23, who moved here with her family from Lithuania at age 14 and now works as a receptionist. \"I would!\" snaps back her sister, Kamile, 21, sitting next to her on a bench under the bows of a tall tree. \"I've built my life here.\"\n\nThey both laugh.\n\nThese high-street debates aside, just as important to the narrative are the people who refused to participate at all. Trust in politics, media and other institutions is at a record low. And provisional turnout estimates were just 60%, at least the lowest for 20 years.\n\n\" All of these politicians are full of s---,\" said Bob, 68, a retired plasterer who declined to give his last name. \"You just can't trust any of them.\"\n\nAlexander Smith is a senior reporter for NBC News Digital based in London.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

They tell us 'reach a deal'.\"\n\nMarine Le Pen's anti-immigration, euroskeptic National Rally (RN) is widely expected to emerge as the strongest force after President Emmanuel Macron unexpectedly called snap elections for June 30 and July 7, although it may fall short of an absolute majority.\n\nThe RN was therefore looking for allies to secure control of parliament and it immediately applauded Ciotti's comment. But this in turn means The Republicans (LR) is likely to implode.\n\nCiotti's comments also signified that a decades-old consensus in France's political establishment to join forces to keep the far right from power was blowing up.\n\nThe Republicans, and its previous versions - all heirs of Charles de Gaulle and Jacques Chirac's parties - were in power for large chunks of France's modern political history.\n\nBut LR is a shadow of its former self, with far fewer lawmakers, and had already lost key members to Macron's centrist party and the far right.\n\nOther mainstream parties to the left and right have also been weaker since Macron was first elected president in 2017 on a neither-left-nor-right platform with an upstart party that wanted to reshape France's political landscape.\n\nPhilippe Gosselin, an LR lawmaker, told Reuters he would leave LR over Ciotti's comments and that LR lawmakers would create a new group.\n\n\"It is unthinkable for me (and many LR MPs) that there could be the slightest agreement, the slightest alliance, even local, or personal, with the RN,\" Gosselin said.\n\nOther LR veterans lined up to reject any deal with the far right. An LR parliamentary source estimated that only about a sixth of LR lawmakers would accept such a deal.\n\nOlivier Marleix, who heads the LR group of the lower house of parliament, said on X: \"What Eric Ciotti is saying is valid only for himself, he must leave the leadership of the Republicans.\"\n\nMacron's camp was quick to say Ciotti's comments were shameful and, according to Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin, a former LR member, reminiscent of the 1938 Munich agreements signed by France and Britain with Nazi Germany.\n\nAll French political parties have been rushing to find alliances - and trying not to fall apart - since Macron announced the snap election following a poor performance by his Renaissance party in European Parliament elections on Sunday.\n\nFrance's divided left-wing parties pledged to work together and nominate joint candidates in the elections, but are yet to strike a formal deal.\n\nThe euro dropped as did French stocks and bonds after Macron's announcement.\n\nRating agency Moody's warned of the risk that political instability triggered by the snap election meant for France's already challenging fiscal picture.\n\nThe RN calls for protectionist \"France first\" economic policies and a radical cut in immigration. It would restrict childcare benefits to French citizens and withdraw residency for migrants who are out of work for more than a year.\n\nIt has also proposed higher public spending, despite already significant levels of French debt, threatening to further raise financing costs at banks.\n\nSpeaking to Le Figaro, Macron said he was in for the win and that calling a snap election \"was the right decision, in the interest of the country\" and that it would clarify things.\n\nHe ruled out resigning, whatever the result of the election.\n\nMarine Le Pen's party would win 235 to 265 seats in the National Assembly, a huge jump from its current 88 but short of the 289 needed for an absolute majority, according to the survey by Toluna Harris Interactive for Challenges, M6 and RTL published Monday.\n\nThe same poll sees LR with 40-55 seats, so the two combined might eke out an absolute majority, but with no certainty.\n\nReuters\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Take a look at the recent interventions in the German election campaign by Mr. Elon Musk.\"\n\nIf Merz, who said Monday that he plans to quickly form Germany's next government, does become the next chancellor, then his in tray will be bursting.\n\nDomestically, he would have to deal with widespread unrest over immigration at home , fueled by a spate of high-profile attacks in recent weeks and a flagging economy. That might be harder after the AfD and the radical Left Party won enough seats to block constitutional changes needed to loosen state borrowing limits - changes economists say are essential to reviving growth.\n\nInternationally, Merz would have to navigate the fraying bond between Washington and Europe , of which Germany is the most populous country and biggest economy. There is also the matter of the war in Ukraine , over which the AfD and radical Left's sway may also stymie raising Germany's defense and military aid budget.\n\nAll the while, Merz would have one eye on the far right, which has been surging across Europe while enjoying mutual support from President Donald Trump and his aides.\n\nMusk has previously endorsed the AfD, hosting party events on the X social media platform that he owns and appearing at a campaign rally during which he repeated one of the party's most controversial points of view, which is that young Germans should no longer feel guilty for the events of the Holocaust in their country's past.\n\nMerz said Sunday that \"the interventions from Washington were no less dramatic and drastic and ultimately outrageous than the interventions we have seen from Moscow. So we are under such massive pressure from two sides that my absolute priority now is really to create unity in Europe.\"\n\nBy design, Germany's voting system means it is very difficult for one party to govern alone, forcing leaders to work together and form coalitions to govern this consensus-based country. Merz said that he hoped to form a government by Easter, but added that cooperating with the second-placed AfD was \"completely out of the question.\"\n\nGermany's political establishment has long maintained an informal \"firewall\" against cooperating with the far right that is seen as a bulwark against fascism.\n\nMerz's CDU party won 28.5% of the vote and 208 of the 630 seats in Germany's parliament, according to results that are set to be validated by lawmakers March 15.\n\nThe AfD won 20.5% and 152 seats, while the ruling center-left Social Democratic Party fell to 15.5% and 120 seats. Chancellor Olaf Scholz has been effectively voted out of office, calling the interventions by Washington \"disgusting\" Sunday.\n\nThe environmentally focused Greens got 11.6% and 85 seats, and the leftist Die Linke party received 8.8% and 64 seats, while the pro-business Free Democrats and left-wing populist Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance failed to meet the 5% threshold that would allow them to enter parliament.\n\nAlexander Smith is a senior reporter for NBC News Digital based in London.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "House Republicans are in chaos again as conservatives derail a key surveillance bill\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nWASHINGTON - A band of hard-right agitators, backed by former President Donald Trump, revolted against GOP leaders Wednesday, blocking renewal of a powerful surveillance program that is set to expire next week and throwing the GOP-led House into chaos once again.\n\nNineteen conservatives broke with Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and his leadership team and voted down a \"rule\"; the vote was 193-228. It's yet another example of a minority of Republicans using the otherwise procedural vote to prevent the House from debating their own party's legislation.\n\nIt was the seventh time this Congress - and the fourth under Johnson - that Republicans have taken down their own rule, according to a review by NBC News.\n\nGiven the party's minuscule margin, Wednesday's Republican revolt effectively derailed - for now - carefully crafted compromise legislation to reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n\nAfter the vote, Johnson scheduled a special closed-door meeting of House Republicans for later Wednesday afternoon, but there was no breakthrough after more than an hour. It's unclear whether Congress will be able to renew 702, which the administration says is a critical national security tool, before it expires on April 19.\n\n\"We will regroup and reformulate another plan,\" Johnson told reporters. \"We cannot allow Section 702 of FISA to expire. It's too important to national security.\"\n\nOne option now is that the Senate could send the House a clean, short-term extension of FISA with no reforms. \"It's a fact - if FISA goes down we'll likely extend current FISA. Stupid,\" said moderate Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., a member of the Armed Services Committee. \"They'll end up with the worst option.\"\n\nThe current FISA tool allows the government to conduct targeted surveillance of foreign nationals without needing to obtain warrants, with a higher bar for targeted American citizens. The new House Republican bill calls for a number of reforms but doesn't go far enough in the eyes of privacy and civil liberties advocates, on both the right and left.\n\nTrump threw a wrench into things early Wednesday, posting on social media platform: \"KILL FISA, IT WAS ILLEGALLY USED AGAINST ME AND MANY OTHERS. THEY SPIED ON MY CAMPAIGN!!!\" - an apparent reference to the FBI's bungled surveillance of former Trump aide Carter Page .\n\n\"We are killing FISA. As written, it won't make it off the floor,\" Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., wrote on X , responding to Trump.\n\nTwo other Trump loyalists, Reps. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., and Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., also said before the vote they would cast no votes on the rule.\n\n\"We're throwing our Constitution and our Bills of Rights away with this history of abuse. It needs to be on the scrap heap,\" Burchett said in an interview. \"They broke the law before. What's going to stop them from doing so again? We need to remove that tool.\"\n\nThe contentious issue dominated a closed-door gathering of House Republicans on Wednesday morning. Johnson warned Republican lawmakers they would get jammed with a short-term FISA extension from the Senate, without the reforms in the House GOP bill, if members vote down the rule, four sources said. He described that as the worst-case scenario because it would deny the Republicans the chance to revise the law.\n\nAfter the meeting, Johnson reiterated to reporters that Section 702 can't be allowed to lapse, saying the spying powers are essential to protecting Americans.\n\n\"We have to strike the balance government always does. You have to ... jealously guard the fundamental liberty of American people,\" Johnson said. \"You protect the liberty, but at the same time, you got to protect your security. And we can't allow a critical tool like this to just expire and go out of use.\"\n\nAlthough most Democrats and the White House support extending FISA, House Democrats don't intend to provide votes for the rule because of partisan language tucked into it. In addition to the FISA bill, the rule includes a Republican resolution on Israel that criticizes President Joe Biden for pressuring the country to change its war strategy after the strike on a World Central Kitchen aid convoy .\n\n\"We have to reauthorize FISA. Unfortunately, the speaker has chosen to couple this rule vote with a bunch of other things,\" said Pete Aguilar, of California, the No. 3 House Democrat. \"It has partisan resolutions attached to it. And so I would not anticipate any Democrats' supporting it.\"\n\nWhile some Republicans oppose reauthorizing FISA outright, others are expected to support the rule to vote for a warrant requirement for the Section 702 program. Members of the House Intelligence Committee and the intelligence community warn that such a requirement could cripple the program.\n\nBackers of the House FISA bill have argued that without renewing Section 702, another major terrorist attack could occur on American soil. Families of 9/11 victims sent a letter to the speaker urging Congress to reauthorize Section 702, according to a copy obtained by NBC News. The letter, from 9/11 Families United, was circulated to House Republicans in their weekly conference meeting Wednesday morning.\n\n\"It is our belief that the failure to renew Section 702 would be detrimental to American national security and would put Americans at risk of new terrorist attacks,\" the letter said.\n\nThe push to curtail the government's surveillance power has sparked an extraordinary left-right coalition.\n\nThe Rules Committee authorized a House floor vote on an amendment to curtail warrantless surveillance of U.S. persons under the FISA law, written by Reps. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz.; Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash.; Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y.; Warren Davidson, R-Ohio; Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif.; and Jim Jordan, R-Ohio.\n\nJordan, the chair of the Judiciary Committee, appeared on conservative host Mark Levin's show and pressed his case for changing the current FISA law.\n\n\"Got to have a warrant requirement,\" Jordan said. \"I'm all for surveilling foreigners who want to do us harm. But when you do that you inevitably pick up a number of Americans, many times innocently. And if you're going to go search that database, you got to go through a separate equal branch of government and get a probable cause warrant. That is how it works.\"\n\nThe White House \"strongly supports\" the House's FISA bill, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said. But the administration opposes the Jordan amendment, which, Sullivan said, would \"rebuild a wall around and thus block access to already lawfully collected information in the possession of the U.S. government.\"\n\nChristy Abizaid, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, said: \"I can't imagine working in today's counterterrorism environment without FISA Section 702, and I don't know how we would replace it if it were gone. Our No. 1 mission is to protect the United States homeland from a diverse array of threats, and speed is of the essence to fulfill this mission.\"\n\nCORRECTION (April 8, 2024, 9:55 a.m.) A previous version of this article misstated Rep.

Election Day is Nov. 5, although early voting begins before then.\n\nWith Congress on recess until Sept. 9 and little progress made so far on appropriations, it's all but certain that lawmakers will need a short-term funding bill - also known as continuing resolution, or CR - to prevent a shutdown.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has not made any decisions on what a CR might look like or when he would set the deadline for its expiration.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus said Monday in a statement that the group has taken the official position that a CR \"should include the SAVE Act - as called for by President Trump - to prevent non-citizens from voting to preserve free and fair elections,\" accusing the Biden-Harris administration of having \"imported\" people to the U.S. illegally.\n\nTrump and other top Republicans have repeated that claim, pushing for nationwide proof of citizenship in voting by falsely alleging a plot to use undocumented people to benefit Democrats in elections. Noncitizen voting is already illegal and very rare . Critics of the bill say the new requirements could disenfranchise American citizens.\n\nThe SAVE Act recently passed the Republican-led House but is dead on arrival in the Democratic-controlled Senate. If GOP leaders attached it to government funding, it would spark a standoff with Democrats and President Joe Biden that risks a government shutdown.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus added that in the event of a stopgap bill, \"government funding should be extended into early 2025 to avoid a lame duck omnibus that preserves Democrat spending and policies well into the next administration.\"\n\nThat, too, would spark a fight as many lawmakers prefer to deal with funding the government through fall 2025 in the lame-duck session. House and Senate Democrats favor a late 2024 deadline. And Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the vice chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, recently told NBC News it would be a \"mistake\" to push the deadline into the new year, calling it wiser to finish the process in 2024 and give the new president a \"clean slate\" next January.\n\nSenate Appropriations Chair Patty Murray, D-Wash., said the Freedom Caucus demands amount to \"outrageous partisan pills\" that are a \"nonstarter,\" calling for a bipartisan approach.\n\n\"The SAVE Act is nothing more than a partisan scare tactic meant to erode confidence in our elections. It is already illegal for noncitizens to register and vote in federal elections - our elections are free and fair, despite the dangerous, often incoherent, ramblings of Donald Trump,\" Murray told NBC News in a statement.\n\nShe said the Senate will pursue a \"bipartisan way to ensure we can keep the government funded and deliver responsible, bipartisan spending bills that can actually be signed into law before the end of the year.\"\n\nThe Freedom Caucus is in a period of upheaval as its chairman, Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., lost a hotly contested primary by a wafer-thin margin. But the group of roughly 40 members has punched above its weight in a narrow House GOP majority.\n\nAsked to respond, Johnson spokesperson Athina Lawson didn't address the new conservative demands and said only that the House has \"made significant progress\" on full-year funding bills through September of next year.\n\n\"The House Appropriations Committee has diligently moved all 12 bills out of committee and the House has passed 75 percent of government funding for the upcoming fiscal year while the Senate has yet to even consider a single appropriations bill,\" she said. \"The House will continue its successful effort to responsibly fund the government for FY25 when it returns from its district work period.\"\n\nSahil Kapur is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

O'Bryant School. It replaced a previous emphasis on standardized test scores as well as grades. Under the new plan, grades were considered, with 20% of the seats taken by those with the best grades.\n\nOther seats were filled based on the geographic locations of the students within Boston, with those with the best grades getting preference.\n\nThe plan, which was in effect for only one year, was challenged by the Boston Parent Coalition for Academic Excellence, a group representing white and Asian parents, which said the policy constituted a form of racial discrimination under the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause.\n\nA federal judge ruled that the policy was lawful because it was written in a race-neutral way. The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed.\n\nThe Supreme Court in February turned away a similar challenge to an admissions policy at a Virginia high school that was also aimed at increasing diversity.\n\nIn a statement, Gorsuch said the fact the Boston schools' policy was no longer in effect was one reason not to hear the case.\n\nIn other action in the schools context Monday, the court also declined to take up a case out of Wisconsin about whether parents can sue schools over policies intended to protect students struggling with their gender identities.\n\nThe Eau Claire Area School District issued guidance in 2021 in support for students who are transgender, nonbinary or gender-nonconforming. The policy says that in some cases, an affected student's parents may not be central to the process if there is a risk of lack of acceptance at home.\n\nThe policy was challenged by Parents Protecting Our Children, a group representing parents. It argued it violates parental rights under both the 14th Amendment's due process clause and the First Amendment's free exercise clause.\n\nLower courts ruled that the group did not have legal standing to pursue its claims because it could not show that any members had been harmed by it.\n\nAgain, Alito and Thomas said they would have taken the case up, as did fellow conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\n\"This case presents a question of great and growing national importance,\" Alito wrote .\n\nLawrence Hurley is a senior Supreme Court reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

President Trump headlined the Conservative Political Action Conference Saturday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We have a lot to stick together for because what we've done has never been done before. Nobody's ever seen anything like this, and nobody's ever seen four weeks like we've had. RASCOE: And across town, a smaller group of conservatives who oppose Trump gather to talk about what's next. NPR's Stephen Fowler and Sarah McCammon have been covering these events, and they join us now. Good morning to you both. STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: Good morning. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Hey there. RASCOE: So, Stephen, I'll start with you and CPAC. What did you hear there? FOWLER: CPAC has been around for a while, but since Trump has been on the scene the last decade, you might as well call it TPAC. Here's one of Trump's pollsters, John McLaughlin, speaking just after showing a straw poll of CPAC participants found a 99% approval rating of Trump as president. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: And I said, it's way more popular than even Ronald Reagan was, and I never would have said this back in the day. Donald Trump has literally remade the Conservative movement. He's remade the Republican Party. FOWLER: Not that there's any deviation from Trump and his administration were quashed or silenced this week, but it also stood out to me, Ayesha, how seamlessly Trump 2.0's policies and language and world view are organically reflected in virtually every aspect of CPAC. RASCOE: Sarah, you were at a competing event that continues today. So how are conservatives who oppose Trump feeling right now? MCCAMMON: Well, they're a much smaller group. I attended a summit hosted by a group called Principles First, which began during Trump's first term in opposition to his policies. And speakers there included high-profile anti-Trump Republicans, such as former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. He criticized several of the administration's actions so far, including the firings of federal prosecutors who investigated the January 6 attack on the Capitol. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ALBERTO GONZALES: You're doing your job successfully, and you get fired. That is a complete betrayal. I think it's a betrayal to the American people for the president to pardon particularly those individuals that are dangerous. (APPLAUSE) GONZALES: The president's pardon power is virtually absolute in the Constitution, so I get that he has the authority to do that. There's no question about it. But it was a wrong thing to do. MCCAMMON: And of course, Gonzales is referring there to Trump's pardoning of 1,500 people related to January 6. And he said, you know, without speaking for former President George W. Bush, who he served under, he couldn't imagine Bush pardoning offenders who had harmed police officers or caused damage to the U.S. Capitol. So, Ayesha, this was an opportunity for conservative-leaning activists who've largely given up on today's Republican Party to kind of regroup and try to carve out a space for those anti-Trump conservative voices. RASCOE: Stephen, how are folks at CPAC reacting to Trump's first month in office? FOWLER: I mean, they love it. I want to play some remarks here from Senator Jim Banks of Indiana, who encapsulated the sense that Trump is winning, has won and will continue to win in achieving his campaign promises. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JIM BANKS: Within a short time, we've gotten just a glimpse of the greatness that will define this new era. President Trump has already rooted out massive waste, fraud and abuse within the federal bureaucracy, crippling the corruption of the deep state. FOWLER: A lot of Trump's agenda is being challenged in court. It's executive action that'll either take time to implement, if it can be implemented at all, but that doesn't really matter as much because Trump is president. He says it's being done, and Republicans do hold all the federal levels of power. I'll also add, a not-too-surprising undercurrent this week for me was Elon Musk and his DOGE effort. Musk was given the rock star treatment at CPAC. And so many speakers made sure to bring up that effort to cut federal spending and reshape the government in a deferential and effusive way usually reserved for Trump. RASCOE: Anti-Trump Republicans often find themselves working with Democrats these days. So, Sarah, what did they have to say about how Democrats have been responding to Trump's first month in office? MCCAMMON: Yeah, I mean, there was plenty of criticism of Trump and Republicans at this event I attended yesterday, but there was also criticism of Democrats. I mean, these are center-right conservatives. I heard more than once that Democrats have failed to communicate to voters that they care about them and understand their concerns. One of the speakers was billionaire Mark Cuban, who endorsed Vice President Harris last year but says he doesn't identify with any party. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARK CUBAN: You know, if you're the Democrats or you're trying to counter them - whether you're a conservative, whatever it may be - you have to recognize, you know, telling this other company's customers that they're dumb doesn't work because they're not dumb, right? They bought into what they saw in that person. MCCAMMON: And Cuban says, as the impact of some of Trump's policy starts to be felt, he thinks more voters will shift away from him, but it might take some time. RASCOE: Sarah, what about all of those center-right activists and disaffected Republicans that Democrats tried to win over last fall? Do the people you talk to think they can make any progress now with Trump and his supporters fully in power? MCCAMMON: I mean, it's been tough. You know, Trump not only won but expanded his coalition. So there are many reasons for these kinds of activists to be discouraged, but organizers and speakers point to what they see as some hopeful early signs - Trump's approval ratings dropping this past week, reports of voters showing up at congressional town halls and protesting. So they believe there is an opportunity at this moment for centrists to work together outside the major party structures to push back against him. FOWLER: And also to Sarah's point, I mean, Trump is not going to be the leader of the Republican Party forever. He's super effective at uniting coalitions both supporting him and opposing him. I mean, Republicans right now are at the pinnacle of power under Trump, but CPAC also didn't give any indication that there's a successor waiting in the wings to keep or grow the disparate groups that support Donald Trump. RASCOE: That's NPR's Stephen Fowler and Sarah McCammon. Thank you so much to you both. MCCAMMON: Thank you. FOWLER: Thank you. Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

President Trump has already rooted out massive waste, fraud and abuse within the federal bureaucracy, crippling the corruption of the deep state. FOWLER: A lot of Trump's agenda is being challenged in court. It's executive action that'll either take time to implement, if it can be implemented at all, but that doesn't really matter as much because Trump is president. He says it's being done, and Republicans do hold all the federal levels of power. I'll also add, a not-too-surprising undercurrent this week for me was Elon Musk and his DOGE effort. Musk was given the rock star treatment at CPAC. And so many speakers made sure to bring up that effort to cut federal spending and reshape the government in a deferential and effusive way usually reserved for Trump. RASCOE: Anti-Trump Republicans often find themselves working with Democrats these days. So, Sarah, what did they have to say about how Democrats have been responding to Trump's first month in office? MCCAMMON: Yeah, I mean, there was plenty of criticism of Trump and Republicans at this event I attended yesterday, but there was also criticism of Democrats. I mean, these are center-right conservatives. I heard more than once that Democrats have failed to communicate to voters that they care about them and understand their concerns. One of the speakers was billionaire Mark Cuban, who endorsed Vice President Harris last year but says he doesn't identify with any party. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARK CUBAN: You know, if you're the Democrats or you're trying to counter them - whether you're a conservative, whatever it may be - you have to recognize, you know, telling this other company's customers that they're dumb doesn't work because they're not dumb, right? They bought into what they saw in that person. MCCAMMON: And Cuban says, as the impact of some of Trump's policy starts to be felt, he thinks more voters will shift away from him, but it might take some time. RASCOE: Sarah, what about all of those center-right activists and disaffected Republicans that Democrats tried to win over last fall? Do the people you talk to think they can make any progress now with Trump and his supporters fully in power? MCCAMMON: I mean, it's been tough. You know, Trump not only won but expanded his coalition. So there are many reasons for these kinds of activists to be discouraged, but organizers and speakers point to what they see as some hopeful early signs - Trump's approval ratings dropping this past week, reports of voters showing up at congressional town halls and protesting. So they believe there is an opportunity at this moment for centrists to work together outside the major party structures to push back against him. FOWLER: And also to Sarah's point, I mean, Trump is not going to be the leader of the Republican Party forever. He's super effective at uniting coalitions both supporting him and opposing him. I mean, Republicans right now are at the pinnacle of power under Trump, but CPAC also didn't give any indication that there's a successor waiting in the wings to keep or grow the disparate groups that support Donald Trump. RASCOE: That's NPR's Stephen Fowler and Sarah McCammon. Thank you so much to you both. MCCAMMON: Thank you. FOWLER: Thank you. Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Nobody's ever seen anything like this, and nobody's ever seen four weeks like we've had. RASCOE: And across town, a smaller group of conservatives who oppose Trump gather to talk about what's next. NPR's Stephen Fowler and Sarah McCammon have been covering these events, and they join us now. Good morning to you both. STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: Good morning. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Hey there. RASCOE: So, Stephen, I'll start with you and CPAC. What did you hear there? FOWLER: CPAC has been around for a while, but since Trump has been on the scene the last decade, you might as well call it TPAC. Here's one of Trump's pollsters, John McLaughlin, speaking just after showing a straw poll of CPAC participants found a 99% approval rating of Trump as president. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: And I said, it's way more popular than even Ronald Reagan was, and I never would have said this back in the day. Donald Trump has literally remade the Conservative movement. He's remade the Republican Party. FOWLER: Not that there's any deviation from Trump and his administration were quashed or silenced this week, but it also stood out to me, Ayesha, how seamlessly Trump 2.0's policies and language and world view are organically reflected in virtually every aspect of CPAC. RASCOE: Sarah, you were at a competing event that continues today. So how are conservatives who oppose Trump feeling right now? MCCAMMON: Well, they're a much smaller group. I attended a summit hosted by a group called Principles First, which began during Trump's first term in opposition to his policies. And speakers there included high-profile anti-Trump Republicans, such as former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. He criticized several of the administration's actions so far, including the firings of federal prosecutors who investigated the January 6 attack on the Capitol. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ALBERTO GONZALES: You're doing your job successfully, and you get fired. That is a complete betrayal. I think it's a betrayal to the American people for the president to pardon particularly those individuals that are dangerous. (APPLAUSE) GONZALES: The president's pardon power is virtually absolute in the Constitution, so I get that he has the authority to do that. There's no question about it. But it was a wrong thing to do. MCCAMMON: And of course, Gonzales is referring there to Trump's pardoning of 1,500 people related to January 6. And he said, you know, without speaking for former President George W. Bush, who he served under, he couldn't imagine Bush pardoning offenders who had harmed police officers or caused damage to the U.S. Capitol. So, Ayesha, this was an opportunity for conservative-leaning activists who've largely given up on today's Republican Party to kind of regroup and try to carve out a space for those anti-Trump conservative voices. RASCOE: Stephen, how are folks at CPAC reacting to Trump's first month in office? FOWLER: I mean, they love it. I want to play some remarks here from Senator Jim Banks of Indiana, who encapsulated the sense that Trump is winning, has won and will continue to win in achieving his campaign promises.

Bush, who he served under, he couldn't imagine Bush pardoning offenders who had harmed police officers or caused damage to the U.S. Capitol. So, Ayesha, this was an opportunity for conservative-leaning activists who've largely given up on today's Republican Party to kind of regroup and try to carve out a space for those anti-Trump conservative voices. RASCOE: Stephen, how are folks at CPAC reacting to Trump's first month in office? FOWLER: I mean, they love it. I want to play some remarks here from Senator Jim Banks of Indiana, who encapsulated the sense that Trump is winning, has won and will continue to win in achieving his campaign promises. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JIM BANKS: Within a short time, we've gotten just a glimpse of the greatness that will define this new era. President Trump has already rooted out massive waste, fraud and abuse within the federal bureaucracy, crippling the corruption of the deep state. FOWLER: A lot of Trump's agenda is being challenged in court. It's executive action that'll either take time to implement, if it can be implemented at all, but that doesn't really matter as much because Trump is president. He says it's being done, and Republicans do hold all the federal levels of power. I'll also add, a not-too-surprising undercurrent this week for me was Elon Musk and his DOGE effort. Musk was given the rock star treatment at CPAC. And so many speakers made sure to bring up that effort to cut federal spending and reshape the government in a deferential and effusive way usually reserved for Trump. RASCOE: Anti-Trump Republicans often find themselves working with Democrats these days. So, Sarah, what did they have to say about how Democrats have been responding to Trump's first month in office? MCCAMMON: Yeah, I mean, there was plenty of criticism of Trump and Republicans at this event I attended yesterday, but there was also criticism of Democrats. I mean, these are center-right conservatives. I heard more than once that Democrats have failed to communicate to voters that they care about them and understand their concerns. One of the speakers was billionaire Mark Cuban, who endorsed Vice President Harris last year but says he doesn't identify with any party. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARK CUBAN: You know, if you're the Democrats or you're trying to counter them - whether you're a conservative, whatever it may be - you have to recognize, you know, telling this other company's customers that they're dumb doesn't work because they're not dumb, right? They bought into what they saw in that person. MCCAMMON: And Cuban says, as the impact of some of Trump's policy starts to be felt, he thinks more voters will shift away from him, but it might take some time. RASCOE: Sarah, what about all of those center-right activists and disaffected Republicans that Democrats tried to win over last fall? Do the people you talk to think they can make any progress now with Trump and his supporters fully in power? MCCAMMON: I mean, it's been tough. You know, Trump not only won but expanded his coalition. So there are many reasons for these kinds of activists to be discouraged, but organizers and speakers point to what they see as some hopeful early signs - Trump's approval ratings dropping this past week, reports of voters showing up at congressional town halls and protesting. So they believe there is an opportunity at this moment for centrists to work together outside the major party structures to push back against him. FOWLER: And also to Sarah's point, I mean, Trump is not going to be the leader of the Republican Party forever. He's super effective at uniting coalitions both supporting him and opposing him. I mean, Republicans right now are at the pinnacle of power under Trump, but CPAC also didn't give any indication that there's a successor waiting in the wings to keep or grow the disparate groups that support Donald Trump. RASCOE: That's NPR's Stephen Fowler and Sarah McCammon. Thank you so much to you both. MCCAMMON: Thank you. FOWLER: Thank you. Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

What did you hear there? FOWLER: CPAC has been around for a while, but since Trump has been on the scene the last decade, you might as well call it TPAC. Here's one of Trump's pollsters, John McLaughlin, speaking just after showing a straw poll of CPAC participants found a 99% approval rating of Trump as president. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: And I said, it's way more popular than even Ronald Reagan was, and I never would have said this back in the day. Donald Trump has literally remade the Conservative movement. He's remade the Republican Party. FOWLER: Not that there's any deviation from Trump and his administration were quashed or silenced this week, but it also stood out to me, Ayesha, how seamlessly Trump 2.0's policies and language and world view are organically reflected in virtually every aspect of CPAC. RASCOE: Sarah, you were at a competing event that continues today. So how are conservatives who oppose Trump feeling right now? MCCAMMON: Well, they're a much smaller group. I attended a summit hosted by a group called Principles First, which began during Trump's first term in opposition to his policies. And speakers there included high-profile anti-Trump Republicans, such as former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. He criticized several of the administration's actions so far, including the firings of federal prosecutors who investigated the January 6 attack on the Capitol. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ALBERTO GONZALES: You're doing your job successfully, and you get fired. That is a complete betrayal. I think it's a betrayal to the American people for the president to pardon particularly those individuals that are dangerous. (APPLAUSE) GONZALES: The president's pardon power is virtually absolute in the Constitution, so I get that he has the authority to do that. There's no question about it. But it was a wrong thing to do. MCCAMMON: And of course, Gonzales is referring there to Trump's pardoning of 1,500 people related to January 6.

Musk was given the rock star treatment at CPAC. And so many speakers made sure to bring up that effort to cut federal spending and reshape the government in a deferential and effusive way usually reserved for Trump. RASCOE: Anti-Trump Republicans often find themselves working with Democrats these days. So, Sarah, what did they have to say about how Democrats have been responding to Trump's first month in office? MCCAMMON: Yeah, I mean, there was plenty of criticism of Trump and Republicans at this event I attended yesterday, but there was also criticism of Democrats. I mean, these are center-right conservatives. I heard more than once that Democrats have failed to communicate to voters that they care about them and understand their concerns. One of the speakers was billionaire Mark Cuban, who endorsed Vice President Harris last year but says he doesn't identify with any party. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARK CUBAN: You know, if you're the Democrats or you're trying to counter them - whether you're a conservative, whatever it may be - you have to recognize, you know, telling this other company's customers that they're dumb doesn't work because they're not dumb, right? They bought into what they saw in that person. MCCAMMON: And Cuban says, as the impact of some of Trump's policy starts to be felt, he thinks more voters will shift away from him, but it might take some time. RASCOE: Sarah, what about all of those center-right activists and disaffected Republicans that Democrats tried to win over last fall? Do the people you talk to think they can make any progress now with Trump and his supporters fully in power? MCCAMMON: I mean, it's been tough. You know, Trump not only won but expanded his coalition. So there are many reasons for these kinds of activists to be discouraged, but organizers and speakers point to what they see as some hopeful early signs - Trump's approval ratings dropping this past week, reports of voters showing up at congressional town halls and protesting. So they believe there is an opportunity at this moment for centrists to work together outside the major party structures to push back against him. FOWLER: And also to Sarah's point, I mean, Trump is not going to be the leader of the Republican Party forever. He's super effective at uniting coalitions both supporting him and opposing him. I mean, Republicans right now are at the pinnacle of power under Trump, but CPAC also didn't give any indication that there's a successor waiting in the wings to keep or grow the disparate groups that support Donald Trump. RASCOE: That's NPR's Stephen Fowler and Sarah McCammon. Thank you so much to you both. MCCAMMON: Thank you. FOWLER: Thank you. Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

FOWLER: CPAC has been around for a while, but since Trump has been on the scene the last decade, you might as well call it TPAC. Here's one of Trump's pollsters, John McLaughlin, speaking just after showing a straw poll of CPAC participants found a 99% approval rating of Trump as president. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: And I said, it's way more popular than even Ronald Reagan was, and I never would have said this back in the day. Donald Trump has literally remade the Conservative movement. He's remade the Republican Party. FOWLER: Not that there's any deviation from Trump and his administration were quashed or silenced this week, but it also stood out to me, Ayesha, how seamlessly Trump 2.0's policies and language and world view are organically reflected in virtually every aspect of CPAC. RASCOE: Sarah, you were at a competing event that continues today. So how are conservatives who oppose Trump feeling right now? MCCAMMON: Well, they're a much smaller group. I attended a summit hosted by a group called Principles First, which began during Trump's first term in opposition to his policies. And speakers there included high-profile anti-Trump Republicans, such as former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. He criticized several of the administration's actions so far, including the firings of federal prosecutors who investigated the January 6 attack on the Capitol. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ALBERTO GONZALES: You're doing your job successfully, and you get fired. That is a complete betrayal. I think it's a betrayal to the American people for the president to pardon particularly those individuals that are dangerous. (APPLAUSE) GONZALES: The president's pardon power is virtually absolute in the Constitution, so I get that he has the authority to do that. There's no question about it. But it was a wrong thing to do. MCCAMMON: And of course, Gonzales is referring there to Trump's pardoning of 1,500 people related to January 6. And he said, you know, without speaking for former President George W. Bush, who he served under, he couldn't imagine Bush pardoning offenders who had harmed police officers or caused damage to the U.S. Capitol. So, Ayesha, this was an opportunity for conservative-leaning activists who've largely given up on today's Republican Party to kind of regroup and try to carve out a space for those anti-Trump conservative voices. RASCOE: Stephen, how are folks at CPAC reacting to Trump's first month in office? FOWLER: I mean, they love it. I want to play some remarks here from Senator Jim Banks of Indiana, who encapsulated the sense that Trump is winning, has won and will continue to win in achieving his campaign promises. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JIM BANKS: Within a short time, we've gotten just a glimpse of the greatness that will define this new era. President Trump has already rooted out massive waste, fraud and abuse within the federal bureaucracy, crippling the corruption of the deep state. FOWLER: A lot of Trump's agenda is being challenged in court. It's executive action that'll either take time to implement, if it can be implemented at all, but that doesn't really matter as much because Trump is president. He says it's being done, and Republicans do hold all the federal levels of power. I'll also add, a not-too-surprising undercurrent this week for me was Elon Musk and his DOGE effort.

RASCOE: That's NPR's Stephen Fowler and Sarah McCammon. Thank you so much to you both. MCCAMMON: Thank you. FOWLER: Thank you. Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Donald Trump has literally remade the Conservative movement. He's remade the Republican Party. FOWLER: Not that there's any deviation from Trump and his administration were quashed or silenced this week, but it also stood out to me, Ayesha, how seamlessly Trump 2.0's policies and language and world view are organically reflected in virtually every aspect of CPAC. RASCOE: Sarah, you were at a competing event that continues today. So how are conservatives who oppose Trump feeling right now? MCCAMMON: Well, they're a much smaller group. I attended a summit hosted by a group called Principles First, which began during Trump's first term in opposition to his policies. And speakers there included high-profile anti-Trump Republicans, such as former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. He criticized several of the administration's actions so far, including the firings of federal prosecutors who investigated the January 6 attack on the Capitol. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ALBERTO GONZALES: You're doing your job successfully, and you get fired. That is a complete betrayal. I think it's a betrayal to the American people for the president to pardon particularly those individuals that are dangerous. (APPLAUSE) GONZALES: The president's pardon power is virtually absolute in the Constitution, so I get that he has the authority to do that. There's no question about it. But it was a wrong thing to do. MCCAMMON: And of course, Gonzales is referring there to Trump's pardoning of 1,500 people related to January 6. And he said, you know, without speaking for former President George W. Bush, who he served under, he couldn't imagine Bush pardoning offenders who had harmed police officers or caused damage to the U.S. Capitol. So, Ayesha, this was an opportunity for conservative-leaning activists who've largely given up on today's Republican Party to kind of regroup and try to carve out a space for those anti-Trump conservative voices. RASCOE: Stephen, how are folks at CPAC reacting to Trump's first month in office? FOWLER: I mean, they love it. I want to play some remarks here from Senator Jim Banks of Indiana, who encapsulated the sense that Trump is winning, has won and will continue to win in achieving his campaign promises. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JIM BANKS: Within a short time, we've gotten just a glimpse of the greatness that will define this new era. President Trump has already rooted out massive waste, fraud and abuse within the federal bureaucracy, crippling the corruption of the deep state. FOWLER: A lot of Trump's agenda is being challenged in court. It's executive action that'll either take time to implement, if it can be implemented at all, but that doesn't really matter as much because Trump is president. He says it's being done, and Republicans do hold all the federal levels of power. I'll also add, a not-too-surprising undercurrent this week for me was Elon Musk and his DOGE effort. Musk was given the rock star treatment at CPAC. And so many speakers made sure to bring up that effort to cut federal spending and reshape the government in a deferential and effusive way usually reserved for Trump. RASCOE: Anti-Trump Republicans often find themselves working with Democrats these days. So, Sarah, what did they have to say about how Democrats have been responding to Trump's first month in office? MCCAMMON: Yeah, I mean, there was plenty of criticism of Trump and Republicans at this event I attended yesterday, but there was also criticism of Democrats. I mean, these are center-right conservatives. I heard more than once that Democrats have failed to communicate to voters that they care about them and understand their concerns. One of the speakers was billionaire Mark Cuban, who endorsed Vice President Harris last year but says he doesn't identify with any party. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARK CUBAN: You know, if you're the Democrats or you're trying to counter them - whether you're a conservative, whatever it may be - you have to recognize, you know, telling this other company's customers that they're dumb doesn't work because they're not dumb, right? They bought into what they saw in that person. MCCAMMON: And Cuban says, as the impact of some of Trump's policy starts to be felt, he thinks more voters will shift away from him, but it might take some time. RASCOE: Sarah, what about all of those center-right activists and disaffected Republicans that Democrats tried to win over last fall? Do the people you talk to think they can make any progress now with Trump and his supporters fully in power? MCCAMMON: I mean, it's been tough. You know, Trump not only won but expanded his coalition. So there are many reasons for these kinds of activists to be discouraged, but organizers and speakers point to what they see as some hopeful early signs - Trump's approval ratings dropping this past week, reports of voters showing up at congressional town halls and protesting. So they believe there is an opportunity at this moment for centrists to work together outside the major party structures to push back against him. FOWLER: And also to Sarah's point, I mean, Trump is not going to be the leader of the Republican Party forever. He's super effective at uniting coalitions both supporting him and opposing him.

So there are many reasons for these kinds of activists to be discouraged, but organizers and speakers point to what they see as some hopeful early signs - Trump's approval ratings dropping this past week, reports of voters showing up at congressional town halls and protesting. So they believe there is an opportunity at this moment for centrists to work together outside the major party structures to push back against him. FOWLER: And also to Sarah's point, I mean, Trump is not going to be the leader of the Republican Party forever. He's super effective at uniting coalitions both supporting him and opposing him. I mean, Republicans right now are at the pinnacle of power under Trump, but CPAC also didn't give any indication that there's a successor waiting in the wings to keep or grow the disparate groups that support Donald Trump. RASCOE: That's NPR's Stephen Fowler and Sarah McCammon. Thank you so much to you both. MCCAMMON: Thank you. FOWLER: Thank you. Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

I attended a summit hosted by a group called Principles First, which began during Trump's first term in opposition to his policies. And speakers there included high-profile anti-Trump Republicans, such as former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. He criticized several of the administration's actions so far, including the firings of federal prosecutors who investigated the January 6 attack on the Capitol. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ALBERTO GONZALES: You're doing your job successfully, and you get fired. That is a complete betrayal. I think it's a betrayal to the American people for the president to pardon particularly those individuals that are dangerous. (APPLAUSE) GONZALES: The president's pardon power is virtually absolute in the Constitution, so I get that he has the authority to do that. There's no question about it. But it was a wrong thing to do. MCCAMMON: And of course, Gonzales is referring there to Trump's pardoning of 1,500 people related to January 6. And he said, you know, without speaking for former President George W. Bush, who he served under, he couldn't imagine Bush pardoning offenders who had harmed police officers or caused damage to the U.S. Capitol. So, Ayesha, this was an opportunity for conservative-leaning activists who've largely given up on today's Republican Party to kind of regroup and try to carve out a space for those anti-Trump conservative voices. RASCOE: Stephen, how are folks at CPAC reacting to Trump's first month in office? FOWLER: I mean, they love it. I want to play some remarks here from Senator Jim Banks of Indiana, who encapsulated the sense that Trump is winning, has won and will continue to win in achieving his campaign promises. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JIM BANKS: Within a short time, we've gotten just a glimpse of the greatness that will define this new era. President Trump has already rooted out massive waste, fraud and abuse within the federal bureaucracy, crippling the corruption of the deep state. FOWLER: A lot of Trump's agenda is being challenged in court. It's executive action that'll either take time to implement, if it can be implemented at all, but that doesn't really matter as much because Trump is president. He says it's being done, and Republicans do hold all the federal levels of power. I'll also add, a not-too-surprising undercurrent this week for me was Elon Musk and his DOGE effort. Musk was given the rock star treatment at CPAC. And so many speakers made sure to bring up that effort to cut federal spending and reshape the government in a deferential and effusive way usually reserved for Trump. RASCOE: Anti-Trump Republicans often find themselves working with Democrats these days. So, Sarah, what did they have to say about how Democrats have been responding to Trump's first month in office? MCCAMMON: Yeah, I mean, there was plenty of criticism of Trump and Republicans at this event I attended yesterday, but there was also criticism of Democrats. I mean, these are center-right conservatives. I heard more than once that Democrats have failed to communicate to voters that they care about them and understand their concerns. One of the speakers was billionaire Mark Cuban, who endorsed Vice President Harris last year but says he doesn't identify with any party. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARK CUBAN: You know, if you're the Democrats or you're trying to counter them - whether you're a conservative, whatever it may be - you have to recognize, you know, telling this other company's customers that they're dumb doesn't work because they're not dumb, right? They bought into what they saw in that person. MCCAMMON: And Cuban says, as the impact of some of Trump's policy starts to be felt, he thinks more voters will shift away from him, but it might take some time. RASCOE: Sarah, what about all of those center-right activists and disaffected Republicans that Democrats tried to win over last fall? Do the people you talk to think they can make any progress now with Trump and his supporters fully in power? MCCAMMON: I mean, it's been tough.

RASCOE: Anti-Trump Republicans often find themselves working with Democrats these days. So, Sarah, what did they have to say about how Democrats have been responding to Trump's first month in office? MCCAMMON: Yeah, I mean, there was plenty of criticism of Trump and Republicans at this event I attended yesterday, but there was also criticism of Democrats. I mean, these are center-right conservatives. I heard more than once that Democrats have failed to communicate to voters that they care about them and understand their concerns. One of the speakers was billionaire Mark Cuban, who endorsed Vice President Harris last year but says he doesn't identify with any party. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARK CUBAN: You know, if you're the Democrats or you're trying to counter them - whether you're a conservative, whatever it may be - you have to recognize, you know, telling this other company's customers that they're dumb doesn't work because they're not dumb, right? They bought into what they saw in that person. MCCAMMON: And Cuban says, as the impact of some of Trump's policy starts to be felt, he thinks more voters will shift away from him, but it might take some time. RASCOE: Sarah, what about all of those center-right activists and disaffected Republicans that Democrats tried to win over last fall? Do the people you talk to think they can make any progress now with Trump and his supporters fully in power? MCCAMMON: I mean, it's been tough. You know, Trump not only won but expanded his coalition. So there are many reasons for these kinds of activists to be discouraged, but organizers and speakers point to what they see as some hopeful early signs - Trump's approval ratings dropping this past week, reports of voters showing up at congressional town halls and protesting. So they believe there is an opportunity at this moment for centrists to work together outside the major party structures to push back against him. FOWLER: And also to Sarah's point, I mean, Trump is not going to be the leader of the Republican Party forever. He's super effective at uniting coalitions both supporting him and opposing him. I mean, Republicans right now are at the pinnacle of power under Trump, but CPAC also didn't give any indication that there's a successor waiting in the wings to keep or grow the disparate groups that support Donald Trump. RASCOE: That's NPR's Stephen Fowler and Sarah McCammon. Thank you so much to you both. MCCAMMON: Thank you. FOWLER: Thank you. Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

There's no question about it. But it was a wrong thing to do. MCCAMMON: And of course, Gonzales is referring there to Trump's pardoning of 1,500 people related to January 6. And he said, you know, without speaking for former President George W. Bush, who he served under, he couldn't imagine Bush pardoning offenders who had harmed police officers or caused damage to the U.S. Capitol. So, Ayesha, this was an opportunity for conservative-leaning activists who've largely given up on today's Republican Party to kind of regroup and try to carve out a space for those anti-Trump conservative voices. RASCOE: Stephen, how are folks at CPAC reacting to Trump's first month in office? FOWLER: I mean, they love it. I want to play some remarks here from Senator Jim Banks of Indiana, who encapsulated the sense that Trump is winning, has won and will continue to win in achieving his campaign promises. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JIM BANKS: Within a short time, we've gotten just a glimpse of the greatness that will define this new era. President Trump has already rooted out massive waste, fraud and abuse within the federal bureaucracy, crippling the corruption of the deep state. FOWLER: A lot of Trump's agenda is being challenged in court. It's executive action that'll either take time to implement, if it can be implemented at all, but that doesn't really matter as much because Trump is president. He says it's being done, and Republicans do hold all the federal levels of power. I'll also add, a not-too-surprising undercurrent this week for me was Elon Musk and his DOGE effort. Musk was given the rock star treatment at CPAC.

I want to play some remarks here from Senator Jim Banks of Indiana, who encapsulated the sense that Trump is winning, has won and will continue to win in achieving his campaign promises. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JIM BANKS: Within a short time, we've gotten just a glimpse of the greatness that will define this new era. President Trump has already rooted out massive waste, fraud and abuse within the federal bureaucracy, crippling the corruption of the deep state. FOWLER: A lot of Trump's agenda is being challenged in court. It's executive action that'll either take time to implement, if it can be implemented at all, but that doesn't really matter as much because Trump is president. He says it's being done, and Republicans do hold all the federal levels of power. I'll also add, a not-too-surprising undercurrent this week for me was Elon Musk and his DOGE effort. Musk was given the rock star treatment at CPAC. And so many speakers made sure to bring up that effort to cut federal spending and reshape the government in a deferential and effusive way usually reserved for Trump. RASCOE: Anti-Trump Republicans often find themselves working with Democrats these days. So, Sarah, what did they have to say about how Democrats have been responding to Trump's first month in office? MCCAMMON: Yeah, I mean, there was plenty of criticism of Trump and Republicans at this event I attended yesterday, but there was also criticism of Democrats. I mean, these are center-right conservatives. I heard more than once that Democrats have failed to communicate to voters that they care about them and understand their concerns. One of the speakers was billionaire Mark Cuban, who endorsed Vice President Harris last year but says he doesn't identify with any party. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARK CUBAN: You know, if you're the Democrats or you're trying to counter them - whether you're a conservative, whatever it may be - you have to recognize, you know, telling this other company's customers that they're dumb doesn't work because they're not dumb, right? They bought into what they saw in that person. MCCAMMON: And Cuban says, as the impact of some of Trump's policy starts to be felt, he thinks more voters will shift away from him, but it might take some time. RASCOE: Sarah, what about all of those center-right activists and disaffected Republicans that Democrats tried to win over last fall? Do the people you talk to think they can make any progress now with Trump and his supporters fully in power? MCCAMMON: I mean, it's been tough. You know, Trump not only won but expanded his coalition. So there are many reasons for these kinds of activists to be discouraged, but organizers and speakers point to what they see as some hopeful early signs - Trump's approval ratings dropping this past week, reports of voters showing up at congressional town halls and protesting. So they believe there is an opportunity at this moment for centrists to work together outside the major party structures to push back against him. FOWLER: And also to Sarah's point, I mean, Trump is not going to be the leader of the Republican Party forever. He's super effective at uniting coalitions both supporting him and opposing him. I mean, Republicans right now are at the pinnacle of power under Trump, but CPAC also didn't give any indication that there's a successor waiting in the wings to keep or grow the disparate groups that support Donald Trump. RASCOE: That's NPR's Stephen Fowler and Sarah McCammon. Thank you so much to you both. MCCAMMON: Thank you. FOWLER: Thank you. Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

You know, Trump not only won but expanded his coalition. So there are many reasons for these kinds of activists to be discouraged, but organizers and speakers point to what they see as some hopeful early signs - Trump's approval ratings dropping this past week, reports of voters showing up at congressional town halls and protesting. So they believe there is an opportunity at this moment for centrists to work together outside the major party structures to push back against him. FOWLER: And also to Sarah's point, I mean, Trump is not going to be the leader of the Republican Party forever. He's super effective at uniting coalitions both supporting him and opposing him. I mean, Republicans right now are at the pinnacle of power under Trump, but CPAC also didn't give any indication that there's a successor waiting in the wings to keep or grow the disparate groups that support Donald Trump. RASCOE: That's NPR's Stephen Fowler and Sarah McCammon. Thank you so much to you both. MCCAMMON: Thank you. FOWLER: Thank you. Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

So, Sarah, what did they have to say about how Democrats have been responding to Trump's first month in office? MCCAMMON: Yeah, I mean, there was plenty of criticism of Trump and Republicans at this event I attended yesterday, but there was also criticism of Democrats. I mean, these are center-right conservatives. I heard more than once that Democrats have failed to communicate to voters that they care about them and understand their concerns. One of the speakers was billionaire Mark Cuban, who endorsed Vice President Harris last year but says he doesn't identify with any party. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARK CUBAN: You know, if you're the Democrats or you're trying to counter them - whether you're a conservative, whatever it may be - you have to recognize, you know, telling this other company's customers that they're dumb doesn't work because they're not dumb, right? They bought into what they saw in that person. MCCAMMON: And Cuban says, as the impact of some of Trump's policy starts to be felt, he thinks more voters will shift away from him, but it might take some time.

These conservatives are trying to change that\n\nXimena Bustillo\n\nLeft to right: Danielle Butcher Franz, Karly Matthews, Stephen Perkins and Benji Backer talking about plans for the second day of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Grace Widyatmadja/NPR hide caption\n\nTucked into a hallway at the Republican National Convention, between booths promoting the Second Amendment and another selling official merchandise of the Trump Campaign, sat a sprawling display of the conservative legacy in environmentalism.\n\nYoung conservatives ran back and forth asking convention goers with Nixon pins if they were familiar with former President Richard Nixon's environmental policy. They approached oil lobbyists about the need for climate change conversations. They handed out stickers to rising young Republican voters.\n\n\"The word 'Conservative' is in 'conservation,'\" said Aidan Shank, one member of the American Conservation Coalition, the environmental group that set up the booth.\n\nFor years, the Republican Party has gotten a reputation for denying climate science and the urgency of global warming. Their statements about the environment usually focus on burning more fossil fuels, the biggest driver of climate change.\n\nStephen Perkins, Chief Operating Officer, and Karly Matthews, Vice President of Communication of ACC, walk towards Baird Center were American Conservation Coalition is hosting a booth at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Grace Widyatmadja/NPR hide caption\n\nAidan Shank talking to a guest at the ACC Exhibition booth in Baird Center. Grace Widyatmadja/NPR hide caption\n\nBut this year, for the first time in recent memory, conservatives had a climate showing at the Republican National Convention. The leadership of the American Conservation Coalition (ACC) flew to Milwaukee for a week of conversations around climate, conservation, and energy. They kept up efforts to win delegates' attention and support, even as their party nominated former President Donald Trump, who doesn't acknowledge the full effects of human-caused climate change and has vowed to rescind many of President Biden's climate-related investments.\n\nYoung conservatives are likely to support Trump this November. Still, they want to see their party talk about climate and energy policy. They see potential for a Trump administration to prioritize domestic production of clean energy. Unlike their Democratic counterparts-and prevailing climate science-they also still back oil and gas development.\n\n\"We can be hopeful. And our approach has always been to work with people where we can,\" said Danielle Butcher Franz, CEO of ACC. She added: \"We really are using this RNC to introduce ourselves to the base, and to stakeholders, and to say there's a better way to do environmental policy.\"\n\nOn their first morning in Milwaukee, six members of ACC got ready at an Airbnb for their convention debut. Decked out with their American flag caps, brown Tevoca boots, American flag belt and button-up shirt with bison, they planned out their RNC reception event schedule: arrive at 1 pm, do a reception hosted by another group, and have time to visit, talk to dozens of people over five hours.\n\nACC was an RNC sponsor, cementing its mark at the Republican gathering. It's considered a significant milestone for the group, which formed in 2017 during the first Trump administration.\n\nAt its inception, it quickly attracted young politicos like Stephen Perkins, the 29-year-old chief operating officer of ACC.\n\nLeft to right: Danielle Butcher Franz, Stephen Perkins, Benji Backer and Chris Barnard getting ready at ACC's airbnb ahead of the second day of the Republican National Convention. Grace Widyatmadja/NPR hide caption\n\n\"I grew up going camping and with my dad and fishing and all that sort of stuff. And so we've always had an appreciation for the environment and the outdoors,\" said Perkins, of the Texas places he grew up in and loved. \"As I got more involved in politics, the issues that I gravitated toward were the tougher ones.\"\n\nPerkins likes to talk to fellow young conservatives about the impact of climate change on most policy issues. He recalled when one young Republican told him that he didn't care about climate - that he was more concerned about immigration. Perkins had an answer for him.\n\n\"Not the only reason, but a big reason why people are coming here is many of them are climate refugees,\" Perkins said of the explanation he gave about immigration \"There are places where whether it's flooding or extreme heat, they're coming here to escape that. And so there's actually a connection.\"\n\nGenerally, Republicans have not seen climate as their issue. And leaders, like Trump and Vance, have championed fossil fuel production over conservation and climate action.\n\n\"He's (Trump) not perfect. We certainly recognize that. He needs to talk about climate change,\" Perkins said. \"But when you talk about seven years ago when ACC was started, you couldn't get Republican elected officials to even talk about climate change.\"\n\nAidan Shank, Brian Martinez and Michael Esposito take a photo with Republican Senator of Indiana, Mike Braun, at ACC's booth in Baird Center during the second day of the Republican National Convention. Grace Widyatmadja/NPR hide caption\n\nACC's booth at Baird Center on the second day of the Republican National Convention. Grace Widyatmadja/NPR hide caption\n\nSome of that has evolved. During the first GOP debate, an ACC member asked presidential candidates running against Trump how they would ease fears that the GOP doesn't care about climate. There were few direct answers.\n\nAlthough climate is not a top issue for Republicans, i t does rank higher on the list of policy priorities for younger Republican s. The steps are small but ACC hopes a younger generation of conservatives can reframe the conversation. One way of doing so was with the large booth at the convention.\n\nMost visitors were curious and generally supportive. They picked up stickers, and fliers and colored a large poster that spelled out the word \"legacy.\"\n\nThere was the occasional pushback - like an oil lobbyist who denied climate change.\n\n\"Approaching every conversation with empathy is the first place to begin,\" said Aidan Shank, who was staffing the ACC table. \"There's so many places where we can agree, and just assuming that the conversation revolves around finding those agreements, sometimes that's the most constructive way to create dialogue.\"\n\nThe leaders at ACC wanted to create the organization in order to facilitate the conversations Shank is having at the convention now. Like Perkins, Danielle Butcher Franz grew up in the outdoors. Raised in a more liberal family, she said she never thought of the environment as a partisan issue, until she started talking to others.\n\n\"As we would speak to our peers, we would notice over and over them saying things like, 'I'm conservative except on the environment' or 'I want to support Democrats because of climate change,'\" Butcher Franz said.\n\nThough she generally feels welcome in her conservative spaces, she at first had to fight stereotypes.\n\nDanielle Butcher Franz and Chris Barnard listen as guests speak at the Conservative Climate Reception held at Mitchell Park Domes in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on the second day of the Republican National Convention. Grace Widyatmadja/NPR hide caption\n\nThe Conservative Climate Reception held at Mitchell Park Domes in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on the second day of the Republican National Convention. Grace Widyatmadja/NPR hide caption\n\n\"On the right, you would sort of have this skepticism of, 'Are you really conservatives, or is this like a Trojan horse for big government solutions that we don't agree with?' \" Butcher Franz said, noting that she also pushes back against stereotypes about Republican interest in climate.\n\n\"It can be frustrating to have to constantly feel like you're in myth-busting mode, and you have to constantly dispel these preconceived notions that people have about what you believe and what you stand for,\" Butcher Franz said.\n\nLater in the day, the group gathers inside the Mitchell Park Domes Horticulture Conservatory to host a reception with dozens of guests and to talk about energy innovation, and Republicans' long involvement with the environment. Mainly, they wanted to celebrate being at the convention.\n\nNearly all the speakers acknowledged that this kind of convention presence was new and signals a turning tide. In remarks, ACC President Chris Barnard noted that he believed this was a historic event. \"This is the first time something like this has happened at a Republican convention - we have a conservative climate reception,\" he proudly told the crowd.\n\nTalking with NPR, Barnard says he still feels like there is a stereotype that to care about climate or conservation is to be a Democrat. But he wants to see the GOP - even Trump and Vance - to take advantage of the issue.\n\nChris Barnard speaks at the Conservative Climate Reception held at Mitchell Park Domes in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on the second day of the Republican National Convention. Grace Widyatmadja/NPR hide caption\n\n\"It's politically very popular,\" Barnard said. \"And so the first thing to say really is that for anyone in the Republican Party, that's not championing that message: That's really just a lost opportunity.\"\n\nBarnard saw speaking to delegates and other 2024 candidates at the convention as a foot in the door. And he hopes ACC's conversations, the booth and receptions encourage them to address climate in their local races.\n\n\"It's important to talk to them and kind of equip them with the messaging and how they can talk about these issues,\" Barnard said. \"And hoping that there's a good opportunity to work with Republicans on important environmental and climate policies.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "How empathy came to be seen as a weakness in conservative circles\n\nSarah McCammon\n\nThere's a growing movement, among some conservatives, pushing back against traditional notions of empathy. What's behind it, and what might it mean, especially for Christian conservatives?\n\nSARAH MCCAMMON, HOST: People tend to think of empathy or caring about other people's feelings as a good thing, but in some conservative circles, there's a growing chorus of voices arguing that empathy could be bad. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE JOE ROGAN EXPERIENCE\") ELON MUSK: The fundamental weakness of Western civilization is empathy. MCCAMMON: That's billionaire Elon Musk, speaking recently on the podcast \"The Joe Rogan Experience.\" They were discussing the idea that unchecked immigration into Western countries is threatening Western political and cultural values. Musk agrees and warns that societies are at risk of self-destructing. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE JOE ROGAN EXPERIENCE\") MUSK: There's so much empathy that you actually suicide yourself. JOE ROGAN: Yeah. MUSK: So that - we've got civilizational suicidal empathy going on. MCCAMMON: Musk, of course, is a close adviser to President Trump and the leader of the administration's DOGE initiative, which is making massive cuts to the federal government, including humanitarian programs at home and overseas. Musk said empathy can be good, but it's too often weaponized to persuade well-meaning people to support bad ideas. In recent months, several high-profile Christian conservatives have been sounding similar warnings. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"STRONGER MEN NATION\") JOSH MCPHERSON: Empathy almost needs to be struck from the Christian vocabulary. UNIDENTIFIED PASTOR #1: It does. UNIDENTIFIED PASTOR #2: Yes. MCPHERSON: Empathy is dangerous. Empathy is toxic. Empathy will align you with hell. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"FAMILY TALK\") ALLIE BETH STUCKEY: Really, I think empathy as hoisted up as the highest virtue, or even a virtue at all - I think that really gets us into a really big mess. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THINKING IN PUBLIC\") JOE RIGNEY: Most people have a hard time imagining how empathy could ever be harmful. And therefore, if I'm the devil, where am I going to hide some of my most destructive tactics? MCCAMMON: That was pastor Josh McPherson on his podcast, \"Stronger Man Nation,\" conservative commentator Allie Beth Stuckey on the \"Family Talk\" podcast, and author Joe Rigney, discussing his book, \"The Sin Of Empathy,\" on a podcast hosted by Al Mohler of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. New York Times columnist David French has noticed this discourse and wrote about it in a recent column called \"Behold The Strange Spectacle Of Christians Against Empathy.\" French says Jesus - the central figure in Christianity - embodied empathy by coming to Earth as a man and enduring the human experience. French notes that Trump has cut programs long supported by many evangelicals and conservative Catholics, including funding for religious organizations that help the poor. DAVID FRENCH: So how do you rationalize this change? And I think that that's why some of these arguments about toxic empathy and other concepts are falling upon willing and open ears because they're - people are looking for a moral frame around which they can fit the Trump movement, and decrying empathy helps them do that. MCCAMMON: Some conservatives also argue that women are especially susceptible to being misled by appeals to empathy, often when it comes to helping people who are suffering or in need. Here's Allie Beth Stuckey on \"Family Talk.\" (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"FAMILY TALK\") STUCKEY: They'll use emotional, compassionate, kind-sounding language in order to get a woman to think, well, in order to be a good person, in order to be kind, in order to even love my neighbor, then I have to be pro-open borders. I have to be pro-LGBTQ. I have to be pro-choice. MCCAMMON: In an interview with NPR, Joe Rigney said he believes women are more naturally empathetic, which makes them better nurturers. Rigney says they're also more likely to reject church teachings they see as lacking compassion. RIGNEY: And in that kind of context, the empathetic sex is ill-suited precisely because of the ways that that empathy could be manipulated into, say, refusing to draw lines or in the name of helping a oppressed group, we're going to abandon our biblical confession or something like that. MCCAMMON: David French, meanwhile, says the idea that women are uniquely vulnerable to manipulation ties in closely with Christian nationalism, the idea that Christian men should run the country. FRENCH: And so you do have quite a bit of literature in the far right - the Christian nationalist right - that is decrying what they see as the, quote, \"feminized church, feminized political discourse.\" They say that America is a gynocracy, is what they will call it. And that empathy element is a part of their argument. MCCAMMON: Rigney says he wouldn't flinch from being described as a Christian nationalist. RIGNEY: And I want society to be Christian. So, yes, I think it's true. I think it's good for the world, and I think it's, quite frankly, good for religious minorities. I think that, in many ways, in the absence of that, tyranny is inevitable. MCCAMMON: French says he worries that some Christians have shifted from fighting for religious freedom to fighting for Christian dominance. But when it comes to calls for public policies grounded in empathy, he acknowledges that everyone has to draw lines somewhere. FRENCH: There are times when the head has to overrule the heart. That is something that has to happen sometimes in public policy. But at the same time, there should be no objection to appeals to the heart because our compassion, our empathy is a fundamental part of who we should be as human beings. MCCAMMON: French says there's nothing really new about accusing one's political opponents of appealing to emotion rather than logic, but he argues there should be room in our political discourse for both.

FRENCH: And so you do have quite a bit of literature in the far right - the Christian nationalist right - that is decrying what they see as the, quote, \"feminized church, feminized political discourse.\" They say that America is a gynocracy, is what they will call it. And that empathy element is a part of their argument. MCCAMMON: Rigney says he wouldn't flinch from being described as a Christian nationalist. RIGNEY: And I want society to be Christian. So, yes, I think it's true. I think it's good for the world, and I think it's, quite frankly, good for religious minorities. I think that, in many ways, in the absence of that, tyranny is inevitable. MCCAMMON: French says he worries that some Christians have shifted from fighting for religious freedom to fighting for Christian dominance. But when it comes to calls for public policies grounded in empathy, he acknowledges that everyone has to draw lines somewhere. FRENCH: There are times when the head has to overrule the heart. That is something that has to happen sometimes in public policy. But at the same time, there should be no objection to appeals to the heart because our compassion, our empathy is a fundamental part of who we should be as human beings. MCCAMMON: French says there's nothing really new about accusing one's political opponents of appealing to emotion rather than logic, but he argues there should be room in our political discourse for both.

MCCAMMON: That's billionaire Elon Musk, speaking recently on the podcast \"The Joe Rogan Experience.\" They were discussing the idea that unchecked immigration into Western countries is threatening Western political and cultural values. Musk agrees and warns that societies are at risk of self-destructing. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE JOE ROGAN EXPERIENCE\") MUSK: There's so much empathy that you actually suicide yourself. JOE ROGAN: Yeah. MUSK: So that - we've got civilizational suicidal empathy going on. MCCAMMON: Musk, of course, is a close adviser to President Trump and the leader of the administration's DOGE initiative, which is making massive cuts to the federal government, including humanitarian programs at home and overseas. Musk said empathy can be good, but it's too often weaponized to persuade well-meaning people to support bad ideas. In recent months, several high-profile Christian conservatives have been sounding similar warnings. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"STRONGER MEN NATION\") JOSH MCPHERSON: Empathy almost needs to be struck from the Christian vocabulary. UNIDENTIFIED PASTOR #1: It does. UNIDENTIFIED PASTOR #2: Yes. MCPHERSON: Empathy is dangerous. Empathy is toxic. Empathy will align you with hell. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"FAMILY TALK\") ALLIE BETH STUCKEY: Really, I think empathy as hoisted up as the highest virtue, or even a virtue at all - I think that really gets us into a really big mess. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THINKING IN PUBLIC\") JOE RIGNEY: Most people have a hard time imagining how empathy could ever be harmful. And therefore, if I'm the devil, where am I going to hide some of my most destructive tactics? MCCAMMON: That was pastor Josh McPherson on his podcast, \"Stronger Man Nation,\" conservative commentator Allie Beth Stuckey on the \"Family Talk\" podcast, and author Joe Rigney, discussing his book, \"The Sin Of Empathy,\" on a podcast hosted by Al Mohler of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. New York Times columnist David French has noticed this discourse and wrote about it in a recent column called \"Behold The Strange Spectacle Of Christians Against Empathy.\" French says Jesus - the central figure in Christianity - embodied empathy by coming to Earth as a man and enduring the human experience. French notes that Trump has cut programs long supported by many evangelicals and conservative Catholics, including funding for religious organizations that help the poor. DAVID FRENCH: So how do you rationalize this change? And I think that that's why some of these arguments about toxic empathy and other concepts are falling upon willing and open ears because they're - people are looking for a moral frame around which they can fit the Trump movement, and decrying empathy helps them do that. MCCAMMON: Some conservatives also argue that women are especially susceptible to being misled by appeals to empathy, often when it comes to helping people who are suffering or in need. Here's Allie Beth Stuckey on \"Family Talk.\" (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"FAMILY TALK\") STUCKEY: They'll use emotional, compassionate, kind-sounding language in order to get a woman to think, well, in order to be a good person, in order to be kind, in order to even love my neighbor, then I have to be pro-open borders. I have to be pro-LGBTQ. I have to be pro-choice. MCCAMMON: In an interview with NPR, Joe Rigney said he believes women are more naturally empathetic, which makes them better nurturers. Rigney says they're also more likely to reject church teachings they see as lacking compassion. RIGNEY: And in that kind of context, the empathetic sex is ill-suited precisely because of the ways that that empathy could be manipulated into, say, refusing to draw lines or in the name of helping a oppressed group, we're going to abandon our biblical confession or something like that.

FRENCH: And so you do have quite a bit of literature in the far right - the Christian nationalist right - that is decrying what they see as the, quote, \"feminized church, feminized political discourse.\" They say that America is a gynocracy, is what they will call it. And that empathy element is a part of their argument. MCCAMMON: Rigney says he wouldn't flinch from being described as a Christian nationalist. RIGNEY: And I want society to be Christian. So, yes, I think it's true. I think it's good for the world, and I think it's, quite frankly, good for religious minorities. I think that, in many ways, in the absence of that, tyranny is inevitable. MCCAMMON: French says he worries that some Christians have shifted from fighting for religious freedom to fighting for Christian dominance. But when it comes to calls for public policies grounded in empathy, he acknowledges that everyone has to draw lines somewhere. FRENCH: There are times when the head has to overrule the heart. That is something that has to happen sometimes in public policy. But at the same time, there should be no objection to appeals to the heart because our compassion, our empathy is a fundamental part of who we should be as human beings. MCCAMMON: French says there's nothing really new about accusing one's political opponents of appealing to emotion rather than logic, but he argues there should be room in our political discourse for both.

JOE ROGAN: Yeah. MUSK: So that - we've got civilizational suicidal empathy going on. MCCAMMON: Musk, of course, is a close adviser to President Trump and the leader of the administration's DOGE initiative, which is making massive cuts to the federal government, including humanitarian programs at home and overseas. Musk said empathy can be good, but it's too often weaponized to persuade well-meaning people to support bad ideas. In recent months, several high-profile Christian conservatives have been sounding similar warnings. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"STRONGER MEN NATION\") JOSH MCPHERSON: Empathy almost needs to be struck from the Christian vocabulary. UNIDENTIFIED PASTOR #1: It does. UNIDENTIFIED PASTOR #2: Yes. MCPHERSON: Empathy is dangerous. Empathy is toxic. Empathy will align you with hell. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"FAMILY TALK\") ALLIE BETH STUCKEY: Really, I think empathy as hoisted up as the highest virtue, or even a virtue at all - I think that really gets us into a really big mess. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THINKING IN PUBLIC\") JOE RIGNEY: Most people have a hard time imagining how empathy could ever be harmful. And therefore, if I'm the devil, where am I going to hide some of my most destructive tactics? MCCAMMON: That was pastor Josh McPherson on his podcast, \"Stronger Man Nation,\" conservative commentator Allie Beth Stuckey on the \"Family Talk\" podcast, and author Joe Rigney, discussing his book, \"The Sin Of Empathy,\" on a podcast hosted by Al Mohler of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. New York Times columnist David French has noticed this discourse and wrote about it in a recent column called \"Behold The Strange Spectacle Of Christians Against Empathy.\" French says Jesus - the central figure in Christianity - embodied empathy by coming to Earth as a man and enduring the human experience. French notes that Trump has cut programs long supported by many evangelicals and conservative Catholics, including funding for religious organizations that help the poor. DAVID FRENCH: So how do you rationalize this change? And I think that that's why some of these arguments about toxic empathy and other concepts are falling upon willing and open ears because they're - people are looking for a moral frame around which they can fit the Trump movement, and decrying empathy helps them do that. MCCAMMON: Some conservatives also argue that women are especially susceptible to being misled by appeals to empathy, often when it comes to helping people who are suffering or in need. Here's Allie Beth Stuckey on \"Family Talk.\" (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"FAMILY TALK\") STUCKEY: They'll use emotional, compassionate, kind-sounding language in order to get a woman to think, well, in order to be a good person, in order to be kind, in order to even love my neighbor, then I have to be pro-open borders. I have to be pro-LGBTQ. I have to be pro-choice. MCCAMMON: In an interview with NPR, Joe Rigney said he believes women are more naturally empathetic, which makes them better nurturers. Rigney says they're also more likely to reject church teachings they see as lacking compassion. RIGNEY: And in that kind of context, the empathetic sex is ill-suited precisely because of the ways that that empathy could be manipulated into, say, refusing to draw lines or in the name of helping a oppressed group, we're going to abandon our biblical confession or something like that.

MCPHERSON: Empathy is dangerous. Empathy is toxic. Empathy will align you with hell. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"FAMILY TALK\") ALLIE BETH STUCKEY: Really, I think empathy as hoisted up as the highest virtue, or even a virtue at all - I think that really gets us into a really big mess. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THINKING IN PUBLIC\") JOE RIGNEY: Most people have a hard time imagining how empathy could ever be harmful. And therefore, if I'm the devil, where am I going to hide some of my most destructive tactics? MCCAMMON: That was pastor Josh McPherson on his podcast, \"Stronger Man Nation,\" conservative commentator Allie Beth Stuckey on the \"Family Talk\" podcast, and author Joe Rigney, discussing his book, \"The Sin Of Empathy,\" on a podcast hosted by Al Mohler of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. New York Times columnist David French has noticed this discourse and wrote about it in a recent column called \"Behold The Strange Spectacle Of Christians Against Empathy.\" French says Jesus - the central figure in Christianity - embodied empathy by coming to Earth as a man and enduring the human experience. French notes that Trump has cut programs long supported by many evangelicals and conservative Catholics, including funding for religious organizations that help the poor. DAVID FRENCH: So how do you rationalize this change? And I think that that's why some of these arguments about toxic empathy and other concepts are falling upon willing and open ears because they're - people are looking for a moral frame around which they can fit the Trump movement, and decrying empathy helps them do that. MCCAMMON: Some conservatives also argue that women are especially susceptible to being misled by appeals to empathy, often when it comes to helping people who are suffering or in need. Here's Allie Beth Stuckey on \"Family Talk.\" (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"FAMILY TALK\") STUCKEY: They'll use emotional, compassionate, kind-sounding language in order to get a woman to think, well, in order to be a good person, in order to be kind, in order to even love my neighbor, then I have to be pro-open borders. I have to be pro-LGBTQ. I have to be pro-choice. MCCAMMON: In an interview with NPR, Joe Rigney said he believes women are more naturally empathetic, which makes them better nurturers. Rigney says they're also more likely to reject church teachings they see as lacking compassion. RIGNEY: And in that kind of context, the empathetic sex is ill-suited precisely because of the ways that that empathy could be manipulated into, say, refusing to draw lines or in the name of helping a oppressed group, we're going to abandon our biblical confession or something like that. MCCAMMON: David French, meanwhile, says the idea that women are uniquely vulnerable to manipulation ties in closely with Christian nationalism, the idea that Christian men should run the country. FRENCH: And so you do have quite a bit of literature in the far right - the Christian nationalist right - that is decrying what they see as the, quote, \"feminized church, feminized political discourse.\" They say that America is a gynocracy, is what they will call it. And that empathy element is a part of their argument. MCCAMMON: Rigney says he wouldn't flinch from being described as a Christian nationalist. RIGNEY: And I want society to be Christian. So, yes, I think it's true. I think it's good for the world, and I think it's, quite frankly, good for religious minorities. I think that, in many ways, in the absence of that, tyranny is inevitable. MCCAMMON: French says he worries that some Christians have shifted from fighting for religious freedom to fighting for Christian dominance. But when it comes to calls for public policies grounded in empathy, he acknowledges that everyone has to draw lines somewhere. FRENCH: There are times when the head has to overrule the heart. That is something that has to happen sometimes in public policy. But at the same time, there should be no objection to appeals to the heart because our compassion, our empathy is a fundamental part of who we should be as human beings. MCCAMMON: French says there's nothing really new about accusing one's political opponents of appealing to emotion rather than logic, but he argues there should be room in our political discourse for both.

MCCAMMON: Musk, of course, is a close adviser to President Trump and the leader of the administration's DOGE initiative, which is making massive cuts to the federal government, including humanitarian programs at home and overseas.

(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"FAMILY TALK\") ALLIE BETH STUCKEY: Really, I think empathy as hoisted up as the highest virtue, or even a virtue at all - I think that really gets us into a really big mess. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THINKING IN PUBLIC\") JOE RIGNEY: Most people have a hard time imagining how empathy could ever be harmful. And therefore, if I'm the devil, where am I going to hide some of my most destructive tactics? MCCAMMON: That was pastor Josh McPherson on his podcast, \"Stronger Man Nation,\" conservative commentator Allie Beth Stuckey on the \"Family Talk\" podcast, and author Joe Rigney, discussing his book, \"The Sin Of Empathy,\" on a podcast hosted by Al Mohler of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. New York Times columnist David French has noticed this discourse and wrote about it in a recent column called \"Behold The Strange Spectacle Of Christians Against Empathy.\" French says Jesus - the central figure in Christianity - embodied empathy by coming to Earth as a man and enduring the human experience. French notes that Trump has cut programs long supported by many evangelicals and conservative Catholics, including funding for religious organizations that help the poor. DAVID FRENCH: So how do you rationalize this change? And I think that that's why some of these arguments about toxic empathy and other concepts are falling upon willing and open ears because they're - people are looking for a moral frame around which they can fit the Trump movement, and decrying empathy helps them do that. MCCAMMON: Some conservatives also argue that women are especially susceptible to being misled by appeals to empathy, often when it comes to helping people who are suffering or in need. Here's Allie Beth Stuckey on \"Family Talk.\" (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"FAMILY TALK\") STUCKEY: They'll use emotional, compassionate, kind-sounding language in order to get a woman to think, well, in order to be a good person, in order to be kind, in order to even love my neighbor, then I have to be pro-open borders. I have to be pro-LGBTQ. I have to be pro-choice. MCCAMMON: In an interview with NPR, Joe Rigney said he believes women are more naturally empathetic, which makes them better nurturers. Rigney says they're also more likely to reject church teachings they see as lacking compassion. RIGNEY: And in that kind of context, the empathetic sex is ill-suited precisely because of the ways that that empathy could be manipulated into, say, refusing to draw lines or in the name of helping a oppressed group, we're going to abandon our biblical confession or something like that. MCCAMMON: David French, meanwhile, says the idea that women are uniquely vulnerable to manipulation ties in closely with Christian nationalism, the idea that Christian men should run the country. FRENCH: And so you do have quite a bit of literature in the far right - the Christian nationalist right - that is decrying what they see as the, quote, \"feminized church, feminized political discourse.\" They say that America is a gynocracy, is what they will call it. And that empathy element is a part of their argument. MCCAMMON: Rigney says he wouldn't flinch from being described as a Christian nationalist. RIGNEY: And I want society to be Christian. So, yes, I think it's true. I think it's good for the world, and I think it's, quite frankly, good for religious minorities. I think that, in many ways, in the absence of that, tyranny is inevitable. MCCAMMON: French says he worries that some Christians have shifted from fighting for religious freedom to fighting for Christian dominance. But when it comes to calls for public policies grounded in empathy, he acknowledges that everyone has to draw lines somewhere. FRENCH: There are times when the head has to overrule the heart. That is something that has to happen sometimes in public policy. But at the same time, there should be no objection to appeals to the heart because our compassion, our empathy is a fundamental part of who we should be as human beings. MCCAMMON: French says there's nothing really new about accusing one's political opponents of appealing to emotion rather than logic, but he argues there should be room in our political discourse for both.

FRENCH: And so you do have quite a bit of literature in the far right - the Christian nationalist right - that is decrying what they see as the, quote, \"feminized church, feminized political discourse.\" They say that America is a gynocracy, is what they will call it. And that empathy element is a part of their argument. MCCAMMON: Rigney says he wouldn't flinch from being described as a Christian nationalist. RIGNEY: And I want society to be Christian. So, yes, I think it's true. I think it's good for the world, and I think it's, quite frankly, good for religious minorities. I think that, in many ways, in the absence of that, tyranny is inevitable. MCCAMMON: French says he worries that some Christians have shifted from fighting for religious freedom to fighting for Christian dominance. But when it comes to calls for public policies grounded in empathy, he acknowledges that everyone has to draw lines somewhere. FRENCH: There are times when the head has to overrule the heart. That is something that has to happen sometimes in public policy. But at the same time, there should be no objection to appeals to the heart because our compassion, our empathy is a fundamental part of who we should be as human beings. MCCAMMON: French says there's nothing really new about accusing one's political opponents of appealing to emotion rather than logic, but he argues there should be room in our political discourse for both.

MCCAMMON: That was pastor Josh McPherson on his podcast, \"Stronger Man Nation,\" conservative commentator Allie Beth Stuckey on the \"Family Talk\" podcast, and author Joe Rigney, discussing his book, \"The Sin Of Empathy,\" on a podcast hosted by Al Mohler of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. New York Times columnist David French has noticed this discourse and wrote about it in a recent column called \"Behold The Strange Spectacle Of Christians Against Empathy.\" French says Jesus - the central figure in Christianity - embodied empathy by coming to Earth as a man and enduring the human experience. French notes that Trump has cut programs long supported by many evangelicals and conservative Catholics, including funding for religious organizations that help the poor. DAVID FRENCH: So how do you rationalize this change? And I think that that's why some of these arguments about toxic empathy and other concepts are falling upon willing and open ears because they're - people are looking for a moral frame around which they can fit the Trump movement, and decrying empathy helps them do that. MCCAMMON: Some conservatives also argue that women are especially susceptible to being misled by appeals to empathy, often when it comes to helping people who are suffering or in need. Here's Allie Beth Stuckey on \"Family Talk.\" (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"FAMILY TALK\") STUCKEY: They'll use emotional, compassionate, kind-sounding language in order to get a woman to think, well, in order to be a good person, in order to be kind, in order to even love my neighbor, then I have to be pro-open borders. I have to be pro-LGBTQ. I have to be pro-choice. MCCAMMON: In an interview with NPR, Joe Rigney said he believes women are more naturally empathetic, which makes them better nurturers.

So, yes, I think it's true. I think it's good for the world, and I think it's, quite frankly, good for religious minorities. I think that, in many ways, in the absence of that, tyranny is inevitable. MCCAMMON: French says he worries that some Christians have shifted from fighting for religious freedom to fighting for Christian dominance. But when it comes to calls for public policies grounded in empathy, he acknowledges that everyone has to draw lines somewhere. FRENCH: There are times when the head has to overrule the heart. That is something that has to happen sometimes in public policy. But at the same time, there should be no objection to appeals to the heart because our compassion, our empathy is a fundamental part of who we should be as human beings. MCCAMMON: French says there's nothing really new about accusing one's political opponents of appealing to emotion rather than logic, but he argues there should be room in our political discourse for both.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nMCCAMMON: That was pastor Josh McPherson on his podcast, \"Stronger Man Nation,\" conservative commentator Allie Beth Stuckey on the \"Family Talk\" podcast, and author Joe Rigney, discussing his book, \"The Sin Of Empathy,\" on a podcast hosted by Al Mohler of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. New York Times columnist David French has noticed this discourse and wrote about it in a recent column called \"Behold The Strange Spectacle Of Christians Against Empathy.\" French says Jesus - the central figure in Christianity - embodied empathy by coming to Earth as a man and enduring the human experience. French notes that Trump has cut programs long supported by many evangelicals and conservative Catholics, including funding for religious organizations that help the poor. DAVID FRENCH: So how do you rationalize this change? And I think that that's why some of these arguments about toxic empathy and other concepts are falling upon willing and open ears because they're - people are looking for a moral frame around which they can fit the Trump movement, and decrying empathy helps them do that. MCCAMMON: Some conservatives also argue that women are especially susceptible to being misled by appeals to empathy, often when it comes to helping people who are suffering or in need. Here's Allie Beth Stuckey on \"Family Talk.\" (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"FAMILY TALK\") STUCKEY: They'll use emotional, compassionate, kind-sounding language in order to get a woman to think, well, in order to be a good person, in order to be kind, in order to even love my neighbor, then I have to be pro-open borders. I have to be pro-LGBTQ. I have to be pro-choice. MCCAMMON: In an interview with NPR, Joe Rigney said he believes women are more naturally empathetic, which makes them better nurturers. Rigney says they're also more likely to reject church teachings they see as lacking compassion. RIGNEY: And in that kind of context, the empathetic sex is ill-suited precisely because of the ways that that empathy could be manipulated into, say, refusing to draw lines or in the name of helping a oppressed group, we're going to abandon our biblical confession or something like that. MCCAMMON: David French, meanwhile, says the idea that women are uniquely vulnerable to manipulation ties in closely with Christian nationalism, the idea that Christian men should run the country. FRENCH: And so you do have quite a bit of literature in the far right - the Christian nationalist right - that is decrying what they see as the, quote, \"feminized church, feminized political discourse.\" They say that America is a gynocracy, is what they will call it.

RIGNEY: And in that kind of context, the empathetic sex is ill-suited precisely because of the ways that that empathy could be manipulated into, say, refusing to draw lines or in the name of helping a oppressed group, we're going to abandon our biblical confession or something like that. MCCAMMON: David French, meanwhile, says the idea that women are uniquely vulnerable to manipulation ties in closely with Christian nationalism, the idea that Christian men should run the country. FRENCH: And so you do have quite a bit of literature in the far right - the Christian nationalist right - that is decrying what they see as the, quote, \"feminized church, feminized political discourse.\" They say that America is a gynocracy, is what they will call it. And that empathy element is a part of their argument. MCCAMMON: Rigney says he wouldn't flinch from being described as a Christian nationalist. RIGNEY: And I want society to be Christian. So, yes, I think it's true. I think it's good for the world, and I think it's, quite frankly, good for religious minorities. I think that, in many ways, in the absence of that, tyranny is inevitable. MCCAMMON: French says he worries that some Christians have shifted from fighting for religious freedom to fighting for Christian dominance. But when it comes to calls for public policies grounded in empathy, he acknowledges that everyone has to draw lines somewhere. FRENCH: There are times when the head has to overrule the heart. That is something that has to happen sometimes in public policy. But at the same time, there should be no objection to appeals to the heart because our compassion, our empathy is a fundamental part of who we should be as human beings. MCCAMMON: French says there's nothing really new about accusing one's political opponents of appealing to emotion rather than logic, but he argues there should be room in our political discourse for both.

This weekend, they'll choose a new leader. Taking a page from the GOP playbook, the two contenders are from the party's right wing.\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: A different election will happen this weekend across the Atlantic. Members of Britain's Conservative Party will elect a new member. Whoever wins will be tasked with rebuilding the political party of Churchill and Thatcher after its worst-ever election defeat. NPR's Lauren Frayer reports from London. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) LAURA KUENSSBERG: And as Big Ben strikes 10, a Labour landslide. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Blimey. The Conservative Party looks pulverized tonight. LAUREN FRAYER, BYLINE: Britain's conservatives were pulverized at the polls this summer despite dominating politics here for more than a century. Robert Lord Hayward, a conservative member of the House of Lords, says the way his party is now trying to rebuild is by playing to the extremes. ROBERT LORD HAYWARD: A certain element of the British population is watching what's happening in the United States. You can't avoid it. FRAYER: He says moderates have been voted out of this leadership contest by fellow MPs, and the last two candidates standing... HAYWARD: They're not actually household names in the United Kingdom, which is why they've gone for a populist approach - to attract the headlines. FRAYER: Politicians on this side of the Atlantic are also diving into culture wars by saying stuff like this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KEMI BADENOCH: Of course, not all cultures are equally valid. I don't believe in cultural relativism. I believe in Western values. FRAYER: That's Kemi Badenoch, the front-runner to lead the U.K. Conservative Party, arguing on TV that immigrants from certain cultures should be more welcome here than others. She's also said she thinks paid maternity leave is, quote, \"excessive\" and that, while her parents are wealthy, she herself is working class because she worked a fast food job as a teenager. KATY BALLS: Now, lots of Brits quickly made fun of her, saying, you can't just be working class because you had a job at McDonalds. FRAYER: Katy Balls is political editor of The Spectator, a right-leaning magazine here. She says Badenoch... BALLS: She is very much known for talking about identity politics. She's sometimes depicted as the anti-woke warrior. FRAYER: And some see that as an unlikely role for Badenoch. She's a Black woman and a mother of three who grew up in Nigeria. BALLS: And people listen to her in the way, if it was a man, they may not have done. FRAYER: Badenoch would make history as the first Black leader of any major U.K. party. Her challenger, fellow MP Robert Jenrick, is most famous for quitting a cabinet post over a proposal to deport migrants to Rwanda in Africa. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: ...Has called it moral delinquency. And the Times reported that Prince Charles privately called the plan appalling. FRAYER: The Rwanda plan was panned by human rights groups and overturned by the courts. But for Jenrick, it wasn't tough enough. He's also called for peaceful protesters to be arrested if they chant Allahu akbar, God is great, at pro-Palestinian rallies. And he told a pro-Israel group that he wants the Star of David posted at U.K. borders.

Members of Britain's Conservative Party will elect a new member. Whoever wins will be tasked with rebuilding the political party of Churchill and Thatcher after its worst-ever election defeat. NPR's Lauren Frayer reports from London. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) LAURA KUENSSBERG: And as Big Ben strikes 10, a Labour landslide. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Blimey. The Conservative Party looks pulverized tonight. LAUREN FRAYER, BYLINE: Britain's conservatives were pulverized at the polls this summer despite dominating politics here for more than a century. Robert Lord Hayward, a conservative member of the House of Lords, says the way his party is now trying to rebuild is by playing to the extremes. ROBERT LORD HAYWARD: A certain element of the British population is watching what's happening in the United States. You can't avoid it. FRAYER: He says moderates have been voted out of this leadership contest by fellow MPs, and the last two candidates standing... HAYWARD: They're not actually household names in the United Kingdom, which is why they've gone for a populist approach - to attract the headlines. FRAYER: Politicians on this side of the Atlantic are also diving into culture wars by saying stuff like this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KEMI BADENOCH: Of course, not all cultures are equally valid. I don't believe in cultural relativism. I believe in Western values. FRAYER: That's Kemi Badenoch, the front-runner to lead the U.K. Conservative Party, arguing on TV that immigrants from certain cultures should be more welcome here than others. She's also said she thinks paid maternity leave is, quote, \"excessive\" and that, while her parents are wealthy, she herself is working class because she worked a fast food job as a teenager. KATY BALLS: Now, lots of Brits quickly made fun of her, saying, you can't just be working class because you had a job at McDonalds. FRAYER: Katy Balls is political editor of The Spectator, a right-leaning magazine here. She says Badenoch... BALLS: She is very much known for talking about identity politics. She's sometimes depicted as the anti-woke warrior. FRAYER: And some see that as an unlikely role for Badenoch. She's a Black woman and a mother of three who grew up in Nigeria. BALLS: And people listen to her in the way, if it was a man, they may not have done. FRAYER: Badenoch would make history as the first Black leader of any major U.K. party. Her challenger, fellow MP Robert Jenrick, is most famous for quitting a cabinet post over a proposal to deport migrants to Rwanda in Africa. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: ...Has called it moral delinquency. And the Times reported that Prince Charles privately called the plan appalling. FRAYER: The Rwanda plan was panned by human rights groups and overturned by the courts. But for Jenrick, it wasn't tough enough. He's also called for peaceful protesters to be arrested if they chant Allahu akbar, God is great, at pro-Palestinian rallies. And he told a pro-Israel group that he wants the Star of David posted at U.K. borders.

FRAYER: He says moderates have been voted out of this leadership contest by fellow MPs, and the last two candidates standing... HAYWARD: They're not actually household names in the United Kingdom, which is why they've gone for a populist approach - to attract the headlines. FRAYER: Politicians on this side of the Atlantic are also diving into culture wars by saying stuff like this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KEMI BADENOCH: Of course, not all cultures are equally valid. I don't believe in cultural relativism. I believe in Western values. FRAYER: That's Kemi Badenoch, the front-runner to lead the U.K. Conservative Party, arguing on TV that immigrants from certain cultures should be more welcome here than others. She's also said she thinks paid maternity leave is, quote, \"excessive\" and that, while her parents are wealthy, she herself is working class because she worked a fast food job as a teenager. KATY BALLS: Now, lots of Brits quickly made fun of her, saying, you can't just be working class because you had a job at McDonalds. FRAYER: Katy Balls is political editor of The Spectator, a right-leaning magazine here. She says Badenoch... BALLS: She is very much known for talking about identity politics. She's sometimes depicted as the anti-woke warrior. FRAYER: And some see that as an unlikely role for Badenoch. She's a Black woman and a mother of three who grew up in Nigeria. BALLS: And people listen to her in the way, if it was a man, they may not have done. FRAYER: Badenoch would make history as the first Black leader of any major U.K. party. Her challenger, fellow MP Robert Jenrick, is most famous for quitting a cabinet post over a proposal to deport migrants to Rwanda in Africa. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: ...Has called it moral delinquency. And the Times reported that Prince Charles privately called the plan appalling. FRAYER: The Rwanda plan was panned by human rights groups and overturned by the courts. But for Jenrick, it wasn't tough enough. He's also called for peaceful protesters to be arrested if they chant Allahu akbar, God is great, at pro-Palestinian rallies. And he told a pro-Israel group that he wants the Star of David posted at U.K. borders. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ROBERT JENRICK: ...So that at every airport and point of entry to our great country, there is the Star of David there as a symbol that we support Israel. We stand with Israel. We are friends and allies. FRAYER: Now, some of these views might not seem out of place in U.S. political discourse these days. Others are pretty unconventional, even fringe. But after losing votes this summer to a far-right, anti-immigrant party, the staid old party of Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher may be taking a page from the GOP playbook and making a tactical shift. Tomorrow we'll learn who its next leader is and how much the party might change under them. Lauren Frayer, NPR News, London. (SOUNDBITE OF RINI SONG, \"SELFISH (FEAT. BEAM)\") Copyright © 2024 NPR.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KEMI BADENOCH: Of course, not all cultures are equally valid. I don't believe in cultural relativism. I believe in Western values. FRAYER: That's Kemi Badenoch, the front-runner to lead the U.K. Conservative Party, arguing on TV that immigrants from certain cultures should be more welcome here than others. She's also said she thinks paid maternity leave is, quote, \"excessive\" and that, while her parents are wealthy, she herself is working class because she worked a fast food job as a teenager. KATY BALLS: Now, lots of Brits quickly made fun of her, saying, you can't just be working class because you had a job at McDonalds. FRAYER: Katy Balls is political editor of The Spectator, a right-leaning magazine here. She says Badenoch... BALLS: She is very much known for talking about identity politics. She's sometimes depicted as the anti-woke warrior. FRAYER: And some see that as an unlikely role for Badenoch. She's a Black woman and a mother of three who grew up in Nigeria. BALLS: And people listen to her in the way, if it was a man, they may not have done. FRAYER: Badenoch would make history as the first Black leader of any major U.K. party. Her challenger, fellow MP Robert Jenrick, is most famous for quitting a cabinet post over a proposal to deport migrants to Rwanda in Africa. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: ...Has called it moral delinquency. And the Times reported that Prince Charles privately called the plan appalling.

      "text": "Breaking down this week's online fight among conservatives about legal immigration\n\nStephen Fowler\n\nA fight broke out about legal immigration on social media this week. Here's what it says about Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy's influence and factions in the GOP.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST: President-elect Trump will take office next month with a Republican-controlled Congress and, on paper, few obstacles to enacting his agenda. But a social media fight among conservatives this week around legal immigration for skilled tech workers highlights one challenge he'll face - keeping sometimes conflicting coalitions happy. Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy and other Trump backers in the tech industry say hiring workers on H-1B visas is aligned with Trump's America First agenda, while other conservatives argue legal immigration should be curbed to protect American workers. NPR's Stephen Fowler is here to help explain the debate. Hi, Stephen. STEPHEN FOWLER, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: This is a famously slow news week, so why are we talking about immigration and high-skilled tech workers? What's going on? FOWLER: So for people who are not terminally online, here's a quick recap. Trump made a number of smaller staffing announcements for his second term earlier this week. One of them is a high-profile tech entrepreneur named Sriram Krishnan, who's worked at Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, you name it. Far-right activists started trashing the pick on the social media site X, pointing out that Krishnan was born in India, that he previously made comments advocating for more green cards, and devolving into a lot of racist and anti-immigrant attacks on foreign workers that come to the U.S. on these H-1B visas. SHAPIRO: And then how did Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy get involved? FOWLER: So the two of them are the heads of the outside group the Department of Government Efficiency, which Trump has tasked with finding ways to cut government spending. They both defended the visa program on X, which Musk also owns. Both of them kind of kicked the hornets' nests with this. Musk said there aren't, quote, \"supermotivated and supertalented engineers in the U.S.\" And Ramaswamy posted this very long response that said, among other things, that, quote, \"our American culture has venerated mediocrity over excellence.\" And he said that kind of culture would not produce the best engineers. That did not go over well. SHAPIRO: Sure. So that's all on social media, but setting aside internet fights, what is the actual policy debate here over hiring skilled tech workers? And how might things change in a Trump administration? FOWLER: Ari, the debate over H-1Bs and legal immigration and what Trump might do about them is not something new. In his first term, Trump said that certain visa programs were being abused to bring in foreign workers to replace American workers. He suspended the H-1B program during the pandemic for the same reason, but this time around, things could be different. People in the tech industry, with the Musk-Ramaswamy viewpoint that the U.S. needs more of these top workers no matter where they're from to keep an edge in fields like AI - they're more in Trump's ear and his good graces this time around. There's also interest in reforming the visa process not just for these tech workers - from lawmakers across the aisle who say it's an overly complex system chock full of carveouts that benefit certain industries and, like Trump has said, are being abused. But there's also a lot of conservatives, especially among the base of the GOP, that shape primary elections, who believe Trump's hard-line immigration stances means reform should primarily come in a reduction of immigrants. And so far, Trump hasn't weighed in specifically on this online kerfuffle or indicated what his plans are for this particular issue in his second term. SHAPIRO: No political party is a monolith. The same is true of Trump's GOP. So what does this particular political conflict foreshadow for policy fights in Washington? FOWLER: Well, as we saw with the threat of a government shutdown earlier this month, there are going to be challenges for Republicans to get enough votes in the House to get much done, regardless of what flavor of ideology wins out on these issues. The big tent of Trump has a growing divide between MAGA cultural conservatism and this sort of new tech-right of Silicon Valley that skews more towards deregulation and an economic worldview of people like Musk, who, I should point out, is himself an immigrant who also uses this visa program for his companies. So this could be a defining feature of Trump's second term - all of these different factions and groups seeking sometimes contradictory goals - and it seems Trump is the only captain who can make them all row in the same direction. He may be fighting against the current with many of these issues. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Stephen Fowler. Thank you. FOWLER: Thank you. Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The big tent of Trump has a growing divide between MAGA cultural conservatism and this sort of new tech-right of Silicon Valley that skews more towards deregulation and an economic worldview of people like Musk, who, I should point out, is himself an immigrant who also uses this visa program for his companies. So this could be a defining feature of Trump's second term - all of these different factions and groups seeking sometimes contradictory goals - and it seems Trump is the only captain who can make them all row in the same direction. He may be fighting against the current with many of these issues. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Stephen Fowler. Thank you. FOWLER: Thank you. Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nFOWLER: So for people who are not terminally online, here's a quick recap. Trump made a number of smaller staffing announcements for his second term earlier this week. One of them is a high-profile tech entrepreneur named Sriram Krishnan, who's worked at Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, you name it. Far-right activists started trashing the pick on the social media site X, pointing out that Krishnan was born in India, that he previously made comments advocating for more green cards, and devolving into a lot of racist and anti-immigrant attacks on foreign workers that come to the U.S. on these H-1B visas. SHAPIRO: And then how did Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy get involved? FOWLER: So the two of them are the heads of the outside group the Department of Government Efficiency, which Trump has tasked with finding ways to cut government spending. They both defended the visa program on X, which Musk also owns. Both of them kind of kicked the hornets' nests with this. Musk said there aren't, quote, \"supermotivated and supertalented engineers in the U.S.\" And Ramaswamy posted this very long response that said, among other things, that, quote, \"our American culture has venerated mediocrity over excellence.\" And he said that kind of culture would not produce the best engineers. That did not go over well. SHAPIRO: Sure. So that's all on social media, but setting aside internet fights, what is the actual policy debate here over hiring skilled tech workers? And how might things change in a Trump administration? FOWLER: Ari, the debate over H-1Bs and legal immigration and what Trump might do about them is not something new. In his first term, Trump said that certain visa programs were being abused to bring in foreign workers to replace American workers. He suspended the H-1B program during the pandemic for the same reason, but this time around, things could be different. People in the tech industry, with the Musk-Ramaswamy viewpoint that the U.S. needs more of these top workers no matter where they're from to keep an edge in fields like AI - they're more in Trump's ear and his good graces this time around. There's also interest in reforming the visa process not just for these tech workers - from lawmakers across the aisle who say it's an overly complex system chock full of carveouts that benefit certain industries and, like Trump has said, are being abused. But there's also a lot of conservatives, especially among the base of the GOP, that shape primary elections, who believe Trump's hard-line immigration stances means reform should primarily come in a reduction of immigrants. And so far, Trump hasn't weighed in specifically on this online kerfuffle or indicated what his plans are for this particular issue in his second term. SHAPIRO: No political party is a monolith. The same is true of Trump's GOP. So what does this particular political conflict foreshadow for policy fights in Washington?

      "text": "Conservatives in red states turn their attention to ending no-fault divorce laws\n\nAyesha Rascoe\n\nAfter decades of no-fault divorce law, some conservatives want to make it harder to end marriages on the basis of irreconcilable differences. NPR's Ayesha Rascoe talks with Joanna Grossman of Southern Methodist University about the push-back.\n\nAYESHA RASCOE, HOST: Some conservatives, including high-profile commentators and Republican state lawmakers, have set their sights on ending or restricting no-fault divorce laws. These laws are on the books in all 50 states. No-fault divorce allows anyone who wants to end their marriage to do so without blaming their spouse for doing anything wrong, like adultery or domestic abuse. But critics of no-fault divorce say it undermines the sanctity of marriage and hurts men. We're joined now by Joanna Grossman. She's a law professor who specializes in family law at Southern Methodist University's Dedman School of Law. Professor Grossman, welcome to the program. JOANNA GROSSMAN: Thank you for having me. RASCOE: So can you start by reminding our listeners of the history of no-fault divorce? GROSSMAN: Sure. So for most of history in the U.S., we had something called fault-based divorce - right? - the opposite. And that was basically the state decided whether a marriage was bad enough to justify a divorce. Different states had different grounds, sometimes, including things like cruelty or excessive drinking or imprisonment. But the key to that system was the person who wanted the divorce had to themselves be innocent? They had to accuse and prove that the other spouse had committed something on the list? And that all went by the wayside starting with California in 1969, when states realized that that was really a very artificial way of thinking about marital breakdown and also really inconsistent with our ideas of what happy marriage is. RASCOE: Well, what happened after no-fault divorce went into effect? GROSSMAN: What we saw was a decrease in female suicide. We saw a decrease in domestic abuse of wives. We saw a decrease in homicide of women by intimate partners. And we also saw generally, people feeling more able to control their lives - right? - that they were not stuck in unhappy marriages. So we did see an increase in the divorce rate initially, but since then, the divorce rate has pretty steadily declined. RASCOE: Well, so some Republicans in a few red states, including Louisiana, Texas, Nebraska and Oklahoma, want to end or limit no-fault divorce in their states. If they were able to do that, what would it mean for people in those states who want to get divorced? GROSSMAN: Yeah, so luckily, because we had fault-based divorce for so long, we have good information about what happens in that system, right? So a lot of people would simply cheat to get divorces that the law says they're not entitled to. So two people who wanted to get divorced would simply agree, right? You're going to say I committed adultery, and then we'll get a divorce on grounds of adultery. We'll see the rise of divorce tourism, which we saw in that earlier era. Most states would not get rid of no-fault, so we'll see people traveling to establish residency in those easier states. And then we will see some people who are just stuck - right? where the inability to get divorced is used as a way to trap people in bad marriages. And unfortunately, what we also know is that will mostly be women. RASCOE: Well, and we should clarify that this has not been formally adopted by the GOP. But there are leaders in the party who've come out against no-fault divorce, including Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance. Talk to me about this sudden focus on the specific statute in family law. GROSSMAN: I think it's really part of the same kind of culture wars that are being waged by the GOP both at the state level and at the federal level, right? So the same people who are cheering the repeal of Roe v. Wade and the elimination of protection for abortion rights, those are the same people who want to get rid of no-fault divorce. And a lot of these things are tied together by just sort of nostalgia for some kind of traditional conservative values that they think were in place in the '50s and '60s. But what they really like about that simpler time is the patriarchal component. RASCOE: Well, so in your view, do you think that this effort by some conservatives to get rid of no-fault divorce - do you think it has legs, or is this more of a talking point? GROSSMAN: I think it's hard to say. I think five years ago, I would have said, there's no way one of these bills would pass because it's sort of too ridiculous and doesn't make any sense. But I've seen things pass in the past couple of years that I would have classified as kind of equally implausible. I think this is less likely to pass because it would really wreak havoc on the family court system, right? It would add just tremendous cost and delays to an average divorce, and that will affect not only the parties, but also judges and lawyers and the entire court system. So I do think there'll be some institutional pushback to this effort that we wouldn't see with some of the other kind of culture war issues. RASCOE: That's Joanna Grossman. She is a law professor at Southern Methodist University's Dedman School of Law. Thank you so much for speaking with us. GROSSMAN: Oh, my pleasure. Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

So I do think there'll be some institutional pushback to this effort that we wouldn't see with some of the other kind of culture war issues. RASCOE: That's Joanna Grossman. She is a law professor at Southern Methodist University's Dedman School of Law. Thank you so much for speaking with us. GROSSMAN: Oh, my pleasure. Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

GROSSMAN: Sure. So for most of history in the U.S., we had something called fault-based divorce - right? - the opposite. And that was basically the state decided whether a marriage was bad enough to justify a divorce. Different states had different grounds, sometimes, including things like cruelty or excessive drinking or imprisonment. But the key to that system was the person who wanted the divorce had to themselves be innocent? They had to accuse and prove that the other spouse had committed something on the list? And that all went by the wayside starting with California in 1969, when states realized that that was really a very artificial way of thinking about marital breakdown and also really inconsistent with our ideas of what happy marriage is. RASCOE: Well, what happened after no-fault divorce went into effect? GROSSMAN: What we saw was a decrease in female suicide. We saw a decrease in domestic abuse of wives. We saw a decrease in homicide of women by intimate partners. And we also saw generally, people feeling more able to control their lives - right? - that they were not stuck in unhappy marriages. So we did see an increase in the divorce rate initially, but since then, the divorce rate has pretty steadily declined. RASCOE: Well, so some Republicans in a few red states, including Louisiana, Texas, Nebraska and Oklahoma, want to end or limit no-fault divorce in their states. If they were able to do that, what would it mean for people in those states who want to get divorced? GROSSMAN: Yeah, so luckily, because we had fault-based divorce for so long, we have good information about what happens in that system, right? So a lot of people would simply cheat to get divorces that the law says they're not entitled to. So two people who wanted to get divorced would simply agree, right? You're going to say I committed adultery, and then we'll get a divorce on grounds of adultery. We'll see the rise of divorce tourism, which we saw in that earlier era. Most states would not get rid of no-fault, so we'll see people traveling to establish residency in those easier states. And then we will see some people who are just stuck - right? where the inability to get divorced is used as a way to trap people in bad marriages. And unfortunately, what we also know is that will mostly be women. RASCOE: Well, and we should clarify that this has not been formally adopted by the GOP. But there are leaders in the party who've come out against no-fault divorce, including Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance. Talk to me about this sudden focus on the specific statute in family law. GROSSMAN: I think it's really part of the same kind of culture wars that are being waged by the GOP both at the state level and at the federal level, right? So the same people who are cheering the repeal of Roe v. Wade and the elimination of protection for abortion rights, those are the same people who want to get rid of no-fault divorce. And a lot of these things are tied together by just sort of nostalgia for some kind of traditional conservative values that they think were in place in the '50s and '60s. But what they really like about that simpler time is the patriarchal component. RASCOE: Well, so in your view, do you think that this effort by some conservatives to get rid of no-fault divorce - do you think it has legs, or is this more of a talking point? GROSSMAN: I think it's hard to say. I think five years ago, I would have said, there's no way one of these bills would pass because it's sort of too ridiculous and doesn't make any sense. But I've seen things pass in the past couple of years that I would have classified as kind of equally implausible. I think this is less likely to pass because it would really wreak havoc on the family court system, right? It would add just tremendous cost and delays to an average divorce, and that will affect not only the parties, but also judges and lawyers and the entire court system. So I do think there'll be some institutional pushback to this effort that we wouldn't see with some of the other kind of culture war issues. RASCOE: That's Joanna Grossman.

And unfortunately, what we also know is that will mostly be women. RASCOE: Well, and we should clarify that this has not been formally adopted by the GOP. But there are leaders in the party who've come out against no-fault divorce, including Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance. Talk to me about this sudden focus on the specific statute in family law. GROSSMAN: I think it's really part of the same kind of culture wars that are being waged by the GOP both at the state level and at the federal level, right? So the same people who are cheering the repeal of Roe v. Wade and the elimination of protection for abortion rights, those are the same people who want to get rid of no-fault divorce. And a lot of these things are tied together by just sort of nostalgia for some kind of traditional conservative values that they think were in place in the '50s and '60s. But what they really like about that simpler time is the patriarchal component. RASCOE: Well, so in your view, do you think that this effort by some conservatives to get rid of no-fault divorce - do you think it has legs, or is this more of a talking point? GROSSMAN: I think it's hard to say. I think five years ago, I would have said, there's no way one of these bills would pass because it's sort of too ridiculous and doesn't make any sense. But I've seen things pass in the past couple of years that I would have classified as kind of equally implausible. I think this is less likely to pass because it would really wreak havoc on the family court system, right? It would add just tremendous cost and delays to an average divorce, and that will affect not only the parties, but also judges and lawyers and the entire court system. So I do think there'll be some institutional pushback to this effort that we wouldn't see with some of the other kind of culture war issues. RASCOE: That's Joanna Grossman. She is a law professor at Southern Methodist University's Dedman School of Law. Thank you so much for speaking with us. GROSSMAN: Oh, my pleasure. Copyright © 2024 NPR.  All rights reserved.

We saw a decrease in homicide of women by intimate partners. And we also saw generally, people feeling more able to control their lives - right? - that they were not stuck in unhappy marriages. So we did see an increase in the divorce rate initially, but since then, the divorce rate has pretty steadily declined. RASCOE: Well, so some Republicans in a few red states, including Louisiana, Texas, Nebraska and Oklahoma, want to end or limit no-fault divorce in their states. If they were able to do that, what would it mean for people in those states who want to get divorced? GROSSMAN: Yeah, so luckily, because we had fault-based divorce for so long, we have good information about what happens in that system, right? So a lot of people would simply cheat to get divorces that the law says they're not entitled to. So two people who wanted to get divorced would simply agree, right? You're going to say I committed adultery, and then we'll get a divorce on grounds of adultery. We'll see the rise of divorce tourism, which we saw in that earlier era. Most states would not get rid of no-fault, so we'll see people traveling to establish residency in those easier states.

GROSSMAN: I think it's hard to say. I think five years ago, I would have said, there's no way one of these bills would pass because it's sort of too ridiculous and doesn't make any sense. But I've seen things pass in the past couple of years that I would have classified as kind of equally implausible. I think this is less likely to pass because it would really wreak havoc on the family court system, right? It would add just tremendous cost and delays to an average divorce, and that will affect not only the parties, but also judges and lawyers and the entire court system. So I do think there'll be some institutional pushback to this effort that we wouldn't see with some of the other kind of culture war issues. RASCOE: That's Joanna Grossman.

      "text": "The Supreme Court is the most conservative in 90 years\n\nNina Totenberg\n\nThe justices of the U.S. Supreme Court who decided this term's cases. Erin Schaff/Pool/Getty Images hide caption\n\nThe justices of the U.S. Supreme Court who decided this term's cases.\n\nIn 2018 just after he announced his retirement, Justice Anthony Kennedy, who sat at the ideological center of the court for much of his 30-year tenure, met with a small group of reporters. Was he worried that some of the precedents he helped establish--the right to abortion and LGBT  rights, for instance--might  now be in jeopardy? No, he replied. He was confident that  constitutional  rights, once established would remain in place.\n\nIt took just four years, and the addition of one more Trump appointee to the Supreme Court, to prove him wrong.\n\nThere is simply no way to overstate what the Supreme Court did this term. No journalist or scholar alive can remember a term  with so many earthquakes in the law.\n\nThe data tell the story. The court produced more conservative decisions this term than at any time since 1931, according to statistics compiled by professors Lee Epstein of  Washington University in St. Louis and Keven Quinn of the University of Michigan.\n\nIn an astounding 62% of the decisions, conservatives prevailed, and more importantly, often prevailed in dramatic ways.\n\nThe sweeping nature of the court's decisions, and the sheer number of them amounted to a dream fulfilled for hard-line conservatives and a nightmare for liberals and moderates.\n\nIt's not really a nightmare \"because you wake up from a nightmare and its over at some point,\" says Supreme Court advocate Tom Goldstein, publisher of SCOTUSblog. \"The problem for the American left,\" and more centrist conservatives too, is that \"they are stuck with\" this court \"for the next quarter century. And you have a conservative majority that is... moving the goal posts...on every conceivable issue that you can imagine.\"\n\nGoldstein, who has followed the court's work for nearly three decades, admits it it is hard form him to believe what is happening.\n\nIn overturning Roe v. Wade, the court erased a half century of court precedents and eliminated the constitutional right to abortion. Just weeks after the shootings in Uvalde, Texas, the court issued a broadly worded opinion making it more difficult to regulate guns. In a major environmental case, the court curbed the EPA's ability to deal with climate change, and in so doing signaled that other government assertions of regulatory power in the name of health and safety could be on the chopping block. In two religion cases, the court barely mentioned the concept of  separation between church and state; rather, it   expanded public funding options for religious schools and ruled in favor of a high school football coach who wanted to pray on the 50-yard line, a significant expansion of teachers' rights to public, even ostentatious,  religious expression  while on the job.\n\nOne of the many things that distinguishes this court from any other court of the last 90-plus years is that the current court has no center. Chief Justice John Roberts very occasionally takes a more incremental approach than fellow conservatives, as he did in the abortion case. But the other five conservatives can and did in that case prevail without him. At the same time, Justice Brett Kavanaugh's voting pattern this term moved 20% to the right. So instead of this now being \"the Roberts Court,\" or a court dominated by any one justice,  professor Epstein says, it is \"the Trump court,\" because half of the 6-to-3 conservative majority was appointed by the former president.\n\nAs for the liberals, says Epstein, they have become \"bit players,\" drowned out by a conservative symphony.\n\nSCOTUSblog's Goldstein points to more data that underlines the conservative supermajority's hard turn to the right.  There were more 6-to-3 decisions this term than at any time in the court's modern history, fewer unanimous decisions, and \"every single one of the more liberal justices was in dissent more times this year than in any year of their careers, including Justice Stephen Breyer,\" who has served on the court for twenty eight years.\n\nSome of the effects of the court's work were immediate, with the doors of abortion clinics closing in large swaths of the country. Other effects are already in the works, cases challenging a government regulatory structure that since the New Deal has enabled Congress to give agencies broad power to deal  with major health and safety problems--from regulations that protect that air and water, to those aimed at protecting  pharmaceuticals, food, car safety, and even the stock market, to name just a few.\n\nEven the government's attempt to mandate a vaccine-or-test regime for large private employers was shot down by the court this term, the exception being vaccine mandates for health care workers and the military. And those exceptions were by a divided vote, 5-to-4 to uphold the mandate for health care workers, 6-to-3 for the military.\n\nConservative and liberal scholars alike describe the current court as unusually aggressive. The \"YOLO court\"--You Only Live Once-- said University of Michigan professor Leah Litman. \"A court in a very big hurry,\" said Case Western Reserve professor Jonathan Adler.  \"Heedless, \" said the ACLU's legal director David Cole. \"Reactionary, as distinguished from conservative,\" said Columbia law professor Jamal Greene, noting that the court is going backward in overturning generations of modern law and returning to legal understandings in the seventeen and eighteen hundreds.\n\nWhile most of the public usually pays only occasional attention to what the court does, it seems to have noticed this time. The court's public approval ratings have plunged, to a new low of as little as 25% in a recent Gallup Poll.\n\nThe new conservative juggernaut has hardly finished. It has already agreed to review more hot-button issues next term. Perhaps the most important of these is a case that could radically reshape the rules for federal elections, giving state legislatures almost unfettered control over voting rules, and over the drawing of  congressional districts. If the theory prevails, state legislatures could be free to execute all manner of partisan mischief, freed from oversight by state courts, state constitutional provisions, governors,  and potentially allowing legislatures a free hand to name electoral college electors in presidential elections.\n\nIn addition, the court, after gutting much of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act, now seems focused on weakening or eliminating the few remaining protections for minorities in states with a history of racial discrimination. And that, says Columbia's professor Greene, is going to have \"a lot of effects, some of them unpredictable.\"\n\nThe court also looks headed to reverse another major precedent on the books for nearly a half century. Since 1978 the court has allowed colleges and universities to use race as one of many factors considered in admissions decisions. In the upcoming term, the court will revisit the issue in cases from Harvard University and the University of North Carolina.\n\nYet another hot-button social issue that the court has accepted for review is framed as a free-speech case, but is also a test of the right to discriminate against LGBTQ members of the public in commercial services.  At issue is whether a woman who designs websites for weddings  can refuse to work for  for same-sex couples.\n\nIf this term's past is prologue,  there are seemingly endless questions about where the court  might go next.  The majority opinion in the abortion case, written by Justice Samuel Alito, is based on reasoning also included in the court's precedents on same-sex marriage, the rights of couples to use and have access to contraception, and even the rights of interracial couples to marry.  And while Alito sought to rebut any notion that those decisions are in jeopardy, his abortion opinion mocked a previous abortion decision that was based in part on  those very decisions.\n\nThen too, this term's abortion decision left many questions unanswered. For instance, can a state ban a person from receiving abortion pills, approved by the FDA, and sent through the U.S. postal system?  Can states ban telemedicine appointments with doctors out of state?  In states where abortion is outlawed, can states ban advertisements and other information about how to obtain an abortion?\n\nNor is it clear how far the court is prepared to go in its religion jurisprudence. In upholding a football coach's right to pray on the 50-yard line, surrounded by willing players, the conservative majority discarded one precedent, and seemed to leave room for more precedents to be shattered--among them the court's repeated decisions since 1962 barring teacher-led prayer in the classroom. University of Virginia law professor Douglas Laycock, a strong supporter of the free exercise of religion clause in the First Amendment, wonders how school officials, or lower court judges, are going to differentiate between prayer on the football field and prayer in the classroom.\n\nThe court's decision in the prayer case is among many in recent years in which the court has dismantled prior rules that sought to draw a clear line separating church and state. Among them: The court has ruled that the constitution bars federal anti-discrimination laws, including those requiring accommodations for sick or disabled employees, from applying to lay teachers at religious schools; it ruled that a Catholic social services agency could refuse to abide by its contract with Philadelphia, a contract which required it to work with same-sex couples applying to take in foster children; it ruled that closely held for-profit corporations could refuse, on religious grounds, to abide by a federal law requiring insurance to cover contraception for their employees; it ruled that city councils and other public boards are free to open their meetings with explicitly Christian prayers. It ruled that a 4o-foot cross honoring soldiers who died in World War I could remain on state property at a busy intersection in suburban Maryland.\n\nThis is far from a complete list, but it is an indication of more such decisions to come, and because religious overtones reach so many aspects of American life--from abortion to gay rights to what we want children to read or know--these decisions will have implications for millions of people.  The current court is the most pro-religion of any court in nearly 70 years, according to statistics compiled for an upcoming article in The Supreme Court Review , written by professor  Epstein  and professor  Eric Posner of the University of Chicago. While the number of pro-religion outcomes edged up to 58% overall when William Rehnquist was chief justice (1986-2005), the rate has skyrocketed to over 86% in the years since then with John Roberts as chief justice and the court's composition growing steadily more conservative.\n\nWhatever one thinks of the court's decisions in these and other cases, it quite clearly is not a court that shrinks from controversy or contention. And the subjects it is likely to take on  often pit the young against the old,  rural against urban, and even black against white--in other words the most polarizing subjects of our times. Abortion, the right to vote, affirmative action in school admission and in employment,  the rights of  LGBTQ people, the content of history taught in public schools,  and even book banning in public libraries--all of that will eventually, in all likelihood,  end up in the lap of a very conservative Supreme Court.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Living in Defiance County, Ohio, he convinced his mom to take him to a rally about 50 minutes away in Fort Wayne, Ind.\n\nAnd the rest is history.\n\n\"After that, I fell in love with it,\" Bassett remembered. \"I was the kid that wore the Trump shirt all throughout elementary [school].\"\n\nThat year, he stayed up late to watch the debates. On career day, there was an easy inspiration.\n\n\"I dressed up as Trump,\" he said with a smile. \"I wore a Trump hat, wore the suit, put the button on, I did everything.\"\n\nNow 18, Bassett is heading to Liberty University in the fall. He's become a political wonk, passionate about gun rights and education.\n\nOhio's primary Tuesday marks the first time he gets to vote in a presidential matchup. And though he's grown up from the wide-eyed childhood fan and can acknowledge the former president has his flaws, Trump is still his guy.\n\n\"He's transformed the political universe,\" Bassett said. \"I still like the fact that he doesn't back down to anyone ... he is still a conservative at heart.\"\n\nRylen Bassett on career day in fourth grade (left) and Bassett in his high school senior portrait (right). He told NPR that Trump's candidacy in 2016 was \"refreshing,\" and he stood out compared to traditional political figures.

He told NPR that Trump's candidacy in 2016 was \"refreshing,\" and he stood out compared to traditional political figures.\n\nBassett isn't alone in feeling a pull toward the former president. Trump carried the Buckeye State twice, in 2016 and again in 2020.\n\nAnd nationally, Trump has been on the political stage for nearly a decade. So for many young conservatives casting their first ballot this year, Trump has been at the center of the Republican political world for much of their memory.\n\n\"Donald Trump is their Republican experience,\" explained conservative pollster and strategist Sarah Longwell. \"If you've come of political consciousness in the last decade, then the Republican Party, to you, really does look like Trump.\"\n\nTo Longwell, this new generation of young conservatives is drifting away from the traditional Republican candidates of the past few decades and more toward those who embody Trump and adopt his brash style of politics.\n\n\"For people who have chosen to identify as Republicans or conservatives, in this moment, they've done it because they like what they see out of Donald Trump,\" she said.\n\nGen Z and younger millennial voters overwhelmingly supported President Biden in 2020 and historically back Democratic candidates. That said, some recent national polling shows Trump and Biden in a closer matchup among voters under 35, leaving potential for the GOP as they zero in on battleground states where margins may be small.\n\n\"You change 10% of that audience, you have fundamentally changed a presidential race,\" said John Brabender, a media consultant to the Trump campaign. He cautioned that while Trump has had an influence on young conservatives, so has Biden.\n\n\"It can't be dismissed how important it is in some sense that they see Biden as an overwhelming failure,\" he added.\n\nBack in Defiance County, Bassett and his friends recently founded a young Republican club, the Roosevelt Reagan Society. In January, they organized a forum with the Republican candidates running in Ohio's competitive 9th Congressional District focused on issues affecting young voters.\n\nHowever, not all members of the group are eligible to vote in the 2024 election. Jack Bourgeois and Elizabeth Thompson are two 15-year-old high school freshmen who helped start the club. When they think about the qualities they want in a future presidential candidate, their wish list echoes a familiar sentiment.\n\n\"We would need someone strong, smart and an honest decision-maker,\" Thompson said. \"Someone who commands respect from other world leaders.\"\n\n\"I would want a presidential candidate with a lot of nationalism,\" Bourgeois added. \"Someone who really truly stands for our country and shows the strength of America as a country.\"\n\nAs for Bassett, when he thinks about his ideal future candidate, it's complicated. He loves Trump but disagrees with the way Republicans have refused to compromise in the past, referencing Trump's opposition to recent bipartisan congressional talks on the border - legislation that went on to fail.\n\n\"I want a strong Republican that, he's willing to stand up for what he believes in,\" he said. \"But at the same time, I want a strong Republican that knows when to fold his cards.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

But that position is putting him at odds with some conservatives.\n\nJUANA SUMMERS, HOST: President Trump made an unusual prediction recently. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'll be known as the fertilization president. And that's OK. (LAUGHTER) TRUMP: That's not bad. SUMMERS: That's Trump speaking during a Women's History Month event at the White House last week. Since the campaign, Trump has been touting his support for the fertility treatment known as IVF. But as NPR's Sarah McCammon reports, that position is putting him at odds with some conservatives. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Among the long list of executive orders President Trump has signed so far, there's one focused on an issue that's not a traditional priority for Republicans. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Fertilization - I've been saying that we're going to do what we have to do. And I think the women and families, husbands, are very appreciative of it. MCCAMMON: That's Trump in February, when he signed an executive order focused on expanding access to in vitro fertilization. Trump has been staking out his support for the fertility treatment for more than a year. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: I strongly support the availability of IVF for couples who are trying to have a precious, little, beautiful baby. (CHEERING) TRUMP: I support it. MCCAMMON: That's Trump campaigning in South Carolina early last year, after an Alabama Supreme Court decision prompted fertility clinics there to temporarily stop offering the procedure. At a time when many Republicans were worried about a voter backlash against abortion restrictions, Trump noted that IVF has overwhelming public support. Now as president, he's directed administration officials to prepare a list of ideas for expanding access and reducing costs. BARBARA COLLURA: It's a good first start. MCCAMMON: Barbara Collura of RESOLVE, the National Infertility Association, notes that during the campaign, Trump promised either public funding or mandated insurance coverage for IVF. COLLURA: This executive order does not do that in and of itself. It is asking for policy recommendations. So as far as we're concerned, it's a first step. MCCAMMON: Collura is calling on the administration to offer comprehensive coverage for military service members and mandated coverage in health plans offered to federal employees, among other recommendations. Trump's push for expanded IVF coverage is getting some pushback from conservatives normally aligned with Republicans. Jason Thacker is a senior fellow in bioethics at the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, or ERLC, which opposes the intentional destruction of embryos left over from IVF. JASON THACKER: We can do a lot of things in terms of biomedical technologies, advancements, even fertility treatments. We can do a lot of things. But what we as Christians and specifically at the ERLC are concerned about is to slow down and say, should we? MCCAMMON: Some insurance industry leaders and some fiscal conservatives also warn that requiring insurance companies to cover IVF could increase overall health care costs. John Shelton is policy director for Advancing American Freedom, a group founded by former Vice President Mike Pence. JOHN SHELTON: We just sort of see this health care mandate approach as probably driving up costs more, creating perverse incentives to create more embryos than are implanted. MCCAMMON: Beyond helping individual couples conceive, both Trump and his vice president, JD Vance, have spoken about a desire to see more births. Here's Vance at the March for Life in Washington in January. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VICE PRESIDENT JD VANCE: So let me say very simply, I want more babies in the United States of America. (CHEERING) MCCAMMON: In his public remarks, Trump has explicitly linked support for IVF to the goal of making it easier for American couples to have more babies. Research suggests IVF does not increase overall fertility rates, it just shifts when some people start their families, according to Lyman Stone of the Pronatalism Initiative at the Institute for Family Studies. But Stone says there's at least one thing the federal government could do differently to encourage its workers to have more children. LYMAN STONE: Fifty-hour work weeks are highly sterilizing. So if we want to see more babies, we should really be thinking about expanding remote work options, not reducing them. MCCAMMON: The White House says the main goal of Trump's executive order is to help couples who are struggling to conceive, not to increase the nation's birth rate.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Fertilization - I've been saying that we're going to do what we have to do. And I think the women and families, husbands, are very appreciative of it. MCCAMMON: That's Trump in February, when he signed an executive order focused on expanding access to in vitro fertilization. Trump has been staking out his support for the fertility treatment for more than a year. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: I strongly support the availability of IVF for couples who are trying to have a precious, little, beautiful baby. (CHEERING) TRUMP: I support it. MCCAMMON: That's Trump campaigning in South Carolina early last year, after an Alabama Supreme Court decision prompted fertility clinics there to temporarily stop offering the procedure. At a time when many Republicans were worried about a voter backlash against abortion restrictions, Trump noted that IVF has overwhelming public support. Now as president, he's directed administration officials to prepare a list of ideas for expanding access and reducing costs. BARBARA COLLURA: It's a good first start. MCCAMMON: Barbara Collura of RESOLVE, the National Infertility Association, notes that during the campaign, Trump promised either public funding or mandated insurance coverage for IVF. COLLURA: This executive order does not do that in and of itself. It is asking for policy recommendations. So as far as we're concerned, it's a first step. MCCAMMON: Collura is calling on the administration to offer comprehensive coverage for military service members and mandated coverage in health plans offered to federal employees, among other recommendations. Trump's push for expanded IVF coverage is getting some pushback from conservatives normally aligned with Republicans. Jason Thacker is a senior fellow in bioethics at the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, or ERLC, which opposes the intentional destruction of embryos left over from IVF. JASON THACKER: We can do a lot of things in terms of biomedical technologies, advancements, even fertility treatments. We can do a lot of things. But what we as Christians and specifically at the ERLC are concerned about is to slow down and say, should we? MCCAMMON: Some insurance industry leaders and some fiscal conservatives also warn that requiring insurance companies to cover IVF could increase overall health care costs. John Shelton is policy director for Advancing American Freedom, a group founded by former Vice President Mike Pence. JOHN SHELTON: We just sort of see this health care mandate approach as probably driving up costs more, creating perverse incentives to create more embryos than are implanted. MCCAMMON: Beyond helping individual couples conceive, both Trump and his vice president, JD Vance, have spoken about a desire to see more births. Here's Vance at the March for Life in Washington in January. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VICE PRESIDENT JD VANCE: So let me say very simply, I want more babies in the United States of America. (CHEERING) MCCAMMON: In his public remarks, Trump has explicitly linked support for IVF to the goal of making it easier for American couples to have more babies. Research suggests IVF does not increase overall fertility rates, it just shifts when some people start their families, according to Lyman Stone of the Pronatalism Initiative at the Institute for Family Studies. But Stone says there's at least one thing the federal government could do differently to encourage its workers to have more children. LYMAN STONE: Fifty-hour work weeks are highly sterilizing. So if we want to see more babies, we should really be thinking about expanding remote work options, not reducing them. MCCAMMON: The White House says the main goal of Trump's executive order is to help couples who are struggling to conceive, not to increase the nation's birth rate.

JOHN SHELTON: We just sort of see this health care mandate approach as probably driving up costs more, creating perverse incentives to create more embryos than are implanted. MCCAMMON: Beyond helping individual couples conceive, both Trump and his vice president, JD Vance, have spoken about a desire to see more births. Here's Vance at the March for Life in Washington in January. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VICE PRESIDENT JD VANCE: So let me say very simply, I want more babies in the United States of America. (CHEERING) MCCAMMON: In his public remarks, Trump has explicitly linked support for IVF to the goal of making it easier for American couples to have more babies. Research suggests IVF does not increase overall fertility rates, it just shifts when some people start their families, according to Lyman Stone of the Pronatalism Initiative at the Institute for Family Studies. But Stone says there's at least one thing the federal government could do differently to encourage its workers to have more children. LYMAN STONE: Fifty-hour work weeks are highly sterilizing. So if we want to see more babies, we should really be thinking about expanding remote work options, not reducing them. MCCAMMON: The White House says the main goal of Trump's executive order is to help couples who are struggling to conceive, not to increase the nation's birth rate.

Since the campaign, Trump has been touting his support for the fertility treatment known as IVF. But as NPR's Sarah McCammon reports, that position is putting him at odds with some conservatives. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: Among the long list of executive orders President Trump has signed so far, there's one focused on an issue that's not a traditional priority for Republicans. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: Fertilization - I've been saying that we're going to do what we have to do. And I think the women and families, husbands, are very appreciative of it. MCCAMMON: That's Trump in February, when he signed an executive order focused on expanding access to in vitro fertilization. Trump has been staking out his support for the fertility treatment for more than a year. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: I strongly support the availability of IVF for couples who are trying to have a precious, little, beautiful baby. (CHEERING) TRUMP: I support it. MCCAMMON: That's Trump campaigning in South Carolina early last year, after an Alabama Supreme Court decision prompted fertility clinics there to temporarily stop offering the procedure. At a time when many Republicans were worried about a voter backlash against abortion restrictions, Trump noted that IVF has overwhelming public support. Now as president, he's directed administration officials to prepare a list of ideas for expanding access and reducing costs. BARBARA COLLURA: It's a good first start. MCCAMMON: Barbara Collura of RESOLVE, the National Infertility Association, notes that during the campaign, Trump promised either public funding or mandated insurance coverage for IVF. COLLURA: This executive order does not do that in and of itself. It is asking for policy recommendations. So as far as we're concerned, it's a first step. MCCAMMON: Collura is calling on the administration to offer comprehensive coverage for military service members and mandated coverage in health plans offered to federal employees, among other recommendations. Trump's push for expanded IVF coverage is getting some pushback from conservatives normally aligned with Republicans. Jason Thacker is a senior fellow in bioethics at the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, or ERLC, which opposes the intentional destruction of embryos left over from IVF. JASON THACKER: We can do a lot of things in terms of biomedical technologies, advancements, even fertility treatments. We can do a lot of things. But what we as Christians and specifically at the ERLC are concerned about is to slow down and say, should we?

Here's Vance at the March for Life in Washington in January. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VICE PRESIDENT JD VANCE: So let me say very simply, I want more babies in the United States of America. (CHEERING) MCCAMMON: In his public remarks, Trump has explicitly linked support for IVF to the goal of making it easier for American couples to have more babies. Research suggests IVF does not increase overall fertility rates, it just shifts when some people start their families, according to Lyman Stone of the Pronatalism Initiative at the Institute for Family Studies. But Stone says there's at least one thing the federal government could do differently to encourage its workers to have more children. LYMAN STONE: Fifty-hour work weeks are highly sterilizing. So if we want to see more babies, we should really be thinking about expanding remote work options, not reducing them. MCCAMMON: The White House says the main goal of Trump's executive order is to help couples who are struggling to conceive, not to increase the nation's birth rate.

And I think the women and families, husbands, are very appreciative of it. MCCAMMON: That's Trump in February, when he signed an executive order focused on expanding access to in vitro fertilization. Trump has been staking out his support for the fertility treatment for more than a year. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: I strongly support the availability of IVF for couples who are trying to have a precious, little, beautiful baby. (CHEERING) TRUMP: I support it. MCCAMMON: That's Trump campaigning in South Carolina early last year, after an Alabama Supreme Court decision prompted fertility clinics there to temporarily stop offering the procedure. At a time when many Republicans were worried about a voter backlash against abortion restrictions, Trump noted that IVF has overwhelming public support. Now as president, he's directed administration officials to prepare a list of ideas for expanding access and reducing costs. BARBARA COLLURA: It's a good first start. MCCAMMON: Barbara Collura of RESOLVE, the National Infertility Association, notes that during the campaign, Trump promised either public funding or mandated insurance coverage for IVF. COLLURA: This executive order does not do that in and of itself. It is asking for policy recommendations. So as far as we're concerned, it's a first step. MCCAMMON: Collura is calling on the administration to offer comprehensive coverage for military service members and mandated coverage in health plans offered to federal employees, among other recommendations. Trump's push for expanded IVF coverage is getting some pushback from conservatives normally aligned with Republicans. Jason Thacker is a senior fellow in bioethics at the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, or ERLC, which opposes the intentional destruction of embryos left over from IVF. JASON THACKER: We can do a lot of things in terms of biomedical technologies, advancements, even fertility treatments. We can do a lot of things. But what we as Christians and specifically at the ERLC are concerned about is to slow down and say, should we? MCCAMMON: Some insurance industry leaders and some fiscal conservatives also warn that requiring insurance companies to cover IVF could increase overall health care costs.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\n(CHEERING) TRUMP: I support it. MCCAMMON: That's Trump campaigning in South Carolina early last year, after an Alabama Supreme Court decision prompted fertility clinics there to temporarily stop offering the procedure. At a time when many Republicans were worried about a voter backlash against abortion restrictions, Trump noted that IVF has overwhelming public support. Now as president, he's directed administration officials to prepare a list of ideas for expanding access and reducing costs. BARBARA COLLURA: It's a good first start. MCCAMMON: Barbara Collura of RESOLVE, the National Infertility Association, notes that during the campaign, Trump promised either public funding or mandated insurance coverage for IVF. COLLURA: This executive order does not do that in and of itself. It is asking for policy recommendations. So as far as we're concerned, it's a first step. MCCAMMON: Collura is calling on the administration to offer comprehensive coverage for military service members and mandated coverage in health plans offered to federal employees, among other recommendations. Trump's push for expanded IVF coverage is getting some pushback from conservatives normally aligned with Republicans. Jason Thacker is a senior fellow in bioethics at the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, or ERLC, which opposes the intentional destruction of embryos left over from IVF. JASON THACKER: We can do a lot of things in terms of biomedical technologies, advancements, even fertility treatments. We can do a lot of things. But what we as Christians and specifically at the ERLC are concerned about is to slow down and say, should we? MCCAMMON: Some insurance industry leaders and some fiscal conservatives also warn that requiring insurance companies to cover IVF could increase overall health care costs. John Shelton is policy director for Advancing American Freedom, a group founded by former Vice President Mike Pence. JOHN SHELTON: We just sort of see this health care mandate approach as probably driving up costs more, creating perverse incentives to create more embryos than are implanted. MCCAMMON: Beyond helping individual couples conceive, both Trump and his vice president, JD Vance, have spoken about a desire to see more births. Here's Vance at the March for Life in Washington in January. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VICE PRESIDENT JD VANCE: So let me say very simply, I want more babies in the United States of America. (CHEERING) MCCAMMON: In his public remarks, Trump has explicitly linked support for IVF to the goal of making it easier for American couples to have more babies. Research suggests IVF does not increase overall fertility rates, it just shifts when some people start their families, according to Lyman Stone of the Pronatalism Initiative at the Institute for Family Studies. But Stone says there's at least one thing the federal government could do differently to encourage its workers to have more children. LYMAN STONE: Fifty-hour work weeks are highly sterilizing. So if we want to see more babies, we should really be thinking about expanding remote work options, not reducing them. MCCAMMON: The White House says the main goal of Trump's executive order is to help couples who are struggling to conceive, not to increase the nation's birth rate.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nMCCAMMON: Collura is calling on the administration to offer comprehensive coverage for military service members and mandated coverage in health plans offered to federal employees, among other recommendations. Trump's push for expanded IVF coverage is getting some pushback from conservatives normally aligned with Republicans. Jason Thacker is a senior fellow in bioethics at the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, or ERLC, which opposes the intentional destruction of embryos left over from IVF. JASON THACKER: We can do a lot of things in terms of biomedical technologies, advancements, even fertility treatments. We can do a lot of things. But what we as Christians and specifically at the ERLC are concerned about is to slow down and say, should we? MCCAMMON: Some insurance industry leaders and some fiscal conservatives also warn that requiring insurance companies to cover IVF could increase overall health care costs. John Shelton is policy director for Advancing American Freedom, a group founded by former Vice President Mike Pence. JOHN SHELTON: We just sort of see this health care mandate approach as probably driving up costs more, creating perverse incentives to create more embryos than are implanted. MCCAMMON: Beyond helping individual couples conceive, both Trump and his vice president, JD Vance, have spoken about a desire to see more births. Here's Vance at the March for Life in Washington in January. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) VICE PRESIDENT JD VANCE: So let me say very simply, I want more babies in the United States of America. (CHEERING) MCCAMMON: In his public remarks, Trump has explicitly linked support for IVF to the goal of making it easier for American couples to have more babies. Research suggests IVF does not increase overall fertility rates, it just shifts when some people start their families, according to Lyman Stone of the Pronatalism Initiative at the Institute for Family Studies. But Stone says there's at least one thing the federal government could do differently to encourage its workers to have more children. LYMAN STONE: Fifty-hour work weeks are highly sterilizing.

      "text": "Trump team responds after 'Republicans for Harris' call Trump 'unfit' to be president\n\nSarah McCammon\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, speaks at a campaign rally Wednesday in Asheville, North Carolina. Matt Kelley/AP hide caption\n\nProminent Republicans who are supporting Vice President Harris are urging fellow members of their party to back the Democratic ticket over former President Donald Trump.\n\nDuring a Tuesday night meeting billed as an online rally for \"Republicans for Harris,\" former elected officials and Republican Party leaders made a case for supporting Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nFormer Rep. Denver Riggleman, once a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, was an adviser to the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 insurrection. He described Trump as an \"inveterate liar\" and a \"conspiracy theorist.\"\n\n\"When you see the data and you see the awful things I've seen - you see the command-and-control infrastructure of Jan. 6th - there's no way as a Republican that I could vote for anybody who's anti-Constitution,\" Riggleman said.\n\nThe Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Harris, and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, speak at a campaign rally in Philadelphia on Aug. 6. Matt Rourke/AP hide caption\n\nThe Trump campaign is now responding to the call, calling Harris \"dangerously liberal.\" In a statement to NPR, press secretary Karoline Leavitt did not specifically reference \"Republicans for Harris,\" instead echoing standard campaign talking points.\n\n\"President Trump is building the largest, most diverse political movement in history because his winning message of putting America first again resonates with Americans of all backgrounds,\" Leavitt said in the statement.\n\n\"Kamala Harris is weak, failed, and dangerously liberal and a vote for her is a vote for higher taxes, inflation, open borders, and war,\" she added.\n\nOn Tuesday night, several participants in the Republicans for Harris call did acknowledge that they do not always agree with Harris on policy. But, they argued, they believe Trump would endanger American democracy.\n\n\"When the Harris team wins and prevents the sudden death of American democracy, we can joyfully return to arguing over marginal tax rates and the role of government in health care and all the other issues that defined our politics for generations,\" said Craig Snyder, who leads a group called Haley Voters for Harris.\n\nSnyder's group recently received a cease-and-desist letter from former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who unsuccessfully ran for the Republican presidential nomination. Noting Harris' record as a former prosecutor, Snyder said he's trying to make the case to former Haley supporters and other center-right voters that Harris and Walz will govern from the center-left.\n\nSpeakers also sought to cast themselves - rather than Trump supporters - as the true inheritors of the GOP tradition, invoking former Republican presidents, including Ronald Reagan and the Bushes.\n\nAustin Weatherford, national Republican engagement director for the Harris campaign, noted that former President George W. Bush had described Trump as \"weird\" before Walz applied the term to the Republican nominee.\n\nRina Shah, a political strategist and former Republican National Convention delegate, framed a key voting issue for Democrats this year - abortion rights - in language designed to appeal to small-government conservatives. Shah referred to \"draconian bans\" supported by Republicans in multiple states since the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022.\n\n\"When I see that happening, I think it's antithetical to the Republican Party I came up in,\" Shah said. \"I don't want the government in my backyard, my bedroom, my bank account and certainly not in the medical exam room.\"\n\nOvercoming the fear of stigma and rejection from Republican loved ones also emerged as a key theme during the call.\n\nRosario Marin, who served as U.S. treasurer under President George W. Bush, described voting for Trump as \"unacceptable\" but acknowledged that voting for a Democrat may cause strained relationships for some people.\n\n\"It is not easy to vote outside your party,\" she said. \"You may lose friends. Your neighbors may disagree with you. Family gatherings may turn uncomfortable. But at the end of the day, I can assure you that you will know in your heart that you did the right thing and that it's a worthwhile and noble cause.\"\n\nFormer Rep. Joe Walsh of Illinois acknowledged that it \"takes a lot of courage\" for many Republicans to publicly break with their party, but he argued it's necessary.\n\n\"You have to publicly out yourself: 'I'm a Republican, I'm a conservative, and I'm supporting Kamala Harris,'\" Walsh said. \"It takes courage, but remember: Donald Trump is unfit to be president.\"\n\nOrganizers said more than 70,000 people joined the call live, where speakers urged Republican participants to get behind Harris through volunteering and publicly supporting her campaign.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "A Texas School Board Cut State-Approved Textbook Chapters About Diversity. A Board Member Says Material Violated the Law\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThis article is co-published with The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan local newsroom that informs and engages with Texans. Sign up for The Brief Weekly to get up to speed on their essential coverage of Texas issues.\n\nIn 2022, conservative groups celebrated a \"great victory\" over \" wokeified \" curriculum when the Texas State Board of Education squashed proposed social studies requirements for schools that included teaching kindergartners how Rosa Parks and Cesar Chavez \"advocated for positive change.\"\n\nAnother win came a year later as the state board rejected several textbooks that some Republicans argued could promote a \"radical environmental agenda\" because they linked climate change to human behavior or presented what conservatives perceived to be a negative portrayal of fossil fuels.\n\nBy the time the state board approved science and career-focused textbooks for use in Texas classrooms at the end of 2023, it appeared to be comfortably in sync with conservatives who had won control of local school boards across the state in recent years.\n\nBut the Republican-led state education board had not gone far enough for the conservative majority on the school board for Texas' third-largest school district.\n\nAt the tail end of a school board meeting in May of last year, Natalie Blasingame, a board member in suburban Houston's Cypress-Fairbanks Independent School District, proposed stripping more than a dozen chapters from five textbooks that had been approved by the state board and were recommended by a district committee of teachers and staffers.\n\nThe chapters, Blasingame said, were inappropriate for students because they discussed \"vaccines and polio,\" touched on \"topics of depopulation,\" had \"an agenda out of the United Nations\" and included \"a perspective that humans are bad.\"\n\nIn a less-publicized move, Blasingame, a former bilingual educator, proposed omitting several chapters from a textbook for aspiring educators titled \"Teaching.\" One of those chapters focuses on how to understand and educate diverse learners and states that it \"is up to schools and teachers to help every student feel comfortable, accepted and valued,\" and that \"when schools view diversity as a positive force, it can enhance learning and prepare students to work effectively in a diverse society.\"\n\nBlasingame did not offer additional details about her opposition to the chapters during the meeting. She didn't have to. The school board voted 6-1 to delete them.\n\nThe decision to strip chapters from books that had already won the approval of the state's conservative board of education represents an escalation in local school boards' efforts to influence what children in public schools are taught. Through the years, battles over textbooks have played out at the state level, where Republicans hold the majority. But local school boards that are supposed to be nonpartisan had largely avoided such fights - they weighed in on whether some books should be in libraries but rarely intervened so directly into classroom instruction. Cypress-Fairbanks now provides a model for supercharging these efforts at more fine-grained control, said Christopher Kulesza, a scholar at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy.\n\n\"One of the things that would concern me is that it's ideology pushing the educational standards rather than what's fact,\" he said.\n\nThe board's actions send a troubling message to students of color, Alissa Sundrani, a junior at Cy-Fair High School, said. \"At the point that you're saying that diversity, or making people feel safe and included, is not in the guidelines or not in the scope of what Texas wants us to be learning, then I think that's an issue.\"\n\nWith about 120,000 students, nearly 80% of whom are of Hispanic, Black and Asian descent, Cy-Fair is the largest school district in Texas to be taken over by ideologically driven conservative candidates. Blasingame was among a slate of candidates who were elected through the at-large voting system that ProPublica and The Texas Tribune found has been leveraged by conservative groups seeking to influence what children are taught about race and gender. Supporters say the system, in which voters cast ballots for all candidates districtwide instead of ones who live within specific geographic boundaries, results in broader representation for students, but voting rights advocates argue that it dilutes the power of voters of color.\n\nBlasingame and others campaigned against the teaching of critical race theory, an advanced academic concept that discusses systemic racism. Most of the winning candidates had financial backing from Texans for Educational Freedom, a statewide PAC that sought to build a \"stronghold\" of school board trustees \"committed to fighting Critical Race Theory and other anti-American agendas and curriculums.\" The PAC helped elect at least 30 school board candidates across the state between 2021 and 2023, in part because it focused on anti-CRT sentiment, said its founder, Christopher Zook Jr. \"You could literally go out and say, CRT, you know, 'Stop critical race theory in schools,' and everyone knew what that means, right?\" he said. \"The polling showed that that messaging works.\"\n\nShortly before Blasingame and two fellow conservatives won election in 2021, Texas lawmakers passed a landmark law that sought to shape how teachers approach instruction on race and racism. The law, which aimed to ban critical race theory, prohibits the \"inculcation\" of the notion that someone's race makes them \"inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously.\"\n\nBlasingame made no mention of the law when she pushed to remove chapters about teaching a diverse student body, but pointed to it as the reason for her objection in text messages and an interview with ProPublica and the Tribune. Though Blasingame acknowledged that one of the chapters had \"very good presentation on learning styles,\" she said removing the whole chapter was the only option because administrators said individual lines could not be stricken from the book.\n\nThe textbook referred to \"cultural humility\" and called for aspiring teachers to examine their \"unintentional and subtle biases,\" concepts that she said \"go against\" the law. The school board needed to act because the book \"slipped through\" before the state's education agency implemented a plan to make sure materials complied with the law, Blasingame said.\n\nState Board Chairman Aaron Kinsey, who is staunchly anti-CRT, declined to say if he thought the body had allowed textbooks to slip through as Blasingame suggested. Kinsey, however, said in a statement that contracts with approved publishers include requirements that their textbooks comply with all applicable laws. He did not comment on Cy-Fair removing chapters.\n\nCy-Fair appears to have taken one of the state's most aggressive approaches to enforcing the law, which does not address what is in textbooks but rather how educators approach teaching, said Paige Duggins-Clay, the chief legal analyst for the Intercultural Development Research Agency, a San Antonio-based nonprofit that advocates for equal educational opportunity.\n\n\"It definitely feels like Cy-Fair is seeking to test the boundaries of the law,\" Duggins-Clay said. \"And I think in a district like Cy-Fair, because it is so diverse, that is actively hurting a lot of young people who are ultimately paying the cost and bearing the burden of these really bad policies.\"\n\nThe law's vagueness has drawn criticism from conservative groups who say it allows school districts to skirt its prohibitions. Last month, Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a lawsuit against the Coppell school district in North Texas and accused administrators of illegally teaching \"woke and hateful\" CRT curriculum. The suit points to a secret recording of an administrator saying that the district will do what's right for students \"despite what our state standards say.\" The lawsuit does not provide examples of curriculum that it alleges violates state law on how to teach race. In a letter to parents, Superintendent Brad Hunt said that the district was following state standards and would \"continue to fully comply with applicable state and federal laws.\"\n\nTeachers and progressive groups have also argued that the law leaves too much open to interpretation, which causes educators to self-censor and could be used to target anything that mentions race.\n\nBlasingame disputes the critique. A longtime administrator and teacher whose family emigrated from South Africa when she was 9 years old, she said she embraces diversity in schools.\n\n\"Diversity is people and I love people,\" she said. \"That's what I'm called to do, first as a Christian and then as an educator.\"\n\nBut she said she opposes teaching about systemic racism and state-sanctioned efforts to promote diversity, equity and inclusion, saying that they overemphasize the importance of skin color.\n\n\"They seed hate and teach students that they are starting off behind and have unconquerable disadvantages that they will suffer all their lives,\" Blasingame said. \"Not only does this teach hate among people, but how could you love a country where this is true?\"\n\nThe assertion that teaching diversity turns students of color into victims is simply wrong, educators and students told the news organizations. Instead, they said, such discussions make them feel safe and accepted.\n\nOne educator who uses the \"Teaching\" textbook said the board members' decision to remove chapters related to diversity has been painful for students.\n\nRead More\n\n\"I don't know what their true intentions are, but to my students, what they are seeing is that unless you fit into the mold and you are like them, you are not valued,\" said the teacher, who did not want to be named because she feared losing her job. \"There were several who said it made them not want to teach anymore because they felt so unsupported.\"\n\nThe board's interpretation of the state's law on the teaching of race has stifled important classroom discussions, said Sundrani, the student in the district. Her AP English class, a seminar about the novel \"Huckleberry Finn,\" steered clear of what she thinks are badly needed conversations about race, slavery and how that history impacts people today.\n\n\"There were topics that we just couldn't discuss.\"\n\nFiled under -\n\nJeremy Schwartz is an investigative reporter for the ProPublica-Texas Tribune Investigative Initiative.\n\nDan Keemahill is a data reporter for the ProPublica-Texas Tribune Investigative Initiative.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "How Texas Conservatives Use At-Large School Board Elections to Influence What Students Learn\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThis article is co-published with The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan local newsroom that informs and engages with Texans. Sign up for The Brief Weekly to get up to speed on their essential coverage of Texas issues.\n\nThese highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.\n\nIn 2019, the Keller Independent School District in North Texas looked a lot like its counterpart just 30 miles to the east in the Dallas suburb of Richardson. Each served about 35,000 children and had experienced sharp increases in the racial diversity of students in recent decades. Each was run by a school board that was almost entirely white.\n\nIn the five years since, the districts have followed strikingly divergent paths as culture war battles over how to teach race and gender exploded across the state.\n\nIn Keller, candidates backed by groups seeking to limit the teaching of race and gender took control of the school board and immediately passed sweeping policies that gave outsized power to any individual who wanted to prevent the purchase of books they believed to be unsuitable for children.\n\nThough more than half of Keller's students are from racially diverse backgrounds, the district in 2023 nixed a plan to buy copies of a biography of Black poet Amanda Gorman after a teacher at a religious private school who had no children in the district complained about this passage: \"Amanda realized that all the books she had read before were written by white men. Discovering a book written by people who look like her helped Amanda find her own voice.\" The passage, the woman wrote, \"makes it sound like it's okay to judge a book by the authors skin color rather than the content of the book.\"\n\nBoard members at the Richardson school district went in the opposite direction, even as they contended with similar pressure from groups aiming to rid the district of any materials that they claimed pushed critical race theory, an advanced academic concept that discusses systemic racism. The school board did not ban library books but instead allowed parents to limit their own children's access to them, keeping them available for other students.\n\nOne major difference contributed to the districts' divergence: the makeup of their school boards.\n\nThe way communities elect school board members plays a key, if often overlooked, role in whether racially diverse districts like Keller and Richardson experience takeovers by ideologically driven conservatives seeking to exert greater influence over what children learn in public schools, ProPublica and The Texas Tribune found. Since the pandemic, such groups have successfully leveraged the state's long-standing and predominantly at-large method of electing candidates to flip school boards in their direction.\n\nMost of Texas' 1,000 school districts use an at-large method, where voters can cast ballots for all candidates. Supporters say that allows for broader representation for students, but voting rights advocates argue that such systems dilute the power of voters of color. If board members are elected districtwide, there tends to be less diversity, according to research, which also shows that if they are elected by smaller geographic zones, candidates of color often have more success.\n\n\"What you're seeing happening in Texas is how at-large districts make it easy for somebody to come in, usually from the outside, and hijack the process and essentially buy a board,\" said Michael Li, senior counsel for the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonprofit public policy institute that champions small-donor campaign financing. \"Because of this conflux of factors - at-large elections and large amounts of outside money - it just sort of defeats the idea of representative democracy.\"\n\nProPublica and the Tribune examined 14 rapidly diversifying suburban school districts where children from diverse backgrounds now make up more than half of the student population. In the six districts that used at-large voting systems, well-funded and culture-war-driven movements successfully helped elect school board members who have moved aggressively to ban or remove educational materials that teach children about diversity, even in districts where a majority of children are not white. Nearly 70% of board members in such districts live in areas that are whiter than their district's population.\n\nEight nearby school systems with similar demographics employ single-member voting systems to elect school board candidates. Under the single-member system, voters within certain boundaries elect a board member who specifically represents their area. Candidates in those districts received less campaign support from ideologically driven political action committees, and none of the districts experienced school board takeovers fueled by culture war issues.\n\nAbout 150 Texas school districts have transitioned to a single-member system since the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which is intended to prevent voter discrimination and has brought greater racial representation to local governments. Richardson joined that list in 2019 after a former Black board member sued the district.\n\nSuch legal challenges, however, could soon become more difficult. In one of his first acts in office, President Donald Trump froze civil rights litigation against school districts accused of discriminating against minority groups, and many legal experts believe that under his administration, federal prosecutors will refuse to bring challenges against at-large systems. DOJ officials did not respond to questions from the news organizations.\n\nTrump, a staunch critic of diversity and inclusion programs, has threatened to cut federal funding to schools that he says are pushing \"inappropriate racial, sexual or political content onto the shoulders of our children.\"\n\nDistricts whose boards oppose sweeping efforts to restrict curriculum and books related to race and racism face even more headwinds in Texas. In January, Gov. Greg Abbott vowed to ban diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in public schools, a move that would expand the state's existing ban on college campuses. And Texas lawmakers continue to target the books students can access. One bill, authored by North Texas state Sen. Angela Paxton , the wife of Attorney General Ken Paxton , would require every district in the state to follow a version of Keller's library book purchase policy.\n\nThe president of the Keller board, Charles Randklev, did not respond to multiple requests for comment, and the district did not answer written questions. District officials have previously said that the board represents all students, not just those in a specific neighborhood or area.\n\nBut Laney Hawes, the parent of four students in the district and an outspoken critic of the school board, said the policy on library purchases spawned a backdoor channel to banning materials about race. That, she said, has deprived her children of reading books about Americans like Gorman that provide points of view they might not find otherwise.\n\n\"They have created a system that allows anyone in the community to complain about any book for any reason, and now that book is not on library shelves,\" said Hawes, who is white. She added that the book does not contain any sexually explicit material and was strictly targeted because it dealt with race.\n\n\"They just hate the racial undertones.\"\n\nSchool districts across Texas have drawn considerable attention for removing books from their shelves, but board members in Keller went further when they passed a policy in August 2022 that, in practice, allowed community members to block proposed purchases.\n\nStudents spoke out against the district's removal policies during a board meeting months later, pleading for access to books about race. One biracial student, who has since graduated, told the board that books about characters from different racial backgrounds helped her feel more accepted.\n\n\"All kids deserve to see themselves in literature,\" the student said. \"Racial minorities being written into a story does not instantly equate the book to being propaganda. Having books that mirror the experience of race is not pushing an agenda. It's simply documenting the hardships that consistently happen to most students of color that they're able to relate to. Concealing ideas just because they tell an uncomfortable truth is not protecting your children.\"\n\nThe students' pleas didn't sway the board, and by July 2023, challenges to such books began pouring in.\n\nOne person opposed the purchase of \"Jim Crow: Segregation and the Legacy of Slavery.\" The person, who did not provide their name, pointed to a photo of a young girl participating in a Black Lives Matter protest with the caption: \"Just as in the past, people continue fighting for change.\" They also took issue with this quote: \"You can't 'get over' something that is still happening. Which is why black Americans can't 'get over' slavery or Jim Crow.\"\n\nThe photo and the quotes, the book challenger said, were \"potentially CRT,\" showed the Black Lives Matter Movement in \"a positive light\" and claimed \"oppression is still happening.\"\n\nAnother person challenged the planned purchase of \"Our Skin: A First Conversation About Race,\" saying that the book started \"beautifully,\" but that \"unfortunately tenets of CRT, social justice, and anti-white activism are portrayed.\" The person, who used a pseudonym, did not offer specifics.\n\nAdministrators removed those books, the Gorman biography and 26 others from the purchase list after receiving the complaints, according to district officials. Librarians can reinstate books on future lists, but 75% of those flagged for further review never made it to the shelves, an online search of district libraries shows. That includes the three books about race.\n\nHawes, who heads two PTA groups at her children's schools, said book challenges and complaints have come from allies of school board members. In 2022, Patriot Mobile Action, a North Texas Christian nationalist PAC funded by a cellphone company, spent more than $115,000 supporting three ideologically driven conservatives running for control of the school board.\n\nLeigh Wambsganss, Patriot Mobile's spokesperson and executive director of the PAC, declined to comment but said in a 2022 podcast that the PAC chose candidates based on their Christian conservative views and sought out those who \"absolutely would stand against critical race theory.\" Patriot Mobile supported eight candidates in three other North Texas districts that used at-large voting during the same election cycle. All of them won their races.\n\n\"We weren't prepared for what was coming,\" Hawes said. \"We were literally up against a machine.\"\n\nAnother PAC, KISD Family Alliance, spent $50,000 to help elect the same Keller school board candidates. Its donors included conservative activist Monty Bennett, who previously told the Tribune that he believes schools have been taken over by ideologues \"pushing their outlandish agendas.\" Neither Bennett nor the PAC's treasurer responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe slate of Keller candidates, whose combined campaign war chests dwarfed that of their opponents' by a more than 4 to 1 margin, focused their agendas squarely on culture war issues related to library books and curriculum.\n\n\"While I have many priorities I want to focus on, if concerns over child safety, and sexualization and politicization of children make me a one-issue candidate, so be it. I will be a one-issue candidate all day long,\" Joni Shaw Smith wrote on her campaign website. Smith, who is now a board member, declined to comment.\n\nHer election contributed to what would become a sweep of the seven seats on the board. Five of those seats are held by board members who live in the city of Keller, where three-quarters of residents are white and the median household income of more than $160,000 is among the highest in the state.\n\nMost of the Keller district's 42 schools, however, are located in the more diverse neighborhoods of Fort Worth.\n\nThirty miles away, the makeup of Richardson's school board changed dramatically after the district settled a lawsuit filed in 2018 by David Tyson Jr. He argued that the continued use of at-large voting to select candidates was a \"relic of the district's segregated past.\"\n\nTyson became the district's first Black board member when he was elected in 2004. After he retired in 2010, he watched with growing consternation as no candidates from diverse backgrounds followed in his footsteps, even though students of color accounted for nearly 70% of the district's population.\n\nFrustrated, Tyson sued Richardson, challenging its system for electing candidates under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He and Richardson officials settled the lawsuit in 2019, and the district converted primarily to a system in which candidates needed to live within specific boundaries and receive a majority of votes from residents who also lived within those boundaries to be elected.\n\nRichardson Board Members Now Represent More Parts of the District\n\nIn 2019, the district switched from at-large voting to a single-member system that required board members to live in the areas they represent. Now, board members come from more diverse backgrounds and are spread across the district.\n\nAs ideologically driven candidates swept Keller school board elections, similar efforts played out differently in Richardson. In 2022, two candidates supported by groups seeking to limit instruction and library books that deal with race and gender ran against two candidates of color with differing views. A local PAC that accused the district of teaching \"CRT nonsense\" in a mailer hired the same Republican campaign consulting firm that was working in support of the Keller candidates.\n\nDespite being outspent 2-to-1, the candidates of color won their elections. Their wins gave Richardson four board members of diverse backgrounds, a remarkable evolution from an all-white board just three years earlier. And, as nearby districts began mass removals of library books dealing with race and gender, the Richardson school board embraced an \"opt-out\" process to give concerned parents control over their children's reading \"without impacting the choices of other families who may have different values, wishes or expectations.\" Opponents say opt-out systems do not go far enough in protecting students from materials they deem objectionable.\n\n\"Single-member districts benefited us in making sure our school board maintains the diversity, and diversity of thought, we have, and not just fall into those culture wars,\" said Vanessa Pacheco, one of the board members who won.\n\nPacheco said not being consumed by such fights allowed the board to focus on \"real stuff\" like dual-language classes for elementary students, expanding pre-K opportunities and scheduling school events for parents in the evenings and on weekends to account for working families.\n\nSo striking was the district's atmosphere following the 2022 election that a Dallas Morning News commentary dubbed Richardson a \"no-drama district\" in a sea of school boards consumed by fights over race and gender.\n\nTyson, whose lawsuit set the stage for the Richardson school board's dramatic transformation, said that the shift in voting methods has accomplished what he had hoped for.\n\n\"The goal was to get representation,\" he said. \"We're a majority-minority school district, and so we need to have a majority-minority representation on the school board.\"\n\nHawes watched as voters down the road in Richardson rejected candidates seeking to limit what the district's diverse student body could read and learn. She watched as the board itself grew increasingly diverse. And she watched with a touch of envy as the district embraced the idea that parents and community members who opposed certain books should not make decisions for every child in the district.\n\nWith Richardson as their north star, Hawes and a growing number of concerned parents began discussing ways to force the Keller school district to adopt what they believed was a more representative voting system. It wasn't just a question of race for Hawes. It was also about geographic diversity. Board members who live in the city of Keller hold a majority, even though less than a third of students in the district attend schools there.\n\nMost Keller Board Members Live in the District's Least Diverse Area\n\nMeanwhile, no board member lives in the area with the largest share of students of color.\n\nSo last year, Hawes and other concerned parents met with law firms and the NAACP and began planning a petition drive that would require the board to hold an election to do away with at-large voting. Members planned to meet in January to finalize a strategy.\n\nThen, in mid-January, the Keller school board shocked many in the community by proposing to split the district in two, separating the whiter, more affluent city of Keller to the east from the neighborhoods of northern Fort Worth, which are home to the majority of the district's students, including many who are low income. Like many districts in the state, Keller faces a massive budget shortfall.\n\nRandklev, the board president, defended the split as financially beneficial for both districts in a Facebook post last month. He also wrote that \"neighboring school districts have been forced into single-member districts, and that's a no-win situation regardless of where you live.\" He did not explain his position but said the proposed split \"could provide programming opportunities that best reflect local community goals and values and foster greater parent and community involvement.\"\n\nBut many parents, including Dixie Davis, who previously ran unsuccessfully for the board, said the proposed change would leave the vast majority of the district's low-income student population, and most of its students of color, with uncertain access to facilities like an advanced learning center and the district's swimming complex.\n\nRead More\n\nOn Friday, board members abandoned plans to divide the school district in two, citing the cost of restructuring the district's debt. But their push to split the district has further energized efforts by some parents to do away with at-large voting. Brewer Storefront, the same law firm that fought to change the voting system in Richardson, has filed a similar legal challenge in federal court against Keller and concerned parents have launched a petition drive to force the district to vote on its at-large system. The district has not yet filed a response to the lawsuit and did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\n\"With the momentum and uproar around this proposed district split, it's now or never to get this done,\" Davis said. \"It'll be a huge uphill battle, but this is our best shot.\"\n\nLexi Churchill , ProPublica and The Texas Tribune, and Jessica Priest , The Texas Tribune, contributed research.\n\nFiled under -\n\nJeremy Schwartz is an investigative reporter for the ProPublica-Texas Tribune Investigative Initiative.\n\nDan Keemahill is a data reporter for the ProPublica-Texas Tribune Investigative Initiative.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "Conservatives Go to War - Against Each Other - Over School Vouchers\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nDrive an hour south of Nashville into the rolling countryside of Marshall County, Tennessee - past horse farms, mobile homes and McMansions - and you will arrive in Chapel Hill, population 1,796. It's the birthplace of Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest, who helped found the Ku Klux Klan. And it's the home of Todd Warner, one of the most unlikely and important defenders of America's besieged public schools.\n\nWarner is the gregarious 53-year-old owner of PCS of TN, a 30-person company that does site grading for shopping centers and other construction projects. The second-term Republican state representative \"absolutely\" supports Donald Trump, who won Marshall County by 50 points in 2020. Warner likes to talk of the threats posed by culture-war bogeymen, such as critical race theory; diversity, equity and inclusion; and Shariah law.\n\nAnd yet, one May afternoon in his office, under a TV playing Fox News and a mounted buck that he'd bagged in Alabama, he told me about his effort to halt Republican Gov. Bill Lee's push for private school vouchers in Tennessee. Warner's objections are rooted in the reality of his district: It contains not a single private school, so to Warner, taxpayer money for the new vouchers would clearly be flowing elsewhere, mostly to well-off families in metro Nashville, Memphis and other cities whose kids are already enrolled in private schools. Why should his small-town constituents be subsidizing the private education of metropolitan rich kids? \"I'm for less government, but it's government's role to provide a good public education,\" he said. \"If you want to send your kid to private school, then you should pay for it.\"\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic provided a major boost to supporters of school vouchers, who argued that extended public school closures - and the on-screen glimpses they afforded parents of what was being taught to their kids - underscored the need to give parents greater choice in where to send their children. Eleven states, led by Florida and Arizona, now have universal or near-universal vouchers, meaning that even affluent families can receive thousands of dollars toward their kids' private school tuition.\n\nThe beneficiaries in these states are mostly families whose kids were already enrolled in private schools, not families using the vouchers to escape struggling public schools. In larger states, the annual taxpayer tab for the vouchers is close to $1 billion, leaving less money for public schools at a time when they already face the loss of federal pandemic aid.\n\nVoucher advocates, backed by a handful of billionaire funders, are on the march to bring more red and purple states into the fold for \"school choice,\" their preferred terminology for vouchers. And again and again, they are running up against rural Republicans like Warner, who are joining forces with Democratic lawmakers in a rare bipartisan alliance. That is, it's the reddest regions of these red and purple states that are putting up some of the strongest resistance to the conservative assault on public schools.\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nThanks for signing up.

Support independent journalism by donating to ProPublica.\n\nConservative orthodoxy at the national level holds that parents must be given an out from a failing public education system that force-feeds children progressive fads. But many rural Republican lawmakers have trouble reconciling this with the reality in their districts, where many public schools are not only the sole educational option, but also the largest employer and the hub of the community - where everyone goes for holiday concerts, Friday night football and basketball. Unlike schools in blue metro areas, rural schools mostly reopened for in-person instruction in the fall of 2020, and they are far less likely to be courting controversy on issues involving race and gender.\n\nDemonizing public education in the abstract is one thing. But it's quite another when the target is the school where you went, where your kids went. For Todd Warner, that was Forrest High School in Chapel Hill. \"My three kids graduated from public schools, and they turned out just fine,\" he said. \"Ninety-five percent of our students, our future business owners, our future leaders, are going to the public schools. They're not going to private. Why take it away from them?\"\n\nThe response from voucher proponents to the resistance from fellow Republicans has taken several forms, all of which implicitly grant the critics' case that voucher programs currently offer little benefit to rural areas. In some states, funding for vouchers is being paired with more money for public schools, to offer support for rural districts. In Ohio, voucher advocates are proposing to fund the construction of new private schools in rural areas where none exist, giving families places to use vouchers.\n\nBut the overriding Republican response to rural skeptics has been a political threat: Get with the program on vouchers, or else.\n\nThat's what played out this year in Ohio's 83rd District, in the state's rural northwest. Last summer, Ohio adopted universal private school vouchers, with middle- and working-class families eligible for up to $8,407 per high school student and even the very wealthiest families eligible for almost $1,000 per child. Private school leaders urged already enrolled families to seek the money, and more than 140,000 families applied for vouchers. The cost has exceeded estimates, approaching $1 billion, with most of it going to the parochial schools that dominate the state's private school landscape. Voucher advocates are now pushing to create educational savings accounts to cover tuition at unchartered private schools that are not eligible for the vouchers.\n\nSchool leaders in Hardin County - with its cornfields, solar panel installations and what was once one of the largest dairy farms east of the Mississippi - are deeply worried that vouchers stand to hurt county residents. Only a single small private school is within reach, one county to the south, which means that virtually no local taxpayers would see any of that voucher money themselves - it would be going to private school families in Columbus, Cincinnati and other large population centers. (And under Ohio law, the very public schools that are losing students must pay to transport any students who attend private institutions within a half-hour drive of the public school.)\n\nCraig Hurley, the superintendent for Hardin's Upper Scioto Valley District, is a solidly built 52-year-old who calls himself a staunch conservative. He attended the district's schools and has worked in them for 30 years. He knows that they provide meals to 400 students, nearly two-thirds of whom qualify for free and reduced lunch. Even though the high school can muster only 20 players for football - basketball fares better - the fans come out to cheer. \"Our district is our community,\" he told me. \"The more you separate that, the less of a community we're going to be.\"\n\nHurley has calculated that local schools are receiving less state funding per student than what private schools now receive for the maximum possible voucher amount. Yet private schools face almost none of the accountability that public schools do regarding how the money is spent and what outcomes it achieves. \"We have fiscal responsibility on all of it, on every dime, every penny we spend,\" he said. \"There's no audit for them.\" Not to mention, he added, \"a private school doesn't have to accept all students, right? They pick who they want.\"\n\nThirteen miles east, Chad Thrush, the school superintendent in Kenton, the county seat, noted that his school system is the second-largest employer in town, after Graphic Packaging, which makes plastic cups for vending machines. He worries that the rising cost of the voucher program will erode state funding for public schools, and he worries about what would happen to his district if a new private school opened in town. Thrush understands the appeal of vouchers for parents who want a leg up for their kid. But, he told me, \"we need to be looking at how we're preparing all students to be successful, not just my student.\"\n\nAs it happens, the two superintendents have a crucial ally in Columbus: their state representative, Jon Cross. Like Warner in Tennessee, Cross is an ardent pro-Trump conservative and deeply opposed to private school vouchers. At a legislative hearing last year, he cut loose at a lobbyist for Americans for Prosperity - the conservative advocacy group founded by the industrialist Koch brothers - who was testifying for vouchers, one of the organization's long-standing causes. \"Wouldn't we be better off taking some money in our budget to fix the schools?\" Cross said. \"I tell you what, I really like my public schools. I'm really proud that Carson and Connor, my sons, go to Kenton City Schools and get an education from there just like I did.\"\n\nCross' resistance to vouchers earned him the animus of the state Senate president, Matt Huffman, an avid voucher proponent. Huffman encouraged a primary challenge of Cross. So greatly did local school officials value Cross' support that shortly before the March 19 primary, they held a public meeting to explain the threat vouchers posed, with Cross in attendance. \"If the economy goes bad, are we going to pull $1 billion out for private schools?\" Thrush said. Or, he continued, would the public schools be left with less money?\n\nThe schools in Hardin and Marshall counties are majority white. But some rural Republican legislators in other states have been willing to buck their party leaders on vouchers even in more racially diverse districts. In Georgia, of the 15 Republican state representatives who blocked a voucher proposal last year, more than half came from rural areas with substantial Black populations. One of them was Gerald Greene, who spent more than three decades as a high school social studies teacher and has managed to survive as a Republican in his majority-Black district in the state's southwestern corner after switching parties in 2010.\n\nGreene believes vouchers will harm his district. It has a couple of small private schools in it or just outside it - with student bodies that are starkly more white than the district's public schools - but the majority of his constituents rely on the public schools, and he worries that vouchers will leave less money for them. \"I just felt like we were abandoning our public schools,\" he told me. \"I'm not against private schools at all, but I just did not see how these vouchers would help southwestern Georgia.\"\n\nAfter failing to pass a voucher program last year, the state's Republican governor, Brian Kemp, and proponents in the legislature tried again this year, and this time they succeeded, albeit with vouchers more constrained than elsewhere: They can be used only by students in school districts that are ranked in the bottom quartile and whose families make less than 400% of the poverty level ($120,000 for a family of four), and their total cost can't exceed 1% of the state's total education budget, which caps them now at $140 million.\n\nPartisan pressures simply became too strong for some skeptical Republicans, including Greene's counterpart in the Senate, Sam Watson. Seminole County Superintendent Mark Earnest told me about the conversation in which Watson let him know that he was going to have to support the limited vouchers. \"They have turned this into a caucus priority. It's getting very political,\" Watson said. \"Thanks for letting me know,\" Earnest replied, \"but all vouchers are bad for public education.\" Watson's response: \"I know, but I couldn't go with the Democrats. Sorry.\" (Watson did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nThe highest-profile rural Republican resistance to vouchers has come in Texas, the land of Friday Night Lights and far-flung oil country settlements where the public schools anchor communities. Late last year, the Texas House voted 84-63 to strip vouchers out of a broad education bill. In response, Gov. Greg Abbott launched a purge of anti-voucher Republicans in this year's primaries, backed by millions of dollars from the Pennsylvania megadonor Jeff Yass, a finance billionaire.\n\nAmong those targeted was Drew Darby, who represents a sprawling 10-county district in West Texas and who frames the issue in starkly regional terms: The state's metro areas depend on his constituents to provide \"food, fiber and hide,\" to \"tend the oil wells and wind turbines to provide electricity to people who want to be just a little cooler in the cities.\" But without good public schools, these rural areas will wither. \"Robert Lee, Winters, Sterling, Blackwell,\" he said, listing some hamlets - \"these communities exist because they have strong public schools. They would literally not exist without a good public school system.\"\n\nDarby, a fiscal conservative, is also opposed to a new entitlement for private school families that is projected to soon cost $2 billion a year. \"In rural Texas, there's not a whole lot of private school options, and we want our schools to get every dollar they can. This doesn't add $1, and it's not good for rural Texas.\"\n\nDarby managed to stave off his primary challenge, but 11 of the 15 voucher resisters targeted by Abbott lost, several in races so close that they went to a runoff. Abbott is unapologetic: \"Congratulations to all of tonight's winners,\" he said after the runoff. \"Together, we will ensure the best future for our children.\" Also succumbing to his primary challenger was Jon Cross, in western Ohio. His opponent, Ty Mathews, managed to make the campaign about more than just vouchers, taking sides in a bitter leadership split within the GOP caucus.\n\nAnd for all the concerns that local school leaders have about the effect of vouchers, the threat remained abstract to many voters. \"I'm not worried about it, because we don't have the revenue here anyways in this town for anything to be taken from us to be given to a bigger town,\" one 60-year-old woman told me after casting her vote for Mathews. A younger woman asked simply: \"What exactly are the vouchers?\"\n\nBut in Tennessee, Todd Warner and his allies staved off the threat again this year. To overcome rural resistance, voucher proponents in the Tennessee House felt the need to constrain them and pair them with hundreds of millions of dollars in additional funding for public schools, but this was at odds with the state Senate's more straightforward voucher legislation. The two chambers were unable to come to an agreement before the session's end in April, by which point the House bill had not even made it to the floor for a vote.\n\nFor Democratic voucher opponents in the state, the alliance with Warner and other rural Republicans was as helpful as it was unusual. \"It was strange,\" Rep. Sam McKenzie, a Black Democrat from Knoxville, told me. McKenzie compared it to \"Twins,\" a movie in which Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito played unlikely fraternal twins: \"Representative Warner and I were in lockstep opposition to this voucher scam.\"\n\nOne voucher supporter, Rep. Scott Cepicky, told me he was confident that his side would eventually prevail. \"We'll work on this again next year,\" he said. \"The governor is committed that we're going to run on school choice again.\" And Americans for Prosperity has made clear that it's coming after voucher opponents. Its Tennessee state director, Tori Venable, told Warner during the legislative session that \"I can't protect you if you ain't on the right side of this.\"\n\nRead More\n\nAnother conservative group, the American Federation for Children, sent out a text message in March attacking Warner for his opposition to \"parental rights,\" without using the term vouchers. And a retired teacher in Marshall County, Gwen Warren, told me she and her husband recently got a visit from an Americans for Prosperity canvasser citing Warner's opposition to vouchers. \"She said: 'We're going around the neighborhood trying to talk to people about vouchers. We feel like Tennesseans really want the voucher system.'\" To which, Warren said, her husband replied: \"You're very much mistaken, lady. We don't want vouchers in this county, and you need to go away.\"\n\nWarner remains unfazed by all this. He is pretty sure that his voucher opposition in fact helped him win his seat in 2020, after the incumbent Republican voted for a pilot voucher system limited to Nashville and Memphis. And he notes that no one has registered to challenge him in the state's Aug. 1 primary. \"They tried to find a primary opponent but couldn't,\" he said with a chuckle. \"I was born and raised here all my life. My family's been here since the 18th century. I won't say I can't be beat, but bring your big-boy pants and come on, let's go.\"\n\nHelp ProPublica Report on Education\n\nProPublica is building a network of educators, students, parents and other experts to help guide our reporting about education.

Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nA few months ago, Leonard Leo laid out his next audacious project.\n\nEver since the longtime Federalist Society leader helped create a conservative supermajority on the Supreme Court, and then received more than a billion dollars from a wealthy Chicago business owner to disburse to conservative causes, Leo's next moves had been the subject of speculation.\n\nNow, Leo declared in a slick but private video to potential donors, he planned to \"crush liberal dominance\" across American life. The country was plagued by \"woke-ism\" in corporations and education, \"one-sided journalism\" and \"entertainment that's really corrupting our youth,\" said Leo amid snippets of cheery music and shots of sunsets and American flags.\n\nSitting tucked into a couch, with wire-rimmed glasses and hair gone to gray, Leo conveyed his inspiration and intentions: \"I just said to myself, 'Well, if this can work for law, why can't it work for lots of other areas of American culture and American life where things are really messed up right now?'\"\n\nLeo revealed his latest battle plan in the previously unreported video for the Teneo Network, a little-known group he called \"a tremendously important resource for the future of our country.\"\n\nTeneo is building what Leo called in the video \"networks of conservatives that can roll back\" liberal influence in Wall Street and Silicon Valley, among authors and academics, with pro athletes and Hollywood producers. A Federalist Society for everything.\n\nDespite its linchpin role in Leo's plans, Teneo (which is not the similarly named consulting firm associated with former officials in the Bill Clinton administration) has kept a low public profile. Its one-page website includes bland slogans - \"Timeless ideas. Fresh approach\" - and scant details. Its co-founder described Teneo as \"private and confidential\" in one presentation, and the group doesn't disclose the vast majority of its members or its funders.\n\nBut ProPublica and Documented have obtained more than 50 hours of internal Teneo videos and hundreds of pages of documents that reveal the organization's ambitious agenda, influential membership and burgeoning clout. We have also interviewed Teneo members and people familiar with the group's activities. The videos, documents and interviews provide an unfiltered look at the lens through which the group views the power of the left - and how it plans to combat it.\n\nIn response to questions for this story, Leo said in a statement: \"Teneo's young membership proves that the conservative movement is poised to be even more talented, driven, and successful in the future. This is a group that knows how to build winning teams.\"\n\nThe records show Teneo's members have included a host of prominent names from the conservative vanguard, including such elected officials as U.S. Sens. J.D. Vance of Ohio and Missouri's Josh Hawley , a co-founder of the group. Other members have included Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, now the fourth-ranking House Republican, as well as Nebraska's attorney general and Virginia's solicitor general. Three senior aides to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a potential 2024 presidential candidate, are members. Another is the federal judge who struck down a Biden administration mask mandate. The heads of the Republican Attorneys General Association, Republican State Leadership Committee and Turning Point USA - all key cogs in the world of national conservative politics - have been listed as Teneo members.\n\nConservative media figures like Ben Shapiro of the Daily Wire, several pro athletes and dozens of executives and senior figures in the worlds of finance, energy and beyond have also been members.\n\nLeo joined Teneo's board of directors as chairman in 2021 and has since become a driving force.\n\nWatch Leonard Leo Talk About Teneo\n\nTeneo co-founder Evan Baehr, a tech entrepreneur and veteran of conservative activism, said in a 2019 video for new members that Teneo had \"many, many, many dozens\" of members working in the Trump administration, including in the White House, State Department, Justice Department and Pentagon. \"They're everywhere.\"\n\nThe goal, Baehr said in another video, was \"a world in which Teneans serve in the House and the Senate, as governors - one might be elected president.\"\n\nTeneo Has Ambitious Plans\n\nHere's how \"the Left\" works in America, according to Baehr.\n\n\"Imagine a group of four people sitting at the Harvard Club for lunch in midtown Manhattan,\" he said in a 2020 Teneo video: \"a billionaire hedge funder,\" \"a film producer,\" \"a Harvard professor\" and \"a New York Times writer.\"\n\n\"The billionaire says: 'Wouldn't it be cool if middle school kids had free access to sex-change therapy paid for by the federal government?'\" Baehr continued. \"Well, the filmmaker says, 'I'd love to do a documentary on that; it will be a major motion film.' The Harvard professor says, 'We can do studies on that to say that's absolutely biologically sound and safe.' And the New York Times person says, 'I'll profile people who feel trapped in the wrong gender.' \"\n\nAfter a single lunch, Baehr concluded, elite liberals can \"put different kinds of capital together\" and \"go out into the world\" and \"basically wreck shop.\"\n\nIn a recorded video \"town hall\" held for incoming members, Baehr, a graduate of three Ivy League universities and a serial entrepreneur fluent in tech startup lingo, recalled the moment when he had the epiphany to create a conservative counter-effort.\n\nIt happened a decade earlier when he was eating lunch at a \"fairly uninviting\" Baja Fresh in Dupont Circle in Washington, D.C., with his then-boss Peter Thiel, the iconoclastic venture capitalist.\n\nBaehr explained in the video that he had become frustrated as he kicked around right-of-center politics and activism for a few years, working on Capitol Hill, in the George W. Bush White House and for right-of-center groups including the American Enterprise Institute and the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty.\n\nEvan Baehr Explains Teneo's Origin\n\nBaehr and Thiel lamented what they saw as the fragmented state of conservative networks, with their hidebound think tanks and intellectual centers that hold sway over right-of-center politics. A rare bright spot on their side, Baehr and Thiel agreed, was the Federalist Society. Thiel had, in fact, served as president of the Stanford Federalist Society. What if there were a group similar to the Federalist Society for venture capitalists or corporate CEOs or members of the media? (Thiel did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nIn 2008, Baehr, Hawley and others launched Teneo - Latin for \"I grasp\" or \"I endure.\" Hawley, then an associate lawyer in private practice, authored Teneo's founding principles, according to the new member talk hosted by Baehr, and served on the group's board. Its core beliefs align with the broader conservative establishment's: limited government, individual liberty, free enterprise, strong national defense and civil society and belief in a \"transcendent order\" that is \"founded in tradition, philosophy, or theology.\"\n\nFor a long time, the group didn't live up to expectations. In its first year, Teneo raised a paltry $77,000, according to its tax filing . From 2009 to 2017, the group, based first in Washington, D.C., and later in Austin, Texas, never raised more than $750,000 in a single year, tax records show. One member described in an interview Teneo's early days as little more than a run-of-the-mill dinner club with partisan overtones: \"Instead of being an organization about ideas, it was all about being a Republican.\"\n\nEnter Leo. In the early years of the Trump administration, he and the Federalist Society had remarkable influence within the new government. The Federalist Society had brought the legal doctrines of originalism and textualism - close readings of laws and the Constitution to adhere to the intent and words of the authors - into the mainstream. Leo had taken a leave of absence from the group to advise President Trump on judicial appointments, helping shepherd the appointments of Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court and helping to fill more than 200 other positions in federal district and appellate courts. By the time Trump left office, he had put on the bench 28% of all federal judges in America.\n\nIn the town hall video, Baehr explained how he modeled Teneo on the Federalist Society. Leo's \"secret sauce,\" he said, was to identify an \"inner core\" group of people within the Federalist Society's 60,000 members. Leo was \"identifying them and recruiting them for either specific roles to serve as judges or to spin up and launch critical projects often which you would have no idea about.\"\n\nSoon after Leo took an interest in Teneo, the group's finances soared. Annual revenue reached $2.3 million in 2020 and nearly $5 million in 2021, according to tax records. In 2021, the bulk of Teneo's income - more than $3 million - came from one source: DonorsTrust, a clearinghouse for conservative, libertarian and other charitable gifts that masks the original source of the money. In 2020, the Leo-run group that received the Chicago business owner's $1.6 billion donation gave $41 million to DonorsTrust, which had $1.5 billion in assets as of 2021.\n\nTeneo's other funders have included marquee conservative donors: hedge fund investor Paul Singer, Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus, the Charles Koch Foundation, the Bradley Foundation, and the DeVos family, according to Baehr.\n\nAs the group's finances improved, its videos became much more professionally produced, and its website underwent a dramatic upgrade from previous iterations. All of this was part of what Baehr called \"Teneo 2.0,\" a major leap forward for the group, driven in part by Leo's guidance and involvement.\n\nBaehr declined an interview request. He said in a statement: \"Since Teneo began, I've been building hundreds of friendships among diverse leaders who have a deep love for this country and are working on innovative solutions to drive human flourishing for all. Teneo has made me a better husband, father, and leader.\"\n\nTeneo aims to help members find jobs, write books, meet spouses, secure start-up financing or nonprofit donors and learn about public service. As described in a \"Community Vision\" report from 2019, Teneo seeks to distinguish itself by acting as \"the Silicon Valley of Conservatism - a powerful network of communities where the most influential young leaders, the biggest ideas, and the most leveraged resources come together to launch key projects that advance our shared belief that the conservative worldview drives human flourishing.\"\n\nMany of the connections happen at Teneo's annual retreat, which brings together hundreds of members and their spouses, plus allies including politicians like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and DeSantis as well as business leaders and prominent academics. Speakers at past Teneo retreats have included luminaries spanning politics, culture, business and the law: New York Times columnist David Brooks, federal judge Trevor McFadden, Blackwater founder Erik Prince, \"Woke, Inc.\" author and 2024 presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, former Trump cabinet official and 2024 presidential hopeful Nikki Haley, ultrawealthy donors and activists Dick and Betsy DeVos, and Chick-fil-A board chair Dan Cathy.\n\nBut the group's internal documents and videos also show the widening sprawl of its other activities. Teneo currently has 20 regional chapters nationwide, plus industry working groups focused, most recently, on media, corporate America, finance and law. In April, the group is hosting a \"finance summit\" in South Beach that its invitation says will \"convene rising conservative talent from major financial institutions, funds, and family offices to connect and discuss key industry issues fundamental to the future of our country.\"\n\nTeneo members represent different facets of the conservative movement writ large. Some Teneo members were \"very strong Trump defenders,\" Baehr said in the 2019 town hall video, while others have opposed Trump vehemently. Baehr said there were clear divisions within the group's members about immigration and trade policy. \"Hopefully other ones, maybe Green New Deal, I hope that's more like 99 to 1\" in opposition, he said.\n\nIt's in the town hall video that Baehr assured new members that Teneo \"is private and confidential.\" He said the group will never reveal the names of its members without their permission, though they are free to disclose their membership if they want to. Members must be in their 40s or younger to join.\n\nBaehr said Teneo's website is crafted so as not to pique the interest of Senate staffers who might look up the group if one of its members mentions Teneo during a confirmation process for a judgeship or a cabinet position. \"We think a lot about that to protect your current and future leadership opportunities,\" Baehr explained.\n\nThis strategy appears to have worked. A spokesperson for Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., a critic of Leo's who has spoken extensively about dark money and the courts, said the senator's staff was \"not familiar with Teneo.\" During the confirmation process of Ryan Holte, a Trump appointee to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, Holte was asked several written questions by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Cal., about his membership in Teneo, but Feinstein spelled the group's name wrong each time. (Asked what the mission of the group was, Holte responded that Teneo was a \"nonpartisan, and nonprofit, organization that gathers members from a variety of professional backgrounds for dinners and social activities to discuss current events.\")\n\nA recent Teneo fundraising email laid out how the group can bring its members' influence together in service of a cause.\n\nTo \"confront\" what he dubbed \"woke capitalism,\" Jonathan Bunch, a longtime Leo deputy and now Teneo board member, wrote that the group had brought together a coalition of Teneans \"working with (or serving as) state attorneys general, state financial officers, state legislators, journalists, media executives and best-in-class public affairs professionals\" to launch investigations, hold hearings, pull state investment funds and publish op-eds and news stories in response to so-called environmental, social and governance, or ESG, policies at the corporate level.\n\n\"Our members were in the rooms where it happened,\" Bunch wrote.\n\nAnother project underway, Baehr explained in a 2020 presentation, was a \"surreptitious and exciting\" effort to map key institutions in major cities - private schools, country clubs, newspapers, Rotary and so on - and find ways to get Teneo members inside those institutions and help members connect with each other. The initiative has begun by mapping Atlanta and several cities in Texas.\n\nFor those Teneo members who run for elected office, the network offers easy access to a large pool of donors and allies. A Leo acolyte and member of Teneo's Midwest membership committee, Will Scharf, is now running for Missouri attorney general. Campaign finance records show that dozens of Teneo members made substantial early contributions to Scharf's campaign, including Leo, Baehr and other members of Teneo's leadership, who last year each gave the maximum allowable donation of $2,650.\n\nIn an email, Scharf said many of his \"dearest friends are members of Teneo, and it has been a privilege to be involved with such an extraordinarily talented and committed group of young conservatives.\"\n\nRead More\n\nLeo's own statements about Teneo suggest that his plan for the group extends well beyond achieving near-term political victories.\n\n\"When you're fighting a battle for the heart and soul of our culture, you want to know you're in the trenches with someone you can trust, someone you know, and someone who will have your back,\" Teneo's \"Community Vision\" report quotes Leo as saying. \"We don't win unless we build friendship and fellowship with other people - and that's what you're doing here with Teneo.\"\n\nHelp ProPublica Investigate Threats to U.S. Democracy\n\nWe want to hear directly from the people involved in the administration of our elections - local clerks, canvassers, poll workers and more - about new challenges on the job.\n\nDo you have information about Leonard Leo or the Teneo Network that we should know?

      "text": "Texas AG Ken Paxton Won't Face Federal Corruption Charges as He Gains Momentum for Likely Senate Run\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThis article is co-published with The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan local newsroom that informs and engages with Texans. Sign up for The Brief Weekly to get up to speed on their essential coverage of Texas issues.\n\nAttorney General Ken Paxton has spent much of his career, which has taken him to the heights of Republican politics, trailed by a raft of criminal and civil accusations.\n\nBut in the final days of the Biden administration, The Associated Press reported Thursday, the Justice Department defused the most serious legal threat he faced - a federal criminal probe into allegations of corruption - by declining to prosecute and effectively ending the investigation.\n\nWith the investigation over, Paxton has nearly cleared his crowded slate of career-threatening legal battles, just as he gears up for a likely 2026 primary run against U.S. Sen. John Cornyn.\n\n\"The end of this investigation is both politically and personally a huge boon for Ken Paxton,\" said Matthew Wilson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University. \"Paxton can point to that and say, 'You see, even under a Democratic administration, they didn't feel that there was anything there that merited moving forward.'\"\n\nTwo sources familiar with the issue, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, told the AP of the Justice Department's decision, including that it was made while President Joe Biden was still in office. The DOJ did not immediately respond to questions about confirming the AP report.\n\nThe development extends a multiyear string of legal victories vindicating the once-embattled Republican. It underscores Paxton's durability through all manner of political, personal and legal troubles and helps burnish his reputation among the right wing of his party as a fighter who, like President Donald Trump, has defied numerous efforts by his detractors to take him down.\n\n\"It really sets up those parallels to Trump that will play very well among the Republican primary electorate,\" Wilson said. \"Paxton is a political survivor. People have written his obituary a couple of times, and he has really forged this loyal base among the grassroots activists in the Republican Party.\"\n\nPaxton's attorney Dan Cogdell said he learned of the outcome from the AP because the Justice Department never notified him of its decision not to prosecute.\n\n\"The fact that they declined prosecution is not a surprise,\" Cogdell said. \"I don't really think they ever had a case to begin with.\"\n\nThere was little concern that the case would continue under the Trump administration's Justice Department, given Paxton's close alliance with the president.\n\nIn January, the Texas Supreme Court tossed the State Bar of Texas' lawsuit against Paxton over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election won by Biden.\n\nProsecutors last year dropped felony securities fraud charges against Paxton just three weeks before he was set to face trial, after he agreed to perform 100 hours of community service, take 15 hours of legal ethics courses and pay $271,000 in restitution to those he was accused of defrauding more than a decade ago. The deal ended a nearly nine-year-old felony case that had dogged Paxton since his early days in office.\n\nAnd when the state Legislature sought to impeach him for the same allegations of corruption that spurred the federal investigation, the Texas Senate acquitted him of 16 charges of bribery, abuse of office and obstruction - charges that more than 70% of his own party had supported in the House .\n\nPaxton's last outstanding legal battle is a whistleblower lawsuit filed against him by four of the former senior aides who reported him to the FBI, who allege that he fired them improperly after they spoke out. The Texas Supreme Court said in November that Paxton would not have to sit for a deposition in the lawsuit - another win for the attorney general, who has managed to avoid testifying about the corruption allegations through the civil lawsuit, his impeachment trial and the federal investigation. Paxton last year said he would no longer contest the facts of the case in order to end what he called \"wasteful litigation\" and a distraction for his office.\n\nThe whistleblowers are now waiting on a Travis County district judge to rule on a settlement.\n\n\"DOJ clearly let political cowardice impact its decision. The whistleblowers - all strong conservatives - did the right thing and continue to stand by their allegations of Paxton's criminal conduct,\" TJ Turner and Tom Nesbitt, attorneys for some of the whistleblowers, told the AP in a statement.\n\nOn Thursday, Paxton referenced the end of the federal investigation to take a swing at Cornyn, who has been critical of Paxton's legal controversies and steadfast in his bid for reelection.\n\n\"This former TX Supreme Court Justice and TX Attorney General ignored the rule of law, the Constitution, and innocent until proven guilty while standing with the corrupt Biden DOJ cheering on the bogus witch hunts against both me and President Trump,\" Paxton posted on social media in reference to Cornyn, adding, \"Care to comment now, John?\"\n\nIn response to an attempt by Paxton to tag Cornyn as insufficiently conservative and supportive of Trump, Cornyn had said , \"Hard to run from prison, Ken.\"\n\nThe likely matchup could prove to be Cornyn's toughest primary battle yet as Texas Republican primary voters lurch toward the right and his popularity among GOP voters drops from 2020 highs.\n\nAmong Republican-identifying voters, according to polling by the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin, Cornyn has a 49% approval rating, compared to Paxton's 62% approval rating. Texas' other senator, Ted Cruz, meanwhile, has an approval rating of 78% among Republicans.\n\nStill, Cornyn, who has trounced past challengers, is a prodigious fundraiser and wields widespread influence as a senior senator. He has also worked to smooth over his relationship with the hard-right in Texas and tout his work in the Senate in support of Trump.\n\nRead More\n\nOn Thursday, Cornyn declined to comment on Paxton or the Justice Department decision not to prosecute, saying he was \"not going to have any comments about that until he's an announced candidate. Then I'll have a lot to say.\"\n\nIn response to a request for comment, Cornyn's campaign, meanwhile, sent an endorsement from the National Border Patrol Council that was announced Thursday.\n\nCruz declined to comment.\n\n\"Fundamentally, he's a fighter, and he's also a risk-taker,\" said Matt Mackowiak, a Republican strategist and the former Travis County GOP chair, describing Paxton's position heading into a potential campaign with the federal investigation behind him. \"What I think this whole episode taught him is, trust your instincts and never quit. The psychology of that has to be very powerful for him in approaching this race.\"\n\nKatharine Wilson of The Texas Tribune and Vianna Davila with ProPublica contributed reporting.\n\nFiled under -\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

Among other things, group members said they would push bills to reduce corporate taxes, weaken unions, privatize schooling and influence the ideological debate on college campuses.\n\n\"We can pretty much do whatever we want to right now,\" said Rep. Jim DeCesare, a Republican state legislator in Kentucky, where the party gained the state House for the first time in nearly a century.\n\nDeCesare, who had been minority whip, described plans for \"a pretty intense agenda\" including a so-called right-to-work law allowing employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements to opt out of joining labor unions. Another, he said, would be repealing rules that require government contractors to pay employees more than the minimum wage. Neighboring states competing for new businesses, he said, had already gutted such regulations.\n\n\"We've got some catching up to do, but we plan to make up a lot of ground in a very short time,\" DeCesare said. \"This is our time to shine.\"\n\nAnother ALEC official, Michael Bowman, told the group that outside advocates, not lawmakers, held the key to success. \"Legislators are not the trailblazers of developing policies,\" Bowman said. \"They're actually the retail consumers.\"\n\nALEC, founded in 1973, acts as a clearinghouse for business-friendly model bills. Among its major donors are the billionaires Charles and David Koch. Members include corporations and their lobbyists, along with hundreds of legislators who work together to craft free-market legislation offered in many states at once. The group has successfully advanced bills imposing voter ID rules and loosening labor and environmental regulations.\n\nBecause the group generally allies with Republicans, November's results provide the best chance yet to turn its ideas into law. In Iowa, for example, the party regained dominance in the state Senate, winning a trifecta of both chambers and the governorship for the first time in almost two decades. Republicans expanded their lead in the Pennsylvania Senate to a two-thirds majority, large enough to threaten to override vetoes by Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat. Even in North Carolina, where Democrat Roy Cooper eked out a win for governor, Republicans retained their veto-proof majorities in the legislature, where lawmakers have pushed through a series of controversial laws, including one that rolled back protections for transgender people using public bathrooms. The number of states where Republicans control both the legislature and the governor's office will rise from 23 to 25. The total number of Republican legislators nationwide also has grown.\n\n'America Comes First' can't seem to decide if it's a PAC or a super PAC, but in either case its federal filings remain problematic. Read the story.\n\nAs President-elect Donald Trump picks his top officials, we're laying out the best accountability reporting on each. Read the story.\n\nThe post-election lunch meeting, held Nov. 17 at the organization's Arlington, Virginia, headquarters, included members of ALEC and other conservative groups, with some calling into a private conference line. Ashley Varner, a strategic communications director at ALEC, opened the session by pointing out that with the power shift in Washington, opportunities at the state level were flying under the radar. \"There's a sea of red,\" Varner said, adding that hundreds of incumbents from both parties had been ousted. \"What are we going to do with these new legislatures?'\n\nInez Feltscher, director of ALEC's education task force, outlined plans to advocate for legislation giving money to parents who take their children out of public schools - stipends they could use for private schooling or other educational expenses. Critics of these \"education savings accounts\" say they're a drain on public-school funding, while proponents argue they give parents a chance to pick the best situation for their kids.\n\nFeltscher acknowledged another motivation: \"To break the monopoly on one of the most important institutions in America.\" Conservatives have long been at odds with teachers unions over the structure and curriculum of public schools. \"We've let the left take over almost all of the cultural institutions of this country,\" she said.\n\nAnother ALEC target, Feltscher said, would be the state of \"free debate on American universities,\" which conservatives say are largely dominated by left-leaning faculty, courses and speakers. For example, she said, lawmakers could use a range of tactics to press administrators to include multiple ideologies during on-campus public policy talks, such as demanding an annual count of campus events that included more than one perspective. Simply requiring measurement and public reporting would apply pressure, she said, but legislators could also take it to \"the nuclear level\" and threaten to pull funding from schools that are perceived to be limiting discourse.\n\n\"There's going to be a lot more aggression on this,\" Feltscher said.\n\nALEC executives also forecasted tax cuts and other conservative fiscal reforms in New Hampshire, Missouri, Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina and West Virginia. Jonathan Williams, vice president of ALEC's Center for State Fiscal Reform, reminded the group that one of the only Republican majorities lost in November came in Nevada, where taxes had been raised.\n\nWilliams acknowledged the presidential campaign was \"a little light on policy details\" but said he was optimistic the Trump administration would follow the states' lead. \"The stars have aligned,\" Williams said.\n\nBowman, who is ALEC's vice president of policy, said the change in Washington might benefit ALEC's fight to preserve anonymity for donors to politically active nonprofit groups at the state level. With Trump in office, Democrats might now start to see the value of this privacy. \"Democrats who are afraid of the Republican administration are beginning to say 'Maybe we need to embrace some First Amendment rights,'\" Bowman said.\n\nContacted for comment, Varner, the ALEC communications director, said the organization's optimism is based not on expanded Republican control, but rather voter discontent with the status quo, regardless of party. DeCesare, the Kentucky lawmaker, responded with an email stating he didn't attend the meeting. Varner, however, confirmed that DeCesare had called into the meeting on the conference line.\n\nThis week, some of the promises DeCesare made during the ALEC meeting began to materialize , with a Kentucky House committee approving a \"right to work\" bill and another to roll back the prevailing wage rule.\n\nStephen Voss, a University of Kentucky political scientist, said the Republican resurgence will have a major impact on important policies across the country. He expects most of the changes to percolate out of formerly split states where the GOP has now taken total control - like Kentucky - rather than in states with longstanding Republican majorities.\n\n\"Those are the states where there's just a lot of pent-up demand, a lot of unhappiness with the status quo,\" he said. \"The people who have been waiting to make those changes can now implement them.\"\n\nVoss said that shifts in political control after years of stability often produce a period of dramatic policy innovation.\n\n\"And what we know about public policy is it spreads,\" Voss said. \"Other states will pick up their innovations, good or bad.\"\n\nRobert Faturechi\n\nI am a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter at ProPublica.\n\nGet our investigations delivered to your inbox with the Big Story newsletter.\n\nCreative Commons License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)\n\nThank you for your interest in republishing this story.

      "text": "In Private Speech, J.D. Vance Said the \"Devil Is Real\" and Praised Alex Jones as a Truth-Teller\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nSen. J.D. Vance, whom Donald Trump named as his vice presidential running mate Monday, told a group of influential young conservatives in a closed-door speech in 2021 that they should stand up for \"nonconventional people\" who speak truth, such as Infowars founder Alex Jones.\n\n\"If you listen to Rachel Maddow every night, the basic worldview that you have is that MAGA grandmas who have family dinners on Sunday and bake apple pies for their family are about to start a violent insurrection against this country,\" Vance said. \"But if you listen to Alex Jones every day, you would believe that a transnational financial elite controls things in our country, that they hate our society, and oh, by the way, a lot of them are probably sex perverts too.\"\n\nVance went on, \"Sorry, ladies and gentlemen, that's actually a hell of a lot more true than Rachel Maddow's view of society.\"\n\nHe said that every person in attendance for his speech believed \"something that's a little crazy.\" In his case, he said, \"I believe the devil is real and that he works terrible things in our society. That's a crazy conspiracy theory to a lot of very well-educated people in this country right now.\"\n\nVance made these remarks at a September 2021 gathering of the Teneo Network, an invitation-only group of young conservatives that counts elected officials, pro athletes, financial executives and media figures among its members. Vance joined Teneo six years ago. ProPublica and Documented obtained a video recording of his 30-minute speech and question-and-answer session, which has not been previously reported.\n\nVance's remarks at the conference - which you can read a transcript of or watch in full below - give a rare unvarnished look at his thinking and illustrate how aligned he is with various factions within the conservative and MAGA movements. \"I'll throw out the standard campaign speech,\" he began his Teneo talk. \"[I'll] actually just try to level with you guys about what I do see is the big - a few big problems that are in our country right now.\"\n\nWatch J.D. Vance's Speech at a Private Teneo Network Event\n\nAccording to tax records , the Teneo Network's chairman is Leonard Leo, the legal activist who built a pipeline of lawyers who interpret the Constitution based on the \"original intent\" of the framers or the meaning of the words in the text when they were written. One of the most influential conservatives of the past three decades, Leo helped confirm all six conservative justices currently serving on the U.S. Supreme Court. Leo-aligned judges have pushed to restrict abortion rights and rein in the government's power to regulate corporations.\n\nLeo has said he views the Teneo Network as a way to extend his influence beyond the judiciary to industries including finance, media, government and Silicon Valley . The network identifies and cultivates conservative leaders in \"other areas of American culture and American life where things are really messed up right now,\" as Leo put it in a Teneo video.\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nThanks for signing up.

Support independent journalism by donating to ProPublica.\n\nAccording to internal Teneo documents, Vance joined Teneo in 2018 , several years before he ran for Senate in his home state of Ohio. His book, \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" had already become a bestseller, and Vance was a commentator for CNN while running his own nonprofit and investment fund backing startup companies outside of Silicon Valley.\n\n\"JD Vance has been part of the organization for at least five years and his appearance at the 2021 Teneo Retreat was well received by many young professional leaders in attendance,\" Leo said. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBy the time Vance spoke at Teneo's 2021 conference, he had joined the race to fill outgoing Sen. Rob Portman's seat. Despite his past criticisms of Trump, which included calling the former president an \"idiot\" and comparing him to Adolf Hitler, Vance won Trump's endorsement in 2022 and cruised to a comfortable victory.\n\nVance's connection to Teneo could form a bridge between different factions of the Republican Party that seem to be at odds. Previous news stories have reported that Trump and Leo, who advised the former president on judicial nominees during his administration, are no longer as close as they once were . Russ Vought, a Trump ally, publicly denigrated the Federalist Society , the legal networking group Leo and others built into a juggernaut.\n\nAdding Vance to the ticket bolsters the connections between Leo's network and the Trump 2024 campaign. It also strengthens ties between Trump's reelection bid and the Project 2025 blueprint, which outlines plans for a second Trump administration, including firing thousands of career civil servants, shuttering the Department of Education and replacing ambitious goals to combat climate change with ramped-up fossil fuel production. In a recent TV interview, Vance said the document contained \"some good ideas\" but claimed that \"most Americans couldn't care less about Project 2025\" and that the Trump campaign wasn't affiliated with it.\n\nIn his Teneo remarks, he bemoaned that decades ago major corporate CEOs reliably donated money to Republicans but now they give heavily to Democrats. He lamented that conservatives had \"very few oligarchs on our side,\" had \"lost every institution in American society\" and needed to make corporations \"taking the side of the left in the culture wars feel real economic pain.\"\n\n\"So we've not just lost the academy,\" meaning universities, \"which we've lost for a long time; we haven't just lost the media, which has been on the side of the left for a long time; we now find ourselves in a situation where our biggest multinational corporations are active participants in the culture war on the other side,\" he said. \"It's really been a few of us over the past few years who have recognized that the big corporations have really turned against conservatives in a very big and powerful way.\"\n\nHe argued that conservatives needed to take action against corporations that, say, defended abortion rights or punished employees who spoke out against abortion access. \"If we're unwilling to make companies that are taking the side of the left in the culture wars feel real economic pain, then we're not serious about winning the culture war,\" he said.\n\nHe said that Americans were \"terrified to tell the truth\" and \"point out the obvious,\" including that \"there are real biological, cultural, religious, spiritual distinctions between men and women.\" He added, \"I think that's what the whole transgender thing is about, is like fundamentally denying basic reality.\"\n\nShortly before he spoke at the Teneo conference, Vance drew criticism when he tweeted that \"Alex Jones is a far more reputable source of information than Rachel Maddow.\" Jones, founder of the online show Infowars, gained a following with his promotion of conspiracy theories about the Sept. 11 terrorist attack. More recently, judges in several states ordered him to pay $1.5 billion to the families of the victims of the Sandy Hook school shooting, which Jones had called a hoax.\n\nRead More\n\nVance told Teneo members that he was \"just trolling\" with his defense of Jones, but added \"that doesn't mean what I said is in any way untrue.\"\n\n\"Look, I think there's a not-terrible chance that one of you is going to be sharing cellblock 12A in Premier Harris' prison detention camp in a few years,\" he explained, seemingly referring to Vice President Kamala Harris. \"If we're going to all end up in that place, we might as well have a little fun while we get there. It's OK to troll when you make and speak fundamental truths. But, look, I do think what I said was correct.\"\n\nIf the conservative movement was going to survive, he continued, its members needed to \"speak for truth.\" He mentioned donors in Ohio who had asked him if he would condemn inflammatory remarks made by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\n\"And I say, 'Why? Why do you want me to denounce this person?'\" Vance said. \"'Well, she believes these crazy things.' Who cares?\"\n\nHe went on, \"Believing crazy things is not the mark of whether somebody should be rejected. Believing important truths should be the mark of whether we accept somebody, and if they believe some crazy things on the side, that's fine. We need to be OK with nonconventional people.\"\n\nUpdate, July 16, 2024: This story has been updated to include comment from Leonard Leo.\n\nDo you have any information about J.D.

      "text": "How a Secretive Billionaire Handed His Fortune to the Architect of the Right-Wing Takeover of the Courts\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThis story was co-published with The Lever .\n\nAn elderly, ultra-secretive Chicago businessman has given the largest known donation to a political advocacy group in U.S. history - worth $1.6 billion - and the recipient is one of the prime architects of conservatives' efforts to reshape the American judicial system, including the Supreme Court.\n\nThrough a series of opaque transactions over the past two years, Barre Seid, a 90-year-old manufacturing magnate, gave the massive sum to a nonprofit run by Leonard Leo, who co-chairs the conservative legal group the Federalist Society.\n\nThe donation was first reported by The New York Times on Monday. The Lever and ProPublica confirmed the information from documents received independently by the news organizations.\n\nOur reporting sheds additional light on how the two men, one a judicial kingmaker and the other a mysterious but prolific donor to conservative causes, came together to create a political war chest that will likely supercharge efforts to further shift American politics to the right.\n\nAs President Donald Trump's adviser on judicial nominations, Leo helped build the Supreme Court's conservative supermajority, which recently eliminated Constitutional protections for abortion rights and has made a series of sweeping pro-business decisions. Leo, a conservative Catholic, has both helped select judges to nominate to the Supreme Court and directed multimillion dollar media campaigns to confirm them.\n\nLeo derives immense political power through his ability to raise huge sums of money and distribute those funds throughout the conservative movement to influence elections, judicial appointments and policy battles. Yet the biggest funders of Leo's operation have long been a mystery.\n\nSeid, who led the surge protector and data-center equipment maker Tripp Lite for more than half a century, has been almost unknown outside a small circle of political and cultural recipients. The gift immediately vaults him into the ranks of major funders like the Koch brothers and George Soros.\n\nIn practical terms, there are few limitations on how Leo's new group, the Marble Freedom Trust, can spend the enormous donation. The structure of the donation allowed Seid to avoid as much as $400 million in taxes. Thus, he maximized the amount of money at Leo's disposal.\n\nNow, Leo, 56, is positioned to finance his already sprawling network with one of the largest pools of political capital in American history. Seid has left his legacy to Leo.\n\n\"To my knowledge, it is entirely without precedent for a political operative to be given control of such an astonishing amount of money,\" said Brendan Fischer, a campaign finance lawyer at the nonpartisan watchdog group Documented. \"Leonard Leo is already incredibly powerful, and now he is going to have over a billion dollars at his disposal to continue upending our country's institutions.\"\n\nIn a statement to the Times, Leo said it was \"high time for the conservative movement to be among the ranks of George Soros, Hansjörg Wyss, Arabella Advisors and other left-wing philanthropists, going toe-to-toe in the fight to defend our constitution and its ideals.\" Leo and representatives for Seid did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Marble Freedom Trust is a so-called dark money group that is not required to publicly disclose its donors. It has wide latitude to spend directly on elections as well as on ideological projects such as funding issue-advocacy groups, think tanks, universities, religious institutions and organizing efforts.\n\nThe creators of the Marble Freedom Trust shrouded their project in secrecy for more than two years.\n\nThe group's name does not appear in any public database of business, tax or securities records. The Marble Freedom Trust is organized for legal purposes as a trust, rather than as a corporation. That means it did not have to publicly disclose basic details like its name, directors and address.\n\nThe trust was formed in Utah. Its address is a house in North Salt Lake owned by Tyler Green , a lawyer who clerked for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Green is listed in the trust's tax return as an administrative trustee. The donation does not appear to violate any laws.\n\nSeid's $1.6 billion donation is a landmark in the era of deregulated political spending ushered in by the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision. That case, along with subsequent changes and weak federal oversight, empowered a tiny group of the super rich in both parties to fund groups that can spend unlimited sums to support candidates and political causes. In the last decade, donations in the millions and sometimes tens of millions of dollars have become common.\n\nIndividuals could give unlimited amounts of money to nonprofit groups prior to Citizens United, but the decision allowed those nonprofits to more directly influence elections. A handful of billionaires such as the Koch family and Soros have spent billions to achieve epochal political influence by bankrolling networks of nonprofits.\n\nEven in this money-drenched world, Seid's $1.6 billion gift exceeds all publicly known one-time donations to a politically oriented group.\n\nOne day in November 2015, the employees of Tripp Lite, a manufacturer of power strips and other electrical equipment, gathered for a celebration at the company's headquarters on the South Side of Chicago. Cupcakes frosted in blue and white spelled out the numbers \"56.\" An easel held up a sign hailing Tripp Lite's longtime leader: \"Congratulations Barre!\"\n\nA small, balding man with a white goatee and a ruddy complexion took the microphone. Barre Seid was known as someone who preferred to keep a low profile, but on the 56th anniversary of his leadership of Tripp Lite, he couldn't resist the chance to address his employees. Later, as he bit into a cupcake, Seid posed for a company photographer, who later uploaded the photo to the company's Facebook page.\n\nEven this semipublic glimpse of Seid was rare.\n\nFor several decades, a select group of political activists, academics and fundraisers was ushered to Tripp Lite headquarters to pitch Seid at his office. Despite his status as one of the country's most prolific funders of conservative causes, and despite his decades as the president and sole owner of one of the country's most successful electronics makers, Seid has spent most of his 90 years painstakingly guarding his privacy.\n\nThere are no art galleries, opera companies, or theaters or university buildings emblazoned with his name in his hometown of Chicago. There's even some confusion over how to pronounce his last name. (People who've dealt with him say it's \"side.\")\n\nThe Lever and ProPublica pieced together the details of his life and his motivations for his extensive donations through interviews, court records and other documents obtained through public-records requests.\n\nOne of the only photos of Seid that The Lever and ProPublica could find shows him as a 14-year-old walking in a small group across a college campus. Born in 1932 to Russian Jewish immigrants, Seid grew up on the South Side of Chicago, the oldest of two brothers, according to Census records. A precocious child, he was chosen for a special bachelor's degree program at the University of Chicago, not far from his childhood home.\n\nSeid attended the University of Chicago in the early years of the \"Chicago school,\" a group of professors and researchers who would reimagine the field of economics, assailing massive government interventions in the economy and emphasizing the importance of human liberty and free markets. After college, Seid served two years in the Army and eventually returned home to Chicago, according to testimony given decades later in a court case. He took a job as an assistant to an investor and businessman named Graham Trippe, whose company made headlights and would produce the rotating warning lights used by police cars, tow trucks and other emergency response vehicles.\n\nBy the mid-1960s, Seid had taken over as Trippe Manufacturing's president. In the decades to come, the company, now called Tripp Lite, became a pick-and-shovel business of the digital gold rush. The company sells the power strips that supply electricity to computers and the server racks, cooling equipment and network switches that make data centers run. Business surged with the shift to cloud computing and the proliferation of vast data centers.\n\nThat boom vaulted him from the ranks of merely rich to the superrich. Seid was making around $30 million per year by the mid-1990s, tax records obtained by ProPublica show . His annual income, the vast majority of which came from Tripp Lite's profits, took off in the mid-2000s and steadily rose, hitting around $157 million in 2018. Tripp Lite, which was 100% owned by Seid, contributed $136 million to his total income that year.\n\nEven as Seid built a billion-plus dollar business, he drew scant public attention; Forbes never put him on its list of the wealthiest Americans, and business and political press rarely mentioned him.\n\nYet he was becoming a major donor. He gave at least $775 million in charitable donations between 1996 and 2018, a period in which he reported $1.7 billion in income, according to his tax records. Seid parceled out a small portion of those donations to Chicago-area universities, religious organizations, medical research and dozens of civic-focused groups.\n\nWhile Seid has never spoken to the press about his ideology, evidence of his worldview has emerged here and there. His family foundation has supported the University of Chicago's Becker Friedman Institute for Economics, named after two of the Chicago school's intellectual leaders, Gary Becker and Milton Friedman. He has also donated to the Heartland Institute, a Chicago-based nonprofit that has a history of using inflammatory rhetoric and misleading tactics to undermine climate science.\n\nSeid appeared to be the donor (listed as \"Barry Seid\") who gave $17 million to fund the distribution during the 2008 presidential campaign of millions of copies of a DVD of the film \"Obsession: Radical Islam's War With the West.\" The DVDs, which were sent specifically to households in presidential election battleground states, were criticized as virulently anti-Muslim.\n\nSeid's personality can be glimpsed in exchanges with George Mason University officials from the late 2000s to mid-2010s that came out in response to a public-records request by the activist group UnKoch My Campus. In the emails , Seid comes across as an intellectually probing figure, asking the dean of the law school to respond to news stories about the value of a law-school degree or the workings of higher education's accreditation system. Seid drily addressed several administrators for the university, whose law school and economics department are known for their alignment with conservative, free-market principles, as \"Fellow Members of the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy.\"\n\nSeid appears to have continually sought new vehicles for dispensing his money and maintaining as much anonymity as possible. The GMU emails also show a redacted donor - who activists believed to be Seid based on other unredacted materials - routing donations to the school through DonorsTrust or the Donors Capital Fund, two donor-advised funds that provide an additional level of anonymity.\n\nWhile the roots of Seid and Leo's professional relationship aren't clear, the two worked together at a small foundation Seid formed in 2009 called the Chicago Freedom Trust, a charity that gave out small grants to nonpolitical groups. Leo later joined the foundation's board.\n\nThe GMU emails provide an inkling of the relationship between the two men. In early 2016, Seid emailed the dean of GMU's law school and the head of a prominent American Jewish organization to urge them to work together. The dean, Henry Butler, forwarded Seid's message to Leo seeking to better understand Seid's intentions.\n\n\"Do you have any insight?\" Butler wrote.\n\n\"I do not, but will find out,\" Leo replied.\n\nBillionaires tend to craft intricate estate plans to pass the family business to the next generation, fortified from taxation and protective of their vision. The apparently childless Seid didn't have that option, but starting in April 2020, he set in motion a plan to make sure his fortune would go toward his favored causes.\n\nThat month, the Marble Freedom Trust was created, and Seid subsequently transferred his 100% ownership stake in Tripp Lite to the trust, according to the documents reviewed by The Lever and ProPublica.\n\nIn February 2021, Tripp Lite filed its annual reports with the state of Illinois as it had done for decades. But this time, Seid's typewritten name had been crossed out as an officer of the company. Added as an officer, written in by hand, was Leonard Leo.\n\nA Tripp Lite subsidiary in Nova Scotia, Canada, similarly removed Seid as a director and added Leo as a director in March 2021, according to disclosure filings .\n\nThen, later that same month, Eaton Corporation, a large publicly traded company, acquired Tripp Lite for $1.65 billion.\n\nThe transactions appear to have been carefully sequenced to reap massive tax savings. Selling a company that has grown in value after decades of ownership is treated the same way for tax purposes as a person selling a share of stock. If the property has grown in value, capital gains taxes are due when it is sold.\n\nBut Seid transferred Tripp Lite to the Marble Freedom Trust, a nonprofit that is exempt from income tax, before the electronics company was sold. As a result, lawyers say, Seid avoided up to $400 million in state and federal income tax, preserving those funds for Leo's operation.\n\n\"If the person who had owned the stock had sold the stock himself, he would've been taxed on the appreciation in the stock,\" said Ellen Aprill, a tax law professor at Loyola Marymount University. \"Whereas if you give it to the 501(c)(4), there's no charitable deduction for giving the money, but you avoid the tax on all of that appreciation.\"\n\nPolitical advocacy nonprofits like the Marble Freedom Trust are formally called 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations, after the section of the tax code. Informally, they are known as dark-money groups because donors can remain secret, in contrast to the public disclosures required of gifts to political campaigns or super PACs. While they can spend money directly advocating for or against candidates in political campaigns, such spending cannot be their primary purpose.\n\nIn giving to such a dark money group, Seid also avoided another federal levy, the gift tax, thanks to a change signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2015.\n\nThere's a reason why giving money specifically to a trust might have been attractive for an older and ideological donor such as Seid. The founding documents that lay out how the trust will spend money can be harder to change than the governing documents of a corporation, according to Lloyd Hitoshi Mayer, a professor at Notre Dame Law School.\n\nMayer added that while corporations usually have at least three directors, trusts can have just a single trustee in charge of the organization's activities.\n\nLeo is the trustee and chairman of the Marble Freedom Trust. In other words, Leo is now in charge of the massive sum of money.\n\nFor decades, Leo had served as a top executive at the Federalist Society, helping lead the influential Washington-based conservative lawyers group that serves as a launching pad for careers on the right.\n\nBut in early 2020, Leo made an announcement that suggested he was taking his successful model for reshaping the courts to remake American politics at every level: local, state and federal. In an interview with Axios , Leo said he was stepping away from his day-to-day role with the Federalist Society to take a more active role steering a network of conservative dark money groups.\n\nThe plan was to expand the network's scope to \"funnel tens of millions of dollars into conservative fights around the country,\" according to Axios. What Leo did not mention in the interview was the imminent creation of the Marble Freedom Trust, his biggest-ever war chest.\n\nLeo's long career as both a legal activist and a prodigious fundraiser for conservative causes shows a steady march toward becoming a central figure in the Republican Party's successful strategy to fill as many judicial vacancies as possible with young, conservative judges skeptical of the federal government's power. He served as an adviser to Trump's 2016 campaign, helping the candidate take a step no other major presidential candidate had ever taken: releasing a list of names he would draw on to nominate to the Supreme Court.\n\nComing at a moment when conservatives were wary of Trump's past leanings, the move bolstered his support among social conservatives. Leo stayed on as a judicial adviser during Trump's four years in office. During that time, Leo helped the president appoint and confirm more than 200 nominees to the federal bench, most famously Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nLeo's efforts to reshape the country's judicial system began long before Trump's political ascent. In 1991, he joined the Federalist Society, which was then in its early years and only beginning to build a pipeline for conservative jurists.\n\nIn the view of Leo and his allies, the U.S. legal system had drifted dangerously far from its roots, establishing privileged classes and doctrines that were not enumerated in the Constitution and would be unrecognizable to the Founders. Those same courts had also empowered a class of unelected bureaucrats dubbed the \"administrative state\" to impose needless regulations and to endow the federal government with too much power. Like his close friend Justice Antonin Scalia, Leo argued for an originalist view of the Constitution - namely, that the country's founding document should be interpreted strictly based on how its 18th century authors understood its words at the time.\n\nIn 2005, Leo and his allies formed a dark money network to rally support for George W. Bush's Supreme Court nominees, John Roberts and Samuel Alito. But if Leo wanted to turn back the tide of what he saw as unchecked judicial activism, he needed to build something bigger, more lasting.\n\nLeo set out to create a network of interlocking groups that could each play a part in returning the country to what he saw as its roots, whether by training future generations of Scalias, funding scholarship that made the case for originalism or bankrolling efforts to install conservative judges on the bench.\n\nBetween 2005 and mid-2021, Leo and his associates raised at least $460 million (not including the Marble Freedom Trust's funds).\n\nAccording to tax records, Leo's network has funneled those hundreds of millions into ad campaigns and right-leaning groups. The Judicial Crisis Network - which is now called the Concord Fund and is headed by a former clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas and Leo associate named Carrie Severino - has spent tens of millions airing ads during Supreme Court confirmation fights.\n\nThe group's fundraising took off in 2016, when it led a campaign to block Obama Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland's confirmation. That year, Leo's network received a $28 million infusion from a single anonymous donor . Leo and his network long refused to say who is paying for their advocacy campaigns.\n\nLeo's network has worked closely with Senate Republicans and has showered them with cash as well, recently donating $9 million to a dark money group affiliated with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\n\nWhile Leo is best known for his influence on the Supreme Court, he and his network have also worked to shift the balance of power throughout the judiciary - in federal district and appellate courts, and state supreme courts, too.\n\nAt the state level, the network funds groups supporting conservative gubernatorial and legislative candidates. Leo's nonprofits and their subsidiaries have recently pushed states to tighten voting laws, opposed the teaching of critical race theory in schools and financed organizations pressing states to remove millions of Americans from the Medicaid rolls.\n\nRead More\n\nBut now, with Seid's largesse, Leo has nearly four times the amount he raised over 16 years at his disposal and ambitions to match.\n\n\"I have a very simple rule, which is, I'm engaged in the battle of ideas, and I care very deeply about our Constitution and the role of courts in our society,\" Leo told The Washington Post in 2019 when asked about his donors. \"And I don't waste my time on stories that involve money and politics because what I care about is ideas.\"\n\nHelp Us Report on Taxes and the Ultrawealthy\n\nDo you have expertise in tax law, accounting or wealth management?

      "text": "The Man Behind Project 2025's Most Radical Plans\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nIn January 2023, a group of about 15 people gathered for three days at the Heritage Foundation, the conservative Washington think tank a few blocks from the Capitol. Their aim was ambitious and farsighted: to start building the next Republican administration, two years before a Republican president might again take office.\n\nThe group's leaders originally cast the initiative as candidate-agnostic, intended to assist the 2024 Republican nominee, whoever that might be. But there was no real doubt who the envisioned beneficiary was. The team included several former members of the Trump administration, and the whole effort was geared to address a perceived shortcoming of that White House: its failure to fill enough key government positions with Trump loyalists. So few had expected Trump to win in 2016 that hiring had been left mostly to GOP veterans, who brought in establishment figures and never managed to fill some slots at all, leaving the president exposed to the bureaucratic resistance that his acolytes believe undermined him at every step: the dreaded \"deep state.\"\n\nThey were determined not to let this happen again. This time, Trump would take office with a fully staffed, carefully selected administration ready to roll. Thus the name of this new effort at Heritage, Project 2025. It would consist of four \"pillars\": an 887-page policy plan , a database of conservatives willing to serve in the administration, training seminars for potential new appointees on the functions of government and a battle plan for each agency.\n\nIn recent months, Project 2025 has gotten attention for some of the more radical proposals in its policy plan - such as reinstating more stringent rules for the use of the abortion pill mifepristone and abolishing some federal agencies. On the campaign trail, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris made the project the centerpiece of their case against a Trump restoration. Their attacks were so effective that Trump has publicly disavowed the effort (while selecting a running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, who is closely allied with Heritage).\n\nThis week, as Project 2025 faced denunciations from the Trump campaign, the project's director, Paul Dans, stepped down from his role. Trump's campaign co-managers, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, said in a statement that \"reports of Project 2025's demise would be greatly welcomed, and should serve as notice to anyone or any group trying to misrepresent their influence with President Trump and his campaign - it will not end well for you.\" For Dans, it was a sudden end - or at least a pause - in a remarkable ascent from obscurity.\n\nBut then again, his resignation was at least partly symbolic: The work of Project 2025 is largely done. Under Dans, the project has assembled a database of more than 10,000 names - job candidates vetted for loyalty to Trump's cause - who will be ready to deploy into federal agencies should he win the 2024 election. Project 2025 has delivered a toolkit, ready for use, to create a second Trump administration that would be decidedly more MAGA than the first.\n\nThe most important pillar of Project 2025 has always been about personnel, not policy. Or rather, the whole effort is animated by the Reagan-era maxim that personnel is policy, that power flows from having the right people in the right jobs. To that end, the plan's most pertinent proposal is reinstating Schedule F - a provision unveiled near the very end of Trump's term, then repealed by the Biden administration - which would shift as many as 50,000 career employees in policy-shaping positions into a new job category that would make them much easier to fire.\n\nThis was the mission that brought people together at Heritage for those three days, with the task of designing the personnel database that would populate the next administration, all under the supervision of Dans, a tall, broad-shouldered guy with a slow, jut-chinned way of speaking and traces of a Baltimore accent.\n\nNot long ago, Dans, 55, would have seemed an unlikely person for the role. The son of a liberal Johns Hopkins University professor, Dans was a New York lawyer who before Trump's election had never served in government. For years following that election, he had tried and failed to find a place in the administration, seemingly in spite of a celebrity connection: His wife was a fitness coach for Karlie Kloss, the supermodel sister-in-law of Jared Kushner. Finally, in 2019, Dans got in the door, at the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nSome four years later, here he was, hoping to build the next administration. Dans envisioned the personnel database that he wanted to create as a \"conservative LinkedIn.\" To help explain it, he displayed sketches he had made. They depicted the online file for a sample applicant - \"Betsy Ross.\" One page would show her occupation, which of the conservative organizations supporting Project 2025 had suggested her and which agencies she was being considered for. Another would show the findings of an internal review of her application, her progress on the training sessions (one of which Dans called \"Deep State 101\") and any \"red flags.\" Yet another would show additional vetting: a \"webcrawl\" report; her performance on the Project 2025 questionnaire, which would ask detailed questions about ideological and policy beliefs; and more. The database would allow administration officials to search for candidates of a certain profile to fit a certain role.\n\nThis was what Dans wanted the Heritage staffers gathered in the room and the tech engineers they'd contracted from Oracle to build: the engine of Trump 2.0. It would be a personnel machine not only far beyond what the first Trump administration had at its disposal, but beyond what any other administration had enjoyed, either. According to one person in attendance, the database would take several months to build and would cost upward of $2 million. It would reach outside the usual channels to draw in MAGA believers from across the country. And Dans was at the helm. \"There was no one who had a better idea of it than he did,\" the person in attendance told me. \"He was driving the whole thing.\"\n\nAs the database development progressed in the months that followed, Dans stressed a detail that made it even more far-reaching. He did not want the positions being filled to be limited to the 4,000 or so slots that are reserved for political appointments. He also wanted it to suggest people for roles that are currently assigned to career employees, in keeping with the plans for Schedule F.\n\nPropelling the project has been a worldview that can be easily overlooked amid Trump's talk about restoring the halcyon days of his first term. The people preparing for his return to the White House emphatically do not view his first term as a success. Rather, they view it as a missed opportunity to implement the MAGA vision. For Dans, Trump's first term was an object lesson in how difficult it could be to reach Trump's goals without a captive bureaucracy.\n\nThe former president's supporters are determined that a second Trump administration would be much more organized than the first, stocked with foot soldiers who are both loyal and capable of moving policy forward. Dans declined to be interviewed for this article or to respond on the record to a detailed list of questions, but he has been laying out his thinking in interviews with conservative media outlets. \"We're going to get this done right on the next go-round,\" he told Jenny Beth Martin, a co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, on her podcast last winter. And in essence, that will mean cleaning house, he said. \"If a person can't get in and fire people right away, what good is political management?\"\n\nPaul Dans was raised, in the 1970s and '80s, in a family that embodied liberal idealism. Peter Dans was a professor of medicine who had enlisted in the Public Health Service; started an STD clinic and a migrant health clinic while on faculty at the University of Colorado; and served in the office of Sen. Gaylord Nelson, the Wisconsin Democrat who founded Earth Day. Paul's mom, Colette Lizotte, was a French teacher who had previously worked as a chemist at the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThe family lived in a hilly, verdant stretch north of Baltimore. Paul and his twin brother, Tom, hung out with the other smart kids at Dulaney High School; they played sports and were on the debate team. \"Both were very bright kids, very well behaved,\" recalled Phil Sporer, who attended school with them from early on. \"The Dans boys were everybody's perfect child.\"\n\nThe first hints of Dans' political orientation emerged in college. He went to MIT, where he majored in economics, joined a frat, played on the lacrosse team and, as classmate Juan Latasa told me, stood apart from the \"political correctness\" that was rising at elite campuses around 1990. \"It wasn't always easy for such students. It was a very liberal place,\" Latasa said. \"It was tough.\"\n\nDans stayed on at MIT to get his master's in city planning. His thesis on the redevelopment of industrial parks, like the Brooklyn Navy Yard, showed him still wrestling with competing impulses. There was Reagan-style optimism: \"The myriad crises which America must grapple with in coming years pale in magnitude to the nation's gifted legacy.\" But there was also a hint of resigned declinism, with Dans addressing an \"age of diminished expectations.\"\n\nAt the University of Virginia School of Law, which Dans attended next, his transformation became explicit: He joined the campus branch of the Federalist Society, the conservative network founded by law students at Yale and the University of Chicago in the 1980s, and he rose to become chapter president. \"I was always attracted with the Federalist Society message about how some daring students stood up at Yale Law School and challenged the hegemony there and really was trying to speak truth to power,\" he told hosts Saurabh Sharma and Nick Solheim last year on \"Moment of Truth,\" a podcast produced by American Moment, a conservative organization now aligned with Project 2025.\n\nStill, Dans left little mark on his law school classmates, perhaps partly because he took a year off to study in Paris. I reached out to a couple dozen of his peers, and an email from a lawyer in Dallas was representative: \"I wish I could help but I do not remember any details about Paul Dans.\"\n\nDans' fixation on the federal bureaucracy began at home. The idealism of the 1960s brought his parents to Washington, where they met while working at the National Institutes of Health. \"They had basically come up through the JFK, Kennedy-esque, 'Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country'\" era, he told Sharma and Solheim.\n\nDans didn't seriously consider following his parents into public service - law school debt precluded that option, he said - but he would ultimately become wrapped up in a debate that had first inspired them. They went to Washington during the federal government's great post-World War II expansion, when the ranks of career employees began swelling and when more job protections started accruing to them, sparking a decadeslong argument that has carried on to this day. To federal employee unions and other defenders of the bureaucracy, such protections were in the spirit of the Pendleton Act, the 1883 law that created the modern federal workforce, along with mechanisms for employment based on merit. But to many conservative critics, and some good-government liberals, the job protections that federal workers gained in the 1960s undermined the \"merit based\" nature of the civil service by making it difficult to remove ineffectual workers.\n\nAfter law school, Dans chose a different meritocracy, joining a wave of young attorneys in the New York corporate legal world in the late '90s. But Dans stood out. He was much more conservative than most of his colleagues. He prided himself on being one of very few in his Upper West Side building to get the New York Post. He admired Donald Trump for bringing a \"can-do spirit back ... building on the skyline again.\"\n\nSome colleagues kept their distance, but not Julio Ramos, a fellow junior associate at the law firm LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae. Dans kidded Ramos about his lefty politics and regaled him with talk of supply-side economics and Reagan. It was all very civil. \"Even though he was from the right,\" Ramos told me, \"he didn't have any hatred toward the left.\"\n\nDans left after three years to become an associate at another large firm, Debevoise & Plimpton, and after two years there eventually landed at a less prestigious firm, where his cases included a lawsuit between Yves Saint Laurent's beauty line and Costco over perfume labeling. By 2009, having not made partner anywhere, and two years into his marriage to Mary Helen Bowers, a former New York City Ballet dancer, Dans went into solo practice.\n\nDans has criticized the legal field for what he perceives to be anti-conservative discrimination. \"We are, as a profession, really getting snowed under right now,\" he said on the \"Moment of Truth\" podcast. \"Republicans and conservatives have not stood up in the face of, kind of, cancel culture, and [these] Marxist, Saul Alinsky attacks.\"\n\nEven the moment he has often framed as his biggest triumph affirmed Dans' alienation from liberal lawyers. In 2009, he was one of hundreds of attorneys hired to defend Chevron and its employees against a multibillion-dollar lawsuit for oil pollution in Ecuador. According to the journalist Michael Goldhaber, Dans was hired at $100 an hour - less than 5% of the top rate at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, which was leading Chevron's defense.\n\nAs Dans later told Goldhaber, he had an epiphany: While watching the documentary film \"Crude,\" an exposé of Chevron in Ecuador that was done in collaboration with the plaintiffs' lead lawyer on the case, Steven Donziger, Dans realized that the outtakes from the film should be subpoenaed, to see if the filmmaker captured any legal malfeasance by Donziger. Dans put the suggestion in a memo.\n\nAs it turned out, the subpoenaed outtakes did prove to be damning. Chevron sued Donziger in U.S. federal court, ultimately resulting in a ruling that the company did not have to pay the $9.5 billion judgment. Dans took full credit: \"I came up with a theory that we could get documentary film outtakes, basically caught them doing their nefarious acts on video,\" he told Martin on her podcast.\n\nAccording to other lawyers on the case, the story is more complicated: Although Dans wrote a memo suggesting the outtakes be targeted, others started the push for subpoenas - and came up with the necessary legal basis for seeking the crucial outtakes - independently of Dans raising the idea.\n\nWhen the Chevron case was over, Dans was back on his own, handling motley litigation, including a patent fight between two manufacturers of sheet-pile wall systems and a class action against Frito-Lay regarding its claims that some of its products were made with all-natural ingredients. The address for Dans' solo practice was a mail drop at the New York City Bar Association.\n\nToward the end of the aughts, as President Barack Obama's first term wore on, Dans' conservatism began to take on a new shape. He spent a lot of time online. \"I'm one of the people sitting at his kitchen counter, you know, on the bench there, on the stool kind of going, How can that be? That's crazy,\" he told Martin. \"You're clicking ... you know, refreshing the Drudge Report like 100 times a day.\"\n\nOne thing he clicked on was Trump's conspiracist claims about Obama's origins: \"I had some serious academic questioning about the birthplace of a former president, if you will,\" he told Sharma and Solheim. Dans got excited when rumors spread in 2011 that Trump would be going to New Hampshire to announce a run for president. Alas, it didn't happen.\n\nEarly in the 2016 primary season, Dans attended a dinner of the steering committee for the New York City Lawyers Chapter of the Federalist Society. As he later recalled to Sharma and Solheim, someone asked whom people were supporting for president, and around the table it went: \"I like Jeb.\" \"I like Marco.\" \"I like Jeb.\"\n\nDans watched in bewilderment. Here were all these New York Republicans, and no one had yet mentioned the man who lived a few blocks away, who had decided to run for president this time. Finally, it was Dans' turn. \"Well, I like Trump, and I think he's going to win,\" he later told Sharma and Solheim. \"I like him because I'm sick of losing.\"\n\nThat fall, Dans headed to the Pittsburgh area to volunteer for Trump. He had worked on other campaigns, but none had ever felt like this. \"There was no passion,\" he told Sharma and Solheim. \"We were hungry for a candidate who could really speak to Americans. ... Donald Trump delivered.\"\n\nTrump's appeal to Dans verged on the tribal: He came to see himself as \"a pure-blooded deplorable mix,\" as he told Sharma and Solheim, citing the working-class, ethnic Catholic roots of his ancestors - his paternal grandfather was born to Spanish immigrant parents and had been a merchant mariner, and his mother hailed from French Canadian mill workers in Rhode Island. Never mind that his father was a medical professor who had raised Dans in an affluent suburb.\n\nWhen Trump won, Dans eagerly sent off his resume. \"Next stop, you know, Department of Justice, right?\" he said to Martin years later, recalling his confidence. But no. As he also told Sharma and Solheim, the response was \"crickets.\"\n\nHis explanation? He was too MAGA. \"There were so many people getting sandbagged because somebody thought that they were too 'America First'-y or too Trumpist,\" he told Martin. He was advised to instead slip in \"under the radar\" as \"just your milquetoast Republican appointee.\" Watching his accounts of this disappointment, it's hard not to feel some sympathy for Dans, whose affect in interviews can come off as both genial and awkward, like the chatty, perhaps too chatty, guy at the airport bar.\n\nFinally, late in 2018, Dans came to Washington for a Federalist Society meeting and connected with James Bacon, a college student who was working as confidential assistant to Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson. With Bacon's help, and with the benefit of his master's in city planning, Dans finally broke in, in July 2019, as a senior adviser in HUD's Office of Community Planning and Development.\n\nCareer staff at HUD didn't know what to make of Dans. \"We tried to figure out what his role was,\" one of them told me, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. \"He kind of wandered in,\" the career employee said. \"He was fairly disdainful of the career staff and did not have a lot of respect for why things were the way they were.\" For Dans, his arrival was a \"real baptism\" in how the government actually works. \"You don't realize that the federal government is just an avalanche of money shooting out of various agencies,\" he told Sharma and Solheim. \"It's trying to tame this spew of money and direct in the right way, is what you're doing when you get to an agency.\"\n\nAs Dans saw it, the career employees were the problem. They were biased against conservatives, and they disregarded changes sought by the duly elected administration. Dans also blamed fellow appointees, too many of whom were clueless about the actual work and thus willing to cede decision-making to career employees. \"You came and you went to cocktail parties, and you had your birthday cakes around the office and, you know, maybe a couple of ribbon cuttings, and you got to go on a little international junket,\" he told Sharma and Solheim. \"And meanwhile, everything else is kind of going at the same level.\"\n\nBy late 2019, the White House was coming to share Dans' diagnosis. James Sherk, then a special assistant on the Domestic Policy Council, began compiling purported examples of what they viewed as deep-state obstinacy that Trump should have been able to discipline with dismissals, including anonymous reports about Environmental Protection Agency employees withholding information about legal cases from political appointees and about Department of Justice lawyers refusing to investigate discrimination against Asian Americans at Yale.\n\nThe ultimate example of perceived perfidy came in December 2019, when the House used the testimony of federal employees to approve two articles of impeachment against Trump: for using the levers of powers to pressure Ukraine into discrediting Biden and for obstructing Congress. This gave Trump and his remaining White House coterie new resolve to take more control of hiring.\n\nTrump turned the Presidential Personnel Office over to John McEntee, his 29-year-old former personal assistant who had left the White House in 2018 after a background check found that he posed a security risk due to his frequent gambling. (McEntee, now an adviser for Project 2025, has declined to comment about the background check in the past.) McEntee recruited Bacon, the college student, to assist him in overhauling personnel, and, looking for someone to join in the effort, they settled on Paul Dans. The person who had barely made it into the administration had impressed them with his critiques of the status quo.\n\nIn February 2020, the White House installed Dans at Office of Personnel Management as \"White House liaison and senior adviser to the director\" - its eyes and ears there.\n\nDans, encouraged by McEntee, wasted no time. He quickly ordered the removal of the agency's chief of staff, Jonathan Blyth, and asserted so much authority across the agency that its director, Dale Cabaniss, who had spent years as a Republican staff member in the Senate, decided to leave as well. Cabaniss was replaced by an interim director, Michael Rigas, but people at the agency told me that Dans was the de facto director for the remainder of the year; late in 2020, he was named chief of staff. (Rigas and Blyth did not respond to requests for comment; Cabaniss declined to comment on the record.) So total was the takeover of the personnel process that Dans' colleagues took to referring to him, McEntee and their allies as \"the coup group.\"\n\nOne of Dans' first assertions of authority came at a senior staff meeting after Cabaniss' departure, amid the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. According to another Trump appointee, some 20 people were present in the conference room at OPM's headquarters near the National Mall when the agency's then-chief information officer, Clare Martorana, said that, like most other agencies, it would use Zoom for online meetings.\n\nDans erupted, declaring that Zoom, which was founded by a Chinese immigrant to the U.S., posed the risk of spying by China. Martorana took in his outburst with \"a combination of anger, amusement and just dumbstruck awe,\" the Trump appointee recalled. She then tried to explain that Zoom was on the government's approved list of vendors and that many other agencies were using it. This did not mollify Dans.\n\nAs 2020 went on, Dans' colleagues became accustomed to his insistent demands, which, coupled with his large frame, could make him an intimidating presence. Dans wanted to hire as many appointees as possible in the final year of Trump's term in office, and he wanted the agency's processes to move faster. \"He would just throw bombs into senior staff meetings,\" said the appointee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, \"and they would say: 'What are we supposed to do with this? He can't be serious with this.'\"\n\nIn October 2020, less than two weeks before the election, Trump signed an executive order creating Schedule F, the new category of career employees in key positions who would now be easier to remove.\n\nOver at OPM, Dans was busy with a related effort, seeking to recategorize positions in the Senior Executive Service - higher-ranking managerial slots across the government that are mostly filled with career employees - into a general category that would allow the president to appoint more of them. He was also engaged in another aspect of the administration's new emphasis on personnel: making sure that OPM appointees answered long ideological questionnaires and met for interviews with staffers to assess their fitness for staying on in a second Trump term.\n\nThose who dealt with Dans at OPM told me that they tried to respond to his demands as best they could, but that he often grew agitated when told that OPM did not have the ability to do what he wanted. He seemed to take such explanations as a personal affront. \"He questioned everything from the point of view that there was a conspiracy against him and the president,\" the appointee said.\n\nColleagues chalked up his outbursts to insecurity born of his not understanding how the government worked and being broadly out of his depth. \"He reminded me of some of the people who show up at Republican conventions,\" said a second Republican appointee at the agency, who, like the first, spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. \"Those people usually show up and then go home. They show up and are vocal, but they're not like, 'Now I'm going to go do the boring work of the sausage-making of government.'\"\n\nDonald Devine, who led OPM during the Reagan administration and whom the Trump administration had brought on as an adviser during this period, scoffs at such critiques. \"If you do anything, people aren't going to like it, and that's why he's so different,\" Devine told me. \"Most of the other people in the executive office of OPM weren't doing much, so people didn't care about them. He's a serious person trying to do a serious job. You don't see a lot of that, and that's why I like him so much.\"\n\nDans' only problem, Devine said, was that he ran out of time. \"The major things were going to be done the next term,\" he said. \"It was too late to do anything before they figured out how to run personnel.\"\n\nAfter the election, Dans stayed hard at work at OPM, even as other appointees started to vanish in the final weeks of the Trump administration. Since then, Dans has criticized prosecutions of those involved in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. \"The unfortunate thing is it does send a message to people that you shouldn't criticize the government,\" he said in a C-SPAN interview last year.\n\nA year and a half after arriving in Washington, Dans left for his new home in South Carolina, near his wife's hometown of Charlotte, North Carolina, while she was expecting their fourth child. \"I went home kind of in this Cincinnatus sort of spirit: return to the farm. Our farm being in Fort Mill, South Carolina, in a subdivision,\" he quipped to Sharma and Solheim.\n\nBut then he turned serious: \"We're 'God, country and family.' And now is the time to go put a little more emphasis on the God and family part of that. But we'll be back for the country thing.\"\n\nWith the 2024 election approaching, with Trump leading Biden and then Harris in most national polls and with Dans' vision of reshaping the bureaucracy heavily influencing the Trump campaign, it finally seemed like Dans' moment might actually be arriving. On Tuesday's episode of the \"War Room\" podcast - founded by former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, who is now in prison - Dans sometimes sounded triumphant. \"In order to take this back, the swamp isn't going to drain itself,\" he said. \"We need outsiders coming in committed to doing this. ... With Project 2025, we built a pathway to encourage folks to do this.\"\n\nBut in that same \"War Room\" episode on Tuesday, Dans decried the \"great disinformation campaign\" underway against Project 2025, \"almost a hoax.\" He listed some of the mistruths that Democrats had voiced about the project's proposals, including a claim by Harris that it would eliminate Social Security. \"Just completely fallacious stuff,\" he said. \"It's just one big bald-faced lie.\"\n\nIt was plain that he was taking the attacks very personally, and with good reason. The Democrats' campaign to turn Project 2025 into an albatross around Trump's neck was succeeding, to the point where some sort of dramatic break was needed. Just hours after that episode aired came word that Dans would be stepping down. \"We are extremely grateful for [Dans'] and everyone's work on Project 2025 and dedication to saving America,\" Heritage President Kevin Roberts said.\n\nIn a note to Heritage staff, obtained by The Wall Street Journal , Dans himself suggested that his mission was, essentially, complete. \"The work of this project was due to wrap up with the nominating conventions of the political parties,\" he wrote. \"Our work is presently winding down, and I plan later in August to leave Heritage.\"\n\nIt was face-saving, but it was also largely true. The database was built; the training seminars had been taught. This time, the foot soldiers were ready to go, just waiting to be called on. \"From the president's lips to God's ears that change is going to happen? It really happens below\" the president, Dans said on \"War Room.\" \"That's the importance of recognizing: Personnel is really the cornerstone of the change.\"\n\nDisavowals or not, the logic of Project 2025 is embedded in the DNA of Trump's plan to overhaul the government. Reinstating Schedule F is still a top-level agenda item. Jacqueline Simon, the public policy director of the American Federation of Government Employees, told me that the agencies could end up defining the new employment category so broadly that it could encompass far more than 50,000 positions. \"It will be a purge,\" she said.\n\nDonald Moynihan, a public policy professor at Georgetown University, does not expect Trump to fire tens of thousands. Jettisoning just a couple of thousand, to make an example of them, may be enough. \"They can fire 1,000 and put their heads on pikes, and then everyone else quickly falls into line,\" he told me. \"That way you have a terrified bureaucracy that still has institutional knowledge. That's the more strategic way to use Schedule F, to scare the bejesus out of 49,000 people and force them into line.\" Sherk, the author of Schedule F , suggested as much to me. \"The notion we're going to can 50,000 people is just insane,\" he said. \"Why would you do that? That would kneecap the ability to implement your agenda. You use it to go after bad actors and rank incompetents.\"\n\nThat would still leave the challenge of finding people to fill the 4,000 slots for appointees and however many hundreds or thousands of openings are created by firings. Many Republicans who served in the first Trump administration are leery of serving in a second. \"The last administration was a joke, and they had a real problem recruiting,\" a Washington attorney who served in the George W. Bush administration, and who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution against his firm, told me. \"Who the hell would jump into this clown car driving toward a cliff? Are people going to come forward, quality people? Not a fucking chance.\"\n\nThis was precisely Dans' mission with Project 2025: to find a whole new corps of people willing to come to the capital and do the work of implementing the Trump agenda that the usual D.C. fixtures refuse to do. How many will be suited to the task? \"We have to recruit the talent to get to Washington,\" Dans told Martin. \"Ultimately, what Project 2025 is is a call to action for patriots to come serve in Washington.\"\n\nWill Dans himself be among that number? As Devine sees it, Dans' current defenestration is political, and temporary. \"Paul is too bright and intelligent not to,\" he said. \"They'll pick him up somewhere.\" Devine said that he's spoken with Dans since his decision to resign. \"He's doing well,\" Devine said. \"He's ready to go on to fight. The memorandum he sent [to Heritage colleagues] ends with that: 'Fight! Fight! Fight!'\" Dans still sees himself as a field general for a new class of Trump bureaucrats, one that will come to power if Trump wins, whether the effort is called Project 2025 or not.\n\nRead More\n\nThere is a paradox at the core of this. Dans was never looking for the proverbial farmers with pitchforks, because he is aware of how complex the work of the federal government is. Dans was looking for people who are both angry enough about the state of the country to want to commit four years to serving Donald Trump in Washington to fix it, and yet sufficiently versed in the mechanisms of government to be able to restrain it. \"We need many more eyes and ears, many more technicians on the ground,\" he told Sharma and Solheim.\n\nIt is idealistic, in its way, the conception of an aggrieved, underappreciated elite that is ready to be summoned to Washington. It sounds a lot like, well, Paul Dans. The question is, how many others like him have been out there all along, just waiting for this?\n\nDo You Have a Tip for ProPublica?

      "text": "Republicans link arms with Trump amid tariff and spending stress\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nOn one of the most politically stressful days of Donald Trumpâs presidency, his party sent a more reassuring signal: Most Republicans are ready to back his new tariffs and the next step of his slow-moving Hill agenda.\n\nEven after a high-profile loss in a Wisconsin judicial race raised the specter of future midterm problems, most Republicans lined up Wednesday in defense of Trumpâs Canada tariff plans and forthcoming reciprocal tariffs. Simultaneously, Trump helped Senate Majority Leader John Thune secure the votes needed to advance a bare-bones budget resolution that defers a lot of tough decisions about his agenda.\n\nThatâs in part thanks to evaporating skepticism from conservatives like Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., who has raised a lot of questions about the budget as well as Trumpâs tariffs.\n\nAfter meeting with Trump on Wednesday, though, Johnson said heâs âfeeling a lot more comfortableâ about the budget that tees up future action on tax and spending cuts. Trump is facing a symbolically significant rebellion on the Senate floor against his tariffs on Canada, but Johnson scoffed at the idea of voting with Democrats and a handful of fellow Republicans to rebuke him.\n\nâIâm not going to support their effort to just poke a stick and try and do the president damage,â Johnson said after the meeting.\n\nTrump still faces serious headwinds, the harshest of his presidency so far, as he and his party recover from a Wisconsin Supreme Court loss on Tuesday evening that has sparked worries within the GOP about a 2018-style electoral meltdown. But most Republicans are ready to buy into Trumpâs promise that tariffs can extract more favorable trade deals with other countries.\n\nThatâs thanks in large part to active behind-the-scenes work to shore up support in the party. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was dispatched to the House on Tuesday and the Senate on Wednesday, where he urged unity on tariffs and taxes.\n\nâHeâs a numbers guy and then some, and heâs just going through the numbers. He believes in the plan, as I do,â Rep. Dan Meuser, R-Pa., told Semafor of Bessent afterward. âAre we breaking a few eggs to make an omelette? Yeah. Maybe thatâs why the price of eggs is so high.â\n\nTrump said Wednesday that he would declare a national emergency that allows him to implement sweeping new tariffs, taxing all imports at 10 percent starting April 5 and imports from select countries at higher rates that Trump described as âhalf of what they â¦ have been charging us,â starting April 9. That includes a 34 percent tariff on Chinese imports â to be stacked with an existing 20 percent tariff â and a 20 percent tariff on European Union imports.\n\nâReciprocal: That means they do it to us and we do it to them,â Trump said from the Rose Garden. âVery simple. Canât get any simpler than that.â\n\nAt least one moment is still likely to go awry for the White House: A public rebuke of Trumpâs tariffs on Canada authored by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., looks set to pass the Senate with at least four GOP votes. Even so, other key Republicans said theyâd oppose the condemnation after Trump publicly urged his party to vote it down.\n\nPerhaps most urgently, Trump is successfully getting his agenda moving in Congress after weeks of circular debate among Republicans congealed into a decision to punt big choices about reducing spending until far later in the year. When pressed directly on spending cuts on Wednesday, Trump told Senate Republicans heâd work with them on slashing federal dollars.\n\nThat vow completed a successful courtship of conservatives who had threatened to bring down the budget. Republicans are now confident they can get 50 of their senators to vote for a budget that essentially makes no ironclad commitments to cut spending â which had been a key ask from the right just a few days ago.\n\nâAll of us budget hawks â Iâm one of them â heard the president say, âI recognize this is a rare and wonderful opportunity to right-size the budget and Iâll support your effort to achieve that,ââ recounted Sen. John Kennedy, R-La. âI think it was important for a couple of my colleagues to hear him say that.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nThe quartet of Senate Republicans defying him on Canada tariffs â Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell â arenât exactly Trump stalwarts. As Trump posted about those âunbelievably disloyalâ senators and urged his party to deny Democrats a âvictory,â most Republicans backed him.\n\nâI think President Trump has a plan, and weâll be able to execute that plan,â Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, told Semafor.\n\nHer Iowa colleague Chuck Grassley agreed: âI see it as nothing but to bring up something to obstruct what Trumpâs doing on tariffs.â\n\nTrump and top advisers spent significant time crafting options for Wednesdayâs tariffs, coming to a final decision only in the hours before the event. Even before he finalized the plan, the White House worked to defend the tariffs, with top aides and officials appearing genuinely excited about what Trump dubbed âLiberation Day.â\n\nHouse Republicans said Bessent assured them Tuesday there would be a âcapâ on the tariffs and that other countries have already signaled a willingness to scale back their own tariffs in response. Leading up to Wednesdayâs Rose Garden announcement, the administration blasted out defenses of tariffs and dispatched advisors and Cabinet secretaries onto TV.\n\nIt may not totally convince free-traders to become tariff lovers â but thatâs not what Trump needs. He needs most Republicans to join his bet that widespread levies on foreign imports will pay off economically.\n\nâThe benefits of free trade are held as a stalwart position of conservatives,â said Rep. John Rose, R-Tenn. But, he added, âmost in the Republican Party are willing to give him a pretty long leash in terms of pursuing opening markets.â\n\nAs for Trumpâs tax cuts, thereâs a lot of private handwringing over what Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., called a âmessyâ process.\n\nA couple of senators said the work isnât done: Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., said he wants to balance the budget; Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said only that things are moving in the âright direction.â Both also attended Wednesdayâs meeting with Trump; the budget resolution was unveiled shortly after that meeting.\n\nItâs still not quite clear how the two chambers will come together on the nuts and bolts of a tax plan as text released Wednesday laid out disparate instructions. The House is planning to cut at least $1.5 trillion to pay for tax cuts, while the Senate is leaving those details for later; the chambers also are still in dispute over whether extensions of expiring tax cuts need to be paid for.\n\nLawmakers are simultaneously pressing the White House for a rescission package that allows Congress to pare back federal spending with simple majority votes.\n\nâAt some point,â Kennedy said, âPresident Trump is going to have to step in and say let me help you folks and share our ideas in order for us to reach a consensus.â\n\nTo the extent Trump has had to twist arms in Congress in his three months in office, heâs mostly concentrated on the House. Now itâs the Senateâs turn, and his grip remains strong.\n\nIf Republicans have a breaking point on Trumpâs tariffs, most clearly havenât hit it. Thereâs also not much evidence Republicans would be willing to slow down Trumpâs tax cut plans, as long as he uses the bully pulpit to promote them and pledges to keep working with conservatives.\n\nKennedy said Trump didnât explicitly urge Republicans to support the budget on Wednesday, but it wasnât really needed. The implication of a meeting with the president about his agenda is that the party needs to come together, stop circular debate and support the president.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, is an outlier, one of her conferenceâs two moderates. But as the only Senate Republican representing a state Trump has never won, sheâs a good barometer for how Trumpâs policies are playing.\n\nCollins doesnât like the Canada tariffs and said sheâs âheard considerable concernâ about the broader levies among her colleagues.\n\nâThe Canadian tariffs would cause incredible harm to Maine, families and economies of Maine communities. I also think that theyâre misguided. Canada is not the source of our fentanyl problem in the United States,â Collins told Semafor.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "âA Trump revolutionâ: At CPAC, conservatives hope for a global populist movement\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nNATIONAL HARBOR, Md. â On Thursday morning, Steve Bannon hosted his War Room podcast live from the Conservative Political Action Conference, with a special prop. A screen behind him showed live footage from the Senate floor, where Trump loyalist and frequent CPAC star Kash Patel was about to be confirmed to lead the FBI. Much less interesting, for the crowd gathered around Bannon in CPACâs exhibit hall: Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell taking the floor to announce his retirement.\n\nâMcConnell and his cartel of consultants had a complete monopoly on the funding of Senate races, and theyâve lost more swing races than theyâve won,â said Caroline Wren, a GOP strategist who worked with 2024 Arizona Senate candidate Kari Lake. âWhatâs his legacy? I donât think anyone gives a shit.â\n\nCPACâs transformation into a pro-Trump convention happened many years ago, changing what had been a messy meeting between Republican factions â libertarians and conservatives, war hawks and isolationists â into a celebration of America First nationalism. McConnell stopped coming to the conference after winning a Senate majority in 2014. His major triumphs, of blocking a 2016 Obama appointment to the Supreme Court and speed-running a 2020 Trump appointment, were very old news.\n\nWhat was new, and exciting for this yearâs attendees, was the Trump administrationâs rapid deconstruction of the administrative state, a goal older than the 51-year conference. Even more thrilling was the idea of exporting this around the world. Elon Musk, handed a chainsaw by Argentina President Javier Milei, was praised by Republican leaders and foreign politicians for both slashing the government and turning Twitter into a âfree speechâ hub where liberal media outlets barely mattered.\n\nâWe want a Trump revolution in Britain,â said former British Prime Minister Liz Truss, who lost her seat in the 2024 Labour landslide and has spent her free time meeting MAGA conservatives. âWe want Elon and his nerd army of Musk rats examining the British deep state.â\n\nThere was massive applause for a mention of Vice President JD Vanceâs speech at the Munich Security Conference, where he warned Europeans against mass immigration âcommissarsâ censoring free speech. (âIâll take a standing ovation for a speech I gave already,â Vance joked.)\n\nWhen McConnell was mentioned at all â or when his priority of support for Ukraine was mentioned â it was as a punchline. House Speaker Mike Johnson said he was grateful that McConnell had voted to confirm Patel, and praised Trump for trying to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine on terms that were unpopular in Europe.\n\nâRemember, he wrote The Art of the Deal ,â said Johnson. Asked by his Newsmax interviewer whether there might be another Ukraine funding package, he scoffed.\n\nâI think thereâs no appetite for that!â he said, over a chorus of boos.\n\nIn this article:\n\nIâve covered most CPACs since 2006, skipping a few only when the schedule didnât work at all. The candidates who used to shell out thousands of dollars to win the presidential straw polls are gone; the foreign right-wing politicians who used to walk around as unknowns are now major stars.\n\nThe mood this year â intentionally so, as CPAC has spent a lot of time and money building conferences around the world â was jubilation at the world turned rightside up. The ânational greatness conservativesâ who wanted to spread democracy in a re-made Middle East have been exiled, or have self-deported. The soft power that interested people this year: Trump and Vance and Musk destroying the liberal consensus in Europe, and wherever else was necessary.\n\nThis meant Brazilian conservatives comparing the censorship of X in their country, and the prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro, to the âpersecutionâ of Trump. It meant Korean conservatives informing attendees that election fraud might put their left in power; it meant Hungarian conservatives congratulating Americans for bringing Trump back, a help in their effort to halt illegal immigration and root the left out of institutions.\n\nâWe apologize to the good people of Hungary,â CPAC leader Matt Schlapp told BalÃ¡zs OrbÃ¡n, the political director for (unrelated) Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n.\n\nAmerican liberals had warned, for years, that OrbÃ¡nâs dominance of Hungarian politics and society was a model that Trump and MAGA wanted to follow.\n\nThis is not a particularly controversial idea at CPAC, where the aggressor in European culture wars is George Soros, where immigration from the Middle East is an existential threat, and where any liberal complaints about the rule of law are ludicrous. (One booth sold separate T-shirts that celebrated the âfull pardon for Jan. 6 patriotsâ and condemned the âJanuary 6 fedsurrection,â the idea that the Capitol riot was a law enforcement plot.)\n\nAfter Vance, the highest-ranking Trump official to appear at the conference on Thursday was Attorney Gen. Pam Bondi, interviewed by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and his podcast co-host Ben Ferguson. She rebuffed Fergusonâs question about whether Joe Biden might be legally vulnerable over his handling of classified documents. âThis is not about weaponization,â she said. But she gave a robust defense of a decision that has shocked New Yorkers and led to high-profile DOJ resignations: Dropping the case against New York Mayor Eric Adams, who had lobbied Trump for a favor.\n\nâIt was an incredibly weak case filed to make deportation harder,â said Bondi, adding (incorrectly) that âviolent crime is at an all-time highâ in the city. The Trump DOJ intervention in New York had dynamited Adamsâ already weak political position, ahead of the June Democratic primary. What would other MAGA interventions do in Europe, Korea, and Brazil?\n\nThereâll be a test this weekend, in Germanyâs elections, of whether Trump, Vance, and Musk endorsing far-right European parties is a help or a hindrance. In Canada, Trumpâs tariff threats and constant joking about annexation have revived the fortunes of the ruling Liberal Party, which was set to lose elections in a landslide this year. (Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will leave office before the election, after his party picks a new leader.) UK Reform Party leader Nigel Farage thrilled the crowd when he said his party was leading in polls, but elections there arenât scheduled until 2029.\n\nâTrump is very unpopular here but his no nonsense approach on wokery and government waste has its followers,â said Tim Shipman, the chief political commentator at the Sunday Times and the author of a quartet of books about Brexit. âFarageâs party is topping the polls but he himself is only popular with about 25% of the population. So while a broad cross section has approved of Trumpâs confounding of liberals so far, support for Ukraine is extremely strong and people are utterly horrified by what he said yesterday. The government and those who have courted him on the right are now in a very awkward position, hoping that itâs a play, not a belief.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "Tea partyâs champions agonize over spending cuts\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nYears before Donald Trump remodeled the GOP, the Tea Party took its turn transforming the party. And now, at a critical juncture for Trumpâs agenda, its heirs in Congress are weighing just how far to push it.\n\nA handful of conservative senators are holding out â for now, at least â on supporting Republican leadersâ still-evolving budget, the next step to advance Trumpâs tax cut plans. Those senators are demanding deeper spending cuts than their House counterparts and questioning why the GOP would add a debt ceiling increase that theyâd have to pass without Democrats.\n\nBut a big unknown lingers over the endeavor: Are fiscal conservatives willing to vote no on the budget if they donât get their way? Itâs something the partyâs right flank is plainly wrestling with.\n\nâI have an obligation to do so, if it doesnât get it right. I also have an obligation to make sure it gets right, to get to the point where I can vote for it,â Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, told Semafor of the budget thatâs expected in the Senate floor as soon as next week.\n\nLee added that âI donât necessarily want to encourage us to go slower. I just want to make sure that we do it cautiously and that we get it right.â\n\nItâs a critical moment for Republicans like Lee whose political careers took off in 2010 and 2012 as a rejection of the GOPâs old guard. Senior Republicans estimate that the number of senators uneasy with the budget talks could jeopardize the package or at least delay it further, though Senate Majority Leader John Thune and fellow leaders are moving to assuage those concerns.\n\nIn addition to Lee, Sens. Rand Paul, R-Ky., Ron Johnson, R-Wis., and Rick Scott, R-Fla., are the most vocal in their calls for more spending cuts. Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., an original member of the Tea Party Caucus during her time in the House, told Semafor sheâs taking their position, too: âI canât support the House level. There needs to be more cuts than that.â\n\nSenate Republicans are discussing adding $500 billion to the House GOPâs $1.5 trillion floor for spending cuts, although their budget may end up slashing even more, according to multiple members.\n\nLummis said a group of Republicans is pushing for deeper cuts, and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said heâs among them â but another Republican senator told Semafor that going too far could alienate the partyâs more moderate members. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who leans more populist, said he could support deeper cuts but not if they affect benefits to Medicare or Medicaid, which the House had proposed targeting.\n\nRepublicans can lose up to three votes from their side and pass the budget with a simple majority.\n\nâWeâre trying to thread the needle â¦ all of us want to use as robust of a deficit reduction package as we can, but also something that we can get through the Senate,â Thune told Semafor.\n\nIn this article:\n\nAt the same time, Thuneâs most fiscally conservative members are pushing to excise a debt ceiling increase that Trump wants, separating that issue from the tax cut push. Paul was the only Republican to oppose the partyâs initial budget earlier this year; he told Semafor this is the moment for conservatives to get loud or get rolled.\n\nâThey need to be more verbal, and if theyâre vocal now, I think we can remove it from the bill. If more people donât stand up, theyâre going to jam things at the end and put it on,â Paul said.\n\nRepublicans do not seem optimistic about winning his vote.\n\nIt all speaks to the uncertain status of extreme budget-cutters in the Republican Party. Once a dominant force, these days theyâre used to being assured by leaders that later, not now, is the time for steep spending reduction.\n\nJohnson said this time he doesnât buy it, and that he wants Republicans to push spending back to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nâThey say, âthis is the first step here, we can always do more,ââ Johnson told Semafor. Unless the party cuts spending now, he said: âWeâre not going to do more.â\n\nWhatever cuts the GOP endorses, the details will be left to Senate committees to figure out. Thuneâs leadership team is simply hoping to generate momentum for the stalled Republican agenda heading into next monthâs recess.\n\nThe party is far behind its 2017 pace when it comes to unilateral action on Trumpâs agenda, and leaders are aware that at some point they need to call a vote.\n\nâWeâre closing in on it,â said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., the No. 4 conference leader. She said the goal is to âagree to an aspirational number, or at least agree to a minimum, so we can just move forward. Because we want to capture the momentum.â\n\nBudget resolutions are more of a party unity exercise than anything else. And for that reason, despite the hard line being drawn by the Senateâs most Tea Party-friendly members, itâs hard to imagine four or more Republicans actually tanking the budget.\n\nThune would be highly unlikely to bring any budget to the floor, of course, if he didnât have adequate support.\n\nBut itâs certainly possible that things get delayed even further if conservatives keep balking. And that might not be such a bad thing, since some Republican senators still think they might need to split Trumpâs agenda back into two separate bills at some point.\n\nIf the Senate does move forward, the House might entertain further changes to the budget. To avoid yet another round of voting after this one, Thune and Speaker Mike Johnson will need to reach a compromise ahead of time.\n\nThatâs a huge challenge.\n\nThere are still plenty of optimists in the Senate GOP who see a comfortable landing spot for everyone.\n\nâI think the consensus now is itâs going to be $2 trillion, floor â¦ actually, itâll help us with the fiscal conservatives in the House and certainly in the Senate,â said Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont.\n\nHe added that âthe real meat of the discussion is the actual [party-line] reconciliation bill,â not the budget, and likened the moment to an easy trip down the slope: âI call this skiing the green runs. Weâre going to get into the blue runs and black diamonds next.â\n\nItâs undeniable that this phase of legislating is far easier than whatâs to come: Identifying binding cuts to popular government programs. Many Republicans already have said they are uneasy with cutting Medicaid, for example.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Republicans put Trumpâs court fight on the ballot\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nOCONOMOWOC, Wis. â On Monday night, hundreds of conservatives packed into a brewhouse overlooking a baseball diamond to rally for a judge.\n\nâAmerica, last November, stepped right up to the edge of the abyss,â said Brad Schimel, the GOP-backed candidate for state supreme court on April 1. âDo you think the job is done? No wayâ¦ We want freedom-loving people who donât want to be a socialist nation to be heard.â\n\nDonald Trump Jr. warned that Republicans might âlose Wisconsinâ for good if Schimel didnât beat Democratic Party-backed nominee Susan Crawford and flip the courtâs current 4-3 liberal majority. Staff from Turning Point Action, which organized the rally and a âChase the Voteâ campaign, circled the room to find more volunteers. And former GOP Gov. Scott Walker said that the president needed their help to deport foreign criminals.\n\nâWhoâs trying to stop him? A judge,â said Walker. âWe donât want Susan Crawford and three other radicals on this court to say theyâre not going to let us deport the worst of the worst back to where they belong! We need Brad Schimel on the court!â\n\nWisconsinâs court race, already the most expensive in the stateâs history, pits a Democratic Party thatâs gotten very good at turning out in lower-profile elections against a MAGA coalition thatâs trying to catch up. As early voting began this week, the specter of judges overruling Trump motivated Republicans; the specter of pro-Trump judges taking his side scared Democrats, with still-fresh memories of a 2020 Trump campaign lawsuit that came one vote away from overturning the stateâs election.\n\nIn this article:\n\nThatâs meant more money from new sources â more than $11 million so far from Elon Musk and his PACs, his first intervention in a state court race. Itâs been spent behind a former state attorney general who entered the race early with a plan to ânationalize thisâ and âunite conservatives,â matching the expected out-of-state spending from liberals.\n\nDemocrats have worked to make Musk a problem for Republicans, with Crawford labeling her opponent âElon Schimelâ and national party figures holding anti-âoligarchyâ and anti-Musk rallies across the state.\n\nâDemocrats are looking for any possible way to fight back, to do something to relieve the just constant anxiety of this Trump/Musk onslaught,â said Democratic Party of Wisconsin chairman Ben Wikler, while hosting a âpet the voteâ event in Madison alongside his family dog, Pumpkin. âOrganizing to elect Susan Crawford gives them a channel for that energy.â\n\nRepublicans, just as confidently, have leaned on Trump. Unlike Dan Kelly, whose 2023 defeat gave liberals their majority, Schimel has embraced the GOP and campaigned at MAGA rallies; direct mail ads from Muskâs America PAC tell Republicans that the judge will âsupport President Trumpâs agendaâ if he wins.\n\nThis week, as early voting got underway, the presidentâs court reversals and denunciations of unfriendly judges echoed in Wisconsin. At the Oconomowoc rally, Trump Jr. marveled at how a deportation flight was halted by âsome random judge in the middle of nowhere,â linking it to the Schimel-Crawford race.\n\nâA liberal judge, just like this, wants to overrule the will of the President of the United States and the people who put him there with a mandate to end this nonsense,â Trump Jr. said.\n\nThe paid TV messaging that most voters will see, from the campaigns and Muskâs $10 million-plus PAC buys, have focused more on lurid crime stories than Trump. They include stories of child sex predators who didnât get maximum sentences (in anti-Crawford ads) and backlogged rape kits (in anti-Schimel ads) â little of it related to cases that would come before the stateâs high court.\n\nThe Trump angle is reserved for voters, contacted at their homes in person and in direct mail. In some settings, like his sole televised debate with Crawford, Schimel says he would rule impartially in any interaction with Trump or Musk. With conservative audiences, he is much more direct about his support for Trump, which supporters see as the way to pull out hundreds of thousands of Republicans who would otherwise ignore the race.\n\nâPeople are really fired up,â said Brett Galaszewski, the vice chair of the Milwaukee County GOP and national enterprise director at Turning Point Action, which has hundreds of paid staff in the state reaching Republicans who typically skip non-presidential elections. âTheyâre seeing the effects of what DOGE is doing, and what Trump has done in these first days of his presidency, and the everyday Wisconsinite wants more of that.â\n\nCrawford has gone after Schimelâs Musk and GOP ties, and has spoken more carefully about her own support from Democrats. The risk of the GOPâs MAGA campaign, she told Semafor, would be âthat it undermines the confidence of Wisconsin citizens in the impartiality of the judiciary and of the Supreme Court, in particular.â Schimel entered the race, he said on Monday, because he saw the Democrats working to âunravel the very foundation of our judicial system by promising how youâre going to rule on cases that arenât even filed.â\n\nBut the candidates have implemented those theories of the race very differently. Schimel has encouraged the president to endorse him, and to come to Wisconsin, but as a corrective to liberal overreach. Crawford has stayed well away from high-profile events organized by Bernie Sanders and Tim Walz.\n\nâIâm not going to discourage anyone who can attract a large audience, and wants to support my candidacy, from showing up,â she told Semafor. âBut I do want voters to understand that Iâm not coordinating with these folks.â The election, technically, is nonpartisan. But the campaign is not.\n\nThe trick to winning Wisconsinâs off-year spring elections, since the parties started polarizing and prioritizing them, is getting out the largest fraction of the usual partisan vote. Hundreds of thousands of people who voted red or blue for president will skip it. Thatâs inevitable. Two years ago, Justice Janet Protasiewicz won just 62% as many votes as Joe Biden did in 2020, but that was enough for a double-digit popular vote victory. Thatâs what Republicans want to overwhelm.\n\nTheyâve never tried to do that by running back to Trump voters. But the basic idea â telling voters that they have a partisan reason to vote in this nonpartisan race â has worked before. Five years ago, Republicans narrowly won the race for another seat on the court after Democrats out-spent them, running ads about conservative blog posts by candidate Brian Hagedorn. The Republican State Legislative Committee made a last-minute buy that accused liberals of lobbing âfalse attacks â¦ just like they did against Justice Kavanaugh.â\n\nThat was the last Democratic loss before Wikler took over the party. Republicans, through their alliance of outside groups, are trying to replicate what they think he did: selling national donors on the importance of the race, and organizing very early to find unlikely voters. The goal now, said Wikler, is to blow past the huge turnout from 2023 â more than 1 million votes for their candidate, a Democratic record â with deeper organizing. Holding the seat had been part of a multi-year plan to break Republican control of the state, and they would use Musk to remind them of the stakes.\n\nâDoor knocks more than double what we did in 2023, phone calls more than double,â said Wikler. âRelational friend to friend outreach, more than quadrupled.â\n\nDemocratsâ data suggests that the Musk message is the most powerful motivator for their voters, now that the brief liberal majority has fulfilled one of their 2023 campaign goals, new legislative district maps, and may fulfill another: striking down the stateâs 1849 abortion ban. Republicans believe that their issues are more vital and immediate to the hard-to-get voters. Every day, they are hearing about some Trump setback, and theyâre being told that this is a way to stop them.\n\nIf that works for Republicans, at a moment when Democrats are feeling depressed by their partyâs national leaders, it would reveal a strategy that the GOP can use for the rest of the year. And it would devastate Democrats, who have been outperforming in special elections since they turned over the White House. When I asked Walz what defeat would mean, he didnât try to spin it. âOh my God, thatâs it,â he said. âThatâs the country. Thatâs the republic. Thatâs everything.â\n\nShah Mehdi, 40, who planned to vote early for Schimel, said that he was sick of Democratic attacks on both Musk and Trump, who he has complete faith in; he had traveled to DC for Trumpâs inauguration rally and caught one of the pens the president threw to the audience after signing a pile of executive orders.\n\nâThey are attacking patriot Elon and heâs rescuing astronauts from space and removing waste from our hard-earned tax dollars,â Mehdi said. âItâs crazy.â\n\nSammie Sackmann, a Democrat whoâd come to Eau Claire to hear Walz speak, said that a Schimel win would empower Trump to do so many things she feared. âOur town is already behind in so many things, like education,â she said. âFor us to take things away from people who canât even vote yet, to take away their future â it would be unthinkable.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "Team-up between Germanyâs conservatives and far-right shakes up election\n\nSign up for Semafor Flagship: The daily global news briefing you can trust. Read it now .\n\nThe political fallout in Germany from the conservative Christian Democratic Unionâs collaboration with the far-right Alternative for Germany to pass a migration resolution widened Thursday as the country nears a Feb. 23 general election.\n\nThe measure âÂ while non-binding â was nonetheless striking: It marked the first time since World War II that a mainstream German party used votes from a far-right group to secure a majority in the Bundestag.\n\nFormer Chancellor Angela Merkel criticized her own partyâs actions, while populist Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n cheered the vote. The center right, meanwhile, has tried to limit electoral damage.\n\nThe measureâs passage is set to shake up Germanyâs Feb. 23 election, called after Chancellor Olaf Scholzâs center-left government collapsed late last year. Working with the far-right has long been taboo for mainstream parties, which tend to agree on the need for a âfirewallâ to block the AfD from power. Conservative leader Friedrich Merz, who is on track to become the next chancellor, faced immediate criticism from other parties and said he regretted having to work with the AfD. The move could jeopardize future coalition negotiations after the election, with other parties potentially less willing to form a government with his party, Berlin-based outlet Tabie Briefings wrote: âWhat happened in the Bundestag on Wednesday will have long-lasting effects .â\n\nFormer Chancellor Angela Merkelâs criticism that Friedrich Merz made the âwrongâ move was a â unique act of disloyalty â from the longtime CDU leader, the editor-in-chief of Bild wrote, adding that it was essentially the equivalent of a public stab in the back. Merkelâs legacy has taken a hit in recent years, and her memoir released last year was widely panned. Her criticism is unlikely to stop the CDUâs shift to the right on immigration, Politico wrote, âbut it may well fuel an internal debate on the conservativesâ role in weakening the firewall around the far right.â\n\nFrom Italy to Austria to Poland, Europe has seen a rightward shift on immigration, and several high-profile attacks in Germany in recent months has thrust the migration debate into the spotlight. The AfD has made immigration its central issue, while Merz has also taken a tougher stance ahead of the election in a bid to keep conservative voters from defecting to the far right. If Merz wins and pursues a hardline policy, âGermany wouldnât be going it alone ,â a Bloomberg columnist noted, as even European countries without right-wing governments have beefed up immigration laws and enforcement. The continentâs hard-right appears to be welcoming the shift: âGood morning, Germany. Welcome to the club !â Hungaryâs Viktor OrbÃ¡n said Thursday following the Bundenstag vote.\n\nSign up for Semafor flagship\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives."

      "text": "Trumpâs ânational conservativeâ allies plot a revenge administration\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nOn Monday afternoon, a few blocks from the White House, conservative legal scholars discussed how to strike back against Donald Trumpâs enemies. These subversives, they said, had waged âlawfareâ against the Republican nominee, thrown out 2020 election challenges, and blocked scrutiny of a Biden administration that might be gone in six months. What could conservatives do about that, if they won back power?\n\nâWeâve got to start impeaching these judges for acting in such an unbelievably partisan way from the bench,â said John Eastman, a California attorney who was disbarred last year over working with Trump to challenge the 2020 election.\n\nâPeople who have used this tool against people like John or President Trump have to be prosecuted by Republican or conservative DAs in exactly the same way, for exactly the same kinds of things, until they stop,â said Berkeley Law professor John Yoo.\n\nâI donât say that we should be the mafia,â said Will Chamberlain, a senior counsel at the Article III Project whoâd formerly worked for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. âBut as a political party, if we arenât willing to dish anything out, then we can just expect to keep taking it.â\n\nThe debate in Atlanta had thrown Democrats into a party-wide panic â and made Republicans more confident than ever of a Trump restoration. And that mood permeated the National Conservatism conference, organized by movement thinkers whose populist politics were brought from the fringe to the White House in 2016.\n\nThe MAGA thinkers, policy entrepreneurs, and conservative activists who gathered on Monday were over the moon about Trumpâs odds of victory and completely unbothered by Trumpâs recent efforts to distance himself from their agenda. They expected to return to power soon, assume influential positions in the administration, and use the federal government to punish their political enemies as harshly as their interpretation of the law would allow.\n\nIn this article:\n\nAs NatCon kicked off, Trump and his campaign were moving to separate the candidate from the conservatives whose rhetoric might worry swing voters.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump wrote on Truth Social that he knew ânothingâ about Project 2025, the Heritage Foundationâs plan to staff and craft executive actions for a second Trump administration â led by policymakers who worked for Trump and saw him stymied by bureaucrats. On Monday, the Republican National Committee rammed through a revised platform that dropped specific language about abortion and entitlement reform that Trump disagreed with, and that the campaign saw as politically risky.\n\nNone of that worried the crowds at the Capital Hilton. Trump administration veterans mingled with conservative writers and think tankers who had conquered the old âBush-Romneyâ Republican Party. When Joe Biden was mentioned at all, he was a punchline. When Trump was mentioned, he was a conquering hero whoâd have a confident, well-trained movement behind him next year.\n\nâTrump comes back in January, Iâll be on his heels coming back, and I will run the biggest deportation force this country has ever seen,â said former ICE director Tom Homan at a panel on immigration policy. âThey ainât seen shit yet. Wait until 2025.â\n\nStephen Miller, a Trump policy advisor whoâd spent the Biden years suing to stop race-conscious programs in the public and private sector, indicted the Democratic Party in a conspiracy to âhide the fact that Joe Biden is a mental vegetative state.â Biden had let the country be ârun by secret unnamed Democrat Party interests and staffers for three and a half years, as we inched closer to World War III.â But that party was about to lose the election.\n\nâThis is the first conservative conference in memory where we can look around at our country and the world and say: Weâre winning,â said Rachel Bovard, a vice president at the Conservative Partnership Institute, founded in the first year of the Trump administration to train the growing MAGA movement. âNational conservatives are and must be constitutionalists. But for the constitution to matter again â ever, at all â the right must be prepared to fight on the leftâs absolute terms.â\n\nProject 2025 itself was rarely mentioned, but Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts repeatedly praised Trump in his remarks to the conference, saying the media had worked to discredit and destroy him, alongside leftists who âimagined themselves the founding fathers and mothers, with varying pronouns.â In 2024, Trump was in a position to save America, with a conservative movement that heâd ârevivedâ since he âcame down that escalatorâ in 2015.\n\nâLibertarians may not like populism, but the leftâs new America will erase individual freedom altogether,â said Roberts. âNeo-cons may not like the new rightâs prudent foreign policy, but the only alternative are those Death to America chants at pro-Hamas rallies.â\n\nThere were disagreements at the conference; Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley used a Monday night speech to defend âChristian nationalism,â while warning that some advocates for the idea had gone too far by pining for a âprotestant Francoâ and âblood and soilâ totalitarianism. The country could be saved without that, and Trumpâs criticism of Project 2025 wasnât a real impediment to the mission.\n\nâIâm not too worried about it,â said Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies. âIt was Trump asserting that heâs the one in charge of his own operation.â\n\nDemocrats are trying to shove the mediaâs klieg lights off of Biden and onto Trumpâs conservative movement. Their bet: Voters are deeply worried about the presidentâs age, but not ready to hand America over to the sort of right-wing populism thatâs advanced in Europe and dominated the Biden-era GOP.\n\nBut Republicans havenât been in such a strong position, this close to the election, in a very long time. At this point in Trumpâs two prior campaigns, he trailed Hillary Clinton and Biden in public polls. Not since 2000, when Al Gore was facing a reinvigorated GOP and losing votes on his left to Ralph Nader, has a GOP nominee led in polls after the Fourth of July holiday.\n\nConservatives see a generational chance at victory here, and Trumpâs public squeamishness about some of their ideas doesnât bother them. Even some anti-abortion groups that wanted the party to keep their language in the platform shrugged when it was removed; as written, the platform subtly encourages states to grant constitutional rights to the unborn.\n\nThis article originally referred to a Heritage Foundation booth that went unstaffed. While no one manned the booth during some of the conferenceâs session breaks, a spokesman for the think tank said it was staffed both days.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nAs soon as Joe Biden stumbled over his words in a Latino outreach call â saying either that Trump supporters, or a single Trump supporter, were âthe only garbage I see floating out thereâ â Republicans knew how to respond.\n\nâRemember Hillary,â Trump said at a Tuesday night rally in Allentown, Pa. âShe said âdeplorable.ââ\n\nThe furor over Bidenâs quote, a mangled reference to roast comic Tony Hinchcliffe calling Puerto Rico a âfloating pile of garbageâ at Trumpâs Madison Square Garden rally, fit into a tradition as long as two presidential terms.\n\nSince Sep. 9, 2016, when Hillary Clinton told donors in New York that âhalfâ of Trumpâs supporters fit âinto what I call the basket of deplorables,â Democrats have feared saying something that could be interpreted as a smug insult to Republican voters. And Republicans have rarely wasted an opportunity to interpret it that way.\n\nâThe same party that called Republicans deplorables and fascists has now decided that weâre garbage,â wrote Nebraska Sen. Deb Fischer on X, demanding an apology from her opponent, independent union organizer Dan Osborn.\n\nâAdd this to the âbasket of deplorablesâ and ânaziâ slurs against Americans,â wrote Missouri Sen. Eric Schmitt.\n\nThe White House attempted to clean up Bidenâs remarks before most Republicans had reacted to them. âI referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trumpâs supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage,â Biden posted on his official X account. Talking with reporters on Wednesday, Vice President Kamala Harris quickly distanced herself from the quotes, saying that she âstrongly disagree[d] with any criticism of people based on who they vote for.â\n\nFifty minutes after her statement, the Trump campaign texted donors a message in the voice of JD Vance, saying âit pissed me off when Biden called you garbage,â and that âKamalaâs silence is worse.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nStart with the obvious: Democrats would rather be talking about Harrisâs closing message and a good GDP report today, but Biden put them on clean-up duty. Harrisâs quick response, made as soon as she saw cameras on Wednesday morning, shows how much Democrats learned after the âdeplorablesâ moment eight years ago. Rather than dwelling on what Biden meant, theyâre emphasizing they donât agree with it. Without more oxygen, this whole story could be over by sunset, filed away like Biden telling New Hampshire Democrats last week that they needed to âlock [Trump] upâ¦ politically.â (If youâd never heard about this, thatâs my point.)\n\nIf it does last, itâll be because of one of the great successes in modern conservative messaging: Making Democrats eat their words if they say something insulting about non-Democrats.\n\nThe modern version of this began in April 2008, when Barack Obama told California donors, who were unhappy that he wasnât winning the Pennsylvania primary, that people in some left-behind towns âcling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arenât like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment.â This lived on as proof that Obama (who performed better in rural areas than any Democratic nominee since) loathed small-town America. The âdeplorablesâ moment was even more powerful, embraced instantly by the Trump campaign, which has looked for similar-sounding lines ever since.\n\nBidenâs gaffe is missing some of the elements that powered those stories. Obama and Clinton were talking to donors, making their analysis sound even more patronizing. Heâs also not the nominee anymore; Republicans have tried to blur this by insisting that Harris, who said she disagrees with Biden, actually does agree with him.\n\nTheir confidence comes from experience. Announcing that something is âthe new deplorablesâ has been pretty effective, at least at freezing a news cycle. In April 2020, after Biden told donors that he probably couldnât win diehard Trump voters â âthere are people who support the president because they like the fact that he is engaged in the politics of divisionâ â the Trump campaign claimed that he was âcondescendingly describing them all as deplorable racist xenophobes.â One year later, after Biden said that Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves was engaged in âneanderthal thinking,â Reeves insisted that heâd heard an echo of Clintonâs gaffe.\n\nâToday I feel the same way as I did the day that Hillary Clinton called all of us in Middle America âdeplorables,ââ Reeves said.\n\nThe outrage machine could be turned on anyone. Last year, after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said that conservatives should be rooted in principles, and not âlistless vessels that are just supposed to follow whatever happens to come down the pike on Truth Social,â Trumpâs campaign claimed that heâd a Clinton-style gaffe. âLooks like Ron DeSanctimonious just had his âBasket of Deplorablesâ moment,â Trump strategist Jason Miller said. DeSantis denied it, but dropped that line.\n\nHarris has been far more careful than Trumpâs other opponents. Thatâs not surprising; her campaign team includes Clinton 2016 veterans scarred from touching the âdeplorablesâ stove. Several times, sheâs navigated around questions designed to clarify whether she dislikes Trump voters. In her Fox News interview this month, Bret Baier pressed Harris on why, if Trump was âas bad as you say,â so many voters still supported him.\n\nâAre they misguided, the 50%?â Baier asked. âAre they stupid? What is it?â\n\nHarris didnât take this bait. âI would never say that about the American people,â she said, adding that Trump was âthe one who tends to demean and belittle and diminish the American people.â\n\nIf Bidenâs mistake doesnât impact the race, this will be why. Harris is too careful to make it herself. And sheâs the one on the ballot.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "Trump cuts $3B from congressional deal he hated\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nPresident Donald Trump is cutting nearly $3 billion in spending, much of it reserved for foreign aid, by unwinding part of a 2023 fiscal deal loathed by conservatives, three senior White House officials told Semafor.\n\nTrump is slashing from a pot of money deemed emergency spending by the 2023 Fiscal Responsibility Act, which capped federal spending but also included a side deal criticized by Trump and his allies. One element of the 2023 lawâs side deal allowed for more than $12 billion in emergency spending for this year, but Trump is effectively deeming about a quarter of that as outside the scope of any emergency.\n\nOne of the White House officials said Trump was acting âunilaterallyâ by exercising his discretion over whether spending does indeed constitute an emergency. His decision will be communicated to Congress officially in the form of a presidential memo.\n\nRoughly $2.5 billion of the $2.9 billion in cancelled spending would have gone to foreign aid, including migration and refugee assistance for nongovernmental organizations as well as economic development money slated for Moldova and Georgia. The move does not affect military assistance to nations like Ukraine.\n\nThe cuts will also target diversity, equity, and inclusion projects.\n\nIn this article:\n\nItâs clear that the White House has been waiting to unravel leftover spending from the 2023 debt ceiling fight. The Office of Management and Budget is now run by Russ Vought, who opposed the Fiscal Responsibility Act forged by former Rep. Kevin McCarthy.\n\nMcCarthyâs speakership eventually imploded, in part thanks to angst over his handling of spending issues.\n\nVought is soon to be joined by deputy budget director nominee Dan Bishop, a former congressman who criticized McCarthy over the 2023 law. Bishop is expected to be confirmed by the Senate later this month.\n\nTheir office made the case to Trump to ax the spending, though the president had always hated the 2023 law.\n\nA second of the three White House officials called the Fiscal Responsibility Actâs side deals the âworst aspectâ of the law, describing them as a âshell gameâ designed to avoid spending caps.\n\nâItâs not the way to proceed,â added the second White House official, who said some of the foreign aid money is ânot well-vetted, is not well considered. In fact, not only is it not an emergency, but itâs probably some of the lowest-priority spending that you could identify.â\n\nThe remaining roughly $9.4 billion in designated emergency spending that the 2023 law allotted will remain in place.\n\nTrumpâs move comes after Congress earlier this month passed a government funding plan that runs through Sept. 30, a law that continued some of the side deals from two years ago. The 2023 law raised the debt ceiling and tried to cap spending while also allowing some spending outside the caps.\n\nBeyond Voughtâs ascension, Trumpâs attack on the 2023 law was foreseeable for another reason: Heâs maximizing his presidential authority to reshape government on multiple fronts and scuttle what remains of the Biden presidency.\n\nDemocrats who vocally opposed last weekâs spending plan, in fact, are still worried that it will give him even more sway to reorganize government spending. And Hill Republicans are hopeful the Trump administration will send its spending cuts to the Capitol for Congress to vote on later this year.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Congressional Republicans bristle at Trumpâs tariffs\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nNow that President Donald Trumpâs tariff threats have become reality, Republican lawmakers are bristling â and expecting a flurry of requests for exemptions.\n\nMany in the GOP had gone along with Trumpâs tariff talk when it was hypothetical, but his new 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico caused alarm and resignation on the Hill on Tuesday, as Republicans warned of rising costs and economic harm.\n\nAsked what he thought of the tariffs, Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson deadpanned: âWhat does the stock market think of them? That tells you something.â\n\nâThe White House explanation that we were given is all about stopping the drug flow. I donât know what heâs expecting Mexico and Canada to do. I think both countries could do a lot more, but I also know that we interdict just a fraction of what gets in here,â Johnson told Semafor. âI do know the harm itâs going to cause the economy, and the stock market is showing it.â\n\nUS markets declined for a second straight day as Trumpâs new levies on Mexico, Canada and China took effect. While some conservatives are defending his administrationâs rationale for squeezing trading partners that Trump sees as taking advantage of the US, the consequences for the presidentâs party could be steep: If a prolonged trade war spikes prices, Republicansâ much-touted tax cut package may have far less impact.\n\nThe White House is offering mixed messages in defense of the tariffs. Peter Navarro, Trumpâs senior counselor for trade and manufacturing, argued that they represented America âdefendingâ itself amid a fentanyl crisis. Trump counselor Alina Habba, meanwhile , pointed to unfair trade tactics as the reason during a brief conversation with reporters.\n\nBut even as Navarro has blamed the Biden administration for persistent inflation â while saying the economy âis in good shapeâ because of Trump â clear worries persist.\n\nTrump will have the chance to address those concerns during a joint address to Congress on Tuesday night. One arcane but important wrinkle is that businesses hit by the tariffs are expected to flood the administration, and Republican lawmakers, with requests for waivers from them.\n\nAsked if he was happy with the tariffs, free-trader Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, responded: âYou know my philosophy, so I donât have to answer that question.â\n\nâIâm sure that offices are going to be hit with a lot of requests for waivers, but itâs just that you canât draw any conclusions now,â Grassley said.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said he hopes the tariffs are temporary because ânothing happens in a vacuum. Thereâs always a reaction to actions that are taken.â\n\nAnd Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, aired similar hopes that the tariffs are âshort-lived,â while underscoring his agreement with the Trump administrationâs border security priorities.\n\nTrump has made progress cutting the number of illegal crossings on the southern US border, in part because his first round of tariff threats led to an increased military presence from Mexico.\n\nâPresident Trump has generally been using them as a tool in the toolbox to effectuate a positive outcome. Where itâs been used elsewhere so far, it seems to have worked â the threat, that is,â said Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa.\n\nAs for the actual imposition of the tariffs, he added, âWeâll have to see what the economic response is to determine whether it was a smart play or not.â\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, told Semafor that âif I wereâ Canada and Mexico, âIâd be asking the question â¦ âWhat more do you want from us?ââ\n\nWhite House deputy press seceretary Kush Desai said in a statement: âTariffs have proven to be an effective tool to bring reluctant countries to the negotiating table, and they remain a necessary measure to protect Americans in this drug war.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nQuite a few Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, were unruffled by the tariffsâ potential impact on Tuesday.\n\nPart of the reason for that quieter pushback: Trumpâs 10-year war on party orthodoxy means that there are simply fewer free-traders left in office to complain during his second term.\n\nRep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas, who was elected in 2020, said âAmerica has been taking it in the shortsâ and that he can get behind tariffs in response.\n\nBut Nehls also said that he supported private-sector efforts to seek waivers exempting certain products. One example: employers who visited his district office to talk about sourcing the cranes that lift cargo containers along the Houston Ship Channel.\n\nâThese cranes are made in China; I donât think thereâs an American company that makes them,â Nehls said. âWe can talk to President Trump and his team about some of the second- and third- order effects of some of these tariffs.â\n\nHeâs not alone. Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah, said every conversation he has with the administration on tariffs is about relief for small businesses. Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., said he expected requests for tariff exemptions covering products that arenât even produced in the US, like the cranes in Nehlsâ district.\n\nAs Congress sits inert, Democrats are growing irate at what they see as an unforgivable failure by Hill Republicans to check the executive branch.\n\nThey want their GOP colleagues to invite Trump administration officials to testify about the tariff strategy and are frustrated that hasnât happened.\n\nâIâm trying not to be unduly vitriolic, but why the hell isnât Congress asking these questions? Why canât we get a single Republican to say, âLetâs subpoena the people. If you claim you have a strategy, come and tell us what that strategy is,ââ Rep. Sean Casten, D-Ill., said. âDo your job.â\n\nTrump won a second term in part thanks to his perceived advantage in handling the economy and lowering prices. He clearly sees tariffs as a negotiating tool to get concessions from other countries on issues like border control.\n\nIf the new tariffs stay in effect too long, however, prices could rise and cut into any other economic gains made during Trumpâs presidency.\n\nLike his standoff with Ukraine, Republican lawmakers are largely trusting Trumpâs acumen given his track record of using tariffs as a bargaining tactic. If the tariffs persist, perhaps Republicans will reach their limits. But despite their alarm on Tuesday, that hasnât happened yet.\n\nâIâm literally trying to give him the room that he needs to be able to finish the negotiation, just knowing from history what heâs trying to be able to accomplish,â said Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla.\n\nParticularly optimistic Republicans are not only unconvinced that the tariffs will cause economic pain â they also expect that affected companies will absorb the higher costs instead of raising their prices.\n\nSome GOP lawmakers even see Trumpâs first round of tariffs as proof that the inflationary risk posed by the tariffs isnât real, pointing to the effect of his first-term tariffs on a narrower swath of imports.\n\nâEveryone was like, âOh my God, thereâs going to be inflationâ â there was none,â Rep. Dan Meuser, R-Pa., said. âThere will be a soft landing.â\n\nTrump himself argues that tariffs will ultimately benefit the US by forcing companies to bring manufacturing back home, as well; that could take years.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "How Conservatives Changed the Whole Point of American Political Parties\n\nT he Republican Party of 2024 belongs to Donald Trump and to MAGA. But the populist right once viewed the GOP very differently.\n\nAt the second annual Conservative Political Action Conference in 1975, attendees debated whether they should junk and replace the GOP. One speaker advocating for the move called parties \"no more than instruments, temporary and disposable, by which like-minded citizens can express their views.\" The conference passed a resolution declaring that \"the question of our allegiance to [the two major] political parties is a matter of increasing doubt to conservatives.\"\n\nThough a proposed third-party venture went nowhere fast, it reflected the right's distinctive, cold-eyed approach to the party form. Parties, conservatives thought, served solely as a disposable means to an end, rather than as valuable organizations and instruments of democracy in their own right. And when the forces on the right captured and remade the GOP in their own image beginning in the 1970s, the result was a retreat from the very commitments that had made political parties central pillars of small-d democratic and small-r republican politics. In that sense, the crisis roiling American democracy in 2024 is a half-century in the making.\n\nAs conservatives transformed the GOP, they obliterated an older model of Republicanism. In the middle of the 20th century, GOP organizations at their best had functioned as civic institutions rooted in communities. Conservative in form as much as substance, they focused on problem-solving in government, and worked to contain and channel political conflict rather than exacerbating it. Such Republican Party organizations reflected the interests and stewardship of local social and economic elites. The political scientist Clinton Rossiter evoked the \"Republican self-image\" at midcentury as \"men of standing and sobriety...sound without being callous.\"\n\nParty politics, in this approach, meant organizing social actors into tempered, pragmatic leadership, not serving up grand clashes of worldviews or all-out warfare across social divides. As such, Republican party work and governance emphasized limits in both the exercise of politics and the activity of government.\n\nRay Bliss, longtime Ohio Republican leader - and then in the 1960s, Republican National Committee chair-typified this approach. To build up GOP organizations, he would cross-check voter registration rolls with membership lists for service clubs like the Kiwanis and Rotarians, chambers of commerce, and country clubs. Averse to ideological infighting or even explicit comment on policy issues, Bliss summed up his own vision of Republicanism in power in 1960: \"government which is efficient, yet economical; government that is alert to the changing times, yet guided by common sense; government which is compassionate to the needs of the people, yet wise in the execution of programs to meet those needs.\"\n\nRising conservative activists disdained this approach as both milquetoast and politically ineffective. Seeing politics as fundamentally rooted in conflict, they moved to exploit grievance and status resentments-\"knowing who hates who,\" as the future Nixon aide Kevin Phillips had put it in 1968-to polarize politics.\n\nOrganizational changes to politics in the 1970s set the stage for that approach to overtake the older model of parties. Interest groups, think tanks, and lobbying shops encroached on the activity of both major political parties while a new campaign finance system channeled money outside of the party apparatuses. As the formal Republican Party's clout waned, outside groups ranging from the National Conservative Political Action Committee (NCPAC) to the National Right to Work Committee to the Moral Majority filled the breach. And even as they swamped the traditional party from the outside, conservative activists also used this network of groups to remake the GOP from the precinct level up. \"Conservatism is the wine,\" William Rusher, publisher of National Review , liked to say, \"the GOP is the bottle.\"\n\nConservative leaders like Rusher and Paul Weyrich saw how this burgeoning political infrastructure offered the opportunity to forge a new conservative electoral coalition. They aimed to capitalize on the growing resentments among white Americans over social and cultural issues ranging from legalized abortion to busing children to achieve racially integrated schools. Working together, a range of outside groups could mobilize the rising resentment and supplant the GOP establishment. In 1972, Weyrich launched weekly strategy meetings that would grow to include staffers from political groups like NCPAC, religious right groups, and business groups like the National Association of Manufacturers. Where conservatives had once eyed one another with suspicion, they now had a template for cooperation.\n\nThe activists' most critical move was recruiting disgruntled white evangelicals, especially in the South-most of them former Democrats-into the conservative fold. The fervid language of sexual morality had long colored conservative politics. Now it came tethered to new issues and networks. A deacon in the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, Weyrich always attached deep importance to abortion and homosexuality-and saw early on how they could bring together Catholics and (white) evangelicals.\n\nEventually, Christian Right pastors would deploy the same tactics as Weyrich and his fellow activists to mobilize resentment. \"We need an emotionally charged issue to stir people up and get them mad enough to get up from watching TV and do something,\" Bob Billings of the newly launched Moral Majority explained. \"I believe that the homosexual issue is the issue we should use.\" Especially on these cultural issues, women like the Catholic Phyllis Schlafly and the Evangelical Beverly LaHaye also contributed to the explosion of outside conservative groups.\n\nThis activism took advantage of the new post-Watergate limits on individual contributions to formal parties and candidates. Those restrictions opened up space for political action committees (PACs), which could rake in big money from small-dollar donors motivated to give by sensationalist direct mail focused on hot button cultural issues. NCPAC's chairman Terry Dolan cheerfully prophesied a politics unmoored from the lines of accountability that had long restrained parties and candidates alike. \"A group like ours could lie through its teeth,\" he said in 1980, \"and the candidate it helps stays clean.\"\n\nOne moment epitomized the clash between dueling visions of political action. At a testy breakfast on May 19, 1981, Richard Richards, chair of the Republican National Committee, confronted a who's who from the right, ranging from Dolan, Weyrich, and Schlafly to the billionaire oilman and John Birch Society member Bunker Hunt. Richards, a conservative but tradition-minded political operative, complained about the independent groups making mischief where the GOP did not want them. Their lavish advertising campaigns and repeated interventions in primaries usurped the traditional roles of the party. They were, Richards scolded, like \"loose cannonballs on the deck of a ship.\"\n\nNonsense, responded John Lofton, editor of the Conservative Digest. If he attacked those fighting hardest for Ronald Reagan and his tax cuts, it was Richards himself who was the loose cannonball.\n\nRichards was a more doctrinaire conservative than earlier party chairmen like Bliss. But he continued to hew to the classic organizational model, with its lines of accountability and authority, that had defined the political party for a century and a half. \"If I'm the chairman of the party and I have responsibility for a campaign in a given area,\" he argued, \"I don't want someone else coming in and interfering with my strategy.\" Richards later attempted to forge a \"non-interference agreement\" by which conservative organizations would pledge to stay out of races where Republican candidates or state chairs asked them to stand down.\n\nNCPAC rejected the request-and deemed Richards's complaints the purist of establishment claptrap. Dolan asserted that party operatives \"don't give a damn what registered Republicans think.\" They cared only \"about their contributors.\" The truth was that now that the right had its own machinery, financial clout, and connection with GOP base voters, formal parties were in no position to make demands.\n\nOver the ensuing decades, as the right's issues became the party's, so did its operatives, activists, and political approach. Thus did the conservative loose cannonballs come eventually to dominate the GOP-and define our disordered political era.\n\nParties at their best safeguard democracy, linking the governed with their government and instilling norms of forbearance. When parties fall short of those virtues, democracy itself is threatened. As the right has moved from Tea Party to MAGA in recent years, its longstanding mercenary, win-at-all-costs approach has shifted in disturbing new directions, dismissing not just the authority of political parties, but the very project of building electoral majorities themselves. Consumed by apocalyptic fears of a changing American electorate, Republicans have turned to and relied on the features of the American political system that frustrate popular majorities: the courts, the malapportioned Senate with its 60-vote filibuster rule, gerrymandering, and a politicized voting process.\n\nPerhaps the signal moment for the impulse that began to break down the traditional controls on American politics in the 1970s came with the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection. With mob violence, the right all-but-openly declared that electoral victories by the enemy did not count and countenanced any measures necessary to stop them. The fundamental criterion of democracy, that the losers accept their losses and fight again, no longer held-just another fetter to discard, as \"temporary and disposable\" as the fetters of party.\n\nDaniel Schlozman is associate professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University.

In 2018 he was awarded the Presidential rank of Distinguished Executive in the Senior Executive Service.\n\nT he U.S. government is in the middle of a dramatic and dangerous shift in foreign policy away from Ukraine (and our NATO allies ) and toward Russia in the war between the two countries. In doing so, the Trump Administration and its supporters are potentially shifting the balance of power on the battlefield in Europe's deadliest conflict since World War II. The consequences for America's interests abroad are colossal and possibly catastrophic. But just as troubling-perhaps even more so-is what it reveals about changing values at home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Trump Administration voted against a UN resolution condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine and supporting Ukraine's territorial integrity and President Donald Trump derided President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. Though the Trump Administration recently announced it will resume military aid to Ukraine, the fundamental dangers of a shift towards Russia remain, as Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss Russia's numerous ceasefire conditions in a closed-door meeting at the Kremlin Thursday evening.\n\nThe shift is a victory for one ideological camp in a deeply divided Republican Party. I witnessed firsthand the last time this fight played out over military aid to Ukraine in 2019, and know from personal experience what is at stake. As the senior career civil servant overseeing defense, intelligence, and veterans' programs at the Office of Management and Budget during the first Trump Administration, I was asked to sign off on a hold on military aid to Ukraine, similar to that recently imposed by Trump. Back then, in part thanks to principled conservatives in the Administration and in Congress, the Administration relented and released the aid after details about the hold in assistance began to emerge. Ultimately, this lead to the President's first impeachment .\n\nThis time, however, the shift from Ukraine toward Russia is being embraced by key political allies of Trump who have long claimed to be staunch conservatives. For instance, while House Speaker Mike Johnson has said it is \" absurd \" to claim Republicans support Putin, his own critiques against Zelensky are telling. What is underway is not just forsaking Ukraine in favor of Russia, it is an acceptance of unprovoked aggression and documented , horrific war crimes and an abandonment of conservative principles by politicians who are revealing themselves to be \"Conservative\" Republicans in Name Only (CRINOs).\n\nNot long ago these CRINOs stood firm behind conservative principles. Congressman and now House Speaker Johnson has listed seven core principles of conservatism including individual freedom, peace through strength, and human dignity. He emphasizes the importance of America's \"moral leadership in an increasingly dangerous world,\" noting that \"weakness invites aggression.\"\n\nThose values were widely touted by Republicans, including by President Trump himself during his first term. One need only read President Trump's own 2017 National Security Strategy to see that at work. In it, Trump pledged to pursue \"a world of strong, sovereign, and independent nations, each with its own cultures and dreams\" and promised to \"never lose sight of our values and their capacity to inspire, uplift, and renew.\" Trump's strategy argued that \"the revisionist powers of China and Russia\" wanted to \"shape a world antithetical to U.S. values and interests\" with an aim to \"weaken U.S. influence in the world and divide us from our allies and partners.\" Moreover, the Trump strategy argued, \"Russia is using subversive measures to weaken the credibility of America's commitment to Europe, undermine transatlantic unity, and weaken European institutions and governments. With its invasions of Georgia and Ukraine, Russia demonstrated its willingness to violate the sovereignty of states in the region.\"\n\nNow, instead, President Trump has praised Russian President Putin, calling him a \" genius \" and Ukrainian President Zelensky a \" dictator .\" And his Administration temporarily paused military assistance to Ukraine and suspended crucial intelligence sharing-even though Russia continues to launch deadly strikes. Many CRINOs have essentially adopted Russian talking points, refusing to acknowledge Russia alone is to blame for starting the war, and not defending Ukraine's sovereignty. The Trump Administration has effectively adopted a strategy of appeasement toward Russia, and too many Republicans in Congress who used to proclaim their ardent defense of democracy and vehement opposition to tyrants around the globe have now adopted their own policy of appeasement of the President.\n\nRepublicans may argue they are not abandoning Ukraine, or their values, by pursuing a peace deal acceptable to Russia. But any deal that does not restore and protect Ukraine's territorial integrity does just that.\n\nTo conserve means to protect from harm or destruction. We need true conservatives to protect unalienable rights, fundamental values, and America's moral leadership abroad. We also need true conservatives, many of whom proclaim their adherence to Christian values, to abide by their values at home for reasons that go well beyond foreign policy.\n\nRepublican leaders' adoption of talking points on Ukraine that repeat Russian disinformation is just one example of how abandoning values abroad threatens democracy at home. The ninth commandment instructs us not to bear false witness. As Speaker Johnson's own conservative principle of human dignity aptly states, \"every person should be measured only by the content of their character.\" What is the character of those who bear false witness and favor Russia's tyrannical lies over Ukrainians' unalienable rights?\n\nThe Ukrainians are fighting for their lives, their liberty, and what should be our shared values of standing up to unprovoked invasions and subversive assaults by Russia. It is crucial for America's vital interests that we support the Ukrainians in their fight. As the failures of appeasement have shown before, if we fail to continue to support Ukraine now, we could embolden not only Russia's aggression in Europe but also China's aggression vis-a-vis Taiwan and the South China Sea.\n\nJust as worrying are the consequences of self-proclaimed conservatives abandoning the values they claim to hold dear. When we become a country where political leaders claim to uphold a set of values while acting to undermine them, we have truly lost a key pillar of what has made America great. At home and abroad, America needs true conservatives, not CRINOs.\n\n© 2025 TIME USA, LLC. All Rights Reserved.

      "text": "America Is Failing in the Present While Conservatives Try to Rewrite the Past\n\n\"What do you mean I need to wear a mask outdoors today?\" my kid asked.\n\nI pointed at the front yard. \"See that haze? It's from a bunch of wildfires up north. The air's not safe to breathe today.\"\n\n\"Ugh.\" they spluttered. \"America.\"\n\nTheir sibling, listening in from the couch, yelled, \"No. Ugh- humans .\"\n\nMy kids are typical for their cohort. By almost any measure, today's young Americans are pessimists. Polls show that they have a jaded view of the country, its leaders, its economy , and its public institutions .\n\nConservative political leaders have noticed. They allege that U.S. public schools cultivate American students' pessimism by offering them a too-critical version of our common history. If kids learn about the enslaved humans held by America's marble-statued founding fathers, if they learn the full breadth of our country's cruelties against Native Americans-the thinking goes-they will correspondingly lose faith in the promise of American democracy's future.\n\nThis isn't just rhetoric: conservative political leaders across the country are actively trying to ban curricula they believe undermines young Americans' patriotism from public school classrooms. PEN America's database of \" educational gag orders \" from the past two years includes hundreds of laws, executive orders, and proposed bills aiming to narrow how much children know about the sins of America's past.\n\nTo be sure, public schools should prepare children to participate actively and willingly in U.S. civic life, and that requires helping them recognize genuine accomplishments of U.S. democratic institutions. But that project is less about the past than it is about the present. See, as my kids age, I've found it relatively straightforward to talk them through things like the gap between Thomas Jefferson's professed ideals and his enslavement of humans. But I've found it comparatively impossible to explain present-day American incoherence on gun violence, climate change, and so much more.\n\nIt's worth asking: how much propaganda about the American past would it take to overwhelm children's honest experiences of the American present? How shiny must we polish our old glories to get kids to look past the fact that they cannot safely breathe outdoors today?\n\nSee, the real problem is not that U.S. kids are being \"a-wokened\" by radical school curricula that teach them to hate America. The real problem is that young Americans are experiencing cascading national crises that their country seems unable to confront. Their cynicism has been hard earned, and it begins with circumstances: they've lived through a catastrophic global pandemic, a violent and tawdry transition of power in 2021, increasingly visible evidence of brutal-even deadly-racial injustice from police, escalating environmental crises, and a metronomic march of school shootings.\n\nBut their gloomy view of the country is unquestionably deepened by bearing daily witness to the U.S.' collective failure to respond. Mass shootings happen regularly in the United States- and nowhere else . The policy solutions to this problem are relatively simple -we need tighter restrictions on more lethal weaponry like assault rifles, fewer guns in general, and a much more comprehensive and accessible mental health system. Our leaders know these solutions. Many recite them-and summarily introduce bills in Congress to pursue them-each time U.S. children are slain on campus.\n\nAnd yet, our response usually culminates at \"thoughts and prayers.\" Solutions to the U.S. gun violence epidemic are routinely, predictably blocked by conservatives-those same conservatives, incidentally, who are worried that U.S. children may lose faith in America if they are taught truthful history.\n\nThis is just one example of many. The scientific consensus warning about the dire impacts of climate change is decades old . When I was a child in the 1980s and 1990s, the impacts were mostly looming-and thereby invisible to my peers and me. But today's children are experiencing both the terrifying early waves of what's coming and conservatives' utter unwillingness to do anything about this. As supercharged storms batter vulnerable communities and winter snow never quite shows up on the East Coast , kids watch politicians pushing urgently to expand fossil fuel production and otherwise just screwing around .\n\nSilly season never ends. Baseless conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election now permeate U.S. daily political discourse. Conservatives continue their yearslong crusade against the imaginary scourge of voter fraud . Classified documents are turning up in social club bathrooms . George Santos was elected to Congress upon a foundation of falsehoods -and has found conservatives ready to shield him against accountability. The RAND Corporation has concluded that this sort of nonsense has left our country suffering from \" truth decay .\"\n\nIn other words, there's an immense gulf between the righteous, self-certain, swaggering American nationalist patriotism conservatives cherish-and the flailing, dysfunctional, all-but-delusional country that conservatives daily deliver to U.S. kids. Daily participation in American democracy currently requires an inordinate amount of make-believe. If some of us adults have gotten accustomed to accepting this incoherence as part of the American bargain, our kids are considerably less inspired to play along.\n\nThere's a common thread linking attempted censorship of the American past to our difficulties with improving the American present. It goes like this: nothing undermines the public's civic faith quite as much as the realization that public institutions haven't been telling the truth. That's true when conservatives force schools to hide uncomfortable facts about American slavery, the causes of the Civil War, the genocidal component of Manifest Destiny , and so forth. It's also true when conservatives insist-in the face of overwhelming evidence-that nothing can be done to make our air breathable or our schools safe from gun violence. In both cases, young Americans are being taught that theirs is a country that responds to difficulties by imagining them away.\n\nRebuilding their faith in the American experiment will, indeed, require some changes on campus. Again, conservatives are right to recognize U.S. public education's role in training citizens to be prepared to participate in a democracy. They are also right that this means fostering a shared understanding of the country we all inhabit, a U.S. narrative that links who we were to who we are now-and hints at the country we are on our way to becoming.\n\nBut that project is only possible if schools teach students the actual American story they are joining. Conservatives err by conceiving a too-narrow version of the country, a history concerned with defending the primacy and prestige of a handful of-mostly white, mostly male-characters.\n\nIt doesn't have to be this way. Earnest activists like Citizen University's Eric Liu have been pushing schools towards teaching a more comprehensive American story for the better part of a decade. As Liu put it in a 2015 Democracy Journal article , U.S. schools' core project is \"about raising the collective knowledge of all-and recognizing that the wealthy, white, and powerful also have blind spots and swaths of ignorance so broad as to keep them dangerously isolated from their countrymen.\"\n\nThat isolation is the pernicious consequence of telling American students a narrow version of our history. Children steeped in tales of states' rights and \"courtly\" Confederate generals' heroism will struggle to make sense of how the legacy of slavery shaped the Civil War, Jim Crow, the Civil Rights Era, and racial politics today. When we hide the realities of our history from kids, we leave them unprepared for the realities of our politics today.\n\nThat's why the cure to young Americans' cynicism fundamentally requires addressing present challenges. An honest accounting of the past will not singlehandedly produce patriotic young Americans. Kids' faith in U.S. democracy will hinge squarely upon whether or not democratic institutions deliver real solutions to today's big problems. No matter how heavily we propagandize about past American glories, we're not going to fool our kids-who can see American governing institutions failing them right here, right now.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "How to Make an Argument That's Actually Persuasive\n\nI n a fascinating experiment, researchers from Stanford and the University of Toronto examined how we try to persuade other people to change their minds . It involved roughly 200 people-half of whom identified themselves as politically liberal and half as conservative. The liberals were asked to write a few sentences to convince conservatives to support same-sex marriage . The conservatives were asked to write a few sentences to convince liberals to support English as the official language of the United States. What happened?\n\nAlmost everyone failed.\n\nAmong the liberals , the vast majority (74%) made their arguments for same-sex marriage by evoking values often favored by liberals , like fairness and equality. (For example, \"They deserve the same equal rights as other Americans.\") Only 9% of liberals appealed to conservatives with values often favored by conservatives, like loyalty and unity. (\"Our fellow citizens of the United States of America deserve to stand alongside us.\") Worse, a third of liberals (34%) also used arguments that contradicted values favored by conservatives, like the importance of faith. (\"Although you may personally believe your faith should be against such a thing . . . your religion should play no part in the laws of the United States.\") Talk about not reading the room!\n\nThe conservatives fared no better. The vast majority (70%) argued for English as the official language of the United States using values often favored by conservatives , like loyalty and unity. (For example, \"Making English the official language will help unify the country as we all can communicate with one another and speak the same national language.\") Only 8% of conservatives appealed to liberals with values favored by liberals, like fairness. (\"By making English our official language, there will be less racism and discrimination.\") And 14% of conservatives used arguments that contradicted values favored by liberals. (\"So those of you preaching diversity and equality, who think everyone should take advantage of us, should think real hard.\") Attacking your audience is . . . not persuasive.\n\nAt one time or another, we've all done it, whether at Thanksgiving dinner with our families or a community meeting with our neighbors. We often try to convince someone of something by using the arguments and appealing to the values that make sense to us . And other people do it right back to us. We talk past each other. \"Most people are not very good at appealing to other people's values,\" said Matthew Feinberg, a coauthor of the study and a professor of organizational behavior at the University of Toronto.\n\nWhich may also explain why sometimes the more we talk, the less likely we are to change the minds of people who see the world differently than we do. In another study, researchers asked hundreds of liberals to follow prominent conservatives on what was then Twitter and hundreds of conservatives to follow prominent liberals. Think anyone was persuaded? Of course not. In fact, after about a month, the conservatives were even more conservative in their beliefs and the liberals were even more liberal.\n\nWhy are we so bad at persuading people who see the world through different eyes?\n\nResearchers at the University of California Irvine have one possible answer. They argue that many of us have a \"moral empathy gap\"-we often fail to appreciate that other people have a different moral worldview than our own. \"Our inability to feel what others feel,\" the researchers explained, \"makes it difficult to understand how they think\"-which, in turn, makes it difficult to connect, communicate, and persuade.\n\nBut there's hope.\n\nSome social psychologists argue that we humans tend to see the world through several major prisms, or \"moral foundations.\" These foundations go something like this:\n\nCare/Harm-a focus on caring for and protecting others from harm.\n\nFairness/Cheating-an emphasis on equal treatment and an opposition to cheating.\n\nAuthority/Subversion-a deep respect for hierarchy and authority and a disapproval of subversion.\n\nLoyalty/Betrayal-devotion to family, community, and country, and a disdain for betrayal.\n\nSanctity/Degradation-a belief in upholding the sanctity of our bodies, institutions, and lives.\n\nLiberty/Oppression-an emphasis on independence and a rejection of oppression. Of course, these six moral foundations alone can't explain everyone's beliefs about every issue, and few of us identify with just one. Still, as you read through them, you may find yourself drawn more to certain ones. Consider yourself more progressive or liberal? You might gravitate toward care and fairness. More traditional or conservative in your views? You might see a lot to like with authority, loyalty, and sanctity. And whatever our ideological orientation, what's not to like about liberty? When I first learned about moral foundations after leaving the White House, where I worked as a speechwriter for President Obama from 2009 to 2017, it felt like an epiphany. I felt like I'd finally found the theory behind what I'd been practicing for decades in my work. Because, to me, \"moral foundations\" is another way of saying \"values,\" and values can help you build bridges with any audience, even in these polarized times .\n\nOne Saturday a few years ago, I spent the day in a church basement in Virginia listening to about a dozen Americans talk about their lives, their beliefs, and their country. Half identified themselves as conservative and half as liberal. As you'd expect, things got heated. Fast. Some people struggled to express themselves without disparaging the other side. A few folks fell back on familiar talking points they'd heard from politicians and TV pundits .\n\nBut there were also some surprises, which was the point. The meeting was convened by Braver Angels, a group devoted to helping Americans bridge partisan divides. Over seven hours of intense and emotionally exhausting conversations, some of these conservatives and liberals started to sound like . . . one another. Liberals proudly described their deep religious faith , their service in the military, and how they value family above all else. Conservatives said it was important for communities to welcome immigrants of all backgrounds and that America needs to be a place where people of all races and religions can thrive.\n\nAt times, these conservatives and liberals even used the exact same words to describe their beliefs and goals-\"the dignity of the individual . . . respect for all people . . . creating opportunity for more Americans to succeed.\"\n\n\"The other side,\" joked one person, \"was not as unreasonable as I expected.\"\n\nOf course, cherishing the same values can sometimes lead people to hold profoundly different opinions on specific issues. To many conservatives, \"freedom\" means freedom from excessive government regulation; to many liberals, it means a larger role for government in areas like education and health care to help people live their lives in freedom and security. To many conservatives, \"caring for others\" and \"protecting life\" means protecting the unborn from abortion; to many liberals, it means protecting the life and choices of the mother.\n\nStill, many of us fail to realize that, even as we disagree with one another on specific issues (sometimes vehemently), most people share our basic values. In one survey, Republicans and Democrats were asked about their own views and those of people in the other party. Less than a third of Democrats believed that Republicans think it's \"extremely or very important\" for Americans to learn from the past so the country can make progress. In fact, 91% of Republicans said they believe that. Likewise, only about a third of Republicans believed that Democrats think it's \"extremely or very important\" that government be accountable to the people. In fact, 90% of Democrats said they believe that.\n\nIt's true across other values as well. Roughly 90% of the people in the survey, Republicans and Democrats alike, said that personal responsibility, fair enforcement of the law, compassion, and respect across differences were important to them. What one person in that church basement in Virginia said seems to be true: \"We have sincere differences, but I think we're motivated by deeply shared principles.\"\n\nThat's the beauty and the power of appealing to values. Values can help us transcend the usual fault lines in our families, companies, and countries.\n\nWhich means the next time you get up to speak and try to connect with or persuade your audience-whether at Thanksgiving dinner or your town meeting-don't simply argue the points that make sense to you. Instead, try to speak to the broader, deeper values that matter most to your listeners and that, even in these divided times, can help us find some common ground in our families, our communities, and our country.\n\nAdapted excerpt from Say It Well: Find Your Voice, Speak Your Mind, Inspire Any Audience by Terry Szuplat.

      "text": "I Was a Liberal Who Worked at Fox News. Here's What That Taught Me About Arguing Politics\n\nI t may seem surprising for a liberal commentator like myself, but from 2010 to 2013, I worked in the most prominent den of American conservatism: Fox News . During my time at the network I came to realize how condescending I'd been in my views about not only the people who worked at Fox News but the people watching at home. And condescension is just a snooty form of prejudice; we are only condescending to those we feel are inherently beneath us. The more I got out of my own liberal bubble, the more I met other conservatives who were neither stupid nor hateful - or at least no more deliberately hateful than I was. Those experiences really challenged my biases and assumptions. I'm not saying that Sean Hannity is the nicest person on the planet; his political views are certainly not anywhere near what I would reasonably call nice. What I am saying is that I realized that the person I'd thought of as entirely cruel, as the caricature of a horrific right-wing monster, is actually caring and kind, and a good dad and a supportive friend. Including a supportive friend to me.\n\nEither way, the experience of getting to know and like many conservatives and at the same time receiving more and more hate mail from conservatives presented me with a choice. From here on out, was I going to believe that most conservatives were like the ones I'd worked with at Fox News, or was I going to assume that most conservatives were like the ones sending me hateful messages online? Which was the exception, and which was the rule? Honestly, I probably could have made a case either way. This was a decision that tested my core principles. I could either choose to hate most conservatives or not. I found my answer in my aunt Lucy.\n\nAunt Lucy has a deep love for her friends and family, a great sense of humor, and a laugh that feels like a tickle. Aunt Lucy (not her real name, by the way) lives in the middle of the country and is a conservative Republican. She also loves me and my partner and our daughter and welcomes us with open arms at every family occasion we manage to attend. The few times we've cautiously talked politics, Aunt Lucy has been curious and kind. Aunt Lucy watches Fox News, and eventually it dawned on me that most Fox viewers are probably just like her - decent, curious about the news, intending to learn and do something good with the information. I started to picture my aunt Lucy when I would go on Fox, and then when I would go on CNN , and even when I would respond to people on Twitter. It made it easier for me to think and talk and act from a place of kindness, not hate - to not stereotype the invisible people on the other side of those screens but instead to imagine my aunt Lucy, someone I love and respect.\n\nFor me, it's infinitely more encouraging, not to mention more effective, to treat conservatives as a bunch of Aunt Lucys instead of a cache of trolls or a \"basket of deplorables.\" Nobody is going to engage in a constructive dialogue with me if they think I believe they're a bridge-dwelling gnome or a totable pile of rot.\n\nPeople often ask me how they can talk to their conservative relatives at family gatherings like Thanksgiving. I actually have a handy tool, taught to me by Matt Kohut and John Neffinger, authors of the book Compelling People , as well as their colleague Seth Pendleton, with whom I've worked leading media trainings and public-speaking workshops.\n\nImagine my aunt Lucy says something about how she doesn't mean to be anti-immigrant or anything, but the economy is just really bad right now and we don't have enough jobs for the people who are already here. Now, my natural instinct is to argue: \"No, you're wrong, and let me explain the three reasons why!\" But what we know from neuroscience is that while we all need to use our frontal lobes to engage in a reasoned discussion - and to be open to persuasion - when we perceive an argument coming, our frontal lobes shut down and the fight-or-flight part of our brain turns on (the part of the brain, as we'll see later, that also holds our biases and stereotypes). If we want to keep the possibility of persuasion open, we have to stay conversational. Also, in her statement, my aunt Lucy isn't expressing cold hard facts so much as she's expressing a feeling about the facts as she understands them. And as every good couples counselor I've ever been to has told me, you can't argue with feelings. If my partner says I hurt her feelings, I can't say, \"No, I didn't!\" They're her feelings - and they're inherently valid by virtue of her feeling them.\n\nSo instead of arguing, here's a tip, which uses the shorthand ABC. The A stands for \"affirm.\" First, you find a feeling that you can genuinely affirm. In this hypothetical conversation with my aunt Lucy, I might say, \"I'm also really worried about the economy right now.\" Or, \"I completely agree it's important that everyone has access to a good job.\" It's important that I'm not making it up. It's not some act or gesture. I mean it. I can really, authentically agree with that part of what Aunt Lucy is saying. So I start with that.\n\nNext is B , for \"bridge.\" It does not stand for \"but.\" It also doesn't stand for \"however,\" which is the Harvard of \"buts.\" It's a bridge, a way of saying \"and.\" You can actually just say \"and\" - or \"that's why\" or \"actually\" or \"the thing is\" or even \"the good news is.\" Anything but \"but.\" \"But\" basically invalidates whatever came before it. Like when I say to my partner, \"I'm sorry, but . . .\" According to those same couples counselors, that means I'm not at all sorry. Apparently, that's what my partner thinks it means, too.\n\nThen comes C - \"convince.\" This is where I put whatever I was inclined to spit out in the first place, about how comprehensive immigration reform actually raises wages and working standards for immigrant and citizen workers, or whatever point I wanted to make.\n\nIn my experience, ABCing is hard to do in the moment but incredibly effective when done right. It's a powerful tool for what I call \"connection-speech,\" which not only lets you make your point but helps you make it in a friendly, respectful way that can be heard.\n\nBut beyond the ABC tool, when people ask how to talk to their own Aunt Lucys about politics, I often ask how they talk with their family members about topics other than politics. Do they yell and scream at their aunt if she loves some movie they think is stupid? Of course not. Maybe they get heated and say things like, \"Seriously? You don't think Dirty Dancing is the greatest love story of all time?\" But the conversation stays civil, and any outrage is secondary to the overwhelming spirit of love. I'm not going to disown Aunt Lucy for not liking Dirty Dancing .\n\nObviously, political issues are far more important. But still, I love Aunt Lucy infinitely more than I dislike Donald Trump. Remembering that helps. And frankly, I have plenty of good friends I don't see 100 percent eye to eye with but generally think are \"on my side.\" What if I only agree with them on 90 percent of issues? Or 60 percent? Or 40 percent? Where do I draw the line between accepting we just \"agree to disagree\" and defining them as monstrous enemies? The thing is, I give \"my people\" on \"my side\" the benefit of the doubt. Why don't I do that for Aunt Lucy?\n\nConnection-speech offers a ray of hope in the dark storm cloud that is internet vitriol, and vitriol in general. Because the fact is, we all say we don't like this crap. For instance, most Americans say they don't like mudslinging political ads and negative campaigns. And yet we keep voting for the mudslingers. Do we really want what we say we want? If so, we have to start actually supporting it and modeling civility ourselves. Both offline and on, if we stop fanning hate and instead practice connection-speech, that little ray of hope for a better way of interacting and even disagreeing with one another could spread.\n\nExcerpted from The Opposite of Hate: A Field Guide to Repairing Our Humanity by Sally Kohn © 2018 by Sally Kohn.

      "text": "Why Liberal Justices Need to Start Thinking Like Conservatives\n\nW hen the Supreme Court released its usual end-of-term rush of decisions last week, America experienced nothing less than a constitutional earthquake, a massive jolt caused by deep shifts in the tectonic plates of American jurisprudence.\n\nOn Monday, Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for all six of the Court's Republican appointees, ruled that religious schools must receive equal treatment in any school voucher system that a state might choose to create. On Wednesday, Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the same six, struck down New York's efforts to minimize concealed guns in public places. Then came Friday, when Justice Samuel Alito, writing for five Justices (all Republicans except Roberts) jettisoned a half-century of abortion jurisprudence and explicitly overruled the landmark cases of Roe v. Wade (1973) and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (2012). What on earth is the Court doing?\n\nIn a word: Originalism. Originalism is a profound and principled constitutional theory, available to liberals and conservatives alike, that prioritizes the Constitution's text and original history over even seemingly \"settled\" precedent. And after decades of doctrinal drift on America's highest court, originalism is now openly ascendant.\n\nThe three new blockbuster opinions came from the Court's three senior-most Republican appointees, with decisive backing from their more junior fellows, all self-described originalists nurtured from youth in the bosom of the originalism-focused Federalist Society: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett. In all three cases, the Court's old guard Democrats-Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan-howled in dissent. In all three, the Court repudiated doctrines that appeared solid a generation ago.\n\nAmerica has been here at least three times before-in 1937, 1954, and 1963. In each of these previous turning points, new blood on the Court prompted big changes. Each prior revolution tossed overboard landmark rulings that had once seemed settled precedent, as the new Court condemned the old conclusions as egregious misreadings of constitutional text and history. But all three prior revolutions involved liberal, not conservative, originalism. And in that history lies a way forward for today's liberal jurists-if they can bring themselves to see it.\n\nIn 1937, as in last week's abortion ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , the new Court eradicated putative constitutional rights rooted in a half-century of prior precedent. Back then, the supposed rights involved powerful men's private property; in Dobbs , the contested right implicated less powerful women's private lives. Both times, the Court's new blood said that the supposed rights in question-whether to enforce harsh contracts or to end pregnancies-lacked solid foundations in the Constitution's text and original understanding. In 1937, the old legal order was epitomized by Lochner v. New York (1905), in which the Court struck down an eminently reasonable maximum-hour employment law as violative of a sweatshop owner's right to drive a hard bargain with his workers. Lochner and other cases like it deployed a dubious doctrine, known to lawyers as \"substantive due process,\" that gave judges vast discretion to ignore laws they simply didn't like on substantive policy grounds. The new blood rightly viewed this amorphous and anti-textual concept with great suspicion. Roe carelessly revived the \"substantive due process\" idea in the context of women's reproductive rights, and the Court's new blood has now reacted just as the Court's new blood reacted in the late 1930s, by loudly denouncing this amorphous blob. Thus, Roe has now become the new Lochner .\n\nIn 1954, Brown v. Board of Education likewise said that an old precedent-setting case was egregiously wrong; this time, it was Plessy v. Ferguson (1896). Once again, originalism provided the best justification for the Court's doctrinal about-face, though then-Chief Justice Earl Warren's opinion muted this fact, which became clear only in retrospect. Brown was right for the simple reason that the text and history of the Fourteenth Amendment promised racial equality, and Jim Crow was not truly equal. In last week's school case, Carson v. Makin , America's current Chief Justice subtly channeled his 1950s predecessor by once again proclaiming the idea of educational equality-this time, the equal rights of religious parents and religious schools. As did Warren in Brown , Roberts in Carson muted some of the best originalist evidence that supported his ruling, but his bottom line was emphatic: If a private secular school gets a voucher, so must a private religious school that is identical in all other respects. What 1954 was for race equality in education, 2022 is for religious equality in education. Carson is the new Brown .\n\nFinally, in 1963, the Warren Court switched into high gear after Justice Felix Frankfurter left after a stroke. Now, the Roberts Court is shifting into high gear after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death. Beginning in 1963, the Warren Court dramatically expanded rights under the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments-involving expression rights, search-and-seizure rights, and fair trial rights, among other things. In last week's gun case, New York Rifle v. Bruen , the Roberts Court likewise dramatically expanded rights under the Second Amendment, involving the right to keep and bear arms, broadly construed. Bruen is the new Gideon (1963), the new Miranda (1966).\n\nIn hindsight, the lead architect of the judicial revolutions of 1937, 1954, and 1963 was a liberal originalist who stood like Martin Luther on the rock of constitutional text and history. This jurist led the Court to discard precedent after precedent because, he insisted, the old decisions were egregiously wrong on originalist grounds.\n\nThe most important judicial originalist in modern American history was thus not a conservative-not Robert Bork, not Antonin Scalia, not Clarence Thomas, not Samuel Alito. Rather it was Hugo Black, Franklin Roosevelt's first appointee (in 1937), who became the driving intellectual force of the Warren Court from 1953 to 1969 and left the bench shortly thereafter. Black brilliantly understood the legal, political, and rhetorical power of the Constitution's text and history. He knew how to sing the song of America's origins and amendments. The Constitution's text and background history really did offer strong protections of political expression by government critics (\"Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press\"); the right to vote (a textual refrain that repeatedly recurs in post-Founding Amendments); and jury trials of and for ordinary folk. Black insisted that these and countless other constitutional rights meant what they said, and that judges had to enforce them robustly.\n\nWhether consciously or not, today's Federalist Society conservatives are building on Franklin Roosevelt's first and best judicial pick. It is customary in most circles to refer to the Court's junior Republican trio-Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett-as Trump appointees, but in truth they are Federalist Society appointees, carefully groomed and vetted by this extraordinarily influential organization. Trump himself knows nothing about law and was indeed the most lawless president in American history. To him, law is simply an obstacle or a weapon. But most good lawyers and judges see law as a guide, a lens, a tool, an instrument for justice and community. The Federalist Society is part of this grand legal tradition and it has long championed originalism as the best way for judges and others to do constitutional law.\n\nMeanwhile, the Court's liberals are eschewing originalism, and they are losing badly. They are prioritizing not constitutional text, not its adjacent history, but rather existing Supreme Court precedent.\n\nBut purely precedent-based argumentation is misguided. For starters, each justice swears an oath to the Constitution, not to the Court's caselaw. And the Constitution's text could not be more clear: It, and not judicial precedent, is \"the supreme law of the land\"-no ifs, ands, or buts. Moreover, precedent itself authorizes deviation from egregiously wrong precedent. That is the lesson of 1937, 1954, and 1963-precedents on precedent, so to speak. A dissenter can of course invoke precedent, but the shelf life of a purely precedent-based dissent is shorter than that of a head of lettuce. Once a Court majority hands down its ruling, that ruling itself becomes a new precedent, and a precedent-worshipping dissenter must now change her tune in the next case. But an originalist dissenter need not fold her tent. The text says what it says and the history means what it means today, tomorrow, and forever. Most of Black's biggest triumphs late in his judicial career began as dissents in his early days.\n\nWhen last week's liberals tried to make arguments from constitutional text and history, they often stumbled. For example, in Dobbs they repeatedly and passionately invoked women's \"liberty.\" But the Constitution's text protects \"liberty\" in a clause that promises fair procedures such as impartial judges and juries-\"due process\"-and nothing more. Textually and historically, this is not a Liberty Clause as such. Nor is it a Property Clause, despite Lochner 's strained efforts to make it so. Rather, it is exactly what it says it is-a procedural Due Process Clause. A jurist steeped in arcane judicial precedent may have difficulty even seeing this basic point, but it is blindingly clear for a true originalist, who begins by focusing like a laser on the terse text itself: \"Nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\"\n\nIn Carson , Justice Sotomayor opened her dissent by invoking \"the wall of separation between church and state that the Framers fought to build.\" This was lovely rhetoric but sloppy analysis. The \"wall of separation\" metaphor is not in the Constitution and our best constitutional scholars have proved that the Founding history of church and state is far more complex than this simple metaphor suggests. Most important of all, Carson involved a state-Maine-and not the federal government. The key amendment was thus not the First Amendment, which explicitly speaks of \"Congress\" and was adopted in 1791, but the Fourteenth Amendment, which limits \"state\" governments and was ratified in 1868. That amendment says nothing about religious \"establishment\" as such, but does expressly stress the \"equal\" status of various races and religions. Sotomayor wasn't even looking at the right century or the right text! In Bruen , the New York gun control case, Justice Thomas's ambitious originalist opinion for the Court took special care to highlight the possible difference between the understanding of American rights in 1791 and in 1868, yet Sotomayor and her fellow dissenters in Carson completely missed the memo.\n\nThe Dobbs liberals grumbled that originalism privileges white male history from long ago. But surely the Constitution's text binds us, no? And how can judges faithfully enforce the text without paying at least some attention its enactment context and pondering the reasons why Americans in years past put certain words in the document? In her 2010 confirmation hearings, liberal Justice Elena Kagan explicitly said, \"we are all originalists.\"\n\nAs Justice Black brilliantly showed throughout his career, there are often compelling originalist arguments to be made for liberal outcomes. And some liberal originalists working in today's law schools are making them. For example, they have emphasized the relevance of the Thirteenth Amendment to the abortion debate . Enslaved women were forced to reproduce against their will and modern abortion laws are likewise conscripting unwilling women into, quite literally , forced labor .\n\nThere are plausible counterarguments to this and other liberal originalist ideas; but unless liberals on the Court learn (or relearn) how to do originalism, they will lose many winnable cases. Perhaps conservative originalists on the Court will swat away even compelling liberal originalist ideas, but we will never know unless liberals on the Court put these ideas in play. Even if liberal originalist arguments fail to prevail immediately, they will leave a trail of dissent that will be a godsend to future jurists, unlike precedent-based dissents good for one day only.\n\nIn the modern NBA, no team can consistently win without the ability to sink three-pointers. What is true of today's basketball court is also true of today's Supreme Court: the game is changing and new skills are now required. The Federalist Society is the judicial equivalent of the Golden State Warriors.\n\nBeginning at noon today, when Ketanji Brown Jackson takes her oath of office to replace retiring Stephen Breyer, there will be fresh talent on the Court. In the years ahead, Justice Jackson and the Court's other liberals will need to hit the history books hard and practice their outside shots. Only if this happens will they have a fighting chance in the new era that has dawned.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "What Is a Conservative?\n\nMitt Romney's advance toward the Republican presidential nomination has provoked a lively conversation about what it means to be a conservative in America today. TIME asked a number of right-leaning thinkers to answer one of three questions to help define both their ideology and their challenges for the future\n\n2 of 13\n\nConservatism is a mansion with many rooms, and individual conservatives tend to congregate in some of them rather than others. But as a general matter, conservatives respect the Constitution for the limitations it imposes on the power of the state and believe the Declaration of Independence is the sheet anchor of our liberties. They believe in equality of opportunity rather than equality of outcome. And conservatives believe in the virtues, including the moral virtues, of democratic capitalism.\n\nConservatives hold to the view that a society should protect life, including innocent, unborn life, and that it has obligations to defend the most vulnerable members of the human community. They also believe in the dispersal rather than the concentration of power and that taxes should fund the necessary work of government rather than redistribute wealth. The state should not be in the business of leveling out differences by punishing excellence.\n\nConservatives believe that our laws should be color-blind; they believe in the importance of assimilation and the principle of subsidiarity. The role civic institutions play in our social life is a core conservative principle. So is the belief that our social order rests on a moral foundation and that religion is the source of morality for many people.\n\nConservatives believe, too, that no person is a citizen alone and that families therefore need support from our culture. The role of education is understood to be both intellectual and moral, with the goal of both mastering the basics and nurturing the character of the young.\n\nConservatives also believe that America, while an imperfect nation, has been a tremendous force for good in the world. While conservatives acknowledge limits on American power and influence, they believe (unlike many libertarians) that we should oppose tyranny in other lands. And conservatives believe in the primacy of a strong national defense.\n\nThere is also something like a conservative disposition, which is characterized by an appreciation for the complexity of human society, the limitations of politics and the dangers of mistaking politics for metaphysics. The danger facing statesmen, the great conservative Edmund Burke warned, is when they view self-government \"as if it were an abstract question concerning metaphysical liberty and necessity and not a matter of moral prudence and natural feeling.\"\n\nAmerican conservatism tends to be more hopeful and less dour than, say, British conservatism. It looks to the future rather than remaining fixated on the past. And it is eager to embrace change and reform as social circumstances shift. But true conservatism is wary of revolutionary rhetoric, utopian promises and efforts to remake the world.\n\nWehner is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center. The views expressed are solely his own.\n\n( MORE: The Conservative Identity Crisis )\n\nFollow @TIMEIdeas"

      "text": "Why do I criticize Trump so much if I'm conservative? I expect better from GOP. | Opinion\n\nI receive dozens of emails weekly from people labelling me a RINO , a Democrat in disguise, or a cog in the left wing propaganda machine. Naturally, these emails don't warrant a response, but they do raise an interesting question collectively.\n\nWhy is it so bad to criticize my party or the people leading it?\n\nThe people who attack my frequent criticism of President Donald Trump and the direction of the Republican Party are wrong about my motivations. I'm more conservative than the vast majority of those people might think. But I believe it's more important to be critical of your party than it is to cover up deficiencies.\n\nWe should not be scared of criticizing our leaders as a way to strengthen conservatives in the future. The GOP will become weaker if we are unwilling to point out its blemishes.\n\nThe Trump administration lacks the moral foundation and conservative principles to truly represent a conservative outlook on American politics. Trump's expansion of power for himself, disregard for norms and the law, and his own character problems warrant criticism from those who claim to be conservative.\n\nIt is true that I still agree with the GOP platform far more than I do with the Democrats', which many people find hard to square with the majority of my columns.\n\nBut I'm harder on the GOP because I expect more from conservatives. Before Trump, Republicans had a consistent belief system rooted in a handful of core principles, such as limited government and free markets. Now, that is just not true.\n\nToday's GOP is abandoning that structure by supporting policy ideas like the expansion of tariffs , challenges to the separation of powers , and a blind alliance of the party to Trump. Even Congress has decided against legislating a conservative agenda despite having control of both chambers.\n\nWe see this in the news media, as well.\n\nMany conservatives in the media approach their coverage as a balancing of the mainstream outlets, which generally do favor Democrats, especially in the Trump era. These people ask softball questions, provide cover for Republicans and excuse away Trump's behavior. Organizations like Fox News do little better the Republican Party by catering to it.\n\nThis approach is unproductive for several reasons. By protecting Republican politicians, conservative media limits the flow of information to red state voters. Voters then become less informed, and more likely to base their decisions on that limited information.\n\nThat's fine if you want a voter base with a fraction of the information. I don't.\n\nHolding conservatives to the proper standards is part of making conservatism stronger. Iron sharpens iron, and if we want to produce the best candidates, we have no business taking it easy on conservative leaders, even if we're on the same team.\n\nThe start of the moral decline was when the Republican Party allowed Trump to be its presidential nominee, despite his many character issues.\n\nThe rationale for supporting Trump in 2016 was that holding your nose and voting for him was worth it because he was better than the alternative. A similar reasoning was employed in 2024, although by then more of the Republican Party had become Trump die-hards despite his 2020 loss.\n\nThe teardown of the party's principles led to the reshaping of the GOP for the single purpose of enabling Trump to win elections without regard for the long-term consequences. His administration operates with minimal checks and balances because of Republican acceptance.\n\nThis is why I've been willing to abstain from voting for Trump in the last two election cycles and will remain critical of policies I disagree with. His removal from the GOP is more important than winning any election.\n\nI do not believe that one election can doom the country. I do, however, believe that several consecutive election cycles that tear down political norms can stress the fabric of our Republic, which is precisely what the \"win at all costs\" attitude has done to our country over the past decade.\n\nRepublicans should make decisions based on what is good for conservatism in the long run, rather than their short-term election prospects. I know this is an unrealistic ask. But I'll keep asking ‒ and people can keep emailing me about how they disagree.\n\nDace Potas is an opinion columnist for USA TODAY and a graduate of DePaul University with a degree in political science."

      "text": "Trump's triumphs: How he achieves the wildest dreams of conservatives\n\nDismantle the Education Department? On it. End foreign aid ? Sure. Fire thousands of federal workers ? Done.\n\nWith a combination of chutzpah, a disregard for the legal niceties and a political opposition in such turmoil that it's struggling to challenge him, President Donald Trump in seven weeks has been putting in place goals that conservatives have been dreaming about for decades.\n\nHe's also uprooted what the GOP has long decried as social engineering by liberals, reflected recently by programs known as DEI (for diversity, equity and inclusion) - now banned in the federal government.\n\nTrump's latest action is an executive order , expected to be signed as early as Monday, that would aim to abolish the Education Department 46 years after Congress voted to establish it in 1979. Since 1980, the Republican Party platform has supported shutting down the agency, calling it an example of federal overreach into state and local affairs.\n\n\"I want to just do it,\" Trump said Thursday when reporters asked when he would sign the order. \"Let the states run the schools.\"\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan had endorsed closing the department, too, but he and other Republican leaders have never been able to pass legislation in Congress to shutter it. That's not a step Trump apparently is going to bother with, though some legal scholars say it's required by law.\n\nThe 47th president has regularly tested the limits of executive power , setting up confrontations that the courts are likely to be arbitrating for months and years ahead. In the process, he has burnished his image as decisive and won the adoration of his core supporters .\n\nAnd the alarm of opponents who warn they are the actions of a would-be despot.\n\nSimply ignoring the role of Congress and the potential restraints of the Constitution is one ingredient behind Trump's success in checking off items that have long been on conservatives' wish lists.\n\nHere are some other factors that have helped.\n\nTrump's command of the Republican Party is so complete that not even GOP legislative leaders have objected to actions he has taken that infringe on Congress' power, including withholding funds Congress had appropriated.\n\n\"I've been asked so many times, 'Aren't you uncomfortable with this?'\" House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters last month. \"No, I'm not.\"\n\nTrump has also ignored the dictates in some laws, including the mandate in a bill passed with bipartisan support that demanded the sale or shutdown of TikTok by Jan. 19 because of national security concerns. On the day he took office, Trump unilaterally extended that deadline by 75 days.\n\nRepublican officials have generally been unwilling to challenge the legality or the wisdom of the president's actions, even when they conflict with their own past positions on issues such as aid to Ukraine.\n\nThat stance - or the failure to take a stance - has bolstered his sense of authority.\n\nSure, it's a cliche. That doesn't mean it's not true.\n\nThe failure of Democrats to coalesce behind a coherent strategy against Trump's blizzard of controversial policies was on display during his address to a joint session of Congress last week.\n\nSome Democratic members of Congress didn't show up. Rep. Al Green of Texas was there but didn't last long; he was escorted out after standing and heckling the president. (He was later censured for the disruption.) A handful of others walked out during the speech, with messages like \"Resist\" on the back of their shirts. Some raised black-and-white paddles with words like \"False\" and \"Lies.\"\n\nMost simply sat on their hands.\n\nFor his part, Trump not only didn't reach out for their support. He mocked them as irrelevant.\n\nThe president's first targets have been agencies that don't have the broadest public support, from foreign-aid programs to the Internal Revenue Service. That makes it more difficult to rally his opposition.\n\nThe governmental bureaucracy in general has long been another lightning rod for conservatives.\n\nWhile Democrats have tried to put human faces on the ranks of the federal employees who have been abruptly fired, inviting some to sit in the gallery at the president's speech to Congress, Trump has portrayed the workforce with a broad brush as bloated, unproductive and even corrupt.\n\n\"We had too many people in government,\" he told reporters in the Oval Office on Friday, defending his sweeping layoffs. \"This is for 40 years; this isn't just now. This built up and got worse and worse, and they just hire more and more people.\"\n\nHis administration has set a goal of slashing half of the IRS workforce . It has dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development and imposed a six-week freeze on its funding. In an ongoing legal battle over that, a divided Supreme Court last week cleared the way for a federal judge to order billions of dollars in the aid to be released.\n\nWhat about Social Security and Medicare? Those massive programs consume about a third of the federal budget, but Trump has promised their popular benefits won't be touched.\n\nThen there's the third branch of government: the judiciary .\n\nMore than 100 lawsuits have been filed against the Trump administration, challenging the unilateral firing of civil servants, the freezing of federal spending, the pursuit of undocumented immigrants into churches, the end of birthright citizenship and more.\n\nJudges already have issued more than 40 orders to temporarily block Trump's actions.\n\n\"An American President is not a king - not even an 'elected' one,\" U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell said in one ruling Thursday. \"The President's interpretation of the scope of his constitutional power - or, more aptly, his aspiration - is flat wrong.\"\n\nIn what might prove to be a test case, the judge reinstated Gwynne Wilcox to the National Labor Relations Board after Trump had removed her without cause.\n\nThe administration quickly filed an appeal, and Howell joked she was a \"speed bump\" for the case on its way to the Supreme Court.\n\nMany of those cases may be headed to the high court, but it will take time for appeals to be exhausted and final rulings made. By then - even if Trump's initial action is ultimately judged to have been improper - they could have had an impact that is difficult to undo, after programs have been slashed and workers fired.\n\nWhich is presumably part of the president's point."

      "text": "What is a social conservative?\n\nThe widening ideological rift today between liberals and conservatives is obvious. But the more subtle differences between different schools of thought within parties can be harder to parse.\n\nWhile the Republican National Convention highlights that Republicans are largely rallying behind a party platform which is a combination of different conservative ideas, each might have different, overlapping motivations and priorities.\n\nOne of those ideas is social conservatism.\n\nAccording to the European Center for Populism Studies, \"Social conservatism is the belief that society is built upon a fragile network of relationships which need to be upheld through duty, traditional values and established institutions.\"\n\n\" Social conservatism is generally skeptical of social change and believes in maintaining the status quo concerning social issues such as family life, sexual relations, and patriotism.\"\n\nSocial conservatism is, more simply put, conservatism on social issues. In the U.S. that might mean opposition to gay and transgender rights , abortion , immigration , civil rights and other issues that have to do with social groups and relationships.\n\nSocial conservatives often support the right to carry guns and a strong, central role for religion - particularly Christianity - in society and government.\n\nSocial conservatives tend to oppose steps to dismantle historical inequalities related to personal and social differences including race, class, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexuality and national origin.\n\nHistorically, social conservatives have opposed racial integration, civil rights reform , women's right to vote and the legalization of being gay, among other social reforms.\n\nThey tend to oppose pluralism, which is when different cultural identity groups coexist equally, side by side in society, and instead embrace hierarchy.\n\n\"Conservatives, our work shows, tend to believe more strongly than liberals in a hierarchical world, which is essentially the view that the universe is a place where the lines between categories or concepts matter,\" writes the University of Pennsylvania's Jeremy Clifton.\n\nA good example of this is the conservative emphasis on the deep, \"natural,\" and essential difference between men and women and the importance of each filling traditional gender roles.\n\nThrough much of the 20 th century, social conservatism was largely concerned with maintaining racial, religious and gender distinctions in society and before the law.\n\nThey might favor order, as in \"law and order,\" as a good thing in and of itself, over what they might see as a messier, less strictly disciplined society with more of certain individual freedoms.\n\nThey call for newly enforcing what they might themselves call \"old-fashioned,\" values, and might want to go back to a real or imagined past.\n\nThomas DeMichele of the fact-checking organization Fact / Myth helps illustrate one important difference between present-day mainstream conservatism from different varieties in the past:\n\n\"Generally, where classical conservatism wants to maintain tradition, social conservatism wants progressive change toward what it perceives as traditional values,\" that is, to make progress by going back from social change that has already happened, to an idealized past.\n\nFiscal conservatism is one of the other major strains in American conservatism.\n\nSome of its most important and central beliefs are that taxation should be low and that the government should have a small role and weak power to intervene in the affairs of society and the economy.\n\nIt has some contradictions with social conservatism, particularly the fact that social conservatism tends to want the government to have more power to enforce certain moral and social rules, but the two coexist without much conflict within the modern Republican Party.\n\nFiscal conservatives believe that society and the economy can and should regulate themselves without oversight and that the primary role of the government is to protect private property, rather than to protect and promote the livelihood of its citizens and their ability to exercise their rights in a more direct and proactive way."

      "text": "These proud conservatives love wind turbines and solar power. Here's why.\n\nHOUSTON - Green lawns and trees shimmered in 100-degree heat at the Houstonian resort last week as an unexpected gathering got underway.\n\nInside, the smell of BBQ hung in the air and a ballroom resounded with praise for Donald Trump, admiration of America's heartland and a love of conservative values.\n\nAlso solar power. And wind turbines. And nuclear energy.\n\n\"Clean is right,\" said John Szoka, smiling at the play on words.\n\nHe's the CEO of the Conservative Energy Network, sponsor of last week's Conservative Energy Summit in Houston. Founded in 2016, this year for the first time it brought together more than 200 people from around the country to discuss how best to champion energy sources they believe will restore American energy leadership, save people money, create jobs and secure the power grid.\n\nWhile conservative voices have never been absent from discussions around clean energy, the network is part of a new \"eco-right\" that's emerged to make a conservative case for climate work or at least carbon-neutral energy.\n\nAnd that doesn't necessarily mean believing in climate change, speakers said. Anyone who supports free markets can see that cheap, renewable energy is the future - and there's money to be made for those who embrace it, the group believes.\n\n\"The folks making money from renewable energy projects are conservative and Republican,\" said Drew Christensen, senior director of public engagement at Apex Clean Energy in Virginia and a former Republican representative from Minnesota.\n\nSpeaker after speaker argued that free market competition, consumer choice, private property rights and cutting government overregulation are fundamentally Republican values. If those principles prevail, clean energy will thrive in the U.S., they believe.\n\n\"We need to get the politics out of the energy business,\" said Pat Wood of the Hunt Energy Network in Dallas.\n\nFor America to continue to produce this cheap, abundant power that just happens to be renewable, conservatives have to embrace it - because almost all clean energy projects are developed in Republican districts, said Mark Stover, executive director of the Texas Solar Power Association.\n\n\"In rural, red areas, we've got to repudiate the feeling that Democrats are trying to force clean energy projects down our throats,\" said Marshall Conrad, vice president of government relations at Strata Clean Energy in North Carolina.\n\nLooming, but unspoken in the room, was the upcoming presidential election. Most of the organizations present, including the Conservative Energy Network, are nonprofits that cannot take political positions. But they did address, obliquely, the fact that the Republican nominee Trump publicly says he hates wind turbines and generally opposes renewable energy, which he claims is too costly and inefficient.\n\n\"No matter who wins, we'll continue to do this work because where we're focused isn't national policy, it's down at the state and local level,\" said Szoka.\n\nLooking to the future, conservatives need to get on board because if newer, cheaper forms of power are dismissed it's going to affect elections, said John Berger, president and CEO of Sunnova Energy in Houston.\n\n\"People are starting to get angry. Power bills in some areas are greater than mortgage payments,\" he said. \"We need to address these issues - ratepayers are also called voters.\"\n\nTen years ago renewable energy wasn't a partisan issue, said Christensen. When George W. Bush was governor of Texas in 1999 and deregulated the state's power market, he specifically included renewable power goals, which his successor Rick Perry doubled down on. Texas became a wind, and later solar, powerhouse.\n\n\"Today, every single thing is either red-coated or blue-coated, everything has a partisan angle,\" he said.\n\nThe shift has been dramatic. Strong support for government efforts to develop clean energy has plummeted over the past five or so years among conservative Republicans, from 54% to 24% and from 70% to 49% among moderate Republicans, data from a Yale/George Mason University survey this spring showed.\n\n\"It's not surprising the support for clean energy has fallen sharply among Republicans in recent years given that Trump and Fox News relentlessly trash talk it,\" said Edward Maibach, an expert on climate communications at George Mason University's Center for Climate Change Communication who co-led the survey.\n\nConservative Energy Network came into existence to help provide an alternative view of renewable energy at the state and county level, say organizers.\n\n\"I want to make electricity boring again,\" said Stover. \"Let's have adult conversations about electricity. It's not, 'You're in wind and solar, you're bad,' or 'You're in coal and oil, you're good.'\"\n\nThe network works in the towns and counties where zoning decisions are made and where renewables are being blocked. A USA TODAY analysis published in February found that at least 15% of counties in the U.S. have effectively halted new utility-scale wind, solar, or both .\n\nTo help reclaim energy independence as a conservative stance, Conservative Energy Network and offshoots, including the Land & Liberty Coalition, work at the micro level, spending time not just in state capitals but also in churches, county fairs, zoning commissions and county council meetings to preach a rock-ribbed Republican message about something locals often see as liberal stupidity.\n\nThey have an \"all of the above\" attitude to energy. Topics at the summit included geothermal and nuclear power, hydrogen hubs and industrial carbon capture.\n\n\"You need a trusted, conservative voice to go in there and tell them the truth, get beyond all the misinformation they're seeing,\" said Szoka, who spent ten years as a Republican state legislator in South Carolina. \"We're that voice.\"\n\nNot every Republican sees renewables as a lefty plot. Surveys show that Republicans support not just more oil and gas drilling, but also more solar (70%) and wind (60%.)\n\nTake the solar customer in Pahrump, Nevada, that Drew Bond of the Conservative Coalition for Climate Solutions recently visited.\n\n\"This guy is a Vietnam veteran, lives in the middle of the desert, has solar on his roof, drives a diesel truck and a Chevy Bolt and he had a Trump bandana on,\" Bond said.\n\nThe take-home message? \"We need to stop putting people in boxes.\"\n\nIt was a message that pleased more liberal-leaning groups.\n\nColin Leyden of the Environmental Defense Fund spoke at the conference. While the fund gets categorized as liberal, he said they've actually had a long history of endorsing candidates on the right. But in recent years it's been a struggle to find Republican candidates to endorse.\n\n\"I'm happy to hear that you're seeing an evolution of the climate conversation on the right,\" he said.\n\nThe Conservative Energy Network works in the trenches across 25 states. That includes championing the property rights of farmers and ranchers to build solar or wind on their property, fighting over-regulation and getting power projects built that bring significant revenue to rural communities without raising taxes, said Bradley Pischea, national director of the Land & Liberty Coalition.\n\nThey also spend a lot of time fighting misinformation about new kinds of energy as online posts claim (wrongly) that wind turbines make people sick, solar panels drip poison into the soil, offshore wind kills whales and high voltage transmission lines cause cancer.\n\n\"If there was one thing I could do to support renewable energy it would be to wipe Facebook off the face of the Earth,\" said Stover.\n\nIt takes a conservative voice to refute the lies, said Szoka. Send someone from Greenpeace to a county council meeting in Kansas and nothing they say is going to get listened to. Send out someone who's spent a dozen years working on anti-abortion issues or gun rights or tax cuts and they're harder to ignore.\n\nSometimes being part of the \"eco-right\" means taking left-of-center money, said Szoka. The organization receives funding from energy companies but also from philanthropic groups such as the MacArthur Foundation , Argosy, McKnight and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.\n\n\"While CEN does not necessarily agree with the politics of all of its donors, we do agree on the need for a clean energy transition and CEN wants to ensure America's global leadership and economic dominance in that transition,\" he said.\n\nIn the end, consumers will always go with the cheapest power, which today means wind and solar, said John Berger, president and CEO of Sunnova Energy in Houston.\n\n\"Costs will fall, prices will fall and guess what? We'll solve the climate crisis,\" he said. \"Government needs to get out of the way of the power sector and unleash the technologies that can bring this about.\""

      "text": "Trump evolved CPAC beyond conservatism. Is there still room for Reagan Republicans? | Opinion\n\nWashington, D.C., will host this weekend a pair of events offering a split screen of contradictions about what it means to be a conservative in the time of President Donald Trump, who drives division in all things, including the Republican Party.\n\nPrinciples First is an annual summit launched in 2019 in response to the disillusionment some conservatives felt about Trump's first term - and also as a rebuke to the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual gathering known as CPAC that started in 1974 .\n\nConsider Principles First , an attempt to return to what CPAC once was - a place where conservatives, independents and libertarians discussed and debated policy, up-and-coming politicians sought support, and young and aspiring political operatives came to learn and network.\n\nCompare that with what CPAC has become - a parade of prancing personalities, all trying to one-up each other in toadyism to Trump, where provocation is everything and the actual policy of governing is, at best, an afterthought.\n\nSorry to say, but CPAC's favoring of flash over substance has been more successful at attracting attention, at least for now. Still, Principles First is growing in influence, while CPAC feels like it has reached a controversy-riddled zenith.\n\nThat might be wishful thinking. Time will tell.\n\nHeath Mayo, a 34-year-old lawyer who first attended CPAC as a sophomore in college, told me he launched the volunteer-driven Principles First six years ago, hoping to create a grassroots community of people interested in \"ideas rather than personalities.\"\n\nCPAC, Mayo said, deteriorated and is \"just not a serious place\" for that kind of conversation.\n\nA year ago, Principles First was hoping to prevent a second Trump presidency . This weekend, its activists will explore ways to contain the convulsion of norm-busting and government enfeeblement that Trump has pushed in his first month back in the White House.\n\n\"It is what we thought it was,\" Mayo said. \"It wasn't overstated. The concern was not exaggerated. These guys, through a combination of incompetence and a complete disregard for the fundamental principles that made America great and the institutions that have made us great, are really threatening what we have done over the past century.\"\n\nOn the agenda: Trump's tariffs on allies and embrace of geopolitical foes, how to lower costs for health care and housing, and a big focus on urging Republican members of Congress to stand up to Trump when they disagree with him.\n\n\"They have an independent duty on (Trump Cabinet) nominees to advise and consent, not just trust and obey,\" Mayo said. \"They're independent as legislators in their own right, not just sort of lemmings or foot soldiers in Trump's little MAGA army.\"\n\nOver at CPAC in Oxon Hill, Maryland, about 10 miles south of Washington, D.C., Trump is expected to speak this weekend after his co-president Elon Musk and Vice President JD Vance addressed the crowd Thursday .\n\nThen-California Gov. Ronald Reagan, speaking at the first CPAC in 1974, used the opening lines of his speech to honor and introduce three men who had recently been released from North Vietnamese prisoner-of-war camps. One of them was John McCain, who'd become a Republican senator from Arizona and his party's 2008 nominee for president.\n\nMcCain was cheered at CPAC 51 years ago . Dying of brain cancer in 2018, McCain was jeered when Trump derided him in a noxious CPAC speech.\n\nI'd bet that the late President Reagan, with his \" Tear Down This Wall \" speech before the fall of the Soviet Union, would be outraged at the MAGA crowd at CPAC cheering Trump's flagrant fealty to a Russian president who illegally launched a war against Ukraine and a Republican-controlled Congress chock full of politicians who would really like to stand up to Russia about all that but won't dare cross Trump because they fear his wrath.\n\nTrump is the perfect speaker for what CPAC has become. Anyone who disagrees with Trump and his CPAC pals is a \" global Marxist \" who must be hated . It's simple-minded messaging that taunts the listener to comply or face conflict.\n\nCharlie Gerow, a Pennsylvania political consultant, was a college student when he heard Reagan speak at CPAC in 1974. He joined CPAC's board about a decade ago and was vice chair when he resigned last year, while calling for an independent investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct by the chair, Matt Schlapp.\n\nGerow recalled the early days of CPAC this way: \"It was a training ground for young conservatives. It was a place to see and be seen. All the young guys who thought they were going to rule the world went.\"\n\nGerow declined to comment on the current state of CPAC. But his resignation letter, obtained in November by The Daily Beast , expressed strong concerns about the group encouraging \"blind loyalty\" to Schlapp.\n\nThe CPAC chairman was facing a lawsuit brought in 2023 by a political consultant who accused Schlapp of groping his genitals.\n\nSchlapp denied the allegations. The lawsuit was dropped last March, with CNN and The New York Times reporting that the consultant received a $480,000 settlement.\n\nRight on cue, Schlapp is now accused of grabbing another man's crotch while creeping on a group of men at a Virginia bar two weeks ago, according to a scoop from independent journalist Yashar Ali. A local paper, the Rappahannock News, obtained the details from a police report .\n\nNo charges were filed, and Schlapp did not respond to the newspaper or Ali.\n\nMake of that what you will. But, putting the salacious controversy aside, think about what it meant to be a conservative five decades ago and how some savvy politicians and opportunistic grifters have completely co-opted what it now means. Would Reagan cheer what he would hear at CPAC this week if he were still alive?\n\nI think Reagan would give all that cacophonous chatter his signature shake of the head, a signal he used to send when he wondered what was wrong with the world around him.\n\nFollow USA TODAY columnist Chris Brennan on X, formerly known as Twitter: @ByChrisBrennan"

      "text": "Opinion | Instead of accepting the will of the voters, conservatives blame George Soros\n\nManage your account\n\nWhen all four of conservative Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry's proposed constitutional amendments were soundly defeated Saturday - about twice as many voters voted against them as for them - he responded with insults, condescension and misinformation. The governor should have acknowledged that Louisianians didn't want what he was selling and graciously accepted the will of the voters. Instead, as has become typical for some conservative politicians, the governor blamed political extremists and George Soros.\n\n\"Soros and far left liberals poured millions into Louisiana with propaganda and outright lies about Amendment 2,\" Landry said in a statement. \"Although we are disappointed in tonight's results, we do not see this as a failure. We realize how hard positive change can be to implement in a State that is conditioned for failure.\"\n\nHis statement is problematic for multiple reasons. Not only does he insult the good people of our state , but he also ignores that, as The Advocate newspaper of Baton Rouge reported, people from opposite sides of the political spectrum joined forces to thwart his plans to allow the formation of specialty courts in Louisiana, to move hundreds of millions of dollars from the state's savings accounts into the general fund, to send more minors to adult prisons and to change the rules regarding some judicial elections.\n\nSoros has funded many worthy projects over the years, but Landry's desperate attempt to make him the reason his amendments were rejected Saturday won't fly. Our movement was built from the ground up, led by organizations - including mine, the Power Coalition for Equity and Justice - that have been working in Louisiana for years, organizations that communities trust. The people of this state came together, educated themselves and made an informed decision at the ballot box.\n\nThat is democracy in action and a defining moment that shows that despite the political headwinds, when we educate and we fight - we win.\n\nBut many conservatives talk as if there's a villain - named Soros - behind every effort to oppose them. Elon Musk was heckled in Wisconsin on Saturday as he stumped for the conservative running for the state's Supreme Court election. He said, \"It was inevitable that at least a few Soros operatives would be in the audience.\" While Soros had donated $2 million to Wisconsin's Democratic Party during the judicial race, Musk and PACs he funds had put $20 million into the race that Democrat Susan Crawford won Tuesday .\n\nBut let's be clear: Our victory here in Louisiana wasn't about money or political insiders. It was about people. The Liberty and Dignity Coalition was powered by a coalition of more than 50 organizations, all committed to protecting our communities and standing against harmful policies. At the heart of this fight was the leadership of Sarah Omojola at the Vera Institute , and Kristen Rome at the Louisiana Center for Children's Rights , Power Coalition , VOTE (Voice of the Experienced) , Invest in Louisiana and a network of trusted, community-based organizations worked together to ensure voters had a clear analysis and understanding of each amendment. Each of those organizations led its own education and outreach efforts.\n\nThis was organizing at its best. We took to the streets, held town halls and met people where they were. We broke down complex policies, listened to the concerns of everyday Louisianians and prompted those we met to understand the power of their voices and their votes.\n\nLouisiana officials routinely schedule amendment voters on dates when they think turnout will be abysmally low and only people motivated to vote yes will show up. That was the plan this time. The governor and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., unaware that their microphones were on at a White House last week, were heard discussing the percentage of voters expected to show up .\n\n\"What's the anticipated turnout?\" Johnson asks.\n\nLandry says, \"Well, we thought it was going to be 12, but it looks like it might be 18%.\"\n\n\"That'd be huge for an election,\" Johnson said, \"I mean, for an amendment vote.\"\n\nThe 21% turnout , though still low, was nearly double what Landry had thought it would be. And that was enough to send a signal. Black voters led the charge , making up 37% of early voters , and voters made it clear that they won't stand for policies that put political interests over the well-being of their communities.\n\nYet, instead of respecting the will of the voters, the governor dismissed them, and conservative legislators are scrambling to put the same amendments back on a future ballot. Such tone-deaf leadership is why voter engagement is on the rise. Voters are clear their leaders aren't listening to them.\n\nI don't believe Louisiana is unique in that regard. I believe the spirit that animated voters here is spreading across the country and that politicians who are counting on public apathy to move their problematic agendas forward should be worried. Voters are tired of being ignored, and they refuse to be manipulated. And they will not sit idly by and watch what they love about their states and their country be destroyed.\n\nCORRECTION (APRIL 3, 2025, 11:37 a.m. ET) : A previous version of this article misstated the named a group of organizations that opposed Louisiana's constitutional amendments. It's the Liberty and Dignity Coalition, not the Dignity and Liberty campaign.\n\nThis article was originally published on MSNBC.com"

The Canadian prime minister had lost his finance minister, was deserted by key members of his party and had gone into hiding from the media. Poilievre's Conservative Party, already well ahead in opinion polls, expanded its lead.

On Polymarket, bettors give the Liberals a 63% chance of winning the most seats.\n\nTrump has a unique ability to dominate the political conversation. That's truer than ever in Canada, where he has drowned out the debate on domestic issues with his barrage of tariffs and proclamations that the country should be the 51st US state. At the moment, that appears to be playing into Carney's hands.\n\nKory Teneycke, a longtime Conservative strategist who recently worked on Ontario Premier Doug Ford's provincial election victory, said Poilievre needs to talk more about the US threat and change his tone. \"He sounds too much like Trump. He uses the lexicon of Trump,\" Teneycke said at the Empire Club of Canada.\n\nCarney, who speaks in the muted tones of a former central banker, does not have that problem.\n\nIronically, the slump in Poilievre's political fortunes comes as he has achieved victory on some of his longstanding policy demands. Having helped end Trudeau's political career, the Conservative chief has been forced to watch as Carney co-opts a number of his ideas.\n\nPoilievre, 45, wanted to run the election on the economy and the cost of living, with a particular focus on the Liberals' carbon tax, the centerpiece of a climate plan that Trudeau clung to even when it became unpopular. He relentlessly blamed the levy for exacerbating inflation and weakening Canada's competitiveness - and was so successful that Carney's first act as prime minister was to suspend the portion that consumers pay, despite having previously supported it.\n\nWith Trudeau gone, the carbon tax spurned, interest rates falling, and aggressive rhetoric and actions from Trump, the so-called \"ballot question\" has changed. Dealing with the volatile US president has become the top issue in many voters' minds.\n\nAnd each time the White House threatens Canada's sovereignty or announces a new round of tariffs, it offers Carney an opportunity.\n\nWhen Trump signed an order Wednesday to impose 25% tariffs on automobiles built outside the US - an existential threat to Canadian auto factories and parts makers that are responsible for one of the country's biggest categories of exports - Carney tore up his campaign schedule and flew back to Ottawa to meet with members of his cabinet.\n\nThe next day, standing behind a podium and in front of a row of Canadian flags, Carney delivered a line that's still reverberating around the nation that shares the world's longest undefended border with the US.\n\n\"The old relationship we had with the United States, based on deepening integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation, is over,\" he said. On Friday, Trump and Carney had their first phone call since Carney became prime minister.\n\nThe first week of the election campaign sketched a pattern of Carney, 60, leaning into how he'd help Canada transition to a new, more distant relationship with the US, while Poilievre focused more on affordability and taxes.\n\nOn Monday, Carney stopped at the airport in Gander, Newfoundland, the town that welcomed thousands of stranded American airline passengers after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, an event that inspired the musical Come From Away. That day, Poilievre unveiled an income tax cut larger than the Liberals' proposal.\n\nOn Tuesday, Carney promoted a new defense policy at an east coast shipyard and talked about deepening partnerships with non-US allies. Poilievre pledged to eliminate the sales tax on many new homes. The next day, he promised a tax reduction for working seniors.\n\nOn Thursday, while Carney addressed the government's response to new US tariffs, Poilievre proposed an expansion of tax-sheltered accounts for investors willing to put money into Canadian companies.\n\nAt a rally later that day in the Vancouver region, Poilievre gave a nearly 50-minute stump speech that was similar to the one he has been delivering for months. He mentioned Trump only three times, twice to draw parallels between the president and Carney, and said the Liberals are responsible for weakening Canada and putting it \"under the American thumb.\"\n\nAndrew MacDougall, a communications consultant at Trafalgar Strategy and former spokesman for Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper, said in a message that \"absent President Trump suddenly choking to death on his McDonald's fries, Canada's relationship with the United States will be the ballot question.\"\n\n\"Poilievre will need to be strong on the US, while at the same time reminding Canadians that they were deeply unhappy before Trump went full psycho, and that the reason for their unhappiness was economic decisions people like Mark Carney had been making about their lives for the past 25 to 30 years,\" MacDougall said.\n\nFour weeks may not seem like much time for Poilievre to turn around his campaign. But polls are imperfect and Canadian history has shown, time and again, that big shifts in momentum can happen in the weeks before a vote.\n\nPoilievre's dilemma in hitting back too hard against Trump is that some of his supporters like the president, too. One attendee at his Thursday rally, Bret Jolliffe, was wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat as he entered the venue, but it was confiscated.\n\nA poll taken in early March by Leger Marketing found that only 11% of Canadians have a favorable impression of Trump. Among Conservative Party supporters, the number was 26%.\n\nAt the start of the year, Poilievre did start to adjust his message to the new dynamic. But he could not resist borrowing a little from Trump's \"America First\" stylings.

      "text": "Conservatives shouldn't dance on Reform's grave\n\nManage your account\n\nWell I did warn you. In December I wrote of possible Tory defections to Reform , that \"the obstacle now isn't so much policy... but rather a sense that Reform is still fragile, not fully organised, vulnerable to leading figures leaving or to simple infighting and chaos.\"\n\nAnd so it has proved. So, what are the implications of this week's row for politics on the Right?\n\nReform first. Like many Tories, I speak to lots of Reform members and supporters . This clearly isn't about, or not only about, the personality clash between Nigel Farage and Rupert Lowe and the unedifying trading of accusations on social media. More important are the underlying disagreements about policy and tone.\n\nReform have attracted not just mainstream conservatives despairing of the Tory Party, but also a different and often younger group , the \"very online Right\", as some call them.\n\nThis group seems ready to flirt with policy ideas which are not really in the mainstream of British politics - for example deportation of non-dual national British citizens, or of those who are guilty of nothing more than a family relationship or association with people involved in the rape gangs.\n\nThere is also sometimes even an element of ethno-nationalism, echoed in the weird discussion of whether Rishi Sunak could call himself English, but also seen in criticism of Farage for pointing out Reform can't be at war with Islam, or in the anti-Muslim tone of some of the sniping at the party chair Zia Yusuf .\n\nEven if Rupert Lowe doesn't endorse all these views - and I don't believe he would - his campaigning certainly seems to be aimed at this group. Happily for the country, but problematically for Reform, it's a tiny group, not one you can build an electoral majority on. Moreover, appealing to it often seems to entail a particular political tone - at best that of pub ranting, at worst a whiff of street politics Tommy Robinson style.\n\nFarage can see that these ideas mean death to Reform's efforts to go mainstream. If you doubt it, look at the rest of Europe, where those populist parties that haven't extirpated such thinking persistently underperform on the day in elections. However angry people are - and I agree they really are - Brits won't vote in any numbers for this. I wouldn't either.\n\nYou don't have to think Nigel Farage is perfect to see that the Farage/Yusuf axis, the plan to keep Reform on the robust but mainstream Right and to organise it into a force capable of getting out the vote, is surely the only possible way of putting it durably on the political scene.\n\nIf they are serious about doing so, then for sure Nigel Farage is going to have to work with a broader team, if he can find one. But does that mean that he needs to work with Rupert Lowe and Ben Habib specifically ? I don't think so.\n\nNow what does this mean for Conservatives? Many will see the Reform row as good news - though let's wait and see what the impact on the polls actually is.\n\nCertainly it may buy some time for Kemi Badenoch by relieving the pressure to match Reform quickly on policy and by scaring off any defections. But what's good news for the Conservative Party is not always, or even necessarily, good news for conservatism.\n\nTo put it bluntly - if the Reform Party did not exist, how conservative do you really think the Conservative Party would be?\n\nAs I have said repeatedly over the last couple of years, there are tremendous reserves of bluster and complacency within what is left of the Party. Without some real world pressure, this could easily come to dominate. We heard it from some in the leadership campaign: \"Labour will mess it up, Reform will blow up, let's just wait for our voters to return and we'll soon be back in our ministerial cars.\"\n\nIt could still happen. But what is the point of the Conservative Party being in power in 2029 if we aren't going to do things that fix the country's problems?\n\nYes, there is lots of outrage about Labour now. But if the Conservative Party comes back by default in four years' time, then unless it is burning with anger and driven by a clear conservative determination to change the country, the temptation will be to drift and to accommodate what's been done.\n\nThat's where Reform is so important to conservatism. It gives genuine conservative voters a choice. It forces the Tory Party to engage with and advocate actual conservative ideas and to develop policy accordingly. It removes the temptation to go Lib Dem and stops conservative voters being taken for granted. Let's hope that's what happens.\n\nFor sure, we don't want a split vote on the Right in 2029. But conservatives also believe in competition. For now, Reform creates a competition to be the best opposition and to provide the best policy mix.\n\nFor those of us who are concerned about getting the policy right, about seizing what may be the last opportunity to get the country onto a more conservative path, that is what really matters.\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

      "text": "Veteran legal conservatives rush to Justice Barrett's defense amid MAGA backlash\n\nManage your account\n\nProminent legal conservatives on Friday sought to tamp down a wave of sudden criticism directed at Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett over her vote to reject President Donald Trump 's attempt to freeze nearly $2 billion in foreign aid.\n\nBarrett, a former appeals court judge and law professor who Trump placed on the bench during his first term, joined Chief Justice John Roberts and the court's three liberals in upholding - for now - a lower court ruling that required the administration to quickly spend the contested aid.\n\nThe backlash over that decision from some Trump allies was swift, with one prominent conservative describing Barrett on a podcast as a \"rattled law professor with her head up her a**.\" Others took to social media to describe her as a \"DEI hire\" and \"evil.\"\n\nTrump has scored many significant wins on a court that is the most conservative it has been in decades, with six of nine justices nominated by Republican presidents, including three Trump himself picked. But he's also regularly lost , including with the first two emergency appeals to reach the high court in his second term.\n\nSeveral well-known conservatives who for years have sought to push the law to the right told CNN that the criticism was an overreaction to a relatively modest ruling that simply kept the fight over foreign aid percolating in lower federal courts. The majority did not indicate how it would vote in the likely event that the case makes it back to the Supreme Court - possibly in a few weeks.\n\nThe reaction appeared to be at least partly a response to a sharply worded dissent from Justice Samuel Alito who accused a lower court that sided against Trump of \"judicial hubris.\" Three other conservatives - Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh - joined that opinion.\n\nLeonard Leo, a prominent conservative legal advocate and board co-chairman of the influential Federalist Society, told CNN he felt that Alito's dissent was \"persuasive\" and that the stalwart conservative and former prosecutor \"had the better argument.\"\n\nBut, Leo added, \"that doesn't mean that Justice Barrett isn't among the most distinguished conservative jurists of the past 100 years.\"\n\n\"She's been in the vanguard of conservative jurisprudence on abortion, racial preferences, the administrative state, religious freedom, Trump immunity, guns and the Second Amendment,\" said Leo, who advised Trump on Supreme Court nominees during the president's first term.\n\nThe quarrel in the foreign aid spending case, he said, was \"a procedural disagreement - and those things happen quite often among conservative justices.\"\n\nEd Whelan, a conservative legal commentator, described Barrett as \"an outstanding justice\" and said the \"criticisms of her are myopic.\"\n\nBarrett was viewed as a hero to the conservative legal movement just a few years ago. Weeks after taking her seat, the court shifted positions in a series of emergency cases dealing with how Covid-19 crowd restrictions applied to churches and synagogues. Before liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, the court upheld those restrictions. Once Barrett was in place, it began striking most of them down.\n\nA little more than a year later, Barrett joined her conservative colleagues in overturning Roe v. Wade and significantly expanding Americans' rights under the Second Amendment.\n\nLast summer, she was one of six justices who voted to grant Trump sweeping immunity from criminal prosecution for official actions - though she did write a concurring opinion suggesting she thought the case could have been decided more narrowly in Trump's favor.\n\nBarrett voted with the court's two most conservative justices - Thomas and Alito - more than 80% of the time in the term that ended last year, according to data compiled by the Empirical SCOTUS blog . She was slightly more likely to side with Roberts and Kavanaugh, two conservatives who are often viewed as sitting at the court's ideological center. Roberts in particular has also faced sharp scorn from the right in recent years, even though he remains a reliable vote for conservative outcomes.\n\nBy comparison, Barrett voted with Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the court's senior liberal, less than 70% of the time.\n\nBoth during oral arguments and in her opinions, Barrett often displays a penchant for delving into procedural issues. Among the conservative wing, she has appeared the most concerned about use of the court's emergency docket to decide sweeping questions with national implications.\n\nIn one of the court's first significant early opinions this year, Barrett joined a mix of liberals and conservatives in backing a death row inmate in Oklahoma who the Republican attorney general said was entitled to a new trial in light of withheld evidence. But she moved to the right of Kavanaugh and Roberts in that case, saying that she would have sent the matter back to a lower court for further consideration rather than throwing out the conviction.\n\nBut there have other recent examples in which Barrett has veered to the left. Barrett, joined by three liberals, partially dissented in a decision Tuesday about the Environmental Protection Agency's ability to police sewage that can flow into the Pacific Ocean after San Francisco experiences heavy rainstorms.\n\nHiram Sasser, executive general counsel for First Liberty Institute, a group that has brought successful religious appeals to the Supreme Court, noted that the foreign aid case was in a very preliminary posture.\n\n\"It's hard to read into procedural decisions where someone is going to be on the substantive part of the issue,\" Sasser told CNN.\n\nSasser recalled that his group suffered an initial setback at the Supreme Court when it was representing Joe Kennedy, a high school football coach who lost his job after leading prayers on the 50-yard line after games. The court initially turned away Kennedy's appeal.\n\nIn 2022, when the case was ultimately decided, Kennedy won with a 6-3 majority that included both Barrett and Roberts.\n\n\"We overturned a 50-year-old precedent in a landmark win, but it started off with what was a technical, procedural loss,\" he said. \"I wouldn't forecast anything other than what President Trump just learned is exactly what we learned in the Coach Kennedy case: He's got four votes.\"\n\nThat means to get a majority, Sasser noted, Trump \"only needs one more.\"\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com"

      "text": "\"What's the point of having Congress?\": Even some conservatives now say it's a constitutional crisis\n\nManage your account\n\nWhile the vast majority of elected Republicans are in lockstep support of Elon Musk's attack on government agencies, some conservative scholars say the South African billionaire is creating a constitutional crisis as he arrogates the authority of Congress to determine federal spending, one that becomes more concerning as long as it continues unchecked by other branches of government.\n\nMusk and his cadre of young adult aides, acting without the approval of Congress, have gained access to the U.S. Treasury's payment system and brought operations at the U.S. Agency for International Development to a screeching halt this week. Musk's stated aim is cutting federal spending, which legal experts say can only be done by Congress using its constitutional power of the purse.\n\n\"The Trump administration has essentially declared war on Article I of the Constitution,\" Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the right-wing Manhattan Institute and former aid to retired Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said in an interview with Salon.\n\nUnder Article 1 , the House of Representatives is charged with passing legislation to raise federal revenues and Congress is changed with passing laws to manage appropriations. \"No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law,\" it states. At the constitutional convention, delegate Elbridge Gerry noted that this power was entrusted with the House because its members were \"representatives of the people\" and \"it was a maxim that the people ought to hold the purse-strings,\" as noted by an official congressional history of the debate.\n\nAs Riedl explained, under the Constitution the president has the authority only to \"temporarily delay\" payments as long as Congress is notified and as long as the president is not materially changing the statutory meaning of the underlying law. In the case of Musk and the extralegal Department of Government Efficiency, Riedl said, the Trump administration is usurping its constitutional authority..\n\n\"Clearly, they're looking to blow up the underlying structure of the programs and they're looking to stop payments indefinitely,\" Riedl said. \"This makes it an impoundment.\"\n\n\" Impoundment \" refers to the power of a president to not spend money allocated by Congress and it is regulated not just by the Constitution but by the 1974 Impoundment Control Act, which emphasized that a president would need congressional approval to legally impound funds.\n\nThe one-time and likely future head of Trump's Office of Management and Budget, Russ Vought, has been a longtime critic of the existing law restricting the power of impoundment and has repeatedly stated, as has Trump, that the legislation banning is unconstitutional. In Riedl's opinion, the current strategy by Musk and Trump is designed to get the issue before the Supreme Court, where conservatives hold a 6-3 majority.\n\nThe issue with the Trump and Vought view of impoundment, per Riedl, is that it would cede even more power from Congress while even further empowering the president - and empowering a president who does not have to face the voters again at that.\n\n\"The constitution put Congress in Article 1 because Congress is designed to be the primary branch. It's the closest to the people. Its elections are the most often, and it ensures that no single person will have the power of the purse,\" Riedl said. \"If Congress isn't going to have the power of the purse - they've already surrendered the power of tariffs and declaring war - what's the point of having Congress?\"\n\nRiedl isn't the only conservative raising alarms. Alan Cole, a senior economist at another conservative think tank, the Tax Foundation, expressed concern over Musk's maneuvering in a social media post earlier this week, saying that \"I don't mind cutting USAID significantly\" but that \"the process for it is a genuine constitutional crisis.\" He added that those supportive of cuts should pass a law if they want to do so. Even in the opinion columns of the Wall Street Journal, a typically Trump-friendly environment, critics are pointing out that Trump doesn't have the authority to unilaterally shutter USAID without an act of Congress.\n\n\"Impoundment has become popular in Republican circles because they have not been able to successfully pass their ideas democratically,\" Riedl said. \"What they can't do democratically they are now trying to do via illegal executive fiat and do an end run around Congress.\"\n\nPhilip Wallach, a senior fellow focusing on Congress and the separation of powers at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, told Salon that he is also concerned about impoundment. \"It really doesn't make sense structurally\" for the president to have such a radical power, he argued.\n\n\"As many people have pointed out, how do you negotiate a deal on spending if the president can subsequently renegotiate the terms of the deal, at least in a downward direction?\" Wallach asked. \"You just don't get to change the law by one branch's unilateral action.\"\n\nWallach also said that the legal footing of DOGE was unclear and that, despite the body being part of the Executive Office of the President, it seemed to be a sort of \"floating brand name\" for people engaging in \"legally questionable\" activity. Much of the roughshod and potentially illegal action taken in the name of DOGE, Wallach noted, appears to follow in the mold of a business like SpaceX, where the CEO can essentially act unilaterally.\n\n\"What's strange about it is if they want to win on the impoundment stuff you would expect them to be a little more deliberate about it. Right now their approach is more haphazard like spraying buckshot all over the place,\" Wallach said. \"It's always seemed to me that Donald Trump cares very little for the constitutional separation of powers and Elon Musk seems to care even less.\"\n\nWallach said that it remains to be seen whether Congress will stand up to Trump and reassert its authority over budgetary matters. As it stands, though, Republicans in Congress are running cover for the president and the billionaire who appears to be setting the agenda for him.\n\nNOTUS, a nonprofit media outlet, recently reported Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., as saying that Musk is \"doing exactly what he should be doing\" by \"going through every agency and looking at how to make sure the money's spent right.\"\n\n\"It doesn't look like Congress is doing their job,\" Scott said when asked about the issue that this is, constitutionally speaking, a job for elected lawmakers.\n\nAnother senior Republican, Sen. Thom Tillis, R- N.C., acknowledged that Musk and Trump's actions were unconstitutional but said that \"nobody should bellyache about that.\"\n\n\"That runs afoul of the Constitution in the strictest sense,\" Tillis told NOTUS. But \"it's not uncommon for presidents to flex a little bit on where they can spend and where they can stop spending.\"\n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter , Crash Course.\n\nWhile other Republicans have expressed some concern over Musk's DOGE and Trump's approval of it, it's not clear that any of them are ready to take the sort of action that would be required to put a stop to DOGE's machinations.\n\nRichard Painter, an attorney who served as a White House lawyer for former President George W. Bush's administration, told Salon: \"The founders intended for Congress to be the principal branch of government as the representative of the people.\" What's currently happening with Musk and DOGE is antithetical to that vision, he argued.\n\nPainter said that many members of Congress \"don't want to say no to it but they wouldn't say yes to it,\" in reference to the austere cuts Musk is trying to impose with DOGE. He added that the Republicans supporting Musk in this endeavor are choosing to act in the interest of Trump and their political party, rather than in the interest of Congress as a branch of government.\n\n\"Members of the president's political party in the House and Senate are going to marginalize themselves if they continue to put up with this. At some point, they're going to have to say 'no' and have an investigation and look into what Musk is doing,\" Painter said.\n\nPainter flagged another looming Constitutional crisis. What happens if the president and the executive branch refuse to obey a court order? Already, the Trump administration's Justice Department has indicated that it doesn't believe it is obligated to follow a court order blocking Trump's federal funding freeze, saying that the order \"only challenged the OMB memorandum\" and does not bar \"the President or his advisors from communicating with federal agencies or the public about the President's priorities regarding federal spending.\"\n\n\"We haven't had a president refuse to obey a Supreme Court order,\" Painter said. \"But if this keeps going on a president is going to say 'What's all this Marbury v. Madison business and judicial review?' At the end of the day, there's only one branch with control of an army and that's the executive branch and the president.\""

      "text": "Opinion: Conservatives like me fear Trump will break through guardrails that restrained him last time\n\nManage your account\n\nPresident-elect Trump's imminent return to the White House sparks a pressing question: Can the guardrails of American democracy survive another four years of the only U.S. president who sought to undermine the peaceful transfer of power?\n\nMany of us on the center-right are worried the answer will be \"no.\" After all, conservatism, at its core, is about conserving the institutions, traditions and hard-won lessons of history.\n\nThe guardrails face a tougher test with Trump's second term. In 2016, his inexperience and the presence of structural safeguards and institutionalists - military officers, establishment Republicans and professional bureaucrats - helped check his worst impulses. In 2025, Trump and his allies are better equipped to evade resistance. He has vowed to purge dissenters and surround himself with loyalists who have learned how to manipulate the levers of power.\n\nAs author and former George W. Bush speechwriter David Frum warned (alluding to the movie \"Jurassic Park\"), \"This time, the Velociraptors have figured out how to work the doorknobs.\" Trump's proposed Cabinet picks underscore this shift: Kash Patel, who has openly outlined an enemies list in his book \"Government Gangsters,\" is slated to head the FBI, while former \"Fox News Weekend\" co-host Pete Hegseth, a staunch ally, is poised to lead the Department of Defense. These appointments signal a deliberate strategy to consolidate power and weaken institutional checks.\n\nMeanwhile, as Trump returns to power, he is now backed by a Republican Party reshaped in his image. Critics like former Rep. Liz Cheney and former Sen. Mitt Romney have been pushed out (the former lost a primary, the latter retired). Figures such as Sen. Mitch McConnell are too diminished to offer meaningful resistance. Former establishment Republicans, like Rep. Elise Stefanik, have fully embraced the MAGA agenda, completing the party's transformation into a vehicle for Trump's ambitions.\n\nOutside of politics, the media and major institutions are also faltering as counterweights. Some, unable to stop Trump in the past, are now accommodating him. Settlements like ABC News' payment to resolve Trump-related defamation claims risk chilling critical reporting (host George Stephanopoulos erroneously said Trump was found liable for rape because he forced himself on writer E. Jean Carroll in a dressing room in 1996, but under New York law the term for Trump's offense is \"sexual abuse\"). Social media platforms like Meta seem to be aligning their policies with Trump's base, for instance by eliminating a fact-checking system that was instituted after Facebook was used to boost the Trump campaign in 2016.\n\nThe courts have long served as a vital bulwark of democracy, but questions remain about how long that role can endure. The actions of Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, whose rulings and maneuverings in the classified documents case appear to favor Trump, raise concerns about judicial impartiality. Further amplifying these worries are recent examples of potential conflicts of interest involving Republican-appointed Supreme Court justices, such as Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr., as well as controversies surrounding their spouses' political activities.\n\nPresident Biden has touted his judicial appointees as defenders of the rule of law, and in a recent ceremony, he boasted : \"These judges also are a vital check on the excesses of - of other branches of government, including Congress and the executive branch when they overreach and run afoul of the constitutional and institutional safeguards.\" Time will tell how effective Biden's appointees will be at holding the executive branch accountable.\n\nThe risks are clear: intimidation and co-option of dissenters, consolidation of power within law enforcement and the military, and systematic weakening of democratic foundations.\n\nSome will dismiss these concerns as hysteria. But conservatives are supposed to sound the alarm when traditional institutions are threatened. Not long ago, for example, many conservatives worried that liberal \"social engineering\" policies like redefining the institution of marriage or allowing women to serve in combat roles might begin to erode America's foundational structures.\n\nIt is ironic that many of the same conservatives have little concern about preserving fundamental principles like the rule of law and the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nSo what should those of us who are concerned about Trump's strongman tendencies do?\n\nFirst, reject hysteria - rhetorical warnings about \"fascism\" have proven ineffective at swaying voters, at least so far. We shouldn't so easily take the bait when Trump trolls us, for example, by saying he wants to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the \"Gulf of America.\"\n\nBut complacency is equally dangerous. Trump's return offers an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to democracy and push back against his most harmful impulses. To do so is not to be hysterical, but to be interested in preserving the \"last best hope of Earth,\" as Abraham Lincoln put it.\n\nFormer Vice President Dick Cheney's \" One Percent Doctrine \" held that even a 1% chance of terrorists obtaining a nuclear weapon warranted treating that existential threat as a certainty. By that logic, the slim possibility of Trump finding a way to remain in office beyond 2028 demands serious attention.\n\nThis isn't a perfect analogy, nor is it a call for panic or extreme measures. Rather, it's a call for sobriety and vigilance - particularly given Trump's ongoing efforts to erode the norms and institutions that have safeguarded our democracy.\n\nAs Ronald Reagan warned, \"Freedom is a fragile thing, and it's never more than one generation away from extinction.\"\n\nToday, those words resonate as both a reminder and a warning. It's up to us to protect the democratic institutions that safeguard our liberty - for this generation and the next.\n\nMatt K. Lewis is the author of \"Filthy Rich Politicians\" and \"Too Dumb to Fail.\"\n\nIf it's in the news right now, the L.A. Times' Opinion section covers it.

      "text": "Conservatives Pitch Canada 'Energy Corridor' to End US Reliance\n\nManage your account\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre vowed to fast-track approvals for necessary infrastructure to transport Canadian energy domestically and abroad without going through the US.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nGold-Rush Fever Returns to Historic New Zealand Mining Town\n\nWhat Frank Lloyd Wright Learned From the Desert\n\nBank Regulators Fight for Desks as OCC Returns to New York Tower\n\nThese US Bridges Face High Risk of Catastrophic Ship Strikes\n\nCharter Schools, Colleges Push Muni Debt Distress Near Record\n\nA Conservative government would create a so-called national energy corridor through which companies could build transmission lines, railways and pipelines, according to a statement from Poilievre's campaign Monday. Provincial and local governments would provide \"legally binding commitments\" allowing companies to use the corridor, the party said, without outlining what steps the federal government would take if those other levels of government refused to do so.\n\n\"This means investors will no longer face the endless regulatory limbo that has made Canadians poorer,\" Poilievre said in a statement. \"It will bring billions of dollars of new investment into Canada's economy, create powerful paychecks for Canadian workers, and restore our economic independence.\"\n\nIt's the latest pledge from Poilievre, who's trying to rebuild momentum for his campaign ahead of a general election on April 28. His chief rival, Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney, is enjoying a surge of support amid US President Donald Trump's tariff and annexation threats.\n\nLast year, Canada exported nearly all of its crude oil to the US. Poilievre has blamed the Liberal government for restricting Canadian energy projects, leaving the country dependent on its southern neighbor. A key plank of the Conservative platform is to scrap a law banning new pipelines and boost resources production.\n\nThe Liberal government financed the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline, Canada's only crude oil pipeline that goes to an ocean port, allowing for more exports to Asia. The larger line entered service last year.\n\nThe Liberals, who are now leading in opinion polls, on Friday pitched similar plans to diversify Canadian trade away from the US. A so-called Trade Diversification Corridor Fund would spend C$5 billion ($3.5 billion) to accelerate construction of ports, railroads, highways and airports.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nTrump's IRS Cuts Are Tempting Taxpayers to Cheat\n\nGoogle Is Searching for an Answer to ChatGPT\n\nIsrael Aims to Be the World's Arms Dealer\n\nBusiness Schools Are Back\n\nHow a US Maker of Rat-Proof Trash Bins Got Boxed in by Trump's Tariffs\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P."

      "text": "Opinion - Conservatives have what we need to transform America - here's how to find it\n\nManage your account\n\nThe Democratic stranglehold on the black and working-class vote has finally been broken, at least for the moment. A full-standing army of celebrities, entertainers, and mainstream media pundits were not able to bully Americans into disregarding out-of-control inflation and spiking violent crime.\n\nNow Republicans have a narrow window of opportunity to deliver where their predecessors have failed, by reducing crime without brutalizing lower-income populations and putting forth a vision for upward mobility that goes beyond just slashing government programs.\n\nAnyone who wants to cut government spending - and I am one of those people - needs to support robust indigenous mediating structures. These are local institutions created by those experiencing the problem of poverty or crime. They are antibodies within socially toxic neighborhoods that have demonstrated they can successfully administer cures from within.\n\nThankfully, the capacity building needed to develop these kinds of organizations requires just a fraction of the capital that government programs do and can be achieved completely with private money.\n\nThese organizations also overwhelmingly embody traditional values that have helped many people overcome oppression, poverty and other hardships, hard work, self-respect and responsibility among them.\n\nYet these groups are out of favor with political elites on both sides of the aisle.\n\nConservatives tend to overlook these groups because they often prefer making intellectual arguments about the problems at hand, offering abstract policy proposals or dissecting moral and political failures philosophically.\n\nLeftists, on the other hand, treat the poor as fundamentally incapable of self-elevation. They claim they speak for the people trying to buck the oppressive social-service state, but ignore the related facts that they're often part of the problem - and that traditional values are part of the solution.\n\nConsider the fall of communism in Eastern Europe, and the institutions that sprang up in its wake.\n\nMediating civil society institutions began delivering services to and representing people better than the government did, near the end of the Communist regimes - and in doing so, won the loyalties of the people.\n\nThe Charter '77 in Czechoslovakia, a protest document signed mostly by intellectuals but strongly supported by the public, helped galvanize the public and some political leadership against the state's violations of human rights.\n\nSolidarity, a Polish trade union, became so influential that it helped end Communism in Poland and its leader was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. It had more than 10 million members by the end of its first year, in 1981.\n\nMemorial is a non-profit that arose in Russia during the fall of the Soviet Union partly in protest of the decades-long abuses of the USSR. Its status and activities are still aggressively disputed by the Russian government, a testament to the Russian people's great need for its work.\n\nEach of these organizations parlayed popular trust and favor into political capital abroad. Conservatives in the U.S., as well as other sympathetic factions, supported these institutions in Eastern Europe. The Iron Curtain fell, finally - and these groups helped provide an alternative to the sprawling, oppressive state.\n\nFor the incoming administration, these are some real-life examples of success that can be replicated today at scale. They exist even today.\n\nThe \" Cajun Navy ,\" organized in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and formed again to help after subsequent storms, has rescued as many as 10,000 people stranded on rooftops.\n\nToday, when hurricanes sweep through the Delta and Gulf Coast, these same fishermen and a growing network of volunteer members continue rescuing people from the tops of their roofs. It's a huge organization, but remarkably swift and effective. It's on-site before FEMA arrives, even though it is entirely volunteer-run.\n\nRev. Charlene Turner Johnson has been working for decades to change Highland Park, one of the most vulnerable, drug-afflicted cities in Michigan, into a safe and flourishing town. She helps the most vulnerable find work, build businesses, acquire important life skills, and renovate the city.\n\nKandice Freeman, founder of \" Way to Live ,\" is using a grant to help reduce gun violence in her community and improve the physical health of the children in her area. Her unique approach combines education, intervention and food access events to do its work.\n\nThe common threads that run through all these success stories are that the leaders live in the very zip codes they serve, not in some affluent suburb. They know best what needs to be done, they have the trust of the people they're helping, and they know their way around the problem and the solution.\n\nThe key is not an administrative state so big that it crushes these groups with regulations. Neither is it a hands-off approach, claiming that tax cuts and deregulation will simply solve everything. Our political leaders should rather be finding these successful mediating institutions and actively connecting them to resources in the public and private sectors to replicate their successes at scale.\n\nEmpowering men and women doing this kind of work transforms communities and lives in a way no white paper or government program ever could.\n\nThat's why it's time to abandon the reigning model of identity politics and massive nonprofits that purport to speak for the poor but simply profit off of activism. Seek out and empower the men and women who are already changing the world - and then give them what they need to do it better. If conservative donors are serious about real solutions, that is what they will do.\n\nIf they are not, then they should be prepared to switch places with the Democrats and be thrown out in the next election.\n\nBob Woodson is the founder and president of The Woodson Center and the editor of \" A Pathway to American Renewal: Red, White, and Black Volume II .\"\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

      "text": "Who is Pierre Poilievre, the Canadian conservative aiming to end Liberal era?\n\nAt 20 years old, Pierre Poilievre already had a roadmap for Canada.\n\nCanada's Conservative Party leader - now 45 - laid out a low-tax, small government vision for the country in an essay contest on what he would do as prime minister.\n\n\"A dollar left in the hands of consumers and investors is more productive than a dollar spent by a politician,\" he stated.\n\nPoilievre is now one step closer to making his vision a reality, and even gave a nod to the essay in a recent interview with conservative psychologist and commentator Jordan Peterson.\n\nFor Canadians frustrated with a sluggish economy and a housing and affordability crisis, Poilievre has promised a return to \"common sense politics\", and offered an alternative to what he labelled as former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's \"authoritarian socialism\".\n\nHe now finds himself facing a different political foe, new Liberal leader and Prime Minister Mark Carney.\n\nWhile Poilievre's Conservatives have enjoyed a large lead over the struggling Trudeau Liberals in national surveys for months, support for the Liberals has shot up following Trudeau's resignation.\n\nNow the outcome of the general election is a significantly tighter race.\n\nStill, Poilievre's message is resonating in parts of Canadian society, as his campaign continues to draw large crowds across the country.\n\nCritics have painted him as a sort of Donald Trump \"light\" - a parallel that has become a liability amid Trump's trade war and musings about a \"51st state\".\n\nPoilievre has sought to distance himself from the US president, positioning himself as a \"tough guy\" who can take on Trump, and has pointed to his modest upbringing as one of the differences.\n\nPoilievre was born in Canada's western province of Alberta to a 16-year-old mother who put him up for adoption. He was taken in by two school teachers, who raised him in suburban Calgary.\n\n\"I have always believed that it is voluntary generosity among family and community that are the greatest social safety net that we can ever have,\" he told Maclean's Magazine in 2022, reflecting on his early life.\n\n\"That's kind of my starting point.\"\n\nAs a teenager, Poilievre showed an early interest in politics, and canvassed for local conservatives.\n\nPoilievre was studying international relations at the University of Calgary when he met Stockwell Day, who served as a cabinet minister under former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper.\n\nAt the time, Day was seeking the leadership of the Canadian Alliance - a right-wing party with Alberta roots that became part of the modern-day Conservatives in a 2003 merger - and he tapped Poilievre to help with campus outreach.\n\n\"He impressed me from the start,\" Day told the BBC in an interview. \"He seemed to be a level-headed guy, but full of energy and able to catch people's attention.\"\n\nDay's leadership bid was successful, and he set out for Ottawa with Poilievre as his assistant. Some time after, Poilievre walked into his office on a cold winter night to ask his opinion about potentially running for office.\n\nPoilievre went on to win a seat in Ottawa in 2004 at the age of 25, making him one of the youngest elected Conservatives at the time. He has held that seat since.\n\nIn Ottawa, Poilievre was given the nickname Skippy by peers and foes alike due to to his youthful enthusiasm and sharp tongue.\n\nHe built a reputation for being \"highly combative and partisan\", said Randy Besco, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Toronto.\n\nBehind the closed doors of Conservative caucus meetings, Poilievre showed his diplomatic side, Day said.\n\n\"Pierre was always good at saying, 'Okay, you know what? I hadn't thought of that,' or he would listen and say: 'Have you thought of this?'\" said Day.\n\nStill, confrontational politics became a cornerstone of Poilievre's public persona. After becoming Conservative leader in 2022, he would target Trudeau with biting remarks as a way to connect with disaffected voters.\n\nIt has landed him in trouble at times. In April, he was expelled from the House of Commons for calling the former prime minister a \"wacko\".\n\nPoilievre told the Montreal Gazette in June that he is a fan of \"straight talk\".\n\n\"I think when politesse is in conflict with the truth, I choose the truth,\" he said. \"I think we've been too polite for too long with our political class.\"\n\nHis combative style has also been divisive, and he has been criticised for oversimplifying complex issues for political gain.\n\nWhile Canadians have been open to the opposition leader's message as a change from Trudeau's brand of progressive politics, just under half of them hold an unfavourable opinion of him, according to a recent poll.\n\nPoilievre has also had to shift his sights since Trudeau's resignation to get ahead of the inevitable match-up between him and Carney.\n\nThe Conservative leader has been described as a \"soft\" populist for his direct appeals to everyday Canadians and criticism of establishment elites, including corporate Canada.\n\nIt has been pointed out as a weakness by his critics, as the bulk of Canadians have become angry and frustrated with another well-known, nearby populist - Donald Trump.\n\nCanadians priorities have shifted since the Trump administration launched a trade war against Canada, with the relationship between the two countries now the top of mind for voters.\n\nIt has forced Poilievre, who had not stepped much into foreign policy prior, to pivot. He has since pushed back at Trump's comments suggesting Canada become a 51st US state, vowing to \"put Canada first\".\n\n\"While Canadians are slow to anger and quick to forgive, once provoked, we fight back. And we will fight back,\" Poilievre has said in an address directed at Trump.\n\nTrump has disparaged the Conservative leader in response, telling the UK magazine The Spectator that he is not \"MAGA enough.\" In an interview with Fox News, Trump said that Poilievre is \"stupidly no friend of mine\".\n\nOn domestic issues, Poilievre has pledged to deliver \"the biggest crackdown on crime in Canadian history\", promising to keep repeat offenders behind bars.\n\nHe also came out in support of those who protested vaccine mandates during the 2021 \"Freedom Convoy\" demonstrations that gridlocked Ottawa for weeks.\n\nOn social matters, he has rarely weighed in - something Prof Besco said is typical of senior Conservatives, who see these topics as \"a losing issue\".\n\nWhile Poilievre voted against legalising gay marriage in the early 2000s, he has recently said it will remain legal \"full stop\" if he is elected.\n\nThe Conservatives also do not support legislation to regulate abortion, though they allow MPs to vote freely on the issue.\n\n\"There will be no laws or other restrictions imposed on a woman's right to decide to do with her body as she wishes,\" Poilievre said in April. \"And that is something that I am guaranteeing to you and to all Canadians.\"\n\nAmid a public debate in Canada in recent months on immigration, the Conservative party has said it would tie levels of newcomers to the number of new homes built, and focus on bringing in skilled workers.\n\nPoilievre's wife, Anaida, arrived in Canada as a child refugee from Caracas, Venezuela.\n\nThe Conservative leader has pushed for the integration of newcomers, saying Canada does not need to be a \"hyphenated society\".\n\nOne of his major promises - to cut the industrial carbon pricing programme, arguing it is a financial burden for families - has raised questions over how his government would tackle pressing issues like climate change.\n\nLiberal leader Carney scrapped the unpopular consumer carbon tax this month, shortly after being sworn in.\n\nAbove all, Poilievre has said that he wants to do away with \"grandiosity\" and \"utopian wokesim\" that he believes has defined the Trudeau era, in favour of the \"the things that are grand and great about the common people\".\n\n\"I've been saying precisely the same thing this entire time,\" he told Mr Peterson.\n\nAfter a campaign upended by Trump's threats, the Liberals hope they can hold onto power.\n\nGhayda and her husband Ahmad say they could never discuss politics in Syria - now, they will vote in Canada's election.\n\nCanadians will vote on April 28. Here is a breakdown of who could be the country's  next prime minister.\n\nAccording to Canadian law, a mistrial can be declared if there is a \"real danger that trial fairness has been compromised\".\n\nThe BBC asked people in Washington DC if they follow Canadian politics and about the future of US-Canada relations.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Conservative manifesto: 12 key policies analysed\n\nThe Conservatives have launched their 2024 election manifesto. The document sets out what the party's plans would be, should it win the election on 4 July.\n\nHere are some of the most eye-catching pledges.\n\nRishi Sunak says he wants to \"build an ownership society\", but admitted that owning a home has become more difficult, in a BBC interview ahead of the manifesto launch . He's set an ambitious goal of building 1.6 million homes in England in five years. However, previous targets have regularly been missed.\n\nPart of the plan to get people onto the property ladder is a resurrection of the Help to Buy scheme, which would provide first-time buyers with an equity loan of up to 20% towards the cost of one of these new homes. However, in the past these schemes have been criticised for pushing up house prices and benefitting developers rather than buyers.\n\nThen there's making permanent the stamp duty threshold of £425,000 in England and Northern Ireland for first-time buyers. It means that about eight in 10 first-time buyers do not pay stamp duty, Zoopla figures show.\n\nFor renters, there is a commitment to eventually ban no-fault evictions, a policy first proposed by the party in 2019 , but which has been delayed. And there's a two-year tax-break to allow landlords to sell to existing tenants, but landlord groups say it doesn't address shortages in homes available to let.\n\nOne manifesto surprise is the abolition of National Insurance (NI) for the self-employed. Currently they pay 6% on profits between £12,570 and £50,270 and 2% above £50,270. There are more than four million self-employed people, so it is understandable why the Conservatives want to offer something.\n\nThe cut is promised by the end of the next Parliament and will cost £2.6bn a year. This comes on top of the £5bn a year cost of reducing NI for employees by a further 2p by 2027, in addition to the 4p already cut in 2024 .\n\nThere is also a promise to increase the personal tax-free allowance for pensioners. This would mean future rises in the state pension - by the higher of wage rises, inflation or 2.5% (the triple lock) - will not be hit by income tax. People below pension age will pay more tax on their incomes over the next Parliament, as both the Conservatives and Labour have said they will maintain the freeze imposed when Rishi Sunak was chancellor on income tax thresholds.\n\nMr Sunak says these tax cuts will be paid for by a £6bn a year crackdown on tax avoidance and cutting the welfare bill by £12bn a year by the end of the next Parliament. Both savings are thought uncertain at best and unlikely at worst by analysts including the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank.\n\nThis would apply to the whole of the UK.\n\nThe Conservatives are pledging to toughen sentences for offences including knife crime, grooming and assaults against retail workers. But prisons have an overcrowding crisis, with officials expecting jails in England and Wales to be at full capacity over the next few weeks. This raises questions as to where these criminals would go.  Prisoners are already being released early to free up space. In a 2021 White Paper the Tories promised to deliver 20,000 new prison places by the mid 2020s, described as the biggest prison-building programme in over a century. However that target has not been met, with 6,000 new places created so far. The new manifesto pledge promises four new prisons to complete this programme by 2030.\n\nThe party wants to show they are tough on crime - a stance that usually does well with its traditional supporters. It's pledged to increase the number of community police officers by 8,000. However, some in policing tell us it's one thing wanting to hire more officers but it's another thing retaining them.\n\nIn April, the Metropolitan Police Federation suggested nearly a third of officers intended to resign because of low pay and morale. Recent scandals - from WhatsApp groups revealing racist views to the murder of Sarah Everard in London by a serving police officer - have all impacted recruitment, retention and morale.\n\nThis would apply to England and Wales.\n\nThe manifesto underlines the plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda, saying there will be a \"regular rhythm of flights every month, starting this July\". It's possible the Rwanda scheme could make it through the courts and take off but it is very difficult to see how a regular rhythm will be achieved so soon.\n\nMinisters have already delayed the date for the first theoretical flight to no earlier than 24 July. Judges in London are grappling with around a dozen potentially major challenges, all of which could go to the Supreme Court.\n\nAnd on top of that the UK's deal with Rwanda only seems to cover, for now, sending 300 migrants. That's less than half the number who have arrived across the English Channel this month alone. Official figures show that sending 300 people will mean the UK would pay Rwanda £541m over five years - or £1.8m per transferred individual. We don't know how much more the government has set aside if it wants monthly flights to become a reality.\n\nThis would apply to the whole of the UK.\n\nA big theme of the Conservative campaign is the promise of security. At the heart of that is a commitment to spend 2.5% of GDP on defence spending. The current NATO target is 2% .\n\nThe manifesto talks variously about meeting the new target \"by\" or \"in\" 2030. Privately, Conservative sources made clear they planned to raise defence spending cumulatively year on year.\n\nTheir aim is to contrast themselves with Labour which is promising to meet the 2.5% target, but only when economic circumstances allow. The Tories are trying to suggest to voters that backing Labour would be a risk. Mr Sunak claimed only the Tories could keep Britain safe, in contrast to what he called \"an uncertain Keir Starmer\".\n\nThis would apply to the whole of the UK.\n\nThe Conservatives' promise to close university courses in England with high drop-out rates - or which leave graduates no better off - builds on existing powers.  The Office for Students, which regulates universities, already acts if courses fall below quality thresholds. It estimates this applies to no more than 3% of current students. If potential graduate earnings are taken into account, more courses might fall into this category.\n\nThe party wants to fund 100,000 extra apprenticeships a year by the end of the next Parliament instead. This can only happen if employers want to create them.\n\nIn schools, there's a firm focus on parents' concerns, including requiring schools to ban the use of mobile phones during the school day. The Conservatives are also pointing to their record on improving maths and reading compared with other countries. Schools, meanwhile, are preoccupied with their stagnating budgets to maintain standards. Per-pupil funding in England is just above 2010 levels, so the promise of keeping up with inflation in the next Parliament will be welcomed.\n\nEducation is devolved so these policies would only apply in England.\n\nBBC experts analyse other manifestos\n\nThe Conservatives continue to attempt to walk a thin line on climate. They say they'll meet their goal of reaching net zero by 2050 but without what Rishi Sunak calls \"unaffordable eco-zealotry\".\n\nThe challenge is the Climate Change Committee, the UK's independent watchdog on climate, has already warned that the UK isn't on track to meet its ambitious promise to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 68% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2030.\n\nThey're adamant there will be no new green levies or charges and promise any big new decisions on climate will be put to a vote in Parliament. Local communities will be able to vote on new onshore wind projects and low traffic neighbourhoods.\n\nBut at the same time, they say they will accelerate the rollout of renewables - trebling offshore wind, for example - and will approve new small \"modular\" nuclear power stations.\n\nThis would apply to the whole of the UK.\n\nThe Conservatives say they would pay for £17bn of tax cuts by 2030, including cutting National Insurance for the self-employed, by making savings elsewhere. Like all manifestos, the numbers are based on the party's assumptions - and so open to question.\n\nCrucially, the Tories want to save £12bn by reforming welfare payments, through reforms. But previous attempts indicate curbing the bill for disability related benefits in particular is tricky. The number not working due to long-term sickness is at a high of 2.8 million.\n\nEqually uncertain is the money which can be saved by clamping down on those who underpay taxes.\n\nBy primarily squeezing spending plans to fund tax pledges, the Tories hope to promote a tax-cutting agenda. But look at all taxes and plans already in train - the freezing of tax thresholds - and the tax burden, revenue relative to the economy's income, is still set to rise to its highest since 1948.\n\nMeanwhile, funding spending pledges such as bolstering defence involves plans to cut the civil service headcount to save £3.9bn. Whitehall numbers swelled amid a pandemic and as negotiators worked on post-Brexit trade deals. But those cuts may be too ambitious - as might be plans to save £550m by cutting 5,500 NHS managers.\n\nThis would apply to the whole of the UK.\n\nThe Conservatives say they would introduce a three-strikes-and-you're-out policy to make it easier for social housing landlords to evict tenants guilty of anti-social behaviour.\n\nThe manifesto also promises new \"local connection\" and \"UK connection\" tests for social housing in England, to ensure it is allocated \"fairly\". It's worth noting the homelessness charity Crisis says 90% of social homes are let to British citizens.\n\nThe party also promises to end rough sleeping - a commitment they also made in their 2019 manifesto. Between 2019 and 2023, official figures show the number of people rough sleeping in England fell by 9%. Figures fell sharply during the pandemic - during the \"Everyone In\" scheme - but increased by 27% last year.\n\nHousing is devolved so these policies would only apply in England.\n\nHealth and care make up a relatively small part of the manifesto.\n\nMost Tory promises restate existing policies and targets established over the past five years, from increasing the number of doctors and nurses by 120,000 to introducing a cap on care costs next year. There was, however, room for a new initiative on dentistry, with a promise to tie new dentists into working for the NHS for a number of years after qualifying or face having to pay back their training costs.\n\nThere was also mention of the 40 new hospitals - a 2019 manifesto pledge - but that is mired in controversy with the National Audit Office warning a number of the schemes are behind schedule.\n\nBut the big missing piece of the jigsaw was funding. The manifesto only goes as far as to promise above-inflation rises each year. But this is nothing new - there has only be a handful of occasions in the history of the NHS that the budget has not risen in real terms.\n\nThe Conservatives say they will go ahead with their proposal for an £86,000 cap on social care costs for people who are older or disabled in England if they win the election. It means no one would pay more than that for personal care over their lifetime.\n\nThe current plan is for it to be introduced in October 2025, but it's not clear how it will be funded.\n\nA one penny increase to National Insurance, which it was estimated would raise £12bn, was introduced to pay for it, then scrapped soon after .\n\nPilot schemes to test out how the care cap would work were also stopped. The early lesson from the councils involved was that there wasn't enough money.\n\nWhen I ask social care leaders if they could get a cap up and running in less than 18 months, they said it was possible but that it would need to be fully funded.\n\nThe manifesto also says councils will be given longer term finances and more will be done to attract staff.\n\nThe Conservatives are promising a legal cap on migration by getting Parliament to fix an annual number of work and family visas. That level would fall every year. The manifesto says this will protect public services but the evidence that migration damages public services, where it often fills labour gaps, is highly contested.\n\nThe government's Migration Advisory Committee said in 2018 that the cap on high-skilled migrants should be scrapped, as these workers make a more positive contribution to the public finances .\n\nThe Migration Advisory Committee says these workers make a more positive contribution to the public finances.\n\nSupporters of the idea say blocking business from bringing in foreign labour is a good political choice: it would force employers to invest in British workers.\n\nWe have been here before in a limited way. In 2011,  then-Conservative PM David Cameron's government imposed a skilled workers cap, but it was repeatedly criticised - not least because of its impact on the NHS - and ex-Tory PM Boris Johnson scrapped it after Brexit. So any new cap would need to learn the lessons of that scheme.\n\nThis would apply to the whole of the UK.\n\nClarification 13th June: This article originally explained that the Conservative Party have said in their 2024 manifesto that they will build four new prisons, providing 20,000 additional prison places. We have updated the article to make clear that the figure of 20,000 places is an existing target from a 2021 White Paper commitment to increase prison capacity by the mid-2020s, and that the new manifesto pledge is to create those places with four new prisons by 2030.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

His immediate priority is to try to form a government with the third-placed Social Democrats of Olaf Scholz.\n\nEven before the result was clear, Merz said his top priority was unity in Europe, so that \"step by step, we can really achieve independence from the US\".\n\nThe other big winner in Sunday's vote was the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), who are celebrating a record second-place result of 20.8%.\n\nThe AfD's candidate for chancellor, Alice Weidel, did a victory lap of her supporters, but even her party had hoped for a greater result and the mood at AfD HQ was subdued.\n\nMerz, 69, has never held a ministerial job, but he has promised if he becomes the next German chancellor to show leadership in Europe and beef up support for Ukraine.\n\nMost Germans have been shocked by President Donald Trump's conduct towards Ukraine and Europe and Friedrich Merz said the US leader had shown \"the Americans are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe\".\n\nTrump has labelled Ukraine's leader a \"dictator\" and two of his leading figures have openly backed the AfD in the run-up to the vote. Vice-President JD Vance was accused of meddling in the vote during a visit to Munich, while billionaire Elon Musk has made repeated remarks on his X platform.\n\nFriedrich Merz's first priority will be to try to form a coalition made up of his Christian Democrats (and their Bavarian sister party, the CSU) and Scholz's centre left, despite the Social Democrats' worst-ever showing of 16.4%.\n\nMerz's CDU party leadership will meet on Monday and so will the Social Democrat SPD's, separately, but Scholz will not take part in the talks.\n\nMerz is keen to form a government by Easter. It could be possible, because between the two parties, they have 328 seats, a majority of 12 in the 630-seat parliament.\n\nBut it was not until the early hours of Monday that that became clear.\n\nAfter the collapse of Olaf Scholz's three-party coalition late last year, Merz had asked the electorate for a strong mandate to form a clear-cut coalition with one other party.\n\nIn the event, he secured enough seats only because two of the smaller parties failed to get into parliament.\n\nA two-party coalition would enable him to solve as many of Germany's problems as he could in four years, he said, from a stagnant economy to closing its borders to irregular migrants.\n\nGerman voters had other ideas. They came out in big numbers, with a 83% turnout not seen since before reunification in 1990.\n\nMerz's Christian Democrats had been looking for more than the 28.6% of the vote they and their Bavarian sister party received.\n\nHis most likely partner was always going to be the Social Democrats - known in Germany as a GroKo, or grand coalition.\n\nBut Germany's electorate has fractured, and the two big beasts of its post-war politics can no longer be sure of success.\n\nThe AfD under Alice Weidel enjoyed a 10-point increase in support on four years ago, their support boosted by anger over high prices and a series of deadly attacks in German cities.\n\nThree took place during the election campaign.\n\nWeidel also benefited from a successful TikTok campaign that drew in big numbers of young voters.\n\nAs results came in during the early hours of Monday, it became clear the AfD was far ahead of the other parties in the east, with a projected 34%, according to a survey for public broadcaster ZDF.\n\n\"Germans have voted for change,\" said Weidel. She said Friedrich Merz's attempt to forge a coalition would ultimately end in failure: \"We'll have fresh elections - I don't think we'll have to wait another four years.\"\n\nBut just as the election map turned light blue in the east, much of the rest of Germany turned black - the colour of the CDU.\n\nAnd Merz dismissed the rise of the AfD out of hand. \"The party only exists because there have been problems that haven't been solved. They're happy if these problems get worse and worse.\"\n\n\"We need to solve the problems... then that party, the AfD, will disappear.\"\n\nMerz was equally withering towards the new Trump administration.\n\nPresident Trump did welcome Merz's victory. He said it was proof that Germans were, like Americans, tired of \"the no common sense agenda, especially on energy and immigration\".\n\nIf it was an overture, Merz did not take it as one. He told a round-table TV discussion on Sunday night that the interventions from Washington had been \"no less dramatic and drastic and ultimately outrageous than the interventions we have seen from Moscow\".\n\nLast week, Trump appeared to accuse Kyiv of starting the war which Russia unleashed on its neighbour exactly three years ago.\n\nMerz's victory was quickly welcomed by leaders across much of Europe. France's Emmanuel Macron spoke of uniting at a time of uncertainty to \"face the major challenges of the world and our continent\", while the UK's Sir Keir Starmer sought to \"enhance our joint security and deliver growth for both our countries\".\n\nFriedrich Merz's Christian Democrats continue to rely on older voters for their success, while voters aged 18-24 appear to be far more interested in both the AfD and another party, the Left, which surged in the polls in recent weeks.\n\nNot long ago, the Left was heading out of the parliament, with poll numbers well below the 5% threshold.\n\nBut a series of TikTok videos showing co-leader Heidi Reichinnek giving fiery speeches in parliament went viral and they ended up close to 9%, and a quarter of the younger vote, according to an ARD survey.\n\nThe move alters the German constitution, allowing the country to increase its military spending.\n\nGerman MPs could pave the way for huge investments to defend Europe against a threatening Russia.\n\nGermany's conservative leader clinches an major financial agreement ahead of a crunch vote in parliament.\n\nGermany's likely chancellor-to-be announces a political deal to raise hundreds of billions of euros in extra spending.\n\nGermany's main parties refuse to work with the far right, but the AfD wants to tear the firewall down.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Why are the Conservatives so happy?\n\nFor a party that was so thoroughly rejected by the voting public in July's general election, the mood at the Conservative Party conference is surprisingly upbeat.\n\nPart of this may be relief at being freed from the burden of governing.\n\n\"It's all going horribly wrong but it's no longer our fault!\" said one Tory figure.\n\n\"You'd have thought this would have been a wake, but it's much better than that,\" said a senior party official.\n\nSir Keir Starmer's early missteps and difficulties in office are also a source of great joy for some here in Birmingham.\n\n\"Turns out they're finding out governing is difficult,\" said a former minister with a barely concealed smile.\n\nAfter enduring years of taunts from Labour about cronyism and sleaze, it's now the Tories' turn to make the jokes. Sir Keir Starmer's expensive eyewear has supplied many a punchline in speeches.\n\nAnd the leadership contest that is dominating the conference has, for once, put party members at the heart of the action.\n\nTory conferences can sometimes feel a bit soulless. When the party was in government, the activists were in danger of being outnumbered by corporate lobbyists.\n\nBut many lobbyists have switched their attention to Labour, for now, and are giving Birmingham a miss.\n\nTory officials says a record number of activists have pitched up at this conference - and they are enjoying unprecedented access to senior figures, as the four leadership contenders woo and flatter them.\n\nThey are being plied with novelty merchandise, from foam fingers to fake tan, and are packing into the bars every night to debate the relative merits of the four contenders.\n\nBut there is no sense that the general public have caught Tory leadership fever. An Ipsos Mori poll suggests 64% of the public don't care who wins, and very few have much awareness of who the candidates are.\n\nAnd not everyone in the conference bubble has bought into the celebratory mood.\n\nOne MP - a prominent supporter in public of one of the leading candidates - said: \"I don't understand why everyone is so excited.\n\n\"I think it's mostly the members, not the MPs. The members seem to think this is 2005 but it's pretty clear that none of the candidates are the new David Cameron.\"\n\nThis is a reference to the last time the party transformed their annual gathering into a talent contest to pick a new leader.\n\nAnother former minister expressed concern that all the smiles in Birmingham are sign of denial and delusion.\n\nThe party is trying to learn lessons from their catastrophic election defeat.\n\nThey are buoyed by the idea that Labour's massive majority is fragile, and that Sir Keir is not as popular as Tony Blair was in 1997, the last time they were swept from power by a Labour landslide.\n\nBut they face an enormous strategic challenge to claw back right-wing support from Reform UK at the same time as winning back Liberal Democrat voters.\n\nThey face an equally big demographic challenge.\n\nFormer minister Grant Shapps put it in stark terms at the launch of his new Conservatives Together campaign, saying many 2024 Tory voters will not support them next time \"because they will be dead\".\n\nThe age at which the majority of people vote Conservative, rather than Labour, has risen to 63, the same meeting was told.\n\nAnd just because Tory members in Birmingham are not crying into their beers, does not mean the party as a whole is in great shape.\n\nThe people who give up their time - and spend a small fortune on hotels and transport - to come to party conferences are a small minority of the most dedicated and motivated members.\n\nThey don't necessarily reflect the mood in local party branches, which often struggle to muster enough troops to mount effective campaigns.\n\nFormer minister Mims Davies is among those calling for an effort to get younger people to join up.\n\nThe MP suggested the party could start by being a bit less weird.\n\n\"I call it going to Narnia. You've got to get past all the codes, get to the back of the wardrobe, bust through, find this weird and wonderful world of strange customs.\n\n\"Everybody knows each other. There's always a meal at the end of it and a raffle.\n\n\"Once you get in you've never been happier but you forget to invite people in.\"\n\nHowever broad the smiles are in Birmingham, whoever is unveiled as the new Tory leader on 2 November, will have a job on their hands to turn things round.\n\nThe Conservatives are choosing a new leader to replace former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.\n\nParty members will select the new leader, who will be announced on 2 November.\n\nBBC Verify checks claims made by the Conservative Party's four leadership candidates as they try to get through to the next stage of the contest.\n\nTom Tugendhat, James Cleverly, Robert Jenrick and Kemi Badenoch take to the stage to make their case to Tory members.\n\nHow to recover from its historic defeat in July dominated the party's annual gathering in Birmingham.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Conservatives push for ban on phones in schools\n\nThe Conservatives have said they will push for MPs to be given a vote on banning mobile phones in schools this week.\n\nThe party will attempt to amend the Labour government's Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill to include the ban.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Shadow Education Secretary Laura Trott said ending phone use in schools was a \"no-brainer\".\n\nThe previous Tory government issued guidance to schools last year but Trott said this \"hasn't worked\", with too many children still using the devices in classrooms.\n\n\"So now it is time to make it law,\" Trott said.\n\nA government spokesperson said: \"Mobile phones are a distraction from learning which is why our clear guidance sets out that school leaders should be restricting their use.\n\n\"Around 97% of schools restrict mobile phone use in some way, while headteachers also have the ability to implement complete bans, with many choosing to exercise this right.\"\n\nThe Conservative amendment would needed to be backed by a majority of MPs to be added to the schools bill.\n\nBut the bid to change the bill is unlikely to succeed given Labour has a working majority of 167 MPs.\n\nWhen asked if her party had a chance of adding the phone ban to the bill, Trott said: \"I've got to make the argument.\n\n\"I've got to ... encourage parents, teachers, children up and down the country to petition their MPs to vote for this because it is incredibly important. It will make a massive difference.\"\n\nThe BBC has been told the Labour government has no plans to legislate to impose a blanket ban on mobile phone use in schools.\n\nMinisters believe headteachers already have the power to ban phones in schools.\n\nMost secondary schools in England already have restrictions on phone use and more primaries are introducing rules too.\n\nThe government guidance says \"schools should develop a mobile phone policy that prohibits the use of mobile phones\", throughout the school day, including during lessons.\n\nLast year, technology secretary Peter Kyle told the BBC that he was not aware of \"a single school\" in his constituency that allowed the devices to be used \"freely\" during the school day \"and certainly not in classrooms\".\n\nA recent study suggested banning phones in schools was not linked to pupils getting higher grades or having better mental wellbeing.\n\nLast week, another bill that had suggested banning phones in schools was watered down to gain government support.\n\nLabour MP Josh MacAlister, who brought the private members' bill, told MPs that reducing phone use in law would be a \"process\", not one \"big bang\" event.\n\nThe proposed legislation calls for the government to say within a year whether it will raise the digital age of consent from 13 to 16 - meaning companies could not receive children's data without parental permission until that age.\n\nData Protection and Telecoms Minister Chris Bryant said the bill's recommendations \"very much chime with what we intend to do\".\n\nPrivate members' bills rarely make it into law without government backing, but they are an opportunity for backbenchers to raise an issue's profile.\n\nTech firms are being urged to do more to stop young people accessing unsuitable material.\n\nSome analysts say that if costs incurred by tariffs pass to consumers, US iPhone prices could rise by hundreds of dollars.\n\nDame Rachel de Souza says most schools restrict phone use and children are racking up screen time at home.\n\nCity police want to warn people and help reduce the £50m-a-year trade in stolen phones in London.\n\nSchools in Stamford are backing a campaign to ban smartphones for primary-age children.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

young Conservative supporters.\n\nThere are plenty of them here in Birmingham, of course, but Henry thinks there should be more.\n\nHe is calling on the party to \"tap into\" the growing right-wing youth movements in Europe.\n\nCompared to a rightward swing among young voters in Italy, Germany, Austria and Spain, there is an apathy for the Conservatives among his peer group.\n\nIn the UK \"most people my age are either voting for Reform or Labour\", says Henry, who is Sir Winston's fifth cousin four times removed.\n\nHe says his contemporaries believe the Tory Party is \"filled with a bunch of old people trying to make themselves richer\".\n\nBut they're wrong, Henry argues.\n\n\"The Conservatives can offer people better opportunities to get on and get out into the world - get a good job and start earning money.\"\n\nRecent European elections show a rightward trend among young voters.\n\nMeanwhile YouGov data shows the share of the under 25s vote for the Conservatives crashed from 21% in 2019 to just 8% at the last election.\n\nIn 2024, more under 25s voted for Reform UK - they won 9% of the under 25s vote share.\n\nLabour won 41% of the share of the vote, according to the same survey, with the Liberal Democrats on 16% and the Greens on 18%.\n\nAayaan Jafferi, an 18-year-old Conservative-leaning student from Dudley, argues that unlike other countries \"the right in the UK can't communicate properly with the young\".\n\n\"In other countries like the US, you have figures like [Republican vice presidential nominee] JD Vance,\" according to Aayaan.\n\n\"I'm not saying they're lovely people, but they can communicate to every age really,\" Aayaan says.\n\nSpeeches by Rishi Sunak and other senior Tories are not getting young people \"excited enough to get jumping off their chairs to listen to them speak,\" he argues.\n\nThe urgent need to win young voters has been a theme at this year's Conservative Party Conference.\n\nFormer Tory minister Grant Shapps told the conference, many people who voted Conservative this year won't do so at the next election \"because they will be dead\".\n\nBut the party has \"their work cut out for them\" according to 20-year-old Tory activist George Pattenden.\n\n\"Back in school there was a natural left-wing leaning to the youth,\" George says.\n\nOn top of this the Conservatives have to accept \"we're just not that enthusiastic as a nation\" which is why \"youth turnout is quite low\", he argues.\n\n\"It is hard to get young people to do anything,\" he says.\n\nHe says he \"understands the apathy,\" as politics is not mandatory in schools, leading many to avoid political debate.\n\n\"I'd say it is very unlikely that our generation turns right now,\" Aayaan Jafferi says.\n\n\"Because of social media, we have been kind of trained to think Conservatives bad, Labour good,\" he adds.\n\nUnless the Conservatives \"have a radical change\" and start offering young people policies to get them housing and starting young families \"we're stuck in this left-wing ideology for young people\".\n\nMilan, 17, a classmate of Jafferi's, says \"growing up under Tory rule has shifted people's minds against Conservatives\".\n\n\"I think the same thing would have happen if it was 10 years of Labour as well,\" she adds.\n\nIn Europe, countries have \"had more left wing or centrist parties in power\" so the anti-establishment vote is \"going right\", another 17-year-old Young Conservative told me.\n\nHe argues the British are not as rebellious as people in other parts of Europe.\n\n\"Just look at our history, we've not had revolution for 400 years - it is ingrained in us to be more civil.\"\n\nJosh, 21, a member of the Young Conservatives, predicts \"right-wing support will eventually grow\" among his generation - but \"not for a good reason\".\n\nThe UK is only a \"few years behind Germany and Italy\" in the rise of anti-establishment right-wing movements.\n\n\"Brexit relieved some of that right-wing pressure out of the UK,\" Josh argues.\n\n\"When people see mainstream centrist parties not delivering and not being true to their word on things like immigration\" people his age will eventually turn to more to the right.\n\nThough rare, young voices at the conference agree the party needs to change to win back young voters.\n\nThe real question is whether the party is ready.\n\nIt is 80 years since the Ayrton Light was switched back on after World War Two blackout regulations were lifted.\n\nGraffiti is found on seven statues of historic figures in Parliament Square following a trans rights protest.\n\nParliament will be recalled for a rare Saturday sitting in a bid to save the company's owner from closing the site.\n\nRaising the language's status could see it taught in more local primary schools, a Cornwall MP says.\n\nChancellor Rachel Reeves has unveiled her plans for the UK economy in the House of Commons.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Conservatives call for salary hike on work visas\n\nThe Conservatives say they will push for salary thresholds for all work visas to be raised to £38,700, by tabling changes to the government's immigration bill currently going through Parliament.\n\nShadow home secretary Chris Philp said the party wants to \"bring to an end the era of mass migration\".\n\nIt also is proposing changes to marriage visas, introducing a rule that immigrants will not be able to bring partners to the UK unless they have been married for two years, are both aged 23 years or older, and are not first cousins.\n\nResponding, a Home Office source said: \"The Tories had 14 years to reform immigration and asylum, yet they left a system in chaos and our borders weaker.\"\n\nSince April 2024, applicants for work visas have to earn at least £38,700 - an increase of nearly 50% from the previous £26,200 minimum - but the threshold does not apply to some jobs, such as in health and social care.\n\nThe previous Conservative government rowed back on plans to hike the salary needed to bring family members to the UK , and an increase to a £29,000 threshold was set.\n\nPhilp said the previous Conservative government had announced plans for £38,700 salary threshold for UK-based immigrants wishing to bring a foreign spouse, but claimed this had been suspended by Labour.\n\nToo many people arriving on work visas end up in minimum wage jobs, Philp told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, so a new focus should be on \"a much smaller number of very high-skilled migrants, rather than mass low-skilled migration\".\n\n\"For 20 or 30 years now, we've seen huge numbers arriving in the UK, often coming to work on low wages and in low-skilled jobs and it's time, we think, that ends,\" he said.\n\n\"We think actually it's bad for the taxpayer, because recent OBR analysis shows that people coming here on lower wages actually cost the general taxpayer money because they consume more in services than they pay in tax.\n\n\"It obviously puts pressure on public services, and in some cases, can undermine social cohesion as well.\"\n\nDuring the initial debate on the bill, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told MPs the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill would be effective, unlike the Conservatives' plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda, which Labour ditched as \"a failed gimmick\".\n\nThe Border Security Bill sets out Labour's plan to treat people smugglers like terrorists and repeals most of the Conservative's Illegal Migration Act 2023, which laid the legal groundwork for the Rwanda policy.\n\nA Home Office source said that the Conservatives had the opportunity to introduce all the measures they're now suggesting during the party's 14 years in government \"including the three they passed whilst Chris Philp was a Home Office minister\".\n\n\"The Labour government is getting a grip on the system,\" they said.\n\n\"As part of our Plan for Change, Labour's Border Security Bill will bring in counter-terror style powers to disrupt the criminal smuggling gangs making millions out of small boat crossings, as well as ensuring police and immigration officers have the powers they need to act where anyone poses a public safety threat.\n\n\"As with all proposed amendments to government bills, these will be examined as part of the Parliamentary process.\"\n\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

      "text": "What went wrong for the Conservatives?\n\nThe Conservative Party had become accustomed to almost being the Manchester City of politics.\n\nA blue, winning machine for so long that some of its key players could barely remember anything else.\n\nBut their streak - that delivered Tory prime ministers in four elections in a row - has been brought to a dramatic end.\n\nMany Tories, both winners and losers, are almost speechless and still processing it.\n\nOne told me they were simply \"not coherent\".\n\nA post-mortem on what went wrong with their tactics and leadership, and where to go next, is now beginning.\n\nWhen I speak to Conservatives, several themes come up repeatedly.\n\nSome feel Labour's policy offering was not drastically different to theirs, but think the choice became more about perceptions of \"competence\".\n\nThey have had five leaders, and prime ministers, in less than 10 years.\n\nSeismic events, from Brexit to Covid to multiple leadership contests, splintered the party into ideological factions. Some Tories spent more energy plotting to take each other down than their opposition - and never really patched things up.\n\nScandals rocked the party in a whack-a-mole fashion, from lockdown parties to sexual misconduct allegations to a mini-budget that contributed to raising interest rates. An election betting saga was the cherry on top.\n\nWhen I asked former Chief Whip Sir Mark Spencer during the campaign if the party had a conduct problem, he mentioned that other parties also had to suspend MPs for poor behaviour - which is true - but conceded this had become too regular.\n\nThen there was the undoubted desire for change - a word Labour deployed in its campaign.\n\nThe cost of living, NHS waiting lists, and small boats were all issues voters raised on the doorstep - and felt had been getting worse, not better.\n\nNigel Farage's late return to the fray meant the latter theme became a particular thorn in Tory sides, with some right-leaning voters who switched to Reform UK wanting tougher immigration policies and lower taxes.\n\nRhetoric and policies attempting to win them back alienated some more centrist Tories who abandoned the party for Labour or the Liberal Democrats, leaving the Tories pincered in between.\n\nThis was a more comfortable switch for some centrists who didn't feel they could vote Labour under Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nDid these circumstances mean defeat was inevitable? Most Tories I've spoken to describe the result as \"not unexpected\", but some feel the scale of it could have been mitigated.\n\nThere were avoidable gaffes - like Rishi Sunak leaving D-day commemorations early .\n\nWhile Boris Johnson was prone to gaffes too, some of his fans felt Mr Sunak didn't charm voters back in the same way. The former prime minister still yielded chants of 'Boris! Boris!' at an eleventh-hour rally to try to energise the campaign.\n\nThere is still a lingering bafflement among some about why Mr Sunak decided to call the election in July.\n\nTheir campaign guru, Isaac Levido, had argued for a later date - hoping by then there would be more \"measurables\" to demonstrate their policies were having an impact.\n\nA flight of asylum seekers taking off to Rwanda, for example, or an interest rate cut.\n\nBut he lost that argument. And the Conservatives had little evidence in their armoury of some of their policies working when they went to the electorate.\n\nThe risk of the alternative, Mr Levido's critics argued, was that more bad news could come down the road for the Tories - more Channel crossings this summer, more offenders being released because of prison overcrowding, universities going under.\n\nBut policy and identity wise, what else could the Conservatives have done? That's where their focus will lie now as a search for the soul of the party begins.\n\nMr Sunak has confirmed he will resign as Tory leader once arrangements are in place to choose his successor.\n\nThere have been murmurings for the last few weeks about whether an interim leader is appointed to avoid the awkwardness of, for example, the former PM having to do Prime Minister's Questions from the opposition benches.\n\nCould this be someone who served in the cabinet previously - like Sir Oliver Dowden, James Cleverly, or even Jeremy Hunt, who just about scraped back into the Commons?\n\nIf so, it would probably need to be someone who doesn't actually want to run for leader full time.\n\nOtherwise, Mr Sunak could stay on until the next Tory leadership contest concludes.\n\nThere are some MPs who have been working behind the scenes for a long time on shoring up their support, including Kemi Badenoch (the bookies' favourite) who is on the right of the party, and Tom Tugendhat, who is more to the centre.\n\nFormer contenders like Suella Braverman and former Sunak ally-turned-critic Robert Jenrick are tipped to run too.\n\nThey both spent time in the Home Office, are on the right of the party, and have criticised the government's record on immigration.\n\nOne interesting thing to note, though, is who the remaining Tory MPs are, and what that might mean for who wins support among the parliamentary party.\n\nI've had a quick skim over the new intake of Tory MPs and who they backed in the first Tory leadership contest of July-September 2022.\n\nInterestingly, the majority are Sunak-backers, with a hefty chunk of Liz Truss supporters too.\n\nSuella Braverman and Kemi Badenoch have lost a couple of their key allies on the right of the parliamentary party. A couple of Mr Tugendhat's backers are gone too.\n\nWhy do the leanings of the remaining MPs matter? Well, partly because this will determine how the Tory party decides to shape itself going forward.\n\nDoes it decide to elect someone on the right of the party, like Ms Badenoch, Mrs Braverman or Mr Jenrick, to try to stave off the growing influence of Reform UK who have now won several seats?\n\nSome in the party argue not being tougher on issues like immigration was part of their downfall.\n\nOr does it try to shift back toward the centre ground with a candidate like Mr Tugendhat or Mr Hunt to reclaim some of the space Labour is now trying to occupy on the political spectrum?\n\nSome in the party argue the Tories' drift to the right was part of the problem, and alienated socially liberal, but fiscally conservative, voters.\n\nThe answer will be the result of a lot of tussling and soul-searching over the weeks to come.\n\nThe former prime minister has handed out 36 honours, including to well-known ex-ministers and former advisors.\n\nThe veteran former cabinet minister is among several Conservative figures to be given peerages.\n\nParents in England are now entitled to 15 hours a week of free childcare for their two-year-olds.\n\nThe former prime minister examines his time in Downing Street, with the BBC's Nick Robinson for Political Thinking.\n\nThe White House's criticism of Zelensky was \"very hard to watch,\" the former prime minister told the BBC.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

The descriptions have become interchangeable over time.\n\n\"Tory\" is especially beloved of journalists in search of a short word for a headline or simply an alternative to repeating the word \"Conservative\". \"Tory\" is also most likely to be the word used when referring colloquially to the party.\n\nSo synonymous have the terms become, most members of the party would be hard-pressed to explain the precise history and etymology of the nickname, which actually pre-dates \"Conservative\" by more than a century (more of the history later).\n\nAccording to the BBC's own style guide, \"Conservative\" should be used in the first instance but \"Tory\" is acceptable for later references.\n\nAnd many Conservatives are quite happy to be known as Tories and refer to themselves as such.\n\n\"I use them interchangeably and I don't mind if other people do. If people want to call me a Tory that's fine,\" says Dr Sarah Wollaston, the Conservative candidate for Totnes.\n\n\"These days it doesn't matter which you use. People have forgotten the history,\" says Peter Bone, seeking re-election in Wellingborough, adding \"Tory is quite handy if you're tweeting.\"\n\nSome party members actually prefer the nickname, such as Robin Wight, founder of the advertising agency, WCRS.\n\nRobin Wight, happy to be called a Tory\n\n\"I call myself a Tory. But I don't mind whether it's a Tory or a Conservative,\" he said.\n\nInsiders and loyalists may use both terms neutrally but there is a definite preference among the party's adversaries for the shorter, pithier description.\n\n\"I use \"Tory\" and \"Tories\"  to describe our opponents because to me, those terms place them somewhere backward-looking, negative and reactionary,\" says former Labour MP and cabinet minister, David Blunkett.\n\n\"'Conservative' sounds more positive; it's about preserving and protecting. 'Tory' is shorter and easier to say and it has more negative connotations, which is why we use it,\" he adds.\n\n\"Same old Tories\", \"Tory cuts\" \"Tory-led coalition\": search any of Labour's attack speeches and you'll find a smattering of such terms.\n\nA glance through the former deputy prime minister John Prescott's 2000 Labour conference speech - his traditional rabble-rouser - reveals: \"Tory spending cuts\", \"Tory froth\", \"Tory years\" and the rhetorical flourish \"Tories? Tories?\", presumably designed to get the audience jeering.\n\n\"Come to think of it,\" says Dr Wollaston, \"When people call me a Tory they're often doing so pejoratively: if they're being nice they're more likely to call me a Conservative\".\n\n\"You may hear the word 'Tory' and think of someone with a Scouse accent saying it, perhaps even with the word 'scum' attached,\" jokes another Conservative politician, Bernard Jenkin, adding, \"It depends on the emotion attached to the words. It's really not that important.\"\n\nGiven some of the negative connotations attached to \"Tory\", it's perhaps not surprising that party officials prefer the official, more neutral, name. Broadcasters are used to receiving emails from party HQ, asking them to refer to the party as Conservative in the first instance, especially at election time.\n\nHistory\n\nThe term \"Conservative\" did not emerge until the 1830s during the leadership of Sir Robert Peel\n\nThe political term \"Tory\" dates back to the \"Exclusion Crisis\" which took place between 1679 and 1681 during the reign of Charles II.\n\nTwo political factions had emerged in Parliament: those who wanted to exclude Charles' brother James, the Duke of York, from succeeding the king because he was a Roman Catholic (the Whigs) and those who supported his rights to the throne (the Tories). The Tory campaign prevailed and James became the Stuart king James II.\n\nBoth terms were originally pejorative:- Whig came from an old word for yokel or \"country bumpkin\"; Tory is derived from the Irish Gaelic word tÃ3raidhe, meaning outlaw.\n\n\"Simplistically you could say Tories were Cavaliers and Whigs were Roundheads,\" explains Dr David Seawright from Leeds University, a Conservative Party expert.\n\nAlthough Tories began by supporting a Catholic heir's rights to succession, they went on to be associated with Anglicanism as well as strong monarchist and patriotic sympathies.\n\nBenjamin Disraeli, the so-called \"one-nation\" Prime Minister, embraced the term Tory\n\n\"Patriotism is the first, and most deeply rooted, element of the party's character,\" writes the party's official historian, Lord Lexden, in a 2014 guide.\n\nThe term \"Conservative\" first started to be used widely in the 1830s under the leadership of Sir Robert Peel. He re-interpreted the key elements of the old Tory tradition, effectively modernising the party under the banner of support for social reform and free trade.\n\nWhile the Tory party under the Duke of Wellington had been strongly opposed to the Reform Bill which extended voting rights, Peel accepted it, declaring his support in the Tamworth Manifesto of 1834.\n\nDespite the adoption of a new name, \"Tory\" endured and the two terms became interchangeable, with the older name appearing in official publications such as Lord Hailsham's \"Toryism and Tomorrow\" lecture of 1957.\n\nIn the early 20th century, both terms were briefly eclipsed by a new name, \"Unionist\", to reflect the party's resistance to Irish Home Rule. In the latter part of the century, \"Conservative\" emerged as the official name.\n\n\"Tory\" was also used during the American War of Independence to refer to colonists who were loyal to the British monarchy. The term has also endured in Canada where centre-right Conservatives are known as Tories.\n\n1. In the 17th Century, one of the dispossessed Irish, who became outlaws, subsisting by plundering and killing the English settlers and soldiers; a bog-trotter, a rapparee; later, often applied to any Irish Papist or Royalist in arms.\n\n2. With capital T: A nickname given 1679-80 by the Exclusioners to those who opposed the exclusion of James, Duke of York (a Roman Catholic) from the succession to the Crown.\n\n3.  Hence, from 1689, the name of one of the two great parliamentary and political parties in England, and (at length) in Great Britain.\n\nUsually with capital initial: a supporter or member of the Conservative Party of Great Britain, or a similar party elsewhere; a Tory. In early use: one who espoused the policies of Sir Robert Peel.\n\nSource: Oxford English Dictionary\n\nThe evolutionary way in which the party has been described over time reflects what many historians see as its most essential and enduring feature: adaptability.\n\nUnlike Labour, the Conservative Party was never officially founded and did not even have a written constitution until 1998.\n\nLord Lexden says flexibility in the face of change has been a strength.\n\n\"As Britain evolved from monarchical government to democracy and from intense disputes with a large religious element to purely secular controversies, the Party constantly adapted to change and frequently led the process of change. That has been the secret of its success,\" he writes.\n\nActivists at the 2014 Conservative Party conference in Birmingham did not seem to mind being called Conservatives or Tories.\n\nRebecca Chappell, Windsor, 25\n\n\"I feel very proud to be a Tory or a Conservative. I'm happy to be called both.\"\n\nAlireza Versi, Milton Keynes, 18\n\n\"I would describe myself as a Peelite. If you take Sir Robert Peel, he was a Tory and a Conservative. It doesn't worry me as long as the party has policies  that bring a betterment to society, to Britain, the name doesn't matter.\"\n\nAmy Gray, prospective parliamentary candidate in Hackney North and Stoke Newington\n\n\"I have reclaimed that term as a badge of pride! I am proud to be a Tory!\"\n\nCouncillor Jaswant Singh Birdi, Coventry\n\n\"Tory is just a short form of that (Conservative) but I don't think we would want to use it in our literature.\"\n\nDenise Dutton and Mavis Hearn, Sefton Central\n\nDenise: \"What's the difference? I say a Tory is a Conservative and a Conservative is a Tory.\"\n\nMavis: \"I do too actually, when we are on the street canvassing and things, we are just Tories or Conservatives.\"\n\nTrump questions Putin's desire for peace after meeting Zelensky at the Vatican\n\nThousands line streets of Rome as Pope Francis laid to rest after Vatican funeral\n\nWatch: How the Vatican said goodbye to Pope Francis\n\nAustralia's universal healthcare is crumbling.

      "text": "Why are the Conservatives so happy?\n\nFor a party that was so thoroughly rejected by the voting public in July's general election, the mood at the Conservative Party conference is surprisingly upbeat.\n\nPart of this may be relief at being freed from the burden of governing.\n\n\"It's all going horribly wrong but it's no longer our fault!\" said one Tory figure.\n\n\"You'd have thought this would have been a wake, but it's much better than that,\" said a senior party official.\n\nSir Keir Starmer's early missteps and difficulties in office are also a source of great joy for some here in Birmingham.\n\n\"Turns out they're finding out governing is difficult,\" said a former minister with a barely concealed smile.\n\nAfter enduring years of taunts from Labour about cronyism and sleaze, it's now the Tories' turn to make the jokes. Sir Keir Starmer's expensive eyewear has supplied many a punchline in speeches.\n\nAnd the leadership contest that is dominating the conference has, for once, put party members at the heart of the action.\n\nTory conferences can sometimes feel a bit soulless. When the party was in government, the activists were in danger of being outnumbered by corporate lobbyists.\n\nBut many lobbyists have switched their attention to Labour, for now, and are giving Birmingham a miss.\n\nTory officials says a record number of activists have pitched up at this conference - and they are enjoying unprecedented access to senior figures, as the four leadership contenders woo and flatter them.\n\nThey are being plied with novelty merchandise, from foam fingers to fake tan, and are packing into the bars every night to debate the relative merits of the four contenders.\n\nBut there is no sense that the general public have caught Tory leadership fever. An Ipsos Mori poll suggests 64% of the public don't care who wins, and very few have much awareness of who the candidates are.\n\nAnd not everyone in the conference bubble has bought into the celebratory mood.\n\nOne MP - a prominent supporter in public of one of the leading candidates - said: \"I don't understand why everyone is so excited.\n\n\"I think it's mostly the members, not the MPs. The members seem to think this is 2005 but it's pretty clear that none of the candidates are the new David Cameron.\"\n\nThis is a reference to the last time the party transformed their annual gathering into a talent contest to pick a new leader.\n\nAnother former minister expressed concern that all the smiles in Birmingham are sign of denial and delusion.\n\nThe party is trying to learn lessons from their catastrophic election defeat.\n\nThey are buoyed by the idea that Labour's massive majority is fragile, and that Sir Keir is not as popular as Tony Blair was in 1997, the last time they were swept from power by a Labour landslide.\n\nBut they face an enormous strategic challenge to claw back right-wing support from Reform UK at the same time as winning back Liberal Democrat voters.\n\nThey face an equally big demographic challenge.\n\nFormer minister Grant Shapps put it in stark terms at the launch of his new Conservatives Together campaign, saying many 2024 Tory voters will not support them next time \"because they will be dead\".\n\nThe age at which the majority of people vote Conservative, rather than Labour, has risen to 63, the same meeting was told.\n\nAnd just because Tory members in Birmingham are not crying into their beers, does not mean the party as a whole is in great shape.\n\nThe people who give up their time - and spend a small fortune on hotels and transport - to come to party conferences are a small minority of the most dedicated and motivated members.\n\nThey don't necessarily reflect the mood in local party branches, which often struggle to muster enough troops to mount effective campaigns.\n\nFormer minister Mims Davies is among those calling for an effort to get younger people to join up.\n\nThe MP suggested the party could start by being a bit less weird.\n\n\"I call it going to Narnia. You've got to get past all the codes, get to the back of the wardrobe, bust through, find this weird and wonderful world of strange customs.\n\n\"Everybody knows each other. There's always a meal at the end of it and a raffle.\n\n\"Once you get in you've never been happier but you forget to invite people in.\"\n\nHowever broad the smiles are in Birmingham, whoever is unveiled as the new Tory leader on 2 November, will have a job on their hands to turn things round.\n\nThe Conservatives are choosing a new leader to replace former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.\n\nParty members will select the new leader, who will be announced on 2 November.\n\nBBC Verify checks claims made by the Conservative Party's four leadership candidates as they try to get through to the next stage of the contest.\n\nTom Tugendhat, James Cleverly, Robert Jenrick and Kemi Badenoch take to the stage to make their case to Tory members.\n\nHow to recover from its historic defeat in July dominated the party's annual gathering in Birmingham.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

The measure expands upon a directive last year from the Iowa Board of Regents to eliminate DEI staff positions.\n\nRepublican lawmakers in about two dozen states have filed bills seeking to restrict DEI initiatives this year. They are countered by Democrats who have sponsored supportive DEI measures in about 20 states. Altogether, lawmakers have proposed about 150 bills this year that would either restrict or promote DEI efforts, according to an Associated Press analysis using the legislation-tracking software Plural.\n\nHigher education institutions and many businesses have long devoted resources to improving diversity and inclusivity.\n\nMore recently, conservative groups began raising concerns that DEI initiatives are promoting an agenda that elevates racial or gender identity over individual merit. Since 2022, about half a dozen conservative or libertarian organizations have offered model measures to state lawmakers to eliminate DEI offices or prohibit the use of DEI criteria in training programs or employment, academic, and financial decisions.\n\nChristopher Rufo, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and an architect of the movement, said in a recent article that the ultimate goal is to \"abolish DEI in all American institutions.\"\n\nThe acronym DEI \"has now been weaponized,\" said Paulette Granberry Russell, president of the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education. \"And it's taking us, unfortunately, back to a time that failed to acknowledge the inequities that persist today based on discriminatory practices.\"\n\nThe Race and Equity Center at the University of Southern California has launched a \"National DEI Defense Fund.\" Among other things, it provides free professional development courses where publicly funded DEI training has been banned.\n\nRepublican-led Florida and Texas last year became the first states to adopt broad-based laws banning DEI efforts in higher education. Universities in Texas have since eliminated more than 100 DEI-related jobs and Florida universities also have been shedding positions.\n\nEarlier this year, Republican governors in Alabama and Utah signed laws restricting diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts not only in higher education but also in K-12 schools and throughout state government.\n\nGOP governors in Idaho and Wyoming also signed legislation this year restricting the use of state funds for DEI efforts at higher education institutions. Other bills signed into law in Idaho and GOP-led Indiana prohibit the use of DEI statements in employment and admissions decisions at public colleges and universities.\n\nA similar bill barring mandatory DEI statements in higher education passed Wisconsin's Republican-led legislature but got vetoed by the Democratic governor.\n\nFacing political pressure, some universities have revised their practices regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion.\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin regents agreed in December to shift at least 43 diversity positions to focus on \"student success\" and eliminate statements supporting diversity on student applications. The actions were part of a deal with lawmakers to release funding for pay raises and campus construction projects.\n\nLarge public university systems in Arizona, Georgia, Missouri, and North Carolina are among those that have scrapped the use of diversity statements in employment decisions.\n\nOklahoma Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt signed an executive order in December barring state agencies and universities from supporting DEI programs that \"grant preferential treatment based on one person's particular race, color, sex, ethnicity, or national origin.\"\n\nThe University of Oklahoma said its DEI office closed April 1 and the remaining employees are being reassigned to new roles.\n\nSome Democratic-led states have forged ahead with legislation to expand their emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion in government and education.\n\nWashington's Democratic governor signed a law this year that requires diversity, equity, and inclusion concepts to be incorporated into updated state learning standards for public K-12 schools.\n\nLegislation given final approval this month by Maryland's Democratic-led General Assembly requires the state's retirement system to employ a director of diversity, equity, and inclusion.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Their work reflects a nation in flux.\n\nLoading...\n\nJune 24, 2024, 12:35 p.m. ET\n\nIt may not be surprising that many people who live in New York City feel they live in a very special place.\n\nIt's a city with layers of myths and, frankly, a lot of tired, hoary clichés. But though it has become a lot more like the rest of the United States in recent decades, it still looms large in the American imagination. Some people are annoyed by New York's sense of self-importance. Others are enlivened by its promise that here is where you can make it big.\n\nThe writer E.B. White captured (and invented) many of New York's myths in his 1949 essay, \"Here Is New York\":\n\n\"New York is to the nation what the white church is to the village - the visible symbol of aspiration and faith, the white plume saying the way is up.\"\n\nThis symbolic promise continues to draw creative people \"arriving from the Corn Belt with a manuscript in his suitcase and a pain in his heart.\"\n\nThis week's cover story by Leonardo Bevilacqua, who was born and raised in lower Manhattan, explores some of the old bohemian haunts of generations past. This is where the former music venue CBGB helped give birth to punk rock, where the beat poets once flourished, and where the Nuyorican Poets Café still flourishes today.\n\nThis story, however, reports on a movement of new conservatives - musicians, writers, fashion designers - who are reacting against what they see as liberal dominance in art and culture. They bristle against the idea of moral censorship and the stifling effects of \"cancel culture.\"\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Generation Z teens are twice as likely to say they are more conservative than their parents compared with millennial teens 20 years ago, according to an analysis of 2023 data from Gallup and the Walton Family Foundation conducted by Rachel Janfaza, a journalist who focuses on young people and politics. This youthful conservatism, too, is translating into more interest in traditional faith, especially the older liturgical traditions of Catholicism, both in the U.S. and in the United Kingdom.\n\nFrom music to film to fashion, the youth of lower Manhattan have often sent up white plumes saying the way is up. Millennials may have left organized religion in unprecedented numbers, but a new generation in New York's avant-garde is finding that to be transgressive today is to be conservative.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

It can be an uncomfortable get-up. But if George Washington could wear it into battle, this George Washington interpreter can wear it in his battle for American values.\n\n\"I didn't have a Ph.D. or a JD, so nobody was going to listen to me about my understanding of the Constitution,\" says Mr. Manship, who lives in Alexandria, Virginia. \"But they would listen to the president of the Constitutional Convention.\"\n\nAmerican conservatives differ widely, but many find the nation's founding central to their view of their country and themselves. Could understanding that perspective open up lines of communication between the right and the left?\n\nMr. Manship loves his history, and he dresses as George Washington, in part, out of personal interest. It's also strategic. Mr. Manship is a devout Christian and conservative, active in state politics. In his 30 years of interpreting, he's spoken to thousands of students and addressed the Virginia General Assembly multiple times. When General Washington shows up, he says, other conservatives want to listen.\n\nMost people are more subtle in their attire, but right-leaning Americans across the country frequently appeal to the nation's founding. The fight against big government is one of \"patriots\" against \"tyranny.\" In heavily Republican areas, the historical Gadsden flag - with a coiled rattlesnake and the words \"Dont tread on me\" - has migrated from flagpoles to license plate frames. In response to the 1619 Project, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalistic collection about slavery, there's now a 1776 Project.\n\nThis iconography has long been a hallmark of the American right, but it's becoming increasingly important. The uproar about instruction related to race in schools, in particular, often stems from conservatives sensing critiques of the country's founding, says Amy Cooter, a sociologist at Vanderbilt University. To many, that history isn't a relic. It's a fundamental part of conservative identity today. Figuring out how to make issues like race less controversial demands understanding why the founding - and the founders themselves - matter so much to many people right of center.\n\nMany conservatives \"want to believe so badly that we're a good nation,\" says Dr. Cooter. Questioning the founding is \"threatening to ... who they think they are as people, who they think they are as Americans.\"\n\nPeople's sense of themselves as Americans often depends on their view of America. On that topic, the left and right have very different views.\n\nIn a YouGov/Economist survey last December, those who voted for Joe Biden in 2020 were far more pessimistic about America's relative standing on issues like income inequality and minority rights than those who voted for Donald Trump. A report from Pew Research Center, published a month before , had similar findings. People who identified furthest to the right were far more likely to agree that \"The U.S. stands above all other countries in the world\" than people furthest to the left - 69% to 1%.\n\nFor some of those conservatives who believe in American exceptionalism, displaying symbols of America's founding is a way to show national pride. But it's not the only way, nor are conservatives the only patriotic Americans. In the YouGov survey, independents responded more like Republicans than Democrats.\n\n\"Conservatives or conservative activists might display these symbols the most, but I think the vast majority of Americans are remaining patriotic,\" says Donald Critchlow, professor of history at Arizona State University and author of \"Revolutionary Monsters: Five Men Who Turned Liberation into Tyranny.\"\n\nIn his opinion, the symbols have more to do with political organizing than patriotism. Movements need a shared language and iconography, and conservatives have long used that of the founding. When Franklin Roosevelt tried to pack the Supreme Court in 1937, he says, protesters arrived in Washington dressed as Minutemen.\n\nStill, despite the different strains of the American right and the many symbols they could rally around, there's something specific about the founding that resonates. In part, it's a natural fit with conservative thought. If you want the country to remain true to the way it started, then you're more likely to celebrate those who started it. It also reflects a specific view of the country's founding popular among the right.\n\n\"The understanding of the country as something based on a creed of rational principles has always stood in contrast to a point of view which said, no, it's not based on what these guys wrote. It's based on who they were,\" says Lawrence Rosenthal, chair and lead researcher of the Berkeley Center for Right-Wing Studies at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nPeople on the left, he says, are much more likely to value the principles of America's founding documents - things like individual rights, democracy, and equality. People on the right also value those documents but tend to emphasize the identity of the founders who wrote them, particularly their race or religion. The latter view, says Dr. Rosenthal, has grown more popular than ever since Mr. Trump's presidency.\n\n\"They really see themselves as acting in the lineage especially of the Founding Fathers,\" says Dr. Cooter.\n\nMr. Manship thinks that way.\n\nHis reverence for the Constitution started at the age of 10, when a former editor of the Atlanta Constitution told him to treasure the nation's founding documents. Later, he pledged to \"defend the Constitution of the United States from all enemies, foreign and domestic\" when serving in the Navy. Protecting the Constitution is largely how he views politics today. Like many conservatives, he thinks it's under threat.\n\nIn a November 2021 poll by the Public Religion Research Institute, Republicans were more than twice as likely as Democrats to agree that \"today, America is in danger of losing its culture and identity.\" A more recent poll shows Republicans generally feel more pessimistic about the country's direction.\n\nAppeals to the founding can be powerful forms of reassurance for conservatives who feel threatened - especially as narratives of American history grow more inclusive, and often more critical. In last year's school board races, some candidates opposed to instruction related to race, signaled their positions by signing an online 1776 Pledge .\n\nThe founding is \"more appealing to conservatives because we do have this view of limited government,\" says John Eidsmoe, a former staff attorney with the Alabama Supreme Court and outspoken conservative. \"We're concerned about government getting too powerful, about taking too much of our tax money, about using it for purposes that we think would be immoral.\"\n\nBut the founding doesn't appeal to all on the right the same way.\n\nBrett Ames frequently consults the Constitution when thinking about political problems today and proudly traces his American ancestry back to Braintree, Massachusetts, in 1632. He's a conservative and respects fixtures of America's founding, but he doesn't consider them all sacred. The founders were just men, he says.\n\n\"I don't think that they personally, if they saw how revered they were to this day, that they would be comfortable with it,\" says Mr. Ames.\n\nStill Mr. Ames, a former IT employee, flies two flags off his porch in Buckhall, Virginia: the Marine Corps flag and the Gadsden flag. The first is for his son, who serves in the military. The second is in honor of Revolutionary War naval commander John Paul Jones, who allegedly flew it from his ship. Those two reflect his love of country, but he says they're more about his own values.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

He wants people to know how much he cares about the Constitution. What better way to show it, he says.\n\n\"They see the image of a George Washington. ... They see and feel the passion,\" says Mr. Manship. \"That's going to communicate a love for this Constitution better than if I come before them in a coat and tie or a T-shirt.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

I often hear the argument that we must overwhelm conservatives with greater numbers. But I ask my progressive friends to consider another approach.\n\nLoading...\n\nUpdated March 08, 2017, 8:13 p.m. ET\n\nIn November I had a conservative friend tell me about being berated by a co-worker who thought she voted for Donald Trump. She didn't actually say whether she had or had not voted for President Trump, but her co-worker blamed her for the election of Trump nonetheless.\n\nIn progressive areas like San Francisco and my hometown Berkeley, conservatives tend to keep a low profile. It grieves me that so many people feel that revealing their political leanings would be dangerous and that their fears are reasonable.\n\nAs the cofounder of Moveon.org , I am steeped in the progressive culture. I often hear the argument that we must win by overwhelming the conservatives with greater numbers. I admit that I'd be much more comfortable in a world where the voices of my progressive friends blaze our path forward, solving our shared challenges with or without the support of Trump voters.\n\nHowever, true progress requires stretching myself beyond comfort. There is another approach that I ask my progressive friends and everyone to consider - \"love thy neighbor.\"\n\nLast week Nicholas Kristof wrote a New York Times op-ed about why we shouldn't \"otherize\" Trump voters.\n\nGo ahead and denounce Trump's lies and bigotry. Stand firm against his disastrous policies. But please don't practice his trick of \"otherizing\" people into stick-figure caricatures, slurring vast groups as hopeless bigots. We're all complicated, and stereotypes are not helpful - including when they're of Trump supporters.\n\nMr. Kristof described the political cost of dismissing 63 million Americans, but there is a deeper cost. When we fail to recognize our common humanity we lose valued relationships. We also make our lives smaller, divide our communities, and fail to benefit from everyone's best ideas.\n\nAs the founding partner of LivingRoomConversations.org , I have intentionally sought out friends with very different political beliefs. With AllSides for Schools , I work to bring this practice to the next generation. I strive to better understand the political opportunities and challenges we face together. Despite the discomfort of challenging the progressive ideas that I hold close to my heart, I have found treasured friends who might seem like my polar opposite.\n\nBy connecting around our shared human experience we are discovering that there are opportunities to improve citizen representation in government that satisfy conservative and progressive values. Left and right efforts on criminal justice work has already begun to reduced prison populations.\n\nEven in the area of climate change, meaningful opportunities are multiplying. Efficiency, energy independence through renewable energy, \"clean tax cuts\" all show promise for moving us toward shared goals.\n\nWhen we care about each other and want to meet each other's basic needs, much becomes possible. Even though I have not persuaded my good friend Jacob that climate is a critical concern, he cares more now in part because he cares about me. Also because I did not insist that he accept my view of climate science.\n\nInstead I noted that I don't need proof that climate change is happening. Even if there is only a 10 percent chance that we are destroying the planet's capacity to support future generations, I find that unconscionable. I don't allow my children to play Russian roulette.\n\nThis gave Jacob the space to consider the possibility that climate change is an unacceptable risk rather than react to a demand. And Jacob has caused me to see that climate change is the progressive \"end times\" story.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

We have remarkably different beliefs, but we are learning to hold the tension of our differences and listen to each other with humility.\n\nMore and more of us are working to spark a movement of respect, using simple listening practices that open our hearts. I hope that honoring each other's humanity will lead to more compassionate political discourse and elected leaders that we can all respect, even if they weren't our first choice.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Their selection of Kemi Badenoch as party leader locks in that agenda.\n\nMany Conservatives hope that her energy, as well as her staunch \"anti-woke\" platform, will rejuvenate the party's flagging political fortunes - out of power for the first time in 14 years, with a record-low number of seats in Parliament.\n\nYet others fear that her uncompromising, often Trumpian approach will pull the party further to the right, deepening divides and alienating the centrist voters whom the party hopes to recapture.\n\nMs. Badenoch was born in London but grew up in an affluent family in the Nigerian city of Lagos. She lived there until she was 16, when her parents sent her to the U.K. to avoid the increasingly unstable political situation at home. As a teenager, Ms. Badenoch worked at McDonald's to fund her studies, which earned her a degree in computer systems engineering at the University of Sussex.\n\nMs. Badenoch has described these experiences as the bedrock of her political worldview - one which is staunchly right-wing. In an interview with the Daily Mail, she described Nigeria as a country where she \"never felt safe,\" feeding her appreciation for order and security in the U.K.\n\nThe politician says her time at college - surrounded by those she described as \"stupid, lefty white kids\" - also fed her conservative views. \"People often ask what made me a Conservative and there was no one thing,\" she told The Times of London in one interview. \"But part of it was being at Sussex among snotty, middle-class north Londoners.\"\n\nToday, Ms. Badenoch is well-known for her vocal stance on what her supporters call \"culture war\" causes. She has criticized the Black Lives Matter movement, opposed letting people self-identify as transgender, and said that \"not all cultures are equally valid\" when it comes to deciding who should be allowed into the U.K.\n\nThose positions have fired up hopes among Tories that Ms. Badenoch will win back voters who abandoned the Conservative Party in favor of the populist Reform UK , which enjoyed unprecedented success at the general election by running on an anti-immigration platform.\n\nOthers believe that Ms. Badenoch's bluntness will also play well with voters who are tired of politicians trotting out vague platitudes.\n\n\"I think [Ms. Badenoch] is really good at getting her message across in a clear, coherent, and meaningful way,\" says Gareth Lyon, a Conservative local councilor in Rushmoor, in southern England, who voted for Ms. Badenoch in the party members' leadership vote. He says that since Ms. Badenoch's election, a surge of new members have joined his local party branch.\n\n\"She actually reminds me of Ronald Reagan,\" says Mr. Lyon. \"Something about her is inspiring. Reagan was able to build a coalition, not by pandering, not by trying to make everyone happy, but by starting from what he believed in. That's what I've seen in Kemi.\"\n\nThis straight-talking approach could backfire. The \"culture war\" issues that have earned Ms. Badenoch admiration from some voters are bound to alienate others. She is expected to take the party's policies firmly to the right, a move which could put off more moderate Conservative voters.\n\nBut for now, it is a risk that the Conservative Party is willing to take.\n\nMuch will depend on Ms. Badenoch's next steps. Her leadership bid did not reveal concrete policies, but rather self-described \"core principles,\" such as personal responsibility, family, and truth.\n\nAs a result, Ms. Badenoch has a largely blank slate on which to work. She remains mostly unfamiliar to the electorate: Polling by YouGov in the run-up to the leadership vote found that 43% of Britons simply didn't know how they felt about her.\n\nMs. Badenoch may be \"straight-talking\" - but her impact on the electorate will still depend on the issues and policies she chooses to champion, says Ben Worthy, a lecturer in politics at Birkbeck College, University of London. While Ms. Badenoch has built her reputation on \"anti-woke\" issues, topics such as trans rights have little traction with voters, he says.\n\n\"It could be that she's going to be 'straight-talking' on immigration; there is a segment of voters who are very interested in immigration,\" says Dr. Worthy. \"But most of these voters are already Conservatives.\"\n\nTo win back voters, Ms. Badenoch will need to both diagnose and remedy what led the Conservatives to implode at the last general election.\n\nPolling shows that two events in particular damaged the Conservative Party's reputation, says Dr. Worthy: the Partygate scandal , when then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson held a Downing Street Christmas get-together in violation of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, and the tenure of Liz Truss, a prime minister best known for unpopular economic policies and being compared to a lettuce .\n\n\"It's a mixture of immorality and incompetence,\" says Dr. Worthy.\n\nHer strong moral stances may position Ms. Badenoch well to tackle at least some of these problems. But the road ahead is likely to be long. With just 121 members of Parliament compared with 411 from the ruling Labour Party, the Conservative Party is extremely unlikely to be able to reverse its fortunes in a single term.\n\nUnder these circumstances, consistency will be key, rather than simple answers or even fiery rhetoric. Ms. Badenoch must be able to unite rather than divide in a British political scene that is still fractured and unstable. The Conservative Party itself has burned through six leaders in less than a decade.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

It's the first moment of the vigil of Easter at Church of the Most Holy Redeemer in Manhattan's East Village. Worshippers at this historic Catholic church can only hear her stiletto heels, faint and staccato, as she walks to its organ.\n\nShe steps carefully up the old stone steps to the console, flicking on a reading light that illuminates her sharp features. As more parishioners walk in, she begins to play a mournful introduction, marking the last moments of Lent in what is now a quiet cacophony of footsteps.\n\nNew York has long been a haunt for underground artists. A growing number have become more conservative - and religious.\n\nThis is the organist's sixth gig in four days during Holy Week, which she says is \"kind of fashion week for Catholics.\" A classically trained musician, she is also an artist and model. Earlier this year at an uptown literary ball, she walked a runway for Elena Velez, a well-known designer who's been called the enfant terrible of the fashion world, modeling her controversial \"Gone With the Wind\"-inspired clothing line during the actual New York Fashion Week.\n\nThe church is tucked into a street of 19th-century tenements between Avenues A and B in the East Village, a neighborhood that once embodied New York's bohemian clichés. Right next to it is Graveyard NYC, a heavy-metal tattoo parlor. A few blocks away, the legendary CBGB nightclub, shuttered in 2006, was one of the birthplaces of punk. In 1990, local artists and musicians staged a legendary Resist 2 Exist festival in nearby Tompkins Square, then a drug market and homeless tent city, sparking a near riot when police shut it down.\n\nThe neighborhood may have long since gentrified, but Salomé, her confirmation name-turned-celebrity mononym, has been part of a new cadre of young New York artists who have been raging against a different cause: the cultural rot and decadence brought about by \"libtards.\"\n\n\"Leftists see greatness, and they see beauty, and they're threatened by it, and they want to destroy it,\" says Salomé, who says the Tridentine Mass is \"the greatest work of art\" for its superior musical composition.\n\nOriginally from Philadelphia, Salomé has been a devout Catholic since she was young. She wears a \"Make America Great Again\" hat around town sometimes as an act of ironic defiance. And even though she's a transgender woman, she prefers the term of an earlier age: castrato.\n\nBut first and foremost, she says, she's a child of God.\n\n\"I'm just Catholic here. I sort of refuse to identify myself with any other label, gender, sexuality, political,\" Salomé says. \"I'm Catholic, and I'm an artist. And so because I'm an artist, I'm interested in all ideas. And I happen to have been born in a time when that is not OK.\"\n\nClack. Click. At the end of the service, Salomé steps into the vestibule's yellow light, her 3-inch black pumps clearly visible now. It's late in the evening, but she's wearing a pair of chunky onyx sunglasses that hide her piercing blue eyes, eyes that have locked with French creative directors as well as Italian priests during confession. A wrinkleless, stone-colored Prada trenchcoat presses tightly against her frame.\n\nParishioners exit the church making their last signs of the cross, and Salomé click-clacks quickly down Third Street, disappearing into a crowd of 20-something pleasure-seekers in the East Village's array of cannabis shops and street vendors. She's heading toward the heart of lower Manhattan's conservative counterculture, an area near Chinatown recently dubbed Dimes Square.\n\nIn many ways, the Dimes Square scene began when young New Yorkers, skaters and creative types sick and tired of pandemic restrictions, began to rebel.\n\nSome embraced virtual environments and the technology that made them possible, and edgy podcasts and snarky Substack blogs have always been part of the scene's driving force. But a good number of New York youth saw art and literature as something meant to be shared in person.\n\nMaskless parties started up. A playwright and conservative magazine contributor began staging his work in living rooms. A new local newspaper/neighborhood bulletin called The Drunken Canal began documenting the punklike disregard among local youths for Dr. Anthony Fauci's rules.\n\n\"Young people want presence,\" says Tara Isabella Burton, a bestselling novelist and Oxford-trained theologian. \"It's normal, what's going on. It happened in the 19th century where you saw dandies rebel against automation and industrialization, which affected the politics and the aesthetics of the time.\"\n\nThe restaurant Dimes at the corner of Canal and Division streets near Chinatown became a haunt for an array of hip New York creatives seeking to liberate themselves from both social and ideological shackles. As a pun on Times Square, the gritty area at the border of the Lower East Side became known as Dimes Square.\n\n\"I certainly don't need to tell you that this place is also, emphatically, not in Brooklyn,\" wrote the leftist Substack blogger Mike Crumplar in 2022, with a bit of snark. \"You already know how Brooklyn is too political, too woke, too soft, too soy, too consumed by cancel culture to be a fertile climate for artistic expression. You've already heard about how the vibes are shifting back to downtown Manhattan, which is grittier and sleazier. It's a place where older literary men can have younger muses, free from the prudish Robespierres of the North Brooklyn [Democratic Socialists of America].\"\n\nThe podcast \"Red Scare,\" begun in 2018 and hosted by cultural critics Dasha Nekrasova and Anna Khachiyan, was among the first to popularize the term \"Dimes Square.\" Associated with the \"dirtbag left\" - a term that described zealous Bernie Sanders supporters who eschewed civility and prioritized disruption - the hosts later became disillusioned by the movement and explored the ideas of the \"new right,\" the Donald Trump-led movement that also stands against neoliberalism, global capitalism, and corporate hegemony. Their guests have included people such as Steve Bannon and Alex Jones.\n\nMs. Nekrasova is also a devout Catholic, even if she likes to quip, \"Catholic, like Andy Warhol.\" An actor who had a recurring role in the popular HBO series \"Succession,\" she has hosted podcasts on obscure theological topics.\n\n\"People accuse me of being fascist or a cultural conservative,\" she says in an interview. \"I actually feel more like a degenerate artistically. ... I'm a free speech absolutist.\"\n\nBoth she and Ms. Khachiyan have been outspoken against what they see as the godless politics of the left. \"No hell, no dignity,\" Ms. Nekrasova once said.\n\nPartly because of their influence, the Dimes Square scene began to include a number of artists with more conservative and religious visions. Writers, filmmakers, and fashion designers have been dabbling in pre-Vatican II Catholicism. They play the church organ rather than DJ at nightclubs. Instead of free love and polyamory, they espouse commitment and monogamy. And the flip phone is a favorite accessory - a statement against the herd and its iPhones.\n\n\"New York's hottest club is the Catholic Church,\" proclaimed Julia Yost, senior editor at First Things magazine, in a 2022 essay in The New York Times. \"Traditional morality acquired a transgressive glamour,\" she wrote of the Dimes Square scene. \"Disaffection with the progressive moral majority - combined with Catholicism's historic ability to accommodate cultural subversion - has produced an in-your-face style of traditionalism.\n\n\"This is not your grandmother's church - and whether the new faithful are performing an act of theater or not, they have the chance to revitalize the church for young, educated Americans.\"\n\nJordan Castro looks with wonder at the audience gathered here at Earth, a literary salon and gallery on Orchard Street in the Lower East Side. About 300 people, mostly young and many dressed in monochrome cool, have packed the place to hear the young novelist talk about his work.\n\nEarth's literary salon has been attracting large crowds of people drawn to a literary scene known for its critiques of liberal hegemony in the arts. Its readings and discussions often feature writers who present ideas with witty and at times caustic, ironic prose.\n\nMr. Castro has long been an alternative-literature darling, too. He was the editor of New York Tyrant Magazine, an avant-garde publication specializing in experimental writing. Rugged with wild brown hair and kind, dark eyes and wearing an olive fatigue, he wrote an essay in Harper's Magazine on body building that went viral. He's like a Christian Ken Kesey with a neck tattoo of Ohio, his home state.\n\n\"I think for me, the best literature ... can kind of reveal aspects of life or reality or the psyche or the soul that can reveal those things in sort of unique and compelling ways, so that we can kind of become more attuned to our condition,\" Mr. Castro says in an interview. His first book, \"The Novelist: A Novel,\" is considered a work of \"autofiction,\" and has received glowing reviews.\n\nThe room is hot, so the door stays open as the overflow builds just outside the gallery's storefront space. A young woman peers inside on the shoulders of a friend or lover. An imposing figure whose head practically met the ceiling just outside the door scans the crowd looking like Jesus. Some stray voice in the crowd calls him \"LePuff.\" Young people in grunge-inspired fits and fashion-forward couture squeeze into the corner by the refreshments.\n\nOther readers include the doyenne of Dimes Square, Ms. Nekrasova of \"Red Scare,\" and Tao Lin, another autofiction writer. Mr. Castro's wife, the writer Nicolette Polek, hosted a reading a month ago from her new book, \"Bitter Water Opera,\" which The New Yorker magazine called one of the best books of 2024.\n\nTrue monogamy and traditional Christianity are the last taboos to many, says Mr. Castro, who fell in love with the Eastern Orthodox liturgy and converted a few years ago. He explains how true faith and love freed him from moral rot and a past life consumed by heroin addiction.\n\n\"I strive to be undistracted,\" he remarks. \"Christianity has taught me to pay attention to the important things. I love Jesus, man. Especially when he's ranting at the spoiled temple in John.\"\n\nHe reads poems and stories with a charisma that beams through his smile. The crowd giggles at his insights and claps louder at his lyrical flourishes. Often awkward around strangers, he is comfortable on this makeshift stage. \"Trad culture is not bad for you. Neither is having an objective standard of meaning and not wanting to sleep with 10,000 people,\" he says.\n\nAs a writer and artist, Mr. Castro believes the power of literature can be an entryway into deeper faith - the same theme his wife, Ms. Polek, pursues in her fiction.\n\n\"I think that when people get rid of a transcendent standard of meaning - you know, get rid of a sort of idea of a truth that we can all agree on, something that sort of transcends our own individual whims or preferences - I think when you get rid of that power, it's sort of just your will versus my will.\n\n\"And then, you know, if we're going to live harmoniously, harmoniously with each other,\" he continues, \"we have to have something that can unite us, that sort of transcends our desires, which can change at any moment and which are sort of, you know, untrustworthy.\"\n\nC lick clack. Salomé steps into the screening room of Sovereign House, a subterranean loft and underground artists space in Chinatown.\n\nShe's wearing a sheer black gown and an Arctic fur stole, and she holds aloft a bouquet of roses and baby's breath. Fans gather in a circle to greet the musician and model. She's a well-recognized presence in the Dimes Square scene. It's a screening for her most recent creative turn: She acted in a short film titled \"Envy/Desire.\"\n\n\"We're just kind of reinventing, like, how do you make a movie?\" Salomé says. \"It's made by someone who's not a filmmaker, and acted by people who are sort of not actors. Yeah, it's like a new thing. It's not so much like an intentional, 'Oh, we're going to do this because we're going to insert this belief.'\"\n\nThe film recalls the do-it-yourself quality of a John Waters film, and it's about a transgender woman who believes she may have found the man of her dreams. But his interest in her may reveal his own questions about his gender. Afterward, the crowd claps for the creative team as it takes bows under warm stage lights, and many linger for the Q&A.\n\nSovereign House is a salon started by Nick Allen, a New York tech worker who wanted to create a space for more dissident Dimes Square artists. They host parties for newly launched magazines, stage new plays, and even just engage in conversations about art and literature. (The tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel has also helped fund an \"antiwoke\" film festival in Manhattan.)\n\nThe underground event space has rustic columns separating the foyer from the screening room area. Ironically, the patio out back overlooks the headquarters of the Democratic Socialists in New York.\n\nA general vibe in Dimes Square is that no ideas are off-limits - a reaction to what many artists see as the stifling censorship of left-wing \"cancel culture.\" The salon at Sovereign House has hosted speakers such as Steve Sailer, a far-right thinker. In the past, Mr. Sailer has said Black people \"possess poorer native judgment than members of better-educated groups\" and need moral guidance from society.\n\nBut the underground salon in Chinatown has also included a number of religiously conservative artists and thinkers.\n\nOn a cold October night last fall, Stephen G. Adubato was chatting up guests at Sovereign House while wearing a \"Newark\" patched bomber jacket and sporting a freshly cut fade. Around his neck is a gold cross - the writer and professor of philosophy and religion is a devout Catholic.\n\nHe's here to talk about the latest issue of his project Cracks in Postmodernity, which includes a Substack, zine, and podcast. It's been catching on with a downtown set of writers, and a big crowd has gathered to hear him read from his latest issue.\n\nThe master of ceremonies for the evening, Brennan Vickery, a local bartender who is a regular presence at Sovereign House, contributes to Mr. Adubato's project. He warms up the crowd.\n\n\"Alex Jones, who I by no means am a fan of, but he said this thing that kind of stuck with me, and it is kind of true,\" he says afterward. \"He's like, Do you want to go to a house party that's with liberal people or conservative people? If you go to a liberal party these days, it's like, you can't say this, you can't say that. ... It's going to be subdued. No one can be offensive. So who do you want to party with?\"\n\nLike Salomé, Mr. Adubato only accepts the label Catholic. He says he does not consider himself a conservative, per se, but he accepts the full moral teachings of Catholicism. He initially said his project was intended \"to explore the ways that our contemporary culture points us to the truth of Christ.\" He changed it to an edgier description: \"subverting subversiveness through pretentious and ironic cultural commentary that gives precedence to aesthetics and ontology over ethics and politics.\"\n\n\"I don't want anyone to say anything conventional,\" Mr. Adubato says in an interview. \"I don't want anything predictable. I don't want anyone to sound like they're reading off of a script. That being said, I also think there's a certain limit. I like to be risqué. I like to poke fun at conventional discourse. I'm trying to serve a higher purpose. There's a point where it could become self-indulgent. Where you can say something very hurtful to somebody.\"\n\nHe's nervous tonight. Onstage in a pair of white Nikes, he shakes a bit with his eyes glued to the pages in front of him - a short story about a blue-haired liberal \"getting owned\" by a believer in the Almighty.\n\nMr. Adubato has been visiting other downtown venues to publicize his project. At another event at The Catholic Worker Maryhouse on Third Street in the East Village, not far from Church of the Most Holy Redeemer, over 120 people come on a cold Monday night.\n\nHe discusses the growing interest in religion in these downtown Manhattan haunts.\n\n\"People are tired of pure secularism. It's a dead end. It doesn't promise anything,\" he says in an interview afterward. \"There are people who are still into this spiritual thing and not being tied to any institutional religion. Some people are still into the new age stuff, which in a way has a value. I get why people are still drawn to it.\n\n\"But I am seeing more people being drawn to organized religion, whether it's Catholicism or branches of Protestantism or Islam or Judaism, because there is something a little more concrete about the promises that practicing these religions gives you.\"\n\nThe communal spirit at these events focusing on religious issues has been growing.\n\n\"When you go to a church, it's very clear what's being asked of you, and you can share that path with other people. We want that. We want to be together,\" says Mr. Adubato. \"We want to understand what our lives are for. We don't want this vagueness anymore.\"\n\nAudrey Horne hangs her winter coat on the wicker chair before she sits down to a hot cup of coffee at Café Kitsuné in Manhattan's West Village. Her blue eyes scan the Saturday afternoon crowd. In the corner, a man in a two-piece suit adds final touches to a fashion sketch in front of him, an emerald-hued pastry reduced to crumbs beside him.\n\nShe's made a name for herself as a writer and thinker simply by posting on online forums and the social media site X, where she has 32,000 followers, including editors and writers from Harper's and The New Yorker.\n\nShe spends a lot of time in Washington, D.C., where she's become part of a similar scene of religious thinkers and seekers meeting to discuss art and literature. But she remains a voice in the Dimes Square crowd.\n\n\"I kind of grew an audience through fighting people online and telling people how lonely I was, and just being really brutally honest,\" she says. \"People responded to that in a really unprecedented way.\"\n\nSitting upright, Ms. Horne doesn't telegraph \"bohemian layabout.\" But her attendance at downtown readings and literary salons speaks to the curiosity that had remained unquenched in her youth. She spent much of her childhood in the Two by Twos religious sect, witnessing an FBI raid on what has been labeled a cult. She now says she's a nondenominational Protestant Christian.\n\nShe was living in Seattle before the pandemic, and she describes how she became weary and even a bit alienated from the politics of women's marches, liberal arrogance, and political correctness.\n\n\"And then I listened to this podcast from New York, 'Red Scare,'\" she says. \"It was really exciting, because these are women who historically, I would assume, would be totally opposed to me. But they were saying things I kind of felt and agreed with deep down. ... At the time, there was, like, a sense of almost revenge, and it was kind of delicious. Yeah, I was just intoxicated.\"\n\nSo she moved to the East Coast - just before the COVID-19 shutdown. Isolated and lonely, she began to get into arguments online in the style of \"Red Scare.\" As she got noticed, she started getting out and hitting up Dimes Square watering holes, where she met up with like-minded artists rebelling against what they saw as liberal hegemony. For the first time, she felt comfortable in a secular world of artists and bohemian layabouts, bon vivants, and culture vultures.\n\nBut all the aggressiveness and snark and irony now seems to have gone too far in the scene, she says.\n\n\"I've had to learn to hold a lot of complexity,\" Ms. Horne says. \"And that has made me, I think and I hope, far less judgmental, far more open, and far more forgiving of myself and of others and their forms of exploring.\"\n\nPart of this spirit of tolerance, she says, is arising out of many people's earnest search for meaning. And a lot of that has to do with a growing interest in religion. \"There's something in the air right now that does feel much more open to faith,\" says Ms. Horne. \"I think that culture now feels a lot more - a lot softer, like people are curious about it and seeking it. And not just seeking it, but the real truth underlying the life of faith. ... It has made space for me to jump in and express what I believe to be true.\"\n\n\"We want something pure. We want something earnest,\" she continues. \"I hate to say a new sincerity, but it feels like a return to sincerity. I do think that that's what feels most fresh right now [in the arts]. Like, it's not even funny to be anti-irony. Like, just don't even reference yourself; don't talk about postirony, post-culture war. That's what we're kind of tired of.\"\n\nMr. Vickery, Cracks in Postmodernity's emcee, is standing outside the salon, hanging out near Sovereign House with a crew of bushy-haired 20-somethings. The conversation turns to the place of gay men in the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nDespite being gay himself, Mr. Vickery says gay men are not really a part of this \"intersectional\" identity. \"We're different historically,\" he says.\n\nHe never felt he fit in with the other tribes of gay men clustered in Hell's Kitchen and Chelsea on the West Side, those who were onto \"a new cause every week.\"\n\n\"I think the reason that [artists here] are socially conservative - or at least they pretend to be in this punk kind of element - is because they don't want to be told what to do and what to make and what not to say.\"\n\nHe tried his hand at acting and painting and publishing after he left the Florida Panhandle for New York, and he grew at odds with a lot of the decadence and ugliness in the city, he says. But he fits in here with aggressive, free-thinking conservatives.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

At a conservative rally in Florida, voters muse which Republican is best suited to take on President Joe Biden.\n\nLoading...\n\nJuly 25, 2022, 11:46 a.m. ET | Tampa, Florida\n\nWhen former President Donald Trump took the stage before a crowd of more than 5,000 young conservative activists in Tampa this weekend, he received the rock star's welcome he's grown accustomed to over the seven years in which he's reshaped the Republican Party.\n\nOne night earlier, it was Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis who had the crowd on its feet as he headlined the day's program at Turning Point USA's annual Student Action Summit.\n\n\"To be honest, it's like choosing between your favorite child,\" said Leo Milik, 19, who lives in Barrington, Illinois, when asked whom he'd like to see as the party's next nominee.\n\nMr. Milik, wearing a \"Trump was Right\" baseball cap, said both Republicans \"have their pros, they have their cons.\" For now, he said, he's leaning toward Mr. Trump.\n\nThat sentiment reflects the soul searching underway inside the GOP as an invisible primary for the 2024 presidential nomination begins to take shape, dominated at least for the moment by Mr. Trump and Governor DeSantis.\n\nThere's little doubt that Mr. Trump is moving closer to announcing a third presidential campaign. But there's genuine debate over whether he's the party's best candidate to take on President Joe Biden, who is otherwise seen as a vulnerable incumbent heading into the next campaign, weighed down by soaring inflation, sinking popularity, and questions about his capacity to manage the United States into his 80s.\n\nThis summer's hearings by the House committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection have only amplified the GOP's anxiety about Trump. A pair of weekend editorials in the New York Post and Wall Street Journal - publications owned by the often Trump-friendly Rupert Murdoch - underscored the impact, castigating the former president for refusing to call off the mob of his supporters as they stormed the U.S. Capitol to halt the peaceful transfer of power.\n\n\"As a matter of principle, as a matter of character, Trump has proven himself unworthy to be this country's chief executive again,\" wrote the New York Post.\n\nBut inside the Tampa Convention Center, mentions of Jan. 6 elicited cheers as a who's who of Trump's \"MAGA movement\" took the stage in a room that had the feel of a Las Vegas nightclub.\n\nYoung attendees dressed in sparkly heels and candy-colored cowboy boots danced under laser lights to a DJ before the program began. Speakers were introduced with WWE-style videos, elaborate pyrotechnics, and smoke displays. Throughout the venue, ring lights were placed strategically in front of logoed backdrops for flattering photo ops. Outside, a small group of neo-Nazis briefly waved swastika flags.\n\nThe top draw was Mr. Trump, who again teased his future plans.\n\n\"I ran twice. I won twice and did much better the second time ... and now we may just have to do it again,\" he said to thundering cheers and chants of \"Take it back!\"\n\nDuring his speech, Mr. Trump appeared intent to address criticism from some corners of the party that he is too focused on relitigating the 2020 election, telling the crowd he wanted to talk about \"some of the really big issues.\" But he quickly returned to familiar grievances, labeling himself the most persecuted politician in the nation's history as he inched ever closer to announcing a run.\n\n\"If I renounced my beliefs, if I agreed to stay silent, if I stayed home, if I announced that I was not going to run for office, the persecution of Donald Trump would immediately stop,\" he said. \"But that's what they want me to do. And you know what? There's no chance I do that.\"\n\nMr. DeSantis, who often insists he is focused solely on reelection as governor, headlined Friday night's program in an appearance that strongly suggested his ambitions extend beyond the state.\n\nHe welcomed the crowd to the \"free state of Florida\" and highlighted the anti-COVID mitigation policies that made him a conservative hero during the height of the pandemic. And he bragged about his efforts to bar discussions of race and sexual orientation in Florida classrooms, as well as his battles with Disney.\n\n\"We've accomplished an awful lot in the state of Florida. But we have only begun to fight,\" he said. \"Because we are on a mission to keep the state of Florida free and to save our great country.\"\n\nAn unscientific straw poll of attendees at the event found that 78.7% would vote for Mr. Trump in a GOP primary, with Mr. DeSantis coming in second with 19%. No other potential candidate came in above 1 percent.\n\nAnd many were indeed all in for Mr. Trump to run in 2024.\n\n\"I love the idea, I absolutely do,\" said Ryan Malone, 33, who recently moved from New York to Florida. While he is a big fan of Mr. DeSantis, he argued that Mr. Trump is best positioned to turn the country around from what he sees as Mr. Biden's litany of failures.\n\n\"I think that he would get more done,\" he said. \"Again, I love DeSantis, he's my 1A, right? But I do think that if we're going to get out of this miserable period that we're in, Trump is the guy to get us out of this hole.\"\n\nStill, he worried about what might happen if the two were to run against each other in a GOP primary.\n\n\"I wouldn't want to see there be bad blood between the person who's, like, the true leader of our party and then the person who's, you know, the second coming,\" he said.\n\nBut his wife, Dr. Mariuxi Viteri Malone, 33, is eager for Mr. DeSantis to run. As an immigrant from Ecuador, she said she was offended by Mr. Trump's rhetoric toward Hispanics.\n\n\"Be nice!\" he said. \"That's all you need to do.\"\n\nOthers were more strategic in their thinking.\n\nCameron Lilly, 29, said that he personally likes Mr. DeSantis better than Mr. Trump, but nonetheless thinks another Mr. Trump run makes sense for the party.\n\n\"I think Ron DeSantis right now is wasting the one more chance that Trump has,\" said Mr. Lilly, who works for a defense contractor in Annapolis, Maryland. \"I like DeSantis even a little bit more. But I think if we want to have consistent conservatives in the White House, one more Trump term, DeSantis as vice president, and then potentially one or two more terms. That's the way to keep conservatives in the White House for more years.\"\n\nSteven Dykstra, 22, had another reason.\n\n\"As much as I want DeSantis to be the president - he would make a great president - I want him to stay in Florida,\" said Mr. Dykstra, who attends Pasco-Hernando State College. \"If he were to run in 2024, he wouldn't be our governor. He's been a great governor. I think he should stay.\"\n\nOrlando sisters Sydney and Janae Kinne, who go by \"The Patriot Sisters\" online, said they were fans of both Mr. Trump and Mr. DeSantis, but don't expect either to run in 2024.\n\n\"I would still vote for him. We're still there. But I would like to see him in a different seat this year,\" said Janae, 23, of Mr. Trump. \"If he runs, I mean, we're going to be on the street rooting for him anyways. But we'd like to see him start to raise up other people who have the same mentality.\"\n\nSydney, 21, said she was looking for an alternative, but wasn't sure who.\n\n\"That's the question of the hour,\" she said. \"Right now what we need is someone that, yes, is strong, they're strong-willed, but someone that's a little more kind of rallying everyone together.\"\n\nBut Zachary Roberson, 22, said that, if he ever had to choose between Mr. Trump and Mr. DeSantis, he'd pick the Florida governor.\n\n\"He seems like a more refined version of Trump. So I'm hoping he runs for president,\" said Mr. Roberson, a student at Florida Gulf Coast University.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

But a new Pew Research survey shows that they also find common ground when it comes to the top three values.\n\nLoading...\n\nSept. 18, 2014, 12:46 p.m. ET\n\nAmid the growing political polarization of the US, the Pew Research Center has released a survey today that shows liberals and conservatives have common ground, at least when it comes to parenting.\n\nEven the most divergent political ideologists agree that of 12 core values to teach our kids the top three should be - responsibility, hard work, and good manners.\n\nIt's worth pointing out that this was a nationally representative panel of 3,243 randomly selected U.S. adults surveyed online and by mail - but these are not necessarily parents.\n\nI point this out because my ideals and goals before having children - and after the reality of having four boys - were radically altered by the very nature of child-rearing and how it alerts us to reality vs. ideology.\n\nFor example, as a college student I didn't value empathy and tolerance nearly as much as I do after having four kids who test those qualities in me daily.\n\n\"Teaching the Children: Sharp Ideologies, some common ground\" conducted April 29-May 27 asked adults about the importance of teaching 12 different qualities to children.\n\nThose surveyed were asked to choose the three traits that are most important, according to the Pew website .\n\nThe 12 core values are: Empathy for others, Helping others, Obedience, Religious Faith, Persistence, Being Well-Mannered, Independence, Being Responsible, Hard Work, Creativity, Tolerance and Curiosity.\n\nAccording to the study \"responsibility\" was the greatest common denominator between respondents when it comes to child rearing, no matter what part of the political spectrum they choose.\n\nOf those surveyed 95 percent of women and 91 percent of men responded that teaching kids to be responsible was in the top three priorities for them as parents.\n\nBeyond these three values, the conservative-liberal divide begins to assert itself when it comes to child-rearing values.\n\nThe Pew study says that those \"who express consistently conservative political attitudes across a range of issues are more likely than other ideological groups to rate teaching religious faith as especially important - and the least likely to say the same about teaching tolerance.\"\n\nThose with consistent liberal attitudes, the study says, \"stand out for the high priority they give to teaching tolerance - and the low priority they attach to teaching religious faith and obedience.\"\n\nWhat I found interesting was that men and women overall remained fairly close in their parenting preferences, generally within less than a 10-point range of each other.\n\nFor \"manners,\" 86 percent of women and 81 percent of men found that to be an important value. Most of the other point spreads were similar with the exception of \"Empathy for Others\" where women came in at 75 percent and men at just 81 percent.\n\n\"Curiosity\" provided a dead heat with 59 percent of both men and women determining that to be an important core value.\n\nRacial divides\n\nThe study notes also that black Americans surveyed place a higher importance on teaching children religious faith than whites or Hispanics. Pew notes that reflects the higher levels of religious practice and commitment among African Americans compared to the public as a whole .\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

And that's always welcome in the parenting community.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in\n\nMonitor journalism changes lives because we open that too-small box that most people think they live in.

Unleash Capitalism.\" For an exhibitor at America's largest annual conservative shindig, it's a slogan as truism, as ubiquitous as U.S. flags and Make America Great Again caps.\n\nBut the actual political messaging by Young Conservatives for Carbon Dividends (YCCD) borders on subversive. At its booth, sandwiched between the Federalist Society and a pro-Electoral College group, smartly dressed students make the case for Republicans to accept mainstream climate science and support a carbon tax as a capitalist solution.\n\nFor a party whose titular head, President Donald Trump, rejects the established science and has torn up regulations that restrain carbon emissions, that sounds like a tough sell. And a tax is still a tax, even if the revenue is to be returned in full to taxpayers as a dividend.\n\nIt is said that young people shape the world in their own image. When it comes to climate change, young conservatives are pushing for a Republican agenda that addresses their concerns - and values.\n\nBut when Elise LaFleur, a politics senior at Catholic University of America in Washington, drops by the YCCD booth, she comes away impressed. For her generation, global warming isn't a hoax but a reality to be faced, the sooner the better.\n\n\"It's a conversation we need to be having,\" she says. \"Conservatives do care about the climate.\"\n\nFrom college campuses to Washington think tanks, the ground is shifting beneath the feet of a party that has long sought refuge in climate obfuscation. Republicans' fitful efforts to correct course - and hold onto voters concerned about climate - have largely been eclipsed by President Trump's regulatory bonfires and cheerleading for fossil fuels. But GOP lawmakers in Congress have begun to support various proposals aimed at limiting emissions, including a carbon dividend plan backed by banks, manufacturers, and energy companies.\n\n\"The question is not whether or not you view climate change as an issue that requires a solution, but what is your policy and how do you intend to reduce carbon emissions?\" says Ryan Costello, a Republican and former U.S. House representative who lobbies for the dividend plan.\n\nThis shift on the right hasn't yet translated into votes in Congress. Eight bills have been introduced by Democrats in the House and Senate that would put a price on carbon, according to E&E News . But they have only a handful of Republican co-sponsors, and Rep. Francis Rooney, a Florida Republican who has co-sponsored several such bills, is stepping down this year.\n\nMoreover, some of the GOP solutions - planting trees, subsidizing technology - fall well short of a comprehensive approach to rival the Democrats' aspirational Green New Deal. When House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy unveiled his climate platform in January, it avoided carbon taxes and didn't set any overall targets for emissions cuts.\n\nThis reluctance to grapple with carbon pricing is understandable, given where Republicans started, says Joseph Majkut, director of climate policy at the Niskanen Center, a centrist think tank that supports a carbon tax. \"Assembling a large coalition is an iterative process. These ideas need to be vetted and understood and stress-tested,\" he says.\n\nFor activists like Kiera O'Brien, a Harvard senior and president of YCCD, student-led advocacy on climate policy offers a path to prod Republican leaders off the fence. She's tired of being asked by left-leaning students why conservatives are ignoring the climate crisis. She also knows that at partisan events like last week's Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), critics might spy a sellout to the left's climate agenda.\n\n\"It's not easy to be a sore thumb in the Republican Party saying, 'We need a solution,'\" she says.\n\nBut it is getting easier, says Alex Flint, executive director of the Alliance for Market Solutions, a conservative, pro-carbon-tax group that works on Capitol Hill, far from the grassroots foment at CPAC. In 2018, when he met with 82 Republican members of Congress, all but one acknowledged climate change was a reality , even though \"they weren't having that conversation publicly,\" he says.\n\nIn 2019 \"that conversation went public,\" he says. GOP lawmakers \"are now beginning to explore what are the policies they can embrace to address it, and what are the politics of those policies. Because they have to understand both.\"\n\nPolls show that young conservatives are increasingly concerned about the climate and want to see action. In a Pew survey last October, more than half of millennial and Generation Z Republicans said the government wasn't doing enough on climate, compared with 31% of boomers and those older. Still, a partisan divide remains: Among Democrats the overall share was 90%, compared with 39% for Republicans.\n\nAnd while voters express concern, the saliency of climate varies. In surveys taken over the past decade by Yale and George Mason universities, the share of Republicans who said global warming should be \"a very high priority\" for the federal government never broke 10%; among Democrats it rose from 20% in 2010 to 48% in 2019.\n\nGrowing up in Alaska, which is warming faster than the rest of the continental United States, Ms. O'Brien could see the effects of climate change. She also warmed to the idea of a dividend from carbon taxes since Alaska has returned some of its oil wealth this way for decades; Ms. O'Brien's parents saved their annual checks to help pay for her college tuition.\n\nThat's why she goes to bat for a carbon-tax plan at CPAC, as well as at environmental events where, as a Republican, she's in the minority.\n\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum is the Heartland Institute, a climate-denial group that is a perennial at CPAC, pushing a free-market vision of abundant fossil fuels. This year the Chicago-based group hosted Naomi Seibt, a German teenager and \"climate realism\" YouTuber, seeking to counter the reach of Greta Thunberg, the Swedish schoolgirl turned climate icon.\n\nThe event for Ms. Seibt was barely a quarter full, though, and a modest Heartland booth in the exhibit hall was similarly becalmed. (YCCD and Heartland were both CPAC sponsors.)\n\nThe YCCD booth saw plenty of foot traffic, including young attendees who wanted selfies with the life-size cutouts of former Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush that bracketed the table. In Ms. O'Brien's eyes, both presidents are reminders that Republicans can lead nationally and internationally on climate policy.\n\nSome older attendees took offense. \"You believe in climate change? That's nuts,\" a middle-aged man told a YCCD volunteer, who calmly tried to explain the science behind the policy. \"You're just taking what the media says,\" the man scoffed, claiming that NASA data showed three years of falling global temperatures (in fact, 2019 was the second hottest year recorded, after 2016).\n\nMs. O'Brien says she's not trying to convert older climate skeptics. Her goal is to find young conservatives interested in pursuing bipartisan solutions to a self-evident problem.\n\n\"Republicans have abandoned this issue to the Democratic Party for the past 30 years. As a young Republican, that is unacceptable,\" she says.\n\nMr. Costello, a two-term representative from Pennsylvania who stepped down in 2018, says that Democrats may be out front on climate but they're divided on what to do. \"The Democrats have not unified around a particular solution and nor have Republicans. What I'd like to see is Republicans unify around this solution,\" he says, referring to carbon dividends.\n\nHow long that takes, and whether success ultimately hinges on a change in the White House, is unknowable. Analysts say the current jockeying may not bear fruit until the next Congress.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nMr. Flint, a former staff director of the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, has a theory of change. \"Politicians in a democracy are not necessarily leaders,\" he says, noting that scientists and economists have led on climate, and corporations have joined them. Elected officials, like ordinary voters, have been slower to grasp the policy challenge.\n\n\"In a democracy, maybe it's good that politicians wait until there's a consensus among voters for change. And what's happening now is there is increasingly a political imperative to take action.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

The clash comes amid a wider debate in the US about the First Amendment as violent protests between far-right and far-left protesters have derailed appearances by controversial figures.\n\nLoading...\n\nJune 05, 2017, 9:39 a.m. ET | Portland, Ore.\n\nThousands of demonstrators and counter protesters converged in downtown Portland, Ore., on Sunday, a day marked by multiple arrests and clashes between police and protesters.\n\nA pro-President Trump free speech rally drew several hundred to a plaza near City Hall more than a week after two Portland men were fatally stabbed trying to stop a man from shouting anti-Muslim insults at two teenage girls on a light-rail train.\n\nThat rally was met across the street by hundreds of counter-protesters organized by immigrant rights, religious, and labor groups. They said they wanted to make a stand against hate and racism.\n\nPortland police said Sunday evening that 14 people were arrested, and several dozen knives, bricks, sticks and other weapons were seized.\n\nBy late afternoon, police closed nearby Chapman Square where a separate group of protesters - many wearing masks and black clothing and identified as anti-fascists - also demonstrated. Police used flash-bang grenades and pepper balls to disperse that crowd after saying protesters were hurling bricks and other objects at officers.\n\nThe people gathered at the free speech rally organized by the conservative group Patriot Prayer and counter-protesters at City Hall were not involved in those clashes, police said.\n\nAfter several dozen demonstrators began marching north of the initial rally locations, police officers moved in and blocked them. They detained a large crowd in the street, including several journalists.\n\nPeople identified as participating in criminal activity would be arrested, police said. Everyone else was eventually released after officers took photographs of their identification.\n\nSunday's event was organized by the group Patriot Prayer and billed as Trump Free Speech Rally in \"one of the most liberal areas of the West Coast.\"\n\nRally organizer Joey Gibson held a moment of silence for the two men who were stabbed to death and pleaded with the crowd to refrain from violence. He later told them that goal is to wake up the liberty movement. \"It's OK to be a conservative in Portland,\" he said.\n\nLast week Mayor Ted Wheeler unsuccessfully tried to have the permit for the free speech rally revoked, saying it could further enflame tensions following the May 26 stabbings.\n\nThe suspect in the light-rail stabbings, Jeremy Joseph Christian attended a similar rally in late April wearing an American flag around his neck and carrying a baseball bat. Police confiscated the bat, and he was then caught on camera clashing with counter-protesters.\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook, Gibson condemned Mr. Christian and acknowledged that some rallies have attracted \"legitimate Nazis.\" He described the attacker on the light rail as \"all crazy\" and \"not a good guy.\"\n\nMatthew Eggiman, who lives in Corvallis, said he showed up Sunday to oppose bigotry and racism. He worried that that hateful rhetoric would embolden others. But he also condemned protesters who show up hoping to provoke violence.\n\nThe Rev. Diane Dulin of the United Church of Christ said in a statement ahead of the day's events that any act of violence in the community should be met by non-violence.\n\n\"We build our hope and our stamina for justice by showing up,\" said Dulin, part of a coalition of groups that organized rally to oppose hate.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Christian is charged with aggravated murder and other counts.\n\nThe concerns over the Portland rally come amid a wider debate in the United States about the First Amendment, often in liberal cities like Portland and Berkeley, Calif., and on college campuses, where violent protests between far-right and far-left protesters have derailed appearances by contentious figures.

      "text": "Meet the leaders of the Trump era's new conservative economic populism\n\nThis reported column is Part Two of Eamon Javers' two-part series on the new, conservative economic populism gaining ground among Republicans close to former President Donald Trump.\n\nWASHINGTON - The effort underway to define a new, conservative economic policy for the age of Trump is driven in part by a changing understanding of who conservatives are - and what kind of policy they actually care about.\n\nLeading this change is a cadre of economic populists who reject the political bargain that created the modern Republican Party in America: The marriage of conservative social policy that appeals to rural and evangelical voters with low-tax, laissez-faire economic policy beloved by corporate boardrooms.\n\nAs it gains steam, this effort has the potential to reshape both the GOP and U.S. electoral politics for a generation - but only if it is successful.\n\nFor Sohrab Ahmari, a former Wall Street Journal writer, the goal of neopopulist economics is to reverse the hollowing out of the American middle class that, he believes, has led to many of the pressures on American families that are driving the anger of today's culture wars.\n\nAnd in a Republican Party that he says increasingly represents \"downscale America\" Ahmari argues that there is a political imperative to harness a vast swath of voters he describes as culturally conservative, but eager for more social stability in their lives.\n\nThese voters, he contends, believe in traditional male and female gender labels but also embrace the economic gains of the New Deal. They love Social Security, and they support unions - particularly the ones they themselves belong to. They want a stable financial foundation for their lives, one that is not available in a service-sector-based economy.\n\nIt is precisely former President Donald Trump 's appeal to downscale America, Ahmari argues, that accounts for his polling gains among Hispanic and African American voters - a trend that has befuddled pundits inside the Beltway for months.\n\nThis also suggests that the Trump coalition in 2024 could be broader than many in Washington or on Wall Street anticipate.\n\nTo cement this new coalition together, Ahmari says conservatives first need to embrace unions, if not the political leadership of the current union movement. He envisions a reset of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 to create a broad, sectorwide labor bargaining system, more like a European model.\n\nHe would also like to see a higher minimum wage in nonunion sectors - which he would achieve by empowering regional \"wage boards,\" a resurrection of a New Deal framework that was used to negotiate pay between workers and companies.\n\nHe would push for more restrictions on immigration, including shutting down the H-1B visas that he argues are used by corporations to bring in \"indentured servants\" in the form of workers whose immigration status is tied to their employer, which dramatically reduces their ability to push for higher wages.\n\nBelow is a list of conservative populist economic proposals, several of which would likely get serious consideration in a second Trump administration.\n\nSource: AmericanCompass.org\n\nAhmari argues that tariffs and immigration restrictions are actually the flip side of the same coin, and necessary to push back on corporate power that has been used for decades to control the flows of goods and of labor.\n\nUnder this view, tariffs could help conservatives to wrestle back control over the flow of goods, while immigration restrictions could help them win back control of the flow of labor - to the ultimate benefit of American workers.\n\nAhmari would like to see the economy regulated under a national industrial policy - a government effort to steer the direction of the economy that has long been anathema to free market conservatives.\n\n\"Building stuff matters,\" Ahmari says. \"We've learned since the Ukraine war and the pandemic that you can't just have a services economy. If we can't manufacture artillery shells and masks and ventilators, we're vulnerable.\"\n\nOren Cass, founder of the populist economic think tank American Compass, says this new agenda is much more than just a policy framework -- it's part of a seismic demographic shift underway in the GOP.\n\nHe argues that a generational changing of the guard is occurring inside the Republican Party - led by a small set of young, ambitious Republican senators: J.D. Vance, Ohio, Marco Rubio, Fla., Josh Hawley, Mo., and Tom Cotton, Ark.\n\nThe generational shift underway among elected officials, he tells me, is also reflected in the congressional staffers, policy wonks and media people who form the base of the conservative movement in Washington.\n\n\"When you look at people 25 to 40 years old, all of the most motivated, competent, promising people across the right of center are going in this direction,\" Cass said.\n\n\"As invisible as this may be to the CNBC audience, if you are at a happy hour in DC, this has already happened.\"\n\nCass counts among his allies several well-respected conservative economic thinkers.\n\nIn Trump's orbit, this includes former United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who joined the board of American Compass in 2021.\n\nLighthizer would be widely expected to take a leading role in crafting a Trump second-term economic policy if the presumptive Republican nominee is elected in November.\n\nJames Pethokoukis is a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, and a proponent of the old-school Reaganite consensus economic policies.\n\nBut, like Cass, he too sees a Republican Party that is undergoing rapid change.\n\n\"I am deeply skeptical of that entire movement, because it's fundamentally based on being reactive to your voters rather than trying to come up with good policy,\" Pethokoukis told me in a recent interview.\n\n\"It's economic policy that emerges not from good economics, but from politics and the culture war and what your base wants,\" he said.\n\nOne of the sharpest critiques directed at this Trumpian neopopulism by traditional conservatives is that its policies are often inflationary.\n\nComing at a time when high inflation has taken a high political toll on Democratic President Joe Biden - making voters essentially blind to what is an otherwise strong economy -  any effort that could increase costs for consumers is likely to be viewed as politically dangerous.\n\nAnd what else has happened is a weird bending of the political spectrum such that the new Trump-fueled populists on the right are finding common cause with the economic populists on the left.\n\nThe new conservative economists find common ground with the Biden administration on a range of issues, from industrial policy efforts like his infrastructure bill (which they see as too green, but directionally healthy), the CHIPS Act spending on the semiconductor industry and others.\n\n\"We need to recognize that our (2017) corporate tax cut seems to have generated no meaningful increase in investment. But if you do a CHIPS Act, boom, you have $60 billion in investment,\" Cass said.\n\nAnd they like Biden's focus on antitrust enforcement, particularly against Big Tech companies, which they view as unfair to conservatives. They also like the Biden administration's move to eliminate private sector noncompete agreements, which hurt workers' ability to find higher paying jobs.\n\nAhmari goes so far as to call himself a \"Khan-servative,\" in tribute to Lina Khan, Biden's Federal Trade Commission chair and a leader of the left's thinking on antitrust issues.\n\nThat leads to a Venn diagram politics, in which populists from the left and right could team up on specific issues.\n\nThis could be a welcome change for voters, many of whom say they are exhausted by constant political gridlock in a country where civil society is frayed by ideological divisions.\n\nIt could also offer something more tangible: A road map to gaining legislative traction for bold policy ideas in a Trump 2 administration.\n\nIn March, for example, Vance partnered with liberal Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse to introduce the \"Stop Subsidizing Giant Mergers Act,\" which would end tax-free mergers and taxpayer subsidies that the senators see as consolidating corporate power.\n\nThe two politicians listed the types of tax-free mergers they would like to block in the future, including Facebook's $19 billion acquisition of What'sApp in 2014 and AT&T's $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner in 2018.\n\nAnd in February, Vance raised eyebrows in Washington when he said the FTC's Khan is \"doing a pretty good job\" - rare praise from a conservative for the Biden administration.\n\nBut that praise comes in a context that is something new and different in Washington, and which many on Wall Street and in corporate boardrooms don't fully understand yet.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "The 'death knell' sounded for the Conservative Party long before the UK election, polling guru says\n\nLONDON - After 14 years in power, the U.K.'s ruling Conservative Party looks to be standing on the brink of a momentous electoral defeat in the July 4 vote.\n\nIn the last few days leading up to the election, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has tried to put a brave face on his party's poor showing in the polls - which point to a mammoth win for the rival Labour Party - by saying the result was not a \"forgone conclusion.\"\n\nWhile there's bound to be a reckoning after the election, and some serious soul-searching as to where things went wrong, political analysts tend to agree there was not much that Sunak could have done to repair serious damage done by previous leaders in recent years.\n\nJohn Curtice, one of the U.K.'s most highly regarded polling experts, put the party's demise down to two irreparably damaging events in recent years.\n\n\"This is not an election about the ideological position of the parties, this is an election about competence,\" Curtice told CNBC in the run-up to the vote.\n\n\"The reason why we are where we are is because a) the Conservatives were dealt a bad hand but b) they played it badly.\"\n\nCurtice said \"Partygate,\" the revelation that government officials broke social gathering rules during the Covid-19 pandemic, and the short-lived Liz Truss government of 2022, whose ill-fated economic policies caused market panic, were the origins of the party's downfall.\n\n\"These are the two defining events [of the election], and everything else is variation and embellishment,\" noted Curtice, a professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde and senior research fellow at the National Centre for Social Research.\n\n\"No government that has presided over a market crisis has survived in the ballot box. It is a death knell,\" he added.\n\n\"And meanwhile, in this case, you've got a government that's ditched not one but two prime ministers and one of them [Boris Johnson] was because of his devious relationship with the truth, something that the Conservative Party has never been willing to acknowledge.\"\n\nPartygate was the name given to the scandal that erupted when it was revealed that government officials, including then-Prime Minister Johnson, had attended lockdown-breaking parties and gatherings in both private residences and workplaces during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nJohnson resisted calls to resign before finally doing so in June 2022. An inquiry later concluded that Johnson had deliberately misled Parliament over lockdown parties although the former prime minister had vehemently denied doing so. Sunak dodged questions over whether he agreed with the findings.\n\nJohnson was succeeded by Truss who, along with her then-Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng, instigated a market meltdown by announcing a radical tax-cutting budget that roiled bond markets and sank the pound.\n\nOne British tabloid newspaper ran a livestream of an iceberg lettuce next to a framed photograph of Truss, asking which one would have a longer shelf life. The lettuce won when Truss reluctantly resigned after only 50 tumultuous days in office.\n\nCurtice said voters had not forgotten Partygate or Truss' disastrous and short-lived premiership, and these were likely to be significant, influential factors when voters go to the polls Thursday.\n\n\"Basically, the electorate are voting against this government because they think they screwed up and they regard the Labour Party not necessarily with enthusiasm, but as 'oh my gosh, surely they can't do any worse.' At least [Keir] Starmer sounds vaguely sensible and very boring. So they're going to vote for him.\"\n\nBoth Sunak and Labour Party leader Starmer have been reluctant to point to the polls too much during their election campaigns - the former not wanting to highlight Labour's consistent lead, the latter not wanting to appear arrogant or create voter complacency . Labour is projected to secure a 20-point lead on the Conservatives, giving the center-left party around 40% of the vote to the Tories' 20%, according to a Sky News poll tracker.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Prominent conservatives call for delay to GOP leadership elections\n\nMore than 60 prominent conservatives, including former Trump White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and activist Ginni Thomas, are calling on House and Senate GOP leadership elections to be delayed until after the Dec. 6 Georgia Senate runoff.\n\nThe open letter to GOP lawmakers released Monday comes just a day before House Republicans are set to hold their closed-door election to pick their leaders for the new Congress. Senate Republicans plan to hold their own internal elections on Wednesday.\n\nRepublicans have been trading blame with each other for their lackluster midterms performance , where Democrats held onto control of the Senate and staved off big losses in the House in a year many Republicans were predicting a \"red wave.\"\n\nRead more on NBC News\n\nBut so far, both Senate and House GOP leaders - Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Kevin McCarthy of California - are pressing forward with elections this week.\n\n\"The Republican Party needs leaders who will confidently and skillfully present a persuasive coherent vision of who we are, what we stand for, and what we will do. Many current elections are still undecided. There should be no rushed leadership elections,\" the conservative group wrote in their letter.\n\n\"Conservative Members of the House and Senate have called for the leadership elections to be delayed. We strongly urge both Houses of Congress to postpone the formal Leadership elections until after the December 6 runoff in Georgia and all election results are fully decided.\"\n\nAmong those who signed the letter were David McIntosh, president of the Club for Growth; former Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., chair of the Conservative Partnership Institute; David N. Bossie, president of Citizens United; Trump's former White House budget director, Russ Vought, president of the Center for Renewing America; Ginni Thomas, president of Liberty Consulting and the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas; Matt Schlapp, chairman of CPAC; Adam Brandon, president of FreedomWorks; Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation; and former conservative Reps. Steve King of Iowa and Tim Huelskamp of Kansas.\n\nSo far, no one has formally stepped forward to challenge either McConnell or McCarthy, but that could soon change.\n\nRep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., a former chairman of the far-right, Trump-aligned House Freedom Caucus, has been flirting with challenging McCarthy for speaker. And Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., the chairman of the Senate GOP's campaign arm this cycle, isn't closing the door on a potential challenge to McConnell for minority leader.\n\n\"A lot of people have called me to see if I would run,\" Scott said on Fox News on Sunday, adding, \"I'm not going to take anything off the table.\"\n\nBoth McCarthy and McConnell have a political incentive to move quickly to hold internal elections. With conservative discontent brewing, any lengthy delay could create an opening for a possible challenger to build up support.\n\nBut not all Freedom Caucus members would line up behind Biggs if he takes on McCarthy. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a staunch Trump ally who has clashed with McCarthy, said a conservative challenge to McCarthy would be a very risky\" and \"bad strategy\" and claimed it could lead to a situation where Democrats cut a deal with a handful of anti-Trump Republicans to elect Rep. Liz Cheney as speaker.\n\n\"Do we want to see that challenge open the door to Nancy Pelosi handing the gavel to Liz Cheney? Is that what everybody really wants? Because I will not do it. There is no way in hell I will stand there and allow that to happen,\" Greene said on Steve Bannon's podcast \"War Room.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

Some accounts said the number of those affected was far higher.\n\nThe accounts were all still active Friday, but without access to monetization features; some of them said they worried about their ability to keep posting.\n\nSome conservatives said they considered X's actions to be a betrayal by Musk, who purchased the service then known as Twitter in 2022 in part because he said it had unfairly limited conservative speech . Musk has since called himself a free-expression advocate, even as he calls for jailing some of his critics .\n\nMusk and X did not respond to requests for comment on Friday. But on Thursday night, about an hour before some conservatives started complaining about losing access to X's premium features, Musk posted what he called \"a reminder\" on X. He wrote that the site's algorithm automatically reduces the reach of a user if they're frequently blocked or muted by other, credible users.\n\n\"If far more credible, verified subscriber accounts (not bots) mute/block your account compared to those who like your posts, your reach will decline significantly,\" Musk posted .\n\nBut rather than satisfying people complaining about censorship, the post elicited even more accusations that Musk was shadowbanning his conservative critics, or reducing engagement on their posts without officially disclosing such actions to affected accounts.\n\nThe actions by X came in the middle of a heated online debate on the subject of future immigration policy under President-elect Donald Trump, with anti-immigration MAGA loyalists denouncing the influence of pro-immigration tech executives and investors such as Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nMany of the affected accounts said they were affiliated with one media brand in particular, ConservativeOG.\n\nMore from NBC News:\n\nPreston Parra, a 23-year-old influencer and head of ConservativeOG, said he considered the actions by X to be a \"political takedown\" in retaliation for publicly disagreeing with Musk's pro-immigration views.\n\nHe said he plans to keep fighting Musk, not only to get his premium features restored but also to ensure that Trump pursues restrictionist immigration policies.\n\n\"If anyone thinks for one minute the REAL backbone of the right wing and MAGA is gonna stand idly by while these big tech gillionaire Silicon Valley dweebs who didn't get bullied enough in high school, steal our country, they're mistaken,\" Parra said in a text message. He said he believes Musk to be a \"Trojan horse\" in the Trump camp.\n\nTrump announced that Musk and Ramaswamy would lead a new \"Department of Government Efficiency,\" to much fanfare, shortly after the Nov. 5 election. But in recent days, after venture capitalist Sriram Krishnan was announced as a White House adviser on AI policy, Trump's tech-world allies - including Musk and Ramaswamy - have come under deeper scrutiny and criticism from the far-right for their previous statements about or involvement with legal immigration.\n\nMusk is an immigrant, having been born and raised in South Africa. He became a U.S. citizen in 2002.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Germany's conservatives declare victory in Berlin. Now the hard work begins\n\nThe conservative alliance made up by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU) is set to lead Germany again following the federal election on Sunday, bringing an end to a period of political instability that has dogged Berlin for months.\n\nThe center-right CDU-CSU won 28.6% of votes, with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) coming in second place with 20.8%, while the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) came in third with 16.4% of the vote, according to preliminary results from the Federal Returning Officer.\n\nThe results, which will be confirmed later on Monday, mean the CDU-CSU's candidate Friedrich Merz will likely be installed as Germany's next chancellor, taking over from the SPD's Olaf Scholz after his three-party coalition collapsed late last year.\n\n\"We have won it because the CDU and CSU worked well together and we prepared very, very well for this election and also for taking over governing responsibility,\" Merz said on Sunday as exit polls emerged, signaling the alliance's victory.\n\nThe win for the Christian alliance brings an end to a period of uncertainty in Europe's largest economy, although there could now be weeks of political horse-trading as a coalition government is formed.\n\nThe most likely outcome is for the CDU-CSU to form a two-party coalition with the SPD, a tried and tested coalition formula in Germany, although a three-party coalition made up of the CDU-CSU, SPD and Greens is also a possibility.\n\nMerz had already ruled out forming any governing alliance with the anti-immigration, populist AfD party, which saw its best election result ever on Sunday.\n\nMerz \"clearly has a mandate to form a new government,\" David McAllister, CDU politician and member of the European Parliament, told CNBC Monday.\n\n\"He will be a very good chancellor because I know him for many years, we can absolutely trust this man and hopefully he can bring confidence back, he can restore confidence in Germany, that is his main task and I wish him all the best for that.\"\n\nEuropean markets have had a somewhat muted reaction to the election result although Germany's DAX stock market index opened around 0.4% higher on Monday.\n\nBut despite this respite, the new German government has a lot to contend with.\n\nPolitical division in Berlin has been seen as an undesirable distraction by investors who warn that Germany must overcome a series of challenges. These include an economic malaise that has gripped the country in recent years, with its car-and-export-orientated economy looking vulnerable, as well as a thorny debate over immigration and integration that has seen the likes of the AfD rise in prominence and popularity.\n\nGermany's wider role in European geopolitics is also a matter for debate, particularly given the ongoing war in Ukraine, and as U.S. President Donald Trump and his trade tariffs threat pose another potential headwind.\n\nEconomists are considering what a CDU-CSU-led government means for Germany's economy and fiscal reform after lengthy debate and division over Germany's \"debt brake ,\" a fiscal policy that's enshrined in Germany's constitution, limiting how much debt the government can take on.\n\nStrategists at Deutsche Bank noted that while the election result \"may reduce the risks of particularly fractious coalition talks, it still confirms an ongoing anti-establishment trend that has been visible both in Germany and Europe as a whole.\"\n\n\"The result marks the lowest ever vote share for the two major parties, even as the turnout (82.5%) was the highest since at least 1990. And it leaves the centrist parties short of a 2/3rds constitutional majority, with the CDU/CSU, SPD and Greens jointly at just under 66% of seats. That means any debt brake reform, including for defence spending, would require support from one of the fringe parties. This may not be impossible, but it would require significant political compromises,\" they wrote in a note.\n\nThe fiscal policy has proved to be a persistent political bugbear for Berlin, with arguments between parties over the extent to which the debt brake ensures responsible spending, or limits growth and investment.\n\nBoth arguments could be moot points for an economy that has been flirting with recession for months .\n\n\"The less bad news first: Germany will get a new government that can put an end to a long period of debilitating political uncertainty once it has agreed on its agenda,\" Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, said in a note Monday.\n\n\"We expect a two-party coalition between the CDU/CSU and the centre-left SPD to enact some pro-growth supply-side reforms, ease the regulatory and tax burden on businesses somewhat, and pursue a more rational immigration and a less inefficient and costly energy policy,\" Schmieding noted. He questioned, however, the extent to which populist parties such as the AfD and The Left (Die Linke) could combine and block changes to the German constitution, such as loosening the debt brake rule.\n\nOther economists noted that The Left (Die Linke) has signaled that it's actually in favor of reforming the debt brake rule and will not stand in the way of such a move.\n\n\"Although the AfD and The Left together appear to have the number of seats required to form a blocking minority for constitutional amendments and reforms, which require a two-thirds majority in parliament, we note that The Left is in favour of reforming the debt-brake rule,\" economists in Barclays Cross-Asset Reserach team said in a note Monday.\n\n\"Therefore, although still at risk, we think that it is more likely than not that a new coalition government will reform it and modestly ease fiscal policy,\" they noted in emailed comments.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Trump just took a shot at Bank of America. Here's what he's talking about\n\nIn this article\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Thursday accused the CEOs of the two largest American banks of refusing to serve conservatives, reviving a 2024 campaign talking point that the two companies deny.\n\nSpeaking via video to an assembly held at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump lashed out at Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon as part of a Q-and-A session.\n\n\"I hope you start opening your bank to conservatives because many conservatives complain that the banks are not allowing them to do business within the bank, and that included a place called Bank of America,\" Trump said.\n\n\"You and Jamie and everybody, I hope you're going to open your banks to conservatives because what you're doing is wrong,\" Trump said.\n\nMoynihan, who was among a few executives selected to ask the president questions during the Q-and-A, did not immediately respond to the accusation.\n\nBoth banks deny refusing service to conservatives.\n\n\"We serve more than 70 million clients, we welcome conservatives and have no political litmus test,\" a Bank of America official said in an email.\n\n\"We have never and would never close an account for political reasons, full stop,\" a JPMorgan spokeswoman said in a statement. \"We follow the law and guidance from our regulators and have long said there are problems with the current framework Washington must address.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, caused in part by shoddy lending standards at major banks, U.S. regulators increased pressure on lenders to purge clients in industries considered higher risk for money laundering or fraud. That meant that payday lenders, pawn shops, firearms dealers and those involved in pornography had their accounts revoked, often with little notice or explanation as to why.\n\nAs recently as October, Trump singled out Bank of America, repeating claims that it discriminates against conservatives.\n\nThe accusations may have roots in allegations from state attorneys general last year. In April, Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach sent a letter to Moynihan, accusing the bank of canceling the accounts of \"multiple religious groups with mainstream views in the last three years.\"\n\nIn a May letter in response to Kobach, Bank of America said accounts are de-banked for reasons including a change of stated purpose, the expected level or type of activity on the account or failure to verify certain documents required by law.\n\nOne account highlighted by Kobach was de-banked because it engaged in debt collection services, according to the bank's response.\n\n\"We would like to provide clarity around a very straightforward matter: Religious beliefs or political view-based beliefs are never a factor in any decisions related to our client's accounts,\" the bank said in that letter. \"Bank of America provides banking services to non-profit organizations affiliated with faith-based communities throughout the United States. We have banking and investing relationships with approximately 120,000 faith-based clients.\"\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Bank of America said it would engage with the Trump administration on the regulations that sometimes result in de-banking.\n\nInfluential people in Trump's orbit have continued to claim that banks are discriminating based on religion or politics.\n\nIn November, Marc Andreessen, co-founder of the venture capital firm that bears his name, told podcaster Joe Rogan that dozens of startup founders had been de-banked in recent years. Andreessen has said he advises Trump on technology matters.\n\nBank of America shares were up more than 1% on Thursday, with JPMorgan shares higher as well.\n\nThe banking industry is seen as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the election of Trump, in large part because of expectations he would kill Biden-era regulatory efforts to force banks to hold tens of billions of dollars in additional capital against losses, make annual stress tests less opaque and drop efforts to cap credit card and overdraft limitations.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "UK's Conservatives name Kemi Badenoch as new leader, shifting the party further to the right\n\nLONDON - The U.K.'s opposition Conservative Party on Saturday named right-wing Kemi Badenoch as its new leader, closing a long-drawn-out runoff after the Tories' landslide electoral defeat ushered in a moment of reckoning for the party.\n\nBadenoch ousted Robert Jenrick to secure the top job, replacing outgoing leader and former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.\n\n\"It is the most enormous honor to be elected to this role,\" Badenoch said, giving her maiden speech as party leader shortly after the results were announced.\n\nThe decision follows a three-month contest, during which an initial shortlist of six candidates whittled down to two through four rounds of voting by Tory Members of Parliament (MP).\n\nThe ultimate winner was decided by Conservative Party members, with Badenoch receiving 53,806 votes to Jenrick's 41,388. Voter turnout was 72.8%.\n\nBadenoch's victory confirms a further shift to the right for the U.K.'s oldest political party, suggesting it may take a more hardline approach toward immigration, climate measures and culture politics in opposition.\n\nBadenoch and fellow right-wing candidate Jenrick were seen as unlikely opponents in the final vote, with some MPs suggesting that tactical voting intended to hurt their least favorite figure had instead backfired on former frontrunner and more centrist contender James Cleverly.\n\nThe Conservatives suffered a bruising defeat in the U.K.'s July 4 general election, when Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour government secured a landslide victory as voters grew weary of ongoing leadership changes and political infighting at the tail end of 14 years of Tory rule.\n\nBadenoch said the Conservatives had to acknowledge their previous errors and change course.\n\n\"Our party is critical to the success of our country. But to be heard, we have to be honest. Honest about the fact that we made mistakes, honest about the fact that we left standards slip,\" she stressed on Saturday.\n\n\"The time has come to tell the truth, to stand up for our principles, to plan for our future. To reset our politics and our thinking, and to give our party and our country the new start that they deserve. It is time to get down to business. It is time to renew,\" Badenoch added.\n\nBritish-born Badenoch was raised in Nigeria and worked in IT and banking before entering the U.K. political sphere, gaining election as an MP in 2017. She has served in ministerial roles under three prime ministers, including business minister.\n\nA staunch proponent of Brexit, 44-year-old Badenoch is known for her outspoken views and tough stance on divisive issues such as immigration and rights for transgender people, including in her role as minister for women and equalities.\n\nDuring the leadership race - her second in two years, after placing fourth in a 2022 runoff - Badenoch vowed to reset the Conservative Party, arguing it had become too much like Labour and proposing softer state intervention and a greater focus on families.\n\nHer strong political views have courted controversy over the years, however, with recent comments about maternity pay having \"gone too far\" sparking a backlash, while her suggestion that \"not all cultures are equally valid\" reinforced her image as a so-called culture warrior.\n\nBadenoch's opponent Jenrick was once a close ally of Sunak, who began his political career as a centrist figure. He has since aligned himself with the right within the party, making regaining control of the U.K.'s borders a central tenet of his leadership pitch.\n\nThe 42-year-ol former lawyer resigned from his role as immigration minister in December 2023, insisting that Sunak's Rwanda legislation did not go far enough. He further vowed to withdraw Britain from the European Convention of Human Rights to boost deportations and has taken increasingly hard-line - and at times controversial - stances.\n\nThe leadership win is unlikely to have any immediate impact on the current government, with Labour holding its second-largest parliamentary majority in history.\n\nIt is also possible that the Tories' new leader will no longer be in place by the time the U.K. votes for its next government in up to five years.\n\nSunak said Badenoch would be a \"superb leader\" and urged his party to unite behind her.\n\n\"She will renew our party, stand up for Conservative values, and take the fight to Labour,\" he wrote in a post on social media.\n\nA reinvigorated opposition party will be better placed to apply pressure on Starmer - who described the election of the first Black leader of a Westminster party as a \"proud moment\" for the country - and rebuke some of his key policies.\n\n\"Our first responsibility as his majesty's loyal government is to hold this Labour government to account. Our second is not less important: it is to prepare over the course of the next few years for government,\" Badenoch said Saturday.\n\nThe return of Brexiteer Nigel Farage to the political fray in June, along with surprise electoral gains for his Reform UK Party, could see the Conservatives shift further right in order to stem further electoral losses.\n\nSome analysts have suggested that the newly reformed Tory party could even partner with Reform's Farage to bolster support - a suggestion to which Farage has said \"never say never.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

Investors' focus is now on how quickly Merz's party can form a coalition government to bring about much-needed change to a frail economy.\n\n\"The fragmentation of Germany's political landscape will make the upcoming coalition negotiations very complicated,\" said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro for ING Research.\n\n\"The risk is high that after tonight, the longing for a significant overhaul of the German economy will last much longer. It is hard to see that the next government will be able to deliver much more for the economy than a short-lived positive impact from some tax cuts, small reforms and a bit more investment.\"\n\nIn the broader market, the dollar fell ahead of a busy week packed with U.S. economic data and speeches from various Federal Reserve officials.\n\nTrading was thin on Monday with Japanese markets closed for a public holiday.\n\nAgainst the dollar, sterling hovered near a two-month high at $1.2659, while the Aussie rose 0.17% to $0.6370.\n\nThe New Zealand dollar similarly gained 0.16% to $0.5751. The dollar index fell 0.2% to 106.34.\n\nThe greenback has slid more than 3% from its January peak as traders reasoned the start of Donald Trump's second term has been mostly bluster on tariffs, leaving little appetite for them to load up on fresh dollar holdings.\n\nAlso adding to headwinds for the dollar were falling U.S. Treasury yields on heightened bets of more Fed cuts this year, amid growing concerns over the outlook for the world's largest economy.\n\nData on Friday showed U.S. business activity nearly stalled in February - the latest in a string of surveys to suggest that businesses and consumers were becoming increasingly rattled by the Trump administration's policies.\n\nLater this week, investors will get the second estimate of fourth quarter growth figures in the U.S. and January's core PCE price index data.\n\n\"It's a week where the market could feasibly respond to any economic data point,\" said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone.\n\n\"With U.S. growth concerns building traction, the market's reaction function is now heavily skewed to any downside in the data outcomes.\"\n\nThe drop in Treasury yields, particularly in real terms, has weighed on the dollar against the yen as Japanese yields rise on speculation of another rate hike from the Bank of Japan.\n\nThe yen rose to its strongest level in more than two months on Monday at 148.85 per dollar.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Austrian conservatives pick interim leader after chancellor quits\n\nAustria's ruling conservatives picked Secretary-General Christian Stocker as interim successor to Chancellor Karl Nehammer, Austrian media reported on Sunday, after Nehammer quit as his attempts to form a coalition government without the far right fell apart.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the People's Party (OVP), and Nehammer only told reporters after the party's crisis leadership meeting on Sunday that \"important and correct decisions\" had been taken.\n\nThe surprise collapse of three- and then two-party talks aimed at cobbling together a centrist coalition that could serve as a bulwark against the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) after the FPO came first in September's parliamentary election leaves President Alexander Van der Bellen with few options.\n\nA snap election with support for the eurosceptic, Russia-friendly FPO still growing or an about-face in which Van der Bellen tasks FPO leader Herbert Kickl with forming a government are now the most likely options, with only limited scope for alternatives or playing for time.\n\n\"It is not an easy situation,\" Markus Wallner, the governor of Vorarlberg, the westernmost of Austria's nine provinces, told reporters before the OVP leadership meeting at the chancellor's office on Sunday morning.\n\n\"I believe we must do everything we can now to avoid sliding towards a national crisis.\"\n\nWallner said he opposed a snap election since that would delay the arrival of a new government by months. OVP governors are part of the leadership.\n\nA spokesperson for Van der Bellen said he was due to address the nation at 2:45 p.m. (1345 GMT). Nehammer crossed the road separating their offices earlier to report to Van der Bellen on the OVP leadership meeting.\n\nNehammer insisted during and after the election campaign that his party would not govern with Kickl because he was too much of a conspiracy theorist and posed a security risk while at the same time saying much of Kickl's party was trustworthy.\n\nNehammer's successor will most likely be more open to a coalition with the FPO, which is formally allied with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz party.\n\nThe FPO won September's election with around 29% of the vote, and opinion polls suggest its support has only grown since then, extending its lead over the OVP and Social Democrats to more than 10 percentage points while their support has shrunk.\n\nThe OVP and FPO overlap on various issues, particularly taking a tough line on immigration, to the point that the FPO has accused the OVP of stealing its ideas.\n\nThe two governed together from late 2017 until 2019, when a video-sting scandal involving the then-leader of the FPO prompted their coalition's collapse. At the state level, they govern together in five of nine states, including in OVP moderate Wallner's Vorarlberg.\n\nThe national dynamic is now different because if they were to form an alliance the OVP would for the first time be junior partner to the FPO, making the position of OVP leader difficult and undesirable to many.\n\nAfter initial media reports that household names like former party leader Sebastian Kurz, who led the last coalition with the FPO and has since been convicted of perjury, could become OVP leader, Austrian media reported overnight that they were no longer in the running.\n\nThat left lesser-known figures such as new Chamber of Commerce Secretary-General Wolfgang Hattmannsdorfer, 45.\n\nMeanwhile, the FPO hammered home its message.\n\n\"Austria needs a Chancellor Kickl now,\" it said on X.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Big tech was a major target at CPAC, but conservatives building alternatives are facing challenges\n\nBig tech was in the crosshairs once again at one of the biggest annual gatherings of conservative politicians and personalities.\n\nIn speeches at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), elected officials, including Sens. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., and Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., targeted big tech and the legal immunity companies enjoy under Section 230, which is currently being considered by the Supreme Court .\n\nRep. Lauren Boebert, R-Co., said in her speech Saturday: \"I have called for 230 protections to be removed from these big tech companies who are hiding behind section 230, and they are acting like editors rather than publishers.\"\n\nBut unlike last year's conference, speakers shied away from boosting a grand utopian vision of a conservative \" parallel economy \" shielded from the power of progressive values.\n\nMore from NBC News: CPAC becomes a tale of who's showing up - and who's not Trump trolls Ron DeSantis in CPAC speech Kellyanne and George Conway announce divorce\n\nInstead, business leaders and elected officials shared a more weathered perspective, criticizing the failed promises of technologies like cryptocurrency, which many conservatives embraced last year. They also acknowledged the uneven odds of competing with tech behemoths and the difficulties of turning startups into companies that can eventually scale and thrive independent of politically motivated investors.\n\nDevin Nunes, CEO of former President Donald Trump's Truth Social , spoke openly on stage Friday about the difficulties facing his and other companies in the conservative \"parallel economy.\n\n\"The key was, could we build something that big tech couldn't tear down and couldn't stop?\" he said. \"I will tell you there are real headwinds that we are learning, and I think this is where Congress needs to look.\"\n\nAt last year's CPAC, Truth Social and conservative Twitter-clone Gettr were front and center, with conservatives riding high on the idea of creating an alternative world in tech where conservatives could avoid what they saw as censorship and speak freely about their beliefs and values.\n\nSince then, crypto markets have crashed, Elon Musk took over Twitter, and Meta decided Trump could be allowed back on its platforms, leaving the viability of a parallel digital economy for most conservatives in question.\n\nBut not all Big Tech was a target. Speakers repeatedly praised Musk's Twitter and specifically the \"Twitter Files\" project , in which Musk released internal records about Twitter's old regime through several journalists and pundits in an attempt to illustrate political censorship at the company.\n\nLibsofTikTok creator Chaya Raichik criticized how big tech has treated her accounts while also boasting about her follower count on those platforms and promoting her book sold on Amazon.\n\nOutside of Nunes' appearance, Truth Social didn't appear to have a notable presence at the conference, and Trump didn't mention the platform in his keynote speech. Gettr, whose CEO Jason Miller recently departed the company to work with Trump on his presidential campaign, also did not have a notable presence at the conference.\n\nTech founders at the conference told NBC News that they believe some companies that were part of the \"parallel economy\" movement got ahead of themselves in their aspirations.\n\nJohn McEntee, the founder and CEO of conservative dating app The Right Stuff and a former Trump administration official, said he thought some people who founded companies aiming to replace existing tech companies might not have understood the difficulties going in.\n\n\"I think a lot of people here had that sort of like, 'oh, we can do that' without realizing how hard tech stuff actually is and how much a user is expecting,\" he said. \"They don't understand how difficult that is, you know, you want to change one thing and then all these things on the back end have to change.\"\n\nMcEntee said his own company is growing its userbase of 30,000 users, and is on a road to financial sustainability with its premium membership product, but described the challenge of converting users who are already saturated with various offerings in the tech space.\n\n\"It's very hard to get them to make a new profile when they already are on three other ones,\" he said.\n\nMcEntee said the company's seed round of funding led by conservative tech mogul Peter Thiel can at least last them until summer of this year, but that they'll need to begin looking for another round of funding soon.\n\nAndrew Riddaugh, who also worked in the Trump White House and is now CEO of Liberation Technology Services , which offers independent web hosting and development services, said that he thinks that the conservative companies that are finding success are the ones who are actually innovating in the tech space rather than just providing an alternative.\n\n\"When you look back, those that worked on innovation and new user experience, or new products and tools, those are the ones that you still see around,\" he said. \"If you don't have something that makes you unique, users are going to default to what people already know and use.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "What I've Learned From Conservatives Who Are Addressing The Challenge Of Climate Change\n\nBy Robert G. Eccles\n\nBy Robert G. Eccles ,\n\nContributor.\n\nI live in the charming and historical New England town of Concord, MA., home of Walden Pond, made famous by Henry David Thoreau. A few weeks ago I drove by Walden Pond on my way to have lunch with a liberal (easy to find them in my home state!) friend who is doing important work in addressing climate change. Towards the end of the lunch (her treat so my turn next time) she said, \"Bob, you may already know this, but people are talking. They know you're hanging out with Republicans and wonder if you're still concerned about climate change.\"\n\nAutumn Trees at Walden Pond\n\nYes, I'm still concerned about climate change. Very concerned. So are a number of conservatives. One of the many benefits of my \"GOP Outreach Campaign\" with my Republican lawyer friends Dan Crowley and Tim Doyle and Libertarian 😱 friend Eli Lehrer, co-founder and President of the center-right think tank The R Street Institute (\"Free Markets. Real Solutions.\"), is that I have met a number of conservatives who are very concerned about climate change as well.\n\nWhile liberals may think that all conservatives are climate change deniers (and the MAGA crowd provides some glaring support for this view), this is simply not true. Take for example, the Conservative Climate Caucus , whose founder and Chair is Rep. John Curtis (R-UT) with Vice Chair Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-IA). It has 81 members including 11 from Texas and six from Florida. The homepage of its website states:\n\n\"What We Believe\n\nConcept illustration Global warming around the world is about to be burned by human hands (3D image)\n\nAnother example is my friend Greg Goff who had a distinguished career at ConocoPhillips before becoming the CEO at Andeavor. In 2018 he was named by the Harvard Business Review as one of the top performing CEOs in the world. He is now a board member at ExxonMobil, placed there as a result of the Engine No. 1 campaign. Last December I did an interview with him and asked what his sense of urgency was regarding climate change. His reply: \"My view is that this is the biggest challenge of my lifetime. In addition to having a sense of urgency, it is important there is a very well-developed framework to drive change as we decarbonize.\" Since then Greg and I have kept in touch. I learn something about how to address climate change every time I talk to him.\n\nOn the investor side, I've also learned a lot from my friend and collaborator John Skjervem (another Libertarian 😉), the CIO of Utah Retirement Systems which has $54 billion in AUM. John and I first crossed paths many years ago when I was the Chairman of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). John has been a strong supporter of SASB, now part of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), to this day. We were re-introduced to each other by my good friend Allison Binns who chaired a panel on ESG at a conference where John was a vocal critic (for some solid reasons and not the crazy right wing stuff I've written so much about). John and I then wrote a piece together titled \" Climate Change, Misguided Activism, and a Roadmap for Institutional Investors .\" I also did a fireside chat with him at a top1000funds conference held at Oxford in November.\n\nThe next week John did a keynote interview with Responsible Investor editor Lucy Fitzgeorge-Parker at their Responsible Investor USA 2023 conference. Yeah, I could see a few eyes rolling in this nearly all-liberal audience (Dan, Tim, and Eli were also speakers so not 100% 🐥.) But I could also see a lot of people smiling and nodding in quiet agreement as John challenged some of the liberal orthodoxy about how to deal with climate change. A few people came up to me in private to thank me for John's participation since he expressed some views they agreed with but didn't dare say in front of their liberal peers.\n\nThink Tank concept. Dice form the expression \"think tank\".\n\nThere are also non-profit center-right think tanks doing important work. One example is ClearPath whose mission is \"to develop and advance policies that accelerate innovations to reduce and remove global energy emissions. To advance that mission, we develop cutting-edge policy solutions on clean energy and industrial innovation. \" In a short video CEO Rich Powell explains the importance of getting public policies right in the U.S. Their policy work is focused on \"small government, free market reforms that make an impact\" and is organized in terms of the three pillars of clean energy, clean industrial, and carbon removal. ClearPath also has a Tech 101 series which \"is designed to assist even the busiest layperson in gaining an elementary grasp of the byzantine world of conservative clean energy.\" I had a fascinating lunch with him when I was in D.C. in October. Among other things, I learned a lot about the critical role of \"moonshot technologies,\" something John also talks about.\n\nR Street has an Energy and Environment team, led by Devin Hartman, which \"seeks a cleaner environment through a combination of a thriving economy, well-founded science, and principles of market competition and limited government.\" One of the team's members is Philip Rosetti (bagged another Libertarian 😍). He and I wrote a piece titled \" Policies Meant to Address Climate Change Can Worsen Human Suffering .\" Philip publishes a fabulous \" Low Energy Fridays \" blog which is worth signing up for. Read, for example, how Philip deconstructs the claims about subsidies for fossil fuels. Hartman's December 15, 2023 post \" Climate Change Is-and Is Not-an Existential Risk \" makes a strong case for the importance of properly framing the problem of climate change. He concludes that \"Policies should maximize the combination of future wealth and environmental quality if they are to benefit posterity. This requires mitigating climate change aggressively, but also cost-consciously. And that begins with framing climate risk accurately.\"\n\nAnother thoughtful conservative is Alex Flint of the Alliance for Market Solutions (AMS) who emphasizes that a vibrant and strong economy is critical for the United States to fuel growth and opportunity for every American and to maintain its leadership position in the world. Concerned about both fiscal and climate trends, AMS aligns with economists who point out that a carbon tax will drive emissions reductions more efficiently than regulations or subsidies, while generating revenue that can reduce other taxes or, at least, be less harmful than other tax increases needed to deal with the government's structural deficits. (I've written in support of carbon taxes but, hey, I\"m a liberal so we're always up for more taxes, right 😜?)\n\nI had a fascinating Zoom call with Alex this fall (we're looking forward to meeting in person early next year). He pointed out that while Republicans avoid talking about new taxes of any sort, \"the science and economics of climate change will eventually force the politics to change, and we are working to accelerate that.\"\n\nTwo people disagree and fail to communicate\n\nSo what have I learned about how conservatives are addressing climate change and how is it different from what liberal groups are doing? Before answering this question, I want to make four disclaimers. The first is that there are issues in which this is substantial agreement, like the importance of reducing methane emissions and good public policies-albeit with different views on what \"good\" is. There is even some conservative support for aspects of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), although liberals are much more enthusiastic about it. Second, neither conservatives or liberals are monolithic in their views. There are disagreements in both camps. For example, some conservatives, like Alex, support a carbon tax, and some don't, like 12 Republican Senators . Some liberals are strong advocates for divestment from fossil fuel companies while others emphasize the importance of engagement. Third, I'm not-and never will be-an expert on climate change. Following from these three disclaimers, the fourth one is that my comparison inevitably involves some simplification and generalization.\n\nOne of the most striking things to me when I started talking to conservatives about climate change is what they don't spend much time on. My world is filled with discussions about net-zero commitments by countries, companies, and investors; climate transition plans ; and climate reporting standards from the ISSB (to whom Dan is an advisor), the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), and the U.S. Securities and Exchange, with Scope 3 reporting being seen by many as absolutely essential. Conservatives vary in their views on the importance of such topics; some think they are mildly useful and others don't think they matter much at all.\n\nRelated to this is the role each group sees for finance and technology. Liberals see finance as the foundation for the needed energy transition (which conservatives want as well). For example, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) \"is a global coalition of leading financial institutions committed to accelerating the decarbonization of the economy.\" The coalition includes asset owners, asset managers, banks, and insurance companies, each of which has their own group under the GFANZ umbrella. To qualify for membership, the financial institution needs to have a net-zero by 2050 commitment.\n\nAs with reporting standards, conservatives spend little time thinking about such coalitions and some see them as more part of the problem than part of the solution. Given this, there's also very little talk about 1.5 oC and the Paris Agreement. It's not that conservatives don't understand what 1.5 oC or 2.0 oC or more means. They get that. But they don't use the Paris Agreement framing and don't have 1.5 oC as a part of their narrative.\n\nInstead, conservatives see technology as fundamentally essential to the energy transition. While they support renewable energy, they also focus on carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon direct removal (CDR); energy from nuclear (including small modular reactors), hydrogen, fission, and fusion (the moonshot one); and other moonshot technologies like cirrus cloud seeding and ocean iron fertilization. Liberals tend to less enthusiastic about the potential of these technologies and are focused more on renewable energy. They can even be negative about some, such as CCS, which they object to in terms of current costs, how much capacity would be needed to make a difference, and a concern that it is simply a way for fossil fuel companies to continue to do their thing.\n\nCarboniferous plants and animals of the Eastern United States circa 300 million years ago.\n\nNot surprisingly, there is a major difference in views about the role of fossil fuels. Liberals want them completely eliminated as quickly as possible-with net-zero commitments being key to this-and many see divestment and exclusion by financial institutions as key to that. Conservatives have little time for this and see a larger and more continuing role for fossil fuels, while still acknowledging the need to move to cleaner forms of energy and capturing as much of the carbon being produced as possible. Conservatives also pay more attention to the bottleneck of permitting-for transmission lines to get renewable energy into the grid, for CCS pipelines and storage, and for nuclear facilities.\n\nAlso not surprisingly, conservatives are more pro-market and pro-growth, whereas liberals place a greater emphasis on regulation. Many liberals applaud the EU's Green Deal, Taxonomy, CSRD, Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) and, not yet passed, the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), and wish the U.S. were following the EU's lead. Conservatives see these regulatory initiatives as emblematic of why European economic growth has lagged that in the U.S. for the past 15 years-the gap looks to continue to grow -and want no part of them.\n\nAnother difference is the relative emphasis on a U.S. vs. a global perspective. Conservatives emphasize America's energy security and a just transition in this country. Liberals, through initiatives like GFANZ and Climate Action 100+, emphasize the need for a global approach. They also have a more global perspective on a just transition for the Global South and their support for loss and damage payments.\n\nWhile liberals applaud how China has built a large and dynamic renewable energy, conservatives see this as a competitive threat and point out how China is accelerating its addition of new coal power capacity. They are more concerned than liberals are about the fact that China accounts for nearly 60 percent of the mined production and over 85 percent of processing capacity of the global economy's rare earths' production. Conservatives also point out that 70 percent of the world's cobalt supply (essential for batteries for EVs and storing backup power from renewables) is sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo (sic); this gets less liberal attention as well. Consequently, conservatives are more focused on the permitting necessary to obtain these resources in the U.S.\n\nOne final difference to note. While conservatives focused on climate change regard it as serious of a problem as liberals do, they are more optimistic that we will be able to address it. Melita Leousi and I have written about the five narratives of climate change: scientific, skeptical, moral, opportunity, and doomsday. Liberals load heavy on doomsday. Conservatives load heavy on opportunity.\n\nBipartisan agreement between the republican and democrat organiization as a symbol for a two party ... More system with a flag of the United States connecting two mountain cliffs shaped as an elephant and donkey.\n\nIn my call with Alex, I told him about my \"GOP Outreach Campaign\" and my desire to help create a more bipartisan conversation about climate change. I asked him about what he was doing in his work with his fellow Republicans on climate change. He explained that \"In hundreds of meetings with Republican members of Congress, we have found very little climate denialism. They see that the climate is changing. But they don't like large government solutions proposed by the left, and they know the political arms of essentially all climate organizations will campaign against them.\"\n\nYet Alex is optimistic and points to a few promising signals including the 32 Republicans and 32 Democrats in the House Climate Solutions Caucus , co-chaired by Rep. Andrew R. Garbarino (R-NY) and Rep. Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA). (Reps. John Curtis and Mariannette Miller-Meeks are members.) Flint also noted that there were three delegations from Congress at this year's COP 28, and all three delegations were deliberately bipartisan.\n\nAlso encouraging is I learned about Deploy/US , an NGO dedicated to \"Accelerating Bipartisan Climate Leadership\" whose Founder and CEO is Dr. Andrea Yodsampa. Their website notes that \"We are the only organization in the country focused on building the capacities, amplifying the voices, and scaling the impact of the entire ecosystem of civic enterprises working right-of-center on climate change, as a crucial foundation for bipartisan policy.\" Andrea lives in the next town over from me so I had the pleasure of having lunch with her last fall to learn more about their work. Based on this I'm very optimistic that DEPLOY/US is becoming the much-needed bridge between traditional climate philanthropy and the underfunded arena of conservative climate-focused nonprofits that are necessary to make bipartisan climate action possible. The mention of Deploy/US in this Vox article and in this analysis from the Founders' Pledge is recent evidence that the bridge is taking shape.\n\nIt is a much needed one. Neither liberals or conservatives can claim a monopoly on the best ideas for addressing climate change. The truly best ones must be bipartisan because they are the only ones that will be put into practice. Areas of focus here should be public policy, a carbon tax, and the appropriate roles and relationships between the financial sector and technology.\n\nSince it's New Year's Eve I will conclude with a New Year's Resolution. It is to continue to do whatever I can to foster a dialogue between conservatives and liberals who are addressing the challenge of climate change. Those who are more expert and better placed than I am should do the same."

      "text": "Conservatives Vs. Liberals-Who's More Prone To Believing Misinformation?\n\nBy Mark Travers\n\nBy Mark Travers ,\n\nContributor.\n\nNew research reveals the surprising link between political leaning and \"metacognitive inefficiency.\" ... More Here's what they found.\n\nAs the 2024 elections approach, our social media feeds are flooded with political content from all sides. Whether you lean left or right, you're likely to encounter an overwhelming mix of news, opinions and, unfortunately, misinformation. But this raises an important question: Are liberals and conservatives equally capable of distinguishing political facts from fiction?\n\nRecent research published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology sought to answer this question-by measuring Republicans' and Democrats' levels of \"metacognitive inefficiency.\"\n\nMetacognitive skills are essentially our ability to \"think about thinking.\" According to a 2021 study in Psychological Review , these skills help us use our confidence levels to judge the accuracy of our own decisions, beliefs and thoughts. In simpler terms, metacognition is the mental process that helps us evaluate how likely we are to be correct.\n\nHowever, not everyone's metacognitive skills are perfect. Sometimes, we might feel overly confident or lack confidence in our thoughts and decisions-even when our actual accuracy doesn't match that self-assurance. This mismatch is known as \"metacognitive bias,\" where our confidence either overshoots or undershoots the reality.\n\nOn the other hand, even when we're confident, that confidence might not accurately reflect how correct we are. This is called \"metacognitive sensitivity\"-when, despite sheer confidence, we still make poor decisions, lapses in judgment or believe things that are incorrect. It's about whether our confidence truly indicates whether we're making good decisions or falling into error.\n\nTogether, metacognitive bias and sensitivity make up what psychologists refer to as \"metacognitive inefficiency.\" And this ineffective \"thinking about thinking\" can crop up more often than you'd think in day to day life.\n\nSay, for instance, you're debating with a friend. You feel certain that your facts are correct, but you don't take the time to double-check your sources. If your confidence doesn't match the accuracy of your information, you're exhibiting metacognitive inefficiency. Conversely, if you're unsure but decide to fact-check and find out you were right all along, your metacognition is working effectively. This ability-or lack thereof-can significantly impact how well we navigate our decisions, our education and the flood of information that exists within the world, particularly in the political realm.\n\nMetacognitive abilities play a crucial role in our capacity to distinguish factual information from misinformation-especially in political contexts. It involves not just self-awareness about what we know, but also the ability to confidently assess whether the information aligns with reality. Given the serious threat that political misinformation poses to democracies around the world, and with elections on the horizon, it's a critical area of study that, surprisingly, has received limited attention from researchers-until now.\n\nThis gap in research prompted a team of psychologists to investigate the metacognitive abilities of liberals and conservatives. In the 2024 study published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology , researchers conducted a six-month longitudinal study-surveying over 1,000 U.S. citizens from across the political spectrum. Participants were asked to evaluate a range of widely circulated political information (both factual and misleading) to gauge their ability to discern truth from falsehood.\n\nThe study found that individuals from both the left and right were generally aware of their ability to distinguish accurate information from misinformation. However, a significant difference emerged: Republicans and conservatives demonstrated considerably lower metacognitive insight-especially when the information in question challenged their ideological beliefs-compared to Democrats and liberals.\n\nThis finding suggests that, on average, conservatives' confidence in their judgments was less likely to reflect the actual correctness of their truth assessments when the information conflicted with their political views. In contrast, liberals were somewhat better at aligning their confidence with accuracy-even when faced with information that challenged their own ideologies. This disparity in metacognitive efficiency could play a crucial role in how different political groups navigate the deluge of information leading up to the 2024 elections.\n\nThis disparity in metacognitive efficiency could have significant implications for how different political groups interact with and spread information in the lead-up to the elections-and likely already has. If conservatives are more likely to be overconfident in their beliefs, even when those beliefs are incorrect, they may be more susceptible to believing and sharing misinformation. This could contribute to a more polarized and misinformed electorate; this, in turn, could influence voting behavior and public opinion in ways that do not necessarily reflect the actual facts.\n\nAnd while liberals may be better at adjusting their confidence to match the accuracy of their beliefs, this does not make them immune to misinformation. The complexity and sheer volume of information available-combined with the emotionally charged nature of political content-can still lead to errors in judgment across the political spectrum. However, their relatively higher metacognitive efficiency might offer some resilience against misinformation, which could make them more critical consumers of political content.\n\nHowever, in a broader context, these findings epitomize the importance of metacognitive skills in a healthy democracy. The ability to critically evaluate information-most especially in our current era of widespread misinformation-is essential for informed decision-making. If certain groups are more prone to metacognitive inefficiency, it could lead to an uneven distribution of misinformation-where some segments of the population are more misinformed than others. This can create echo chambers and further entrench ideological divides-both of which make it considerably harder for populations to reach consensus on critical issues.\n\nHas political misinformation informed any of your beliefs?

      "text": "Self-Proclaimed Conservatives Want To Control Your Investments\n\nBy Norbert Michel\n\nBy Norbert Michel ,\n\nContributor.\n\nWall Street sign under water.\n\nAmericans have always had something of a love/hate relationship with finance. And although robust financial markets have always been a critical driver of Americans' prosperity, the hate portion of this relationship has typically eclipsed the love.\n\nAfter the Great Depression, progressive attacks on financial markets and the supposedly unique greed of Wall Street have been pervasive. The recent complaints of politicians such as senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) differ slightly in detail from those of the 1930s, but they're really nothing new.\n\nHowever, in the last few years many conservatives (often among the national conservatives ) have launched their own populist attacks, frequently adopting the term financialization . According to its proponents, financialization represents some kind of overreliance on financial markets, where too many resources have been diverted away from the \"real\" economy.\n\nBut as my new book (co-authored with Jennifer Schulp) demonstrates, even this latest critique is nothing new. In fact, there's virtually no difference between the attacks launched by Socialists, Democrats, or Republicans, regardless of whether they use the term financialization .\n\nThey all use the same themes, most of which go back hundreds of years.\n\nThe most well-used theme is the idea that \"speculators\" are \"nonproducers\" who contribute nothing to the \"real\" economy. They merely profit from the work of others. For America, this theme dates to the nation's founding. It was so central to the fight between the Jeffersonians and Hamiltonians that it even made it into the popular Hamilton musical .\n\nLater, many others put their own spin on it.\n\nFor example, in his famous work Capital , Karl Marx derided bond traders a \"class of lazy annuitants\" who just shuffled money around. He also made the disapproving distinction between \"productive capital\" and \"commodity capital,\" the latter being the kind he apparently liked the least.\n\nIn his 1936 tract on economics , John Maynard Keynes chastised speculators-even though he himself was one-and scornfully compared their trading to casino gambling. In the 1960s, Nobel prize winning economist James Tobin echoed Keynes's remarks, and several socialist critics begin a two-plus decade assault of their own.\n\nInterestingly, the socialists sounded very much like the present-day national conservatives, both arguing that excessive financial activity and speculation had contributed to economic stagnation. In fact, they sounded so much alike that my Cato colleagues and I recently ran a series of X polls -overall, almost half missed the mark, unable to identify whether a particular quote was from a socialist or a natcon.\n\nWorse, all these critics share a disturbing trait: they've supported their attacks on financial markets with nothing more than opinions and irrelevant statistics. They had no evidence that, for instance, wild speculation caused the Great Depression or that financialization ( whatever it is ) caused stagnation in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, or beyond.\n\nThis problem appears to have gotten worse in recent years.\n\nIn 2019, Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) released a report on the supposedly sad state of domestic business investment. The report argued \"For the first time, the nonfinancial corporate business sector now consistently spends more on acquiring financial assets than on capital development.\" Even if this statement is factually correct-the report does not provide direct evidence-it would be irrelevant. There is no inherent dollar amount that indicates firms spent too little on capital development.\n\nMore broadly, the idea that economic growth is harmful unless it comes from directly investing in capital goods, as opposed to investing in financial assets, is objectively wrong.\n\nAll investments are speculative, even investments in capital goods. And even investments that do not directly raise money for capital goods still indirectly contribute to capital development. A vibrant secondary market indirectly helps people raise capital for their companies because it makes it easier to raise capital in primary markets. (It helps when primary investors know they can sell shares on the secondary market.)\n\nObviously, some financial investments will have less influence than others on developing capital goods and wealth in the broader economy, but the same can be said for direct investments in capital goods. Regardless, that's hardly sufficient reason to prohibit people from undertaking certain types of investments.\n\nAnd it would be harmful to do so.\n\nFor starters, this kind of policy would make it more difficult for people to diversify their investments, thereby increasing risk. Ultimately, it would make it more difficult to raise money in primary markets and make it more difficult for people to build wealth.\n\nWorse, implementing this kind of policy would require giving someone the legal authority to prevent people from lawfully undertaking certain types of investments. It would explicitly empower a small group of people-members of Congress or federal regulators, presumably-to make investment decisions for everyone else.\n\nGovernment officials would decide, for instance, which investments are \"too speculative\" or might not produce \"enough\" value. Their subjective views, not the views of people putting their own money up, would determine what investments people can make.\n\nMany modern critics of finance want this outcome, and they justify extreme levels of government control in the name of safety and stability. History has already shown, however, that this kind of restrictive legal/regulatory framework only makes financial markets more fragile. (No, financial markets were not deregulated prior to the 2008 financial crisis.)\n\nStill, many of the natcons do a great job of sounding reasonable when they propose this kind of restrictive policy.\n\nThey focus, for example, on the fact that secondary market trades are not investments in real capital goods. But then they make this innocuous fact seem dastardly with language like \"what we often call investment ... is merely the trading of assets for profit and power.\" No matter how devious they make it sound, this fact doesn't justify what they're proposing.\n\nWhile the natcons insist they love free enterprise and freedom, and they only want to make sure markets work for the typical American, their policy prescriptions undercut pretty much every basic aspect of freedom and free enterprise. They can spin it however they like, but they want to turn Americans' economic decision making over to a group of bureaucrats.\n\nWhat the natcons want for financial markets would be great for the people in power, but not so hot for everyone else. Hopefully Americans start noticing."

More illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images)\n\nThe study, led by two researchers from the University of Texas and New York University, had hundreds of thousands of participants and analyzed mass amounts of Facebook user data.\n\nOne of the study's papers, which used aggregated data for 208 million U.S. Facebook users, found that most misinformation on Facebook existed within conservative echo chambers, which did not have an equivalent on the liberal side of the platform.\n\nThe paper found that news outlets on the right post a higher fraction of news stories rated false by Meta's third-party fact-checking program, meaning conservative audiences are more exposed to unreliable news.\n\nIn a separate paper that assigned users to Facebook and Instagram feeds chronologically instead of algorithm-based feeds, which are the platforms' default feed types, researchers found users on chronological feeds were less engaged and saw more political content compared to those viewing algorithm-based feeds, along with more content from untrustworthy sources and more content from ideologically moderate friends and sources with mixed audiences.\n\nHowever, the feed analysis noted replacing algorithmic feeds with chronological ones did not create any detectable changes in political attitudes, knowledge or offline behavior.\n\nAnother paper assigned nearly 9,000 U.S.-based Facebook users feeds with no reshares, later concluding that the removal of reshared content \"substantially\" lessened the amount of political news, and content from all untrustworthy sources decreased overall.\n\nThe two lead researchers and 15 other academics, who had control rights for the study's papers, declined compensation from Meta to ensure an ethical study was completed.\n\n2.8 billion. That's the number of monthly active users Facebook had as of December 2020. The social media platform surpassed 3 billion active users Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S. 2020 Facebook and Instagram Election Study , the project responsible for the papers, is also conducting studies on whether Facebook promotes ideological division, whether campaign advertising on social media influences attitudes and behaviors, and more.\n\nFacebook played a significant role in the misinformation and discourse that swirled around the 2016 and 2020 presidential election. In 2016, Facebook was harshly criticized for its failure to handle misinformation on its site, which became profitable for fake news peddlers to push on the advertisement-powered platform. Political data analysis firm Cambridge Analytica, which worked on former President Donald Trump's campaign, was accused of secretly using data on millions of Facebook users for voter profiling and targeting. It wasn't until last year that Meta agreed to pay $725 million to settle a privacy lawsuit over its connections with Cambridge Analytica. The issue of misinformation on Facebook was one of the main points addressed in Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's 2018 congressional testimony, in which the billionaire admitted to his platform's failures in combating fake news. \"It's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm,\" Zuckerberg told members of Congress . \"That goes for fake news, foreign interference in elections, and hate speech, as well as developers and data privacy.\" Years later, the problem of rampant misinformation on Facebook persisted. A 2021 study from researchers at New York University and the Université Grenoble Alpes in France revealed that news publishers spreading misinformation received six times more likes, shares and interactions on Facebook than trustworthy publishers from August 2020 to January 2021. Following the election, Facebook changed its algorithm to lessen the amount of political content in users' feeds, something that if done earlier, could have prevented billions of views on the 100 most popular pages that continuously published misinformation on the site leading up to the election, according to a study from online activist group Avaaz. Specifically, far-right misinformation thrived on the platform, with far-right misinformation sources nearly doubling non-misinformation sources in interactions.\n\nMeta Earnings: Stock Rallies As Facebook Parent Notches Most Profitable Quarter Since 2021 (Forbes)\n\nThreads Won't Promote Political Or Hard News Content - A Contrast From Twitter (Forbes)"

(Photo by ... More PATRICK MCMULLAN /Patrick McMullan via Getty Images)\n\nOmeed Malik founded 1789 Capital this year to invest in non-\"woke\" companies that support the \" parallel economy \"-which Malik has also called the \"patriot economy\"-a topic that has increasingly become the focus of conservative pundits and consumers as they have boycotted companies like Bud Light and Target over their outreach to the LGBTQ community.\n\nThe conservative investment firm - named for the year the Bill of Rights was written - is investing $15 million in Tucker Carlson's new media company Last Country, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday.\n\nHelping fuel the so-called parallel economy is PublicSq., a rapidly growing online marketplace for companies that promote conservative values, which Malik merged with his Colombier Acquisition Corp. company in July (PublicSq. has also landed a $1 million ad deal with Carlson's media company).\n\nConservative media company The Daily Wire also announced a large investment in the \"parallel economy\" this week, pledging to invest $100 million over the next three years to create a children's entertainment streaming service called Bentkey, which it considers a conservative rebuttal to \"woke\" Disney programming that includes LGBTQ themes.\n\nThe Daily Wire's CEO Jeremy Boreing has previously founded businesses to compete with \"woke\" companies, including Jeremy's Razors, founded in response to Harry's Razors pulling its ads from The Daily Wire over some podcast hosts allegedly using hate speech, and Jeremy's Chocolates, created after Hershey's used a trans woman in an advertisement.\n\nOther previous large investments into the \"parallel economy\" include a 2021 investment by conservatives including billionaire Peter Thiel and author J.D. Vance into free speech-focused social platform Rumble-though the amount of the investment was not disclosed at the time, the Wall Street Journal reported it valued the company at about $500 million.\n\nMalik's investment in Carlson's media company was the first investment made by 1789 Capital, which reportedly aims to help get Last Country off the ground so it can continue to raise the hundreds of millions it is aiming for. Carlson's media company is reportedly expected to be video-focused and will offer subscription-based content. Malik has previously backed Carlson's ventures, including an investment in conservative media company The Daily Caller , which Carlson co-founded in 2010.\n\nOne of the first film projects announced by Bentkey is a live-action adaptation of Snow White , intended to compete with Disney's own upcoming Snow White remake and set for release in 2024. Disney's film and its star, Rachel Zegler, have for months been the target of right-wing critics who allege it will be \"woke.\" Zegler has attracted some criticism for stating the film will be modernized and embrace feminist themes: \"It's no longer 1937 . . . She's not going to be saved by the prince, and she's not going to be dreaming about true love. She's dreaming about becoming the leader she knows she can be,\" Zegler said in an interview. The film has also been criticized for casting a diverse set of actors-including just one with dwarfism-to play the seven dwarves, and some conservatives criticized Disney for casting Zegler, a Hispanic actress, to play the titular character who is white in the original movie. In an announcement of Bentkey's Snow White , Boreing said Disney's remake is evidence the company has \"abandoned\" Walt Disney's legacy and \"will expose children to the popular but destructive lies of the current moment.\"\n\nMany smaller businesses have been founded to offer an alternative to \"woke\" companies, often finding audiences through a presence on PublicSq.-which it says hosts more than 55,000 \"pro-life, pro-family, and pro-America businesses\"-or advertising on platforms like Rumble. Seth Weathers founded Ultra Right Beer in April in response to the conservative boycott against Bud Light-it's set to hit shelves in stores in the South, and Weathers said he sold $500,000 worth of cans in 12 hours by using an image of Donald Trump's mugshot on the can. Black Rifle Coffee, which reportedly advertises on Rumble, sells coffee marketed toward Second Amendment supporters, like \"AK-47 Espresso Blend\" and \"Silencer Smooth Coffee Roast.\" Pet supply company Tiny Dog, which markets its products on PublicSq., was founded by Kevin and Myra Jones, who told the New York Times they wanted to advertise their business toward people who shared their values.\n\n\"As more and more competition comes in and gets fiercer and fiercer in this world where [we have] what we as marketers refer to as the attentional deficit economy, it's hard to stand out. One way brands, products, services, organizations now stand out is to build a little bit of this ideological DNA into their argument for why you should become one of their customers,\" University of Pennsylvania marketing professor Americus Reed told The Hill .\n\nConservative protests of \"woke\" companies intensified earlier this year, targeting brands that voiced commitments to the LGBTQ community (many of which occurred during Pride month), diversity, equity and inclusion or feminist causes. The boycott against Bud Light, which started in April after it participated in a brief marketing campaign with transgender social media star Dylan Mulvaney, has continued for months and caused the company to slip from its position as the most popular beer in the United States in 2023. Other companies , like Target, Kohl's and sports leagues including Major League Baseball and NASCAR, came under fire in June for social media posts and merchandise that celebrated Pride month. Chick-fil-A and Cracker Barrel both attracted online criticism for making commitments to DEI in June, and a resurfaced Miller Lite commercial for Women's History Month was slammed by commentators including Joe Rogan and Ben Shapiro in May.\n\nConservative Brands-Including Beer, Chocolate, Razors And More-Are Trying To Profit On Anti-'Woke' Backlash (Forbes)\n\nConservatives Aren't Just Boycotting Bud Light.

I certainly don't think that we should be using any influence in our government to try to get him out of what seemed to be extremely serious charges in Romania.

You're rolling out the red carpet for a pair of self-styled pimps and predators.\"\n\nSome of Trump's allies, including his son Donald Trump Jr. and Elon Musk, have expressed support for Andrew Tate. Trump Jr. called Tate's detention in Romania \"absolute insanity\" in a post on X in May last year, while Musk said in January Tate's criticism of the U.K. \"political establishment\" is \"not wrong.\" Musk participated in a discussion on X with Tate, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, former Republican presidential candidate and Trump ally Vivek Ramaswamy and former Trump national security advisor Mike Flynn in December 2023. One of Tate's lawyers, Paul Ingrassia, is a White House liaison at the Department of Justice. Trump lawyer Alina Habba has also expressed support for Tate and what she described as his message for Americans \"to stop being wimps,\" during a recent appearance with Tate on \"The Benny Show\" podcast.\n\nThe Trump administration reportedly pressured Romanian officials to release the brothers, the Financial Times reported , citing unnamed sources. Romanian foreign minister Emil Hurezeanu confirmed having a discussion with Trump's special envoy Richard Grenell about the matter in an interview with Euronews , but said he did not interpret the conversation as pressure from Grenell. Trump told reporters Thursday \"I know nothing about that,\" when asked if his administration had any role in their release.\n\nTate, a self-proclaimed misogynist who promotes machismo and openly degrades women online, and his brother arrived in Fort Lauderdale Thursday after Romanian officials released travel restrictions against the brothers. The brothers, who are dual U.S.-British citizens, were arrested in Romania in 2022 and charged with human trafficking and criminal gang activity, with prosecutors alleging they lured women to Romania and sexually exploited them.

Hayek, Conservatism, And The Free Economy\n\nBy Alejandro Antonio Chafuen\n\nBy Alejandro Antonio Chafuen ,\n\nContributor.\n\nI have spent my entire professional life promoting economic freedom. Most of this has been in the United States, where parties and groups labeled \"conservatives\" have favored the free economy. Various leaders and groups made some exceptions, usually for national security, education, health, and the environment, but by and large they always defended private property. The free economy is nothing more than allowing adults to use their private property as they please.\n\nNobel prize winning economist Professor Friedrich Hayek, then 84, at a presentation ceremony at ... More which he received the Aims of Industry organization's first International Free Enterprise Award.   (Photo by PA Images via Getty Images)\n\nAlthough this is changing, outside the United States the term \"liberal\" usually describes those who emphasize economic liberty and private property. But here, after social democrats and interventionists appropriated the term \"liberal,\" the term \"conservative\" has come to mean something like classical liberalism.\n\nJust as in the modern economy new technologies have allowed for extreme product differentiation, the world of ideologies has in recent times become very differentiated. In the same way you can pick your phone's color, today you can choose your conservative brand depending on your personal and social values. As ideas impact economic policies, several of us who work in this field are studying the new scene and its potential effects on the economy's future.\n\nAs the topic is so vast and is attracting considerable resources, the analysis deserves a long treatment, so I will tackle it step by step in several articles, starting with the definitions and foundations.\n\nLet's start with conservatism. I use the term conservative to describe the ideology, political philosophy, movements, and organizations grounded on the view of the human person as having a special dignity. This dignity makes each of us unique and individual creatures, with body and soul, social needs and inclinations, understanding and free will. I also regard as conservative those philosophies and organizations that defend the institutions that evolved to protect, nurture, and enhance human flourishing.\n\nIn most definitions of conservatism, you will find mention of the political and social philosophies that emphasize preserving established traditions, institutions, and values. As there is a variety of traditions, institutions, and values, especially across regions and countries, it is natural that there will be differences in what people want to conserve.\n\nThere are many colors of conservatism today in the United States and the world: Social Conservatives, National Conservatives , Constitutional Conservatives, Freedom Conservatives, and I could add to the list. The president of the Heritage Foundation, Kevin Roberts, recently published a piece, Unhyphenated Conservatism , which states that \"the divisions today on the American right cannot be papered over.\" After listing eight fundamental principles that should unite conservatives, Roberts states that the most important should be \"individual freedom, grounded on moral virtue and interpersonal responsibility.\"\n\nKevin D. Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation, is playing an important role balancing the ... More free economy and the moral and legal framework that sustains it. Here delivering a speech at the Intercollegiate Studies Institute 70th anniversary dinner\n\nEach of today's \"hyphenated conservative\" groups has chosen to emphasize one or more aspects of the values and institutions that have led to the progress of civilization. Some focus on nation, others on values, others on tradition, and others, like the Freedom Conservatives , on freedom.\n\nF. A. Hayek and Conservatism\n\nF. A. Hayek's contributions to the free society as a scholar and as an intellectual entrepreneur have been so influential that even most freedom-loving conservatives have commented on and analyzed the famous postscript chapter of his Constitution of Liberty , \"Why I am not a Conservative.\"\n\nI do not use the term \"conservative\" in the way Hayek used it. In that essay, Hayek described himself politically as a \"Whig.\" The Whig Party in England emerged during the late 17th century and played a significant role in British politics until the mid-19th century. It then became the liberal party. Its counterpart, Toryism (Conservatives), became identified with a desire to retain the existing state of things, however bad it might be. I do not know, however, any conservative today who states that. On the other hand, the term \"liberal\" replaced Whig. \"Liberal\" also had different meanings, from moderate liberals to lukewarm conservatives, with some negative connotations.\n\nOn the topic of economics, like most conservatives until today, the Whigs generally supported policies that promoted trade, commerce, and economic growth. They were associated with commercial interests and the emerging industrial and merchant classes, favored free trade, and opposed protectionism. Whigs also championed individual liberties and civil rights and were strong proponents of freedom of speech, religion, and the press. Since the term \"Whig\" and the evolution of the party is little known on this continent, when speaking to Americans Hayek said that the writings of James Madison would best explain his political and economic philosophy.\n\nJames Madison (1751-1836), one of the Founding Fathers of the United States and the fourth president, is often considered a key figure in the development of American conservatism. Madison was a proponent of limited government and a strong advocate for individual rights and liberties. He was crucial in drafting the United States Constitution and authored most of the Bill of Rights. These first ten amendments to the Constitution protect fundamental rights such as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly. Madison was not a libertarian; he supported policies such as a strong national government and expanding federal powers. He advocated for establishing a national bank and supported the War of 1812, which involved using federal military power.\n\nThe James Madison Program is one of the most important efforts helping to bring serious academic conservative discourse to leading universities. It is directed by Robert P. George at Princeton University, one of the top conservative intellectuals in the United States. So, for most observers today, \"Hayek the Madisonian\" sounds like \"Hayek the conservative.\"\n\nOn the topic of tradition, an issue that comes up frequently when distinguishing conservatives from liberals, Hayek is clearly on the conservative side. \"Paradoxically, as it may appear,\" he wrote, \"it is probably true that a successful free society, will always in a large measure be a tradition-bound society.\"\n\nHayek is well known among libertarians for analyzing the importance of the individual's knowledge and decentralized decision-making. He emphasized the emergence of spontaneous orders and saw conservatives, especially his contemporaries in the U.K., as more inclined to support government intervention in the economy to preserve societal stability and traditional values.\n\nIn his Road to Serfdom , Hayek mentions that in those times, 1940, the Conservative Party in England had drifted away from the free economy. In Constitution of Liberty , he quotes Harold Nicolson, a member of the establishment, who wrote that among the backbenchers of the Conservative party, \"the most gifted . . . were all socialist at heart.\" Hayek's belief in the necessity of ongoing evolution made him distinct from conservative thinkers who might emphasize established structures and customs.\n\nFrank S. Meyer (1900-1972) addressed Hayek's \"anti-conservative\" confession. Meyer was a crucial figure among American conservatives. In the words of William C. Dennis, Meyer argued that conservatives \"should not let factional ideological quarrels distract them from their duty to further their common heritage of liberty and to reduce the power of the Leviathan state.\" Regarding Hayek, he acknowledged: \"He is a Whig with all the moral and intellectual power of eighteenth-century Whiggism, infinitely superior to its French Revolutionary and Liberal successors.\" However, Meyer continued, \"he is a Whig with all the flaws of Whiggism, its fear of acknowledging the absolute transcendental values upon which its strength is founded.\"\n\nFrank S. Meyer, a former teacher in the Communist Party, broke with the party in 1945 and became a ... More leading figure among conservatives who promote the free economy.\n\nIn \"Conservatives and Libertarians: Uneasy Cousins,\" an essay presented at the Philadelphia Society in 1979, Robert Nisbet, the noted sociologist professor at the University of Columbia, agreed with much of Hayek but not with his generalization that conservatives are reluctant to innovate and change. Nisbet provided several historical examples contra Hayek and concluded that there is no evidence that political conservatives are hostile to change.\n\nHayek doubted that \"there can be such a thing as a conservative political philosophy.\" He argued that \"conservatism may often be a useful practical maxim, but it does not give us any guiding principles which can influence long-range developments.\"\n\nDespite this warning by Hayek, in addition to the eight points that appear in Kevin Roberts's piece mentioned above, U.S. conservatives have been developing guiding principles. Different brands of conservatives coexisted well with a set of principles adopted by young conservatives on September 11, 1960, at the house of William F. Buckley, Jr. in Sharon, Connecticut. In our day another set of principles, this time prepared by the \"Freedom Conservatives,\" is gaining support from diverse sectors, from conservatives to libertarians and even establishment Republicans. I will focus more on these documents in a future piece, but here I will address the first points from each set of principles.\n\nThe Sharon statement starts with: \"That foremost among the transcendent values is the individual's use of his God-given free will, whence derives his right to be free from the restrictions of arbitrary force. That liberty is indivisible, and that political freedom cannot long exist without economic freedom.\"\n\nThe Freedom Conservatives' statement starts with: \"Among Americans' most fundamental rights is the right to be free from the restrictions of arbitrary force: a right that, in turn, derives from the inseparability of free will from what means to be human. Liberty is indivisible, and political freedom cannot long exist without economic freedom.\"\n\nI think that Hayek would have no difficulty signing the Freedom Conservatives' document. Note that, unlike the Sharon statement, the statement does not provide an origin for freedom. I do not think that this would have been a problem for Hayek. He helped produce the Mont Pelerin Society (MPS) guidelines in 1947. Although different in scope, the MPS document is compatible with the Sharon and the Freedom Conservatives statement; it mentions human dignity, freedom, moral absolutes, and the essential moral nature of problems. However, consistent with Frank Meyer's criticism, there is no mention of God, a Creator, or the origins of dignity and freedom.\n\nThe Founding Fathers of the United States mentioned the Creator as the origin of inalienable rights. Even though it leaves a void, the drafters of the Freedom Conservatives decided to avoid the controversy about the origins of freedom. But to be fair, even in the 1960s, the Sharon statement's assertion that free will was God's gift passed by a slim margin, 44 to 40.\n\nDespite the differences in conservative positions, most acknowledge the free economy's importance. The writings of F.A. Hayek, as well as his demeanor, dress, and life, which I witnessed on several occasions, fit well with conservative culture and several conservative positions, especially those of the Freedom Conservatives."

      "text": "How Did Conservatives Get the Idea That Price Controls Whip Inflation?\n\nBy John Tamny\n\nBy John Tamny ,\n\nContributor.\n\nThe path to lower prices is always and everywhere the division of production across as many hands and machines as possible. The latter explains why the poor of today enjoy technology that the richest of the rich had no access to as recently as ten years ago, and also why those same poor have abundant access to clothing of varying styles and sizes that the rich throughout much of ancient and modern history could never really have imagined. It's surprising something so basic requires stating, but it's required.\n\nTo see why, consider the conservative belief that won't die about the path to lower prices being paved by so-called Federal Reserve \"tightness\" in the form of higher interest rates. Price controls to whip higher prices? Can the Right be serious?\n\nFurthermore, governments have no resources. To then suggest the Fed can \"tighten\" access to credit always and everywhere produced in the private sector is the stuff of fantasy.\n\nYet conservative Fed watchers continue to promote the fiction of the Fed as preserver of so-called \"price stability.\" Consider a recent conservative editorial which oddly asserted that \"cooling inflation shows that the Federal Reserve's monetary medicine has been working.\" Really? How?\n\nPuzzling about conservatives is if you say artificially cheap (care of government decree) apartments, bananas and Ferraris will result in the disappearance of all three from the marketplace, they'll nod in smug agreement. But somehow when the Fed is attempting to control the market price, not only can government make money and credit \"easy,\" it can also make money and credit \"tight\" if need be. When it comes to the Fed, all inviolable laws of the market vanish from the minds of conservatives.\n\nThis can be found in conservative thinkers tying allegedly declining prices to interest-rate price controls. Except that the Fed can \"tighten\" access neither to money nor credit. Those who are productive will always have abundant money and credit matched to them.\n\nThis is particularly true in a global economy where the U.S. dollar is the main currency of the globe. Dollars circulate in enormous amounts all over the world, yet we're supposed to believe Fed attempts to shrink so-called \"money supply\" will overwhelm a globalized market for dollars?\n\nThe same editorial crediting the Fed and Jerome Powell with lower prices also suggested that \"Markets seem to think inflation is whipped and the Fed should start worrying about being late to cut rates.\" Except that supposedly Fed price controls, not markets , brought down prices. At which point we're supposed to believe that markets aren't stupid once, but in reality twice; that they've been tricked by price controls in the form of high rates that will soon be followed by more market intervention in the form of lower rates?\n\nMore realistically, stocks were rising impressively and in concert with the Fed's rate hikes . One of the catalysts of rising markets as the Fed pursued higher rates of interest was AI leader Nvidia. Its soaring valuation along with a growing realization of AI's potential resulted in a surge of investment into the epicenter of AI (northern California). It's a short way of saying that actual market forces powerfully overwhelmed Fed interventions in the form of surging investment in a new technology, and soaring valuations for the corporate pioneers of the technology.\n\nBack to actual prices of goods, services and labor, conservatives disappoint yet again. It's not just that they ascribe falling prices to price controls, it's that in blaming the Fed for higher prices they're implying that feverish production borne of global cooperation doesn't matter, that governments around the world could shutter production for weeks and months at a time in response to a virus that panicked politicians (and all too many conservative pundits) without profoundly altering the prices of everything in the near and long term.\n\nWhich is what's really sad. It's not just that conservatives are situational about price controls in their confusing of command-and-control for inflation, it's that they would so thoroughly insult the genius of globalized commerce with the arrogant presumption that once the panicked freed producers to get back to production, that prices should quickly return to where they were before the panicked so obnoxiously stole their freedom in the first place."

(Photo by Robin L Marshall/FilmMagic)\n\n\"Reagan\" opened in theaters last week, grossing a better-than-expected $10.3 million over the long Labor Day weekend at the domestic box office to place overall and earn the weekend's top debut.\n\nThe film has placed second at the box office behind \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" every day this week, missing the top spot on Wednesday by just $4,000, according to Box Office Mojo .\n\nThe film failed to impress critics: It has a 21% score on Rotten Tomatoes , while the audience score ranks much higher at 98%.\n\nSome conservative commentators, who are rallying behind the film on social media, are pointing out the wide discrepancy between the critics and audience scores, including Megyn Kelly , who claimed \"left-wing critics try to kill a film and the American people don't listen.\"\n\nConservative actor Kevin Sorbo , who plays a small role in the film, also taunted liberal audiences, tweeting when the trailer was released: \"The left is going to hate this.\"\n\nThe film stars Dennis Quaid as Reagan, Penelope Ann Miller as Nancy Reagan, and is told through the perspective of Viktor Petrovich, a former KGB agent based on several real individuals, who is played by Jon Voight.\n\nThe Rotten Tomatoes critics consensus states the film's \"cloying and glossy rendering of history flattens the 40th U.S. President into caricature.\" The Los Angeles Times slammed the movie as a \"hollow portrait tailor-made for religious conservatives with a thin grasp of history and no tolerance for nuance,\" alleging the movie selectively leaves out parts of Reagan's presidency that may be unflattering or compromise his portrayal as a crusader against communism. Variety said the film is more \"hagiography than history,\" also claiming it was curated to appeal to an audience of religious conservatives. Several reviews, including Associated Press and the New York Times , criticized the film for portraying Reagan as the sole force behind the fall of the Soviet Union. Paul M. Renfro, a Florida State University history professor, wrote in a column for Slate that the film has \"countless omissions, distortions, and outright fabrications,\" criticizing it for allegedly glossing over the war on drugs and the HIV-AIDS epidemic. Renfro also said the film portrays Reagan as an \"anti-racist trailblazer,\" which he claims is undeserved because of his opposition to legislation including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and his use of the \" welfare queen \" image.\n\nSeveral conservative media personalities with large followings have praised the movie while slamming film critics, including former lawyer Rogan O'Handley, who has 1.7 million followers on X. He slammed critics as \"out of touch\" in one post and criticized the Daily Beast, which posted a negative review of the movie, as \"far left\" and claimed the negative review was because the film \"celebrates American patriotism and Republican values.\" Quaid promoted the film in interviews with several conservative media personalities, including Glenn Beck , Ben Shapiro and Megyn Kelly .\n\nDirector Sean McNamara has said the film's primary focus is not politics: \"I'm not really a political guy at all these days, but I do know a great story when I see one,\" he wrote in a column for Newsweek. He compared the film to \"Rocky,\" stating its director John G. Avildsen told him the film is not about boxing, which was \"merely the backdrop for a story about a man who faced tremendous odds and then overcame them,\" much like the backdrop for \"Reagan\" is politics.\n\n\"Reagan\" took more than a decade to make it to the screen. Producer Mark Joseph , who had been developing the project as early as 2010, slammed a previous attempt at dramatizing Reagan's life, the 2003 series \"The Reagans,\" which Joseph said was an \"insulting, condescending movie about a much-loved historical figure.\" The film was delayed by troubles securing financing and the COVID-19 pandemic . McNamara said the film was \"never intended to come out in an election year,\" but said recent events like the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump make the film \"more urgent and relevant.\"\n\nAnother high-profile movie about a Republican president is due to hit theaters next month: Ali Abbasi's controversial \" The Apprentice ,\" which stars Sebastian Stan as Trump in his early days as a real estate mogul in 1970s New York. Unlike \"Reagan,\" \"The Apprentice\" is already drawing the ire of conservatives, including Trump's campaign, who threatened to sue the filmmakers over what it says are \"lies.\" After the film's premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, Variety reported it is \"chock full of unflattering sequences about Donald Trump.\"\n\n'Deadpool' tops charts yet again as 'Reagan' beats expectations on sluggish Labor Day weekend (Associated Press)\n\nRonald Reagan Is Back On-Screen (Slate)\n\n'The Apprentice' Clip Shows First Glimpse Of Sebastian Stan As Donald Trump (Forbes)\n\nOne Community.

(Photo by Saul LOEB / AFP) (Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe debate over Critical Race Theory continues to wage on. Last year, a video went viral of a man who criticized Critical Race Theory but at the same time could not define it. The man said that Critical Race Theory was the most crucial issue in last year's Virginia gubernatorial election, but later he could not define the theoretical framework or justify his feelings against it. This has led to many who argue that many White Americans who oppose CRT are also completely unaware of what it is.\n\nThat said, proponents of theory argue that there is a large cohort of white Americans who have expressed opposition to the theory who are not guilty of having gaps in knowledge about it, but choose to remain blatantly and willfully uneducated about CRT, which speaks to a larger issue. A larger issue that that points to a deeply rooted rage that stems from fear of anything they perceive to be a threat to their racial privilege. Furthermore, many argue that their indignant and almost boastful resistance to familiarize themselves on the topic of basic U.S. history further illustrates their racial privilege.\n\nThose Who Don't Know About Critical Race Theory\n\nDuring the latter half of last year, a video of a man who stated the most important issue in Virginia's governor's race was banning CRT in schools went viral on Twitter . But in an ironic plot twist, after a few questions, he quickly buckled and admitted that he knew nothing about the theory. Some might feel embarrassed not providing a reasonable argument for their position on such a critical issue. After all, our vote for state elected officials is crucial and can directly affect our everyday lives.\n\nYet, many argued that he did not seem to flinch at the absurdity of his apparent oblivion about CRT. But he is not alone. Others have come before him to rally the troops in a war against CRT while being clueless about the topic. This might help to explain why Glenn Youngkin, the Republican candidate for Virginia governor, who repeatedly decried critical race theory during his campaign and vowed to ban it from Virginia's schools on his first day in office, inevitably won the race on November 4 2021.\n\nThose Who Claim They Know About Critical Theory\n\nA Washington Post opinion piece was recently published, which referred to critical race theory as \"dangerous.\" Many found themselves in opposition not over the columnist's opinion, but rather the inaccuracy of his argument.\n\n\"This is the opposite of what the civil rights movement stood for. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. did not argue that America was systemically racist; he argued that racism was un-American. He appealed to the Enlightenment ideals contained in what he called our \"magnificent\" Declaration of Independence and Constitution and declared his goal was to take \"the whole nation back to those great wells of democracy, which were dug deep by the Founding Fathers,\" writes Washington Post columnist Mark Thiessen.\n\nAlthough many historical accounts of the Civil Rights Leader depict King as one-dimensional and commonly reference his \"I Have A Dream\" speech, King held varying perspectives about racism in the U.S. and was not a one-trick pony. Although he continued to view racism and anti-Blackness in America with optimism for a better tomorrow, he was keenly aware of the reality of the state of race relations in the country.\n\nIn his speech \"Remaining Awake Through a Great Revolution,\" King said this:\n\n\"It is an unhappy truth that racism is a way of life for the vast majority of White Americans, spoken and unspoken, acknowledged and denied, subtle and sometimes not so subtle - the disease of racism permeates and poisons a whole body politic. \"\n\nSimilarly, in a Sunday morning sermon at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., King preached the following:\n\n\"We must come to see that the roots of racism are very deep in our country, and there must be something positive and massive in order to get rid of all the effects of racism and the tragedies of racial injustice.\"\n\nDuring that same sermon, King observed that the same people who have benefitted from the inequitable treatment of Blacks in America are the \"very people who tell Negroes that they must lift themselves by their own bootstraps. It's all right to tell a man to lift himself by his own bootstraps, but it is a cruel jest to say to a bootless man that he ought to lift himself by his own bootstraps.\"\n\nIronically, Dr. King's sentiments are at the crux of CRT - engaging in an honest and transparent analysis of the histrionic presence of anti-Blackness and systemic racism in America and discussing how the malignancy of racism has disenfranchised and marginalized Black Americans.\n\nThose Who Don't Know About Critical Race Theory, But Know Enough To Maintain white Supremacy\n\nCritical race theory has a large number of people up in arms. Primarily, white conservatives. So much so that Fox News mentioned the theory more than 1,900 times between May and July 2021. Eight states, including Idaho, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Iowa, New Hampshire, Arizona, and South Carolina, have passed legislation to ban CRT. But, except for Idaho, none of the state bills explicitly mention \"critical race theory.\" That said, Montana and South Dakota have denounced teaching concepts associated with CRT. In Florida, Georgia, Utah, and Oklahoma, the state school boards have introduced new guidelines barring CRT-related discussions. Local school boards in Georgia, North Carolina, Kentucky, and Virginia, and almost 20 other states have introduced or plan to introduce similar legislation.\n\nBut there was never a formalized plan made by any state or school district to teach critical race theory as a theoretical framework to students. In all its glory, CRT is far too complex to teach to school-aged students in its entirety and complexity. While earning my doctorate, I used critical race theory in my dissertation. It took me weeks to gain a thorough grasp of the theory in its totality and to easily conceptualize my research topic through that lens. So trust me, even if Donald Trump were to give his most sincere blessing, school administrators - even in the most progressive states - never made curriculum plans around little Billy and Sue learning CRT in third grade.\n\nThat said, although many remain woefully yet proudly uneducated on the topic, a handful of white conservatives who oppose the theory have educated themselves on its tenants. At least enough to strategically present rationale - although flawed and dishonest - to ban it. And those people are the state lawmakers who have drafted and passed legislation to ban it. Again, most state bills do not explicitly mention \"critical race theory.\" But in a mean game of chess, the bills ban discussing, training, or adopting the belief that the U.S. is inherently racist and discussions about conscious and unconscious bias, privilege, discrimination, and oppression. Topics that all - to some extent - can be taught to little Billy and Sue in third grade. Yup, they covered their bases.\n\nThe Truth About CRT, Racism, and Some White Conservatives\n\nSo, while a good number of white Americans who oppose the theory remain utterly unaware of what it is, they are very much in tune with their resistance toward racial equity at the cost of losing their racial privilege. With that comes an unwillingness to acknowledge our country's racist history and how it impacts the current racial climate. Opponents also fear that CRT admonishes all White people for being oppressors while portraying Black people as hopelessly oppressed victims. But these descriptions about CRT are gross exaggerations. CRT does not attribute racism to White people as individuals or even to entire groups of people.\n\nSimply put, critical race theory states racism is embedded in U.S. social institutions (e.g., the criminal justice system, education system, labor market, housing market, and healthcare system), which shape laws, regulations, rules, and procedures that ultimately give favor to Whites and marginalize Blacks. Racism can exist without racists, yet many Americans cannot separate their identity from the idea of America and the social institutions that govern us. Consequently, many of these people see themselves as the system and interpret calling social institutions racist as calling them racist personally.\n\nBottom line: for a large number of White folks, critical race theory has become coded language for 'reducing White supremacy.' While some might click their heels at the thought of eradicating White supremacist culture, others are raging against the machine and fighting tooth and nail to protect their racial privilege. This isn't the first time we have witnessed White America go bonkers over a perceived loss of power. There have numerous large demonstrations of White rage over similar issues.\n\nThe most recent incidents include the violent insurrection at the capitol , the Charlottesville and anti-lockdown protests, and even the deadly actions of Kyle Rittenhouse and Dylan Roof . As crazy as it might sound, this is why some white people feel comfortable remaining ignorant about the tenants of the theory while righteous in their opposition to it. It's almost as if some white Americans are saying: \"I'm white. I don't have to justify my opinions.\" And that attitude, ironically, is a critical component of the very privilege they are fighting to maintain."

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nConservatives are far more likely to report experiences of discrimination based on their political views, a new report from USA Today discovered.\n\nAnd the discrimination they experience is pushing many to move from liberal-leaning areas to more conservative regions, according to the 2,000-person study.\n\nWhile only 19 percent of liberal Americans reported experiencing bias or discrimination after moving to a more conservative community, 39 percent of conservative Americans shared that experience when moving to a liberal place.\n\nAnd right-leaning Americans were 56 percent more likely to leave an area with opposing political views.\n\n\"In the past, communities did contain within them more ideological diversity,\" Kent Bausman, a professor of sociology at Maryville University, told Newsweek.\n\n\"What these survey findings suggest is just how deeply divided we are becoming from each other across our ideological camps. We don't simply disagree anymore. Instead, we are starting to see each other as somewhat foreign, in a manner that is to be feared or ignored.\"\n\nGenerally, right-leaning Americans were more likely to prioritize the political views of a prospective community when deciding where to live. Among the conservative group, 25 percent of men prioritized it, while 14 percent of women said the same.\n\n\"White males, and especially conservatives, view themselves as the object of criticism from the left and in political and media discourse,\" Keith Gaddie, a political science professor at Texas Christian University, told Newsweek. \"It is not surprising that they respond by going someplace where they feel comfortable.\"\n\nAltogether, 62 percent of Americans who moved in the last year said they considered political issues when deciding where to make their new home.\n\nHealth care, crime gun violence, and taxes were the most likely policy issues to motivate movers at 28, 28, and 26 percent, respectively.\n\nOf those Americans who moved to a place with different political values, 77 percent said they struggled to adjust, and 30 percent felt excluded from social experiences.\n\nThat was more concentrated among right-leaning Americans, who said they had trouble adapting 82 percent of the time compared to just 70 percent of left-leaning Americans.\n\n\"Conservatives are far more likely to be uncomfortable and to dislike living in and experiencing social environments where they believe their conservative views will be shunned,\" William Hall, a professor of political science and business at Webster University, told Newsweek.\n\n\"On the other hand, historically, those who hold more liberal philosophical and ideological political views, more often favor and embrace change in both the formulation and implementation of public policy and the social order.\"\n\nPolitical beliefs have become increasingly important as a matter of identity for Americans, and they can shape what friends you make and how comfortable you feel in an area, experts say.\n\n\"It has gotten to the point where people's political identity is akin to their religious beliefs,\" Bausman said. \"The result of this is a decline in what might be thought of as civic pluralism - that messy, uncomfortable practice of interacting with those to whom you disagree.\"\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nSuzanne Blake is a Newsweek reporter based in New York.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nA conservative is someone who, to borrow the famous phrase of National Review 's William F. Buckley \"stands athwart history, yelling Stop.\" With the rise of the Soviet threat, that phrase and the hundreds of articles published in Buckley's magazine became generation-defining. Almost 70 years later, young conservatives, growing in the Trump era and lacking the nostalgia of our Boomer parents, have been asking ourselves a pertinent question: what the heck are we yelling at?\n\nStuck in the '70s, many of those who came before us find themselves \"yelling Stop\" at radically different things. Unlike what some of the Boomers may initially think, the difference in our yelling doesn't originate from Gen Z conservatives falling in love with progressive orthodoxies-although a portion has. Gen Z conservatives are not adopting the views of their liberal peers. What we are doing is responding to the unique ills we detect in the unique times we find ourselves in. Our lack of focus on some of the policies cherished by Boomer conservatives is better attributed to prioritization than rejection.\n\nThe mission statement of National Review was once the mission statement of conservatism writ large, which included propositions such as \"we are, without reservations, on the libertarian side\" in fighting \"the growth of government.\" Back then, pro-business and pro-America were almost exclusively seen as synonymous. Back then, leftists talked more about unionizing than about inculcating DEI ideology. Back then, cultural preservation was not the animating spirit of Republican politics; institutions weren't completely overtaken and the status quo was acceptable. It was \"morning in America\" indeed, until it wasn't.\n\nIrritable as the term may be, opposition to wokeness, for instance, has become one of the principal attractors of conservatism for young people. We are all in part a product of our environment. Boomers' conservatism was understandably marked by different perceived threats and it concentrated its energies on those-mainly, defeating the communists. Gen Z now simply concentrates its energies on threats the Boomers never encountered in their youth.\n\nWe find ourselves in an environment where declining community and radical individualism, not fear of government collectivism, engross our dissatisfactions. The mere size of government is not something that we lose sleep over, not because we think more like communists, but because we have seen conservatives before us fail to conserve anything beyond market fundamentalism.\n\nEven if it sounds counterintuitive, in the eyes of Gen Z conservatives, conserving the conservatism of our parents may be the least conservative thing to do. The values-neutral liberal order many Boomers love to appeal to is dead.\n\nProgressives have wielded government power, and wielded it well, to a point at which refusing to use such power in the name of principle has become masochistic. The battle of ideas Boomers experienced on the college campuses of yesteryear is not there like it was before. The leftists we meet on campus don't \"agree to disagree\"; they'd rather just make us agree. The reality is that whenever a Republican says \"I think the law should stay out of it,\" like Nikki Haley did when asked about legislation on sex-change procedures for children, Gen Z conservatives don't think, \"yes, individual responsibility! Small government rocks!\"\n\nThe culture and institutions that held this country together are vanishing. Hence, if we can use some government power-with prudence, of course-to strengthen them, so be it. Boomer conservatives grew up hearing that the more government grows the more chaotic things will turn. Though this idea is theoretically coherent, here's the issue: if you let the government expand, it will be hard to reduce its size, but if you let anti-American activists dictate policy and spearhead culture without restraint, forget about tax rates, America won't be America anymore.\n\nBoomers still have melancholy-but we don't. We have been made to want to conserve something that we never knew, which is why we are so starkly positive-visioned. We don't know what living in an America without ubiquitous and suffocating progressivism feels like. We just know, maybe in part because of the Boomers' stories, that this country is heading in the wrong direction and that playing the same cards won't change that.\n\nIf \"yelling Stop\" means sticking with the belief that government inaction is in itself virtuous, Gen Z conservatives disagree. We want radical change because we face radical circumstances and if Boomers had grown up in the America we have, they would want it too.\n\nJuan P.

In a clip on TikTok , @hifortesa said she found the data fascinating.\n\n\"What I thought was interesting about this was none of these were super feminine which I guess kind of leans into the whole like conservative idea of like Maverick kind of like rebellion like cowboy kind of stuff, then we have the bluest boy names and these are really interesting because they seem to come from a lot of different cultures, so we have Santino, Muhammad, Yusuf, Kieran, Ari, Aidan, Ibrahim, Ali and Nico,\" she said.\n\nWhile baby names don't determine political identity, these trends illustrate how cultural values influence even deeply personal choices.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\n\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\n\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\n\nDaniella Gray is a Newsweek Family & Parenting Reporter based in London, U.K. Her focus is on family dynamics, childhood development, parenting styles, U.S. education and current trends in family and parenting practices.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nThe horrifying execution of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York City this week has reignited a national conversation about private health insurance, reflecting a wide-reaching consensus among Americans of all political stripes that the industry is deeply broken.\n\nOnline, conservatives and liberals alike have expressed reactions ranging from indifference to schadenfreude over Thompson's murder, citing their gripe with the U.S. healthcare system and the companies, like UnitedHealth, that have denied their medical claims in the past.\n\nThompson was shot dead outside a Hilton hotel by a masked gunman in midtown Manhattan on Wednesday morning. More than 48 hours later, the suspect remains at large.\n\nMultiple outlets have reported that three shell casings recovered from the scene were emblazoned with the words \"deny,\" \"defend\" and \"depose.\" Some observers have suggested to be a reference to Delay, Deny, Defend: Why Insurance Companies Don't Pay Claim and What You Can Do About It, a book fiercely critical of the insurance industry.\n\nReddit users took turns posting their own stories about being denied their insurance claims under a post about how UnitedHealthcare used artificial intelligence to deny benefits in the r/Conservative subreddit.\n\n\"Conservative or not, the healt[h]care system is beyond f---ed,\" one user wrote in a comment that's been upvoted more than 2,000 times. \"The US spend more on healthcare pr capita than any other country and its still not free. That money goes straight into their pockets. Its time for a clear out. The current system is beyond f---ed.\"\n\n\"I can agree with the left on this one. That dude won't get a single tear from me,\" a third wrote.\n\nIn another conversation happening on the r/Republican subreddit, users said they \"simply cannot bring [themselves] to care,\" writing that they suspect the shooter to be one of the millions of insurers who were denied by United Healthcare.\n\n\"If you're the CEO of a company doing that to people, there's 12 million people with a motive to come after you,\" one user said.\n\n\"I dunno, I see it the same way as I'd view a mob boss. It's sad that this happened and don't condone it but, I certainly won't cry about it or defend the guy,\" another said. \"Certainly no commie sympathizer though but at the same time... to whack a boss?\"\n\nOn the left, Reddit users posted about how Medicare funding could be cut under the incoming Trump administration, further straining healthcare bills. Under one post comparing President-elect Donald Trump 's Cabinet to insurance CEOs, users expressed excitement about having an \"I told you so moment\" over those who voted for the Republican for financial reasons.\n\n\"Can't wait to tell the tRumpcult voters that rely on Social Security, and Medicare I told you so, and so did tRump, and you still voted for him,\" one user wrote.\n\nOn the r/AskALiberal subreddit, users wrote about how some people who \"were covered by his company insurance and lost a loved one because of denied medical claims are probably happy about what happened.\"\n\n\"Plus another part is the eat the rich crowd, celebrating what they feel is justice against another evil rich CEO profiteering by taking advantage and forcing misery upon his customers for money, just facing due consequences,\" one comment read.\n\nA second user wrote, \"There is a lot of anger out there that when the people running a corporation do something criminal, the worst that happens is the company pays a fine. But every corporate crime is a choice made by people. They should not be personally insulated from the consequences of those choices.\"\n\nThompson's murder comes at a time when the public's views about the quality and coverage of their healthcare have plummeted. According to a Gallup survey published Friday, just 28 percent of Americans rated their coverage as \"excellent or good,\" well below the high point of 41 percent recorded in 2012 after the implementation of Obamacare.\n\nRichard Laermer, a crisis communications expert and chief executive at RLM Public Relations, told Newsweek that while the ineffectiveness of the U.S. healthcare system is \"one of the few things [Americans] agree upon,\" \"nobody should be saying it's 'a good thing' this occurred.\"\n\n\"The fact is that most healthcare companies, particularly insurance, have gotten a terrible rap lately. This murder is unfortunately a symbol of the times. I'm not in any way saying every CEO is a target, but angry and helpless people can do a lot of harm,\" Laermer said.\n\n\"Insurance is hard to procure and it appears that companies now spend a lot of time and effort saying no to claims. It may have just come to a boil with this incident,\" he added.\n\n\"Nothing good will come of this. And a lot of folks are taking it too lightly. A man was killed in broad daylight on the streets of a populous city. That should alarm everyone. And we should show more empathy for his family. Nothing else.\"\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nKatherine Fung is a Newsweek senior reporter based in New York City.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPressure from Republican politicians and conservative donors is beginning to cause Harvard, MIT, and other elite institutions to grudgingly step back from progressive illiberalism.\n\nConsider Senator J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) and Representative Michael Cloud's (R-Tex.) new Dismantle DEI Act , which would eliminate mandatory diversity statements as well as Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) administrators and initiatives in the federal government. Critically, the measure hits National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health research funding, two of the worst DEI offenders, dramatically changing the incentive structure of American academic research.\n\nSome conservatives cling to an optimistic conceit that a quiet majority of university faculty oppose woke policies and are suddenly acquiring the confidence to challenge radical activists, but this is not borne out by the evidence. Lawmakers like Vance and Cloud have a key role to play in the ongoing battle to restore political neutrality and expressive freedom to the nation's institutions, schools, and wider public culture.\n\nHarvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences recently announced an end to the use of mandatory diversity statements in hiring. Diversity statements require applicants for jobs, promotions, or grants to demonstrate how they will advance DEI principles as a condition of success.\n\nThis requirement discriminates against conservative and classical liberal applicants who, reflecting the views of a majority of Americans, prioritize equal treatment, objective truth, and freedom of speech above equal outcomes and emotional safety for minorities. Diversity statements are loyalty oaths which violate applicants' freedom of conscience and discriminate on the basis of philosophical belief.\n\nHarvard's scrapping of diversity statements follows a similar move from MIT, the first elite blue-state institution to do so. Harvard has also vowed to remain neutral on political questions that do not concern the university's narrow self-interest.\n\nWhy the shift?\n\nThe optimistic take is that most faculty have previously been too intimidated by a noisy minority of DEI activists to raise their heads above the parapet, but have now found their mettle and are restoring reason, debate, and merit to the classroom. Universities will reform themselves, the argument goes, unless conservative politicians intervene, because doing so would politicize DEI, turning it into a front in the culture war that causes academics to close ranks and derail internal reform.\n\nThis account does not fit the facts. Extensive survey data reveal, as I argue in my book The Third Awokening , that the rise of cancel culture and DEI stems primarily from \"bleeding heart\" left-liberals, not the revolutionary far Left.\n\nLeft-liberals, motivated by guilt, empathy, and an alarmist fear of the majority, created taboos around race, gender, and sexuality, inflating the definition of harassment and discrimination. They presided over an expanding DEI infrastructure of affirmative action, speech codes, and diversity training.\n\nWhile the far Left leveraged liberals' apparatus of taboos, codes and policies as a force multiplier, it did not create that apparatus. Though radical innovations such as critical race and gender theory now furnish the vocabulary for diversity training and teaching materials, these-like \"defund the police\"-only gained traction because they resonated with the underlying \"majority bad, minorities good\" reflex of the liberals who form a majority in many elite institutions.\n\nNotwithstanding anecdotal evidence, mandatory diversity statements are popular with academics. Surveys in the U.S., U.K., Canada, and Australia show that, in all four countries, social science faculty at elite institutions support these statements by a margin of almost two to one.\n\nAmerican academics are also 50 percent more likely to support than oppose the \"decolonization\" of the curriculum through mandatory race and gender quotas for authors on reading lists. Most favor applying social pressure to colleagues who refuse to attend diversity training. Members of the general public who identify as progressive are even less supportive of academic freedom than are progressive academics.\n\nWe see echoes of this pro-DEI majority in a recent survey of Harvard faculty, which found that most faculty view donors and the political Right , not DEI and the Left, as the main threat to their freedom. That mentality was on display in the 65-29 vote by Columbia Faculty of Arts and Sciences professors to censure president Nemat Shafik for calling in the police to remove a pro-Palestinian encampment even after protesters vandalized Hamilton Hall.\n\nContrast that vote with the situation in 1969, when Cornell faculty voted by a two-to-one margin to censure president James Perkins for acceding to the demands of radical Left protesters. An important difference is that the Left-Right ratio among social science and humanities academics has exploded from approximately three to one in the 1960s to 13 to one today. Academics in the '60s largely stood apart from the protesters and wanted the rules enforced. Now many encourage activism, abjure the rules and join in the protests.\n\nDiversity statements were first banned in red states like Florida and Texas , or by state-appointed trustees, as in North Carolina . Soon afterwards, university presidents Claudine Gay of Harvard, Elizabeth Magill of Penn, and Sally Kornbluth of MIT were publicly embarrassed in a congressional hearing on antisemitism following Hamas ' October 7 attack on Israel.\n\nIt is no accident that Kornbluth became the first leader of an elite school to ban diversity statements-a move Harvard has now followed. The hearings led to the ouster of Gay and Magill, and put Kornbluth and others on notice. Donors such as Bill Ackman and Ken Griffin made their displeasure known online, hitting university balance sheets.\n\nWe shouldn't kid ourselves. Most academics and administrators support DEI, but external pressure from conservative politicians and donors has forced high-profile university leaders to change course. Where external pressure is weak, as in Canada or California , progressive illiberalism dominates. Only sustained political intervention can reform universities and public institutions.\n\nIf voters want to remove woke politics from settings such as schools and government agencies, they must use elected government to drive change.\n\nEric Kaufmann is Professor of Politics at University of Buckingham.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the writer's own.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nThere's not much left to say about the last remaining members of the Never Trump movement. The overwhelming majority of conservatives embraced Donald Trump either during the 2016 election or once they realized that his administration better represented their views than the D.C. uniparty establishment. Some members of Congress might still long for the old pre-Trump GOP, but even they know that it's extinct and that a populist party that cares about the working class makes for better policy and better politics.\n\nSome may wish Trump could be more disciplined and avoid saying or doing outrageous things. But Salena Zito's famous rule about Trump remains true: his critics take him literally but not seriously while his supporters take him seriously but not literally.\n\nThat's why the reaction to Trump's latest gaffe about Russia and NATO hasn't moved the needle for or against him. Like a thousand stories before it since 2015, Democrats may hope that it's the beginning of the end for the former president. But Republicans know he's trolling both liberals and America's European allies. His conduct in office-which was tougher on Russia and did more to impel NATO members to contribute to their defense than prior administrations-reassures them that he isn't about to hand the continent over to Vladimir Putin .\n\nBut some Never Trumpers still argue that a putative second Trump term would be more unhinged than his first and therefore be bad for conservatives, democracy, and everything they hold sacred.\n\nThey're clearly wrong about that.\n\nIf Trump gets back into the White House-and with him currently winning in battleground state polls, it's a real possibility-he will provide the only and perhaps last chance for conservatives to roll back the woke tide that is damaging America in ways that overshadow any minor differences some on the Right may have with him on other issues.\n\nThe most important issue facing the nation in 2024 isn't that most Americans would probably prefer new choices for president. Nor is it Trump's bad manners or the question of whether he or Biden are too old to govern effectively, though that appears certainly true for the incumbent. It's whether the next administration will continue Biden's work in implementing the woke catechism of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) throughout both government and society and further exacerbate racial tensions. The Left's infatuation with critical race theory, intersectionality, and toxic ideas like \"white privilege\" is part of a war on Western civilization that aims at tearing down not just American history but the foundational values that conservatives revere. That it has also provided a permission slip for a new surge in antisemitism since the October 7 Hamas massacres in Israel-the Jews are always the canaries in the coal mine-makes this all the more imperative.\n\nThough he's no intellectual, that's something Trump instinctively understood about the \"1619 Project\" and the way it helped pave the way for the Black Lives Matter riots of 2020. Though liberals mocked his \"1776 Project,\" it was exactly the response conservatives should have applauded.\n\nWith a stroke of a pen, he could undo the executive orders by which Biden compelled every federal agency and department to implement DEI plans and installed woke commissars to enforce them. A Republican-run Department of Justice could also help speed along the lawsuits that could also unravel the DEI orthodoxy that has overtaken the corporate world and conquered academia.\n\nConservatives should also look forward to a Trump administration that is determined to undo the damage of Biden's border policies, which have created a humanitarian crisis in border states as well as deep-blue urban enclaves where many illegal immigrants have gone.\n\nDefending borders and the rule of law against corporate interests is exactly what Republicans failed to do in past GOP administrations. That won't be the same for Trump. Conservatives should be cheered by the realization that the next GOP administration will be one that defends the values as well as the economic interests of working class Americans who now belong in the Republican Party, not with the Democrats.\n\nNor would Trump be an isolationist. He proved to be a realist in foreign policy who understood that Iran was an enemy and that Israel and the Saudis were friends. It's not unreasonable to wonder about his unpredictability and his transactional approach to everything. But the fact that the world was a lot safer and more peaceful on his watch should convince skeptics that the country is in better hands with him than with the pack of Obama alumni whose blunders created the catastrophe in Afghanistan and bear a great deal of the responsibility for the Ukraine war and the Iranian adventurism that led to the current fighting in the Middle East.\n\nIt is true that another Trump administration will have an air of chaos that is missing under Biden despite the incumbent's manifest failures. But that will be due to the open hostility and partisanship of the media figures that pumped life into the Russian collusion hoax that undermined Trump's efforts to govern for his first three years in the White House. We can expect similar sabotage from the D.C. establishment and the media the next time around. But the next Trump administration would not be handicapped the way the first was.\n\nIn 2017, the Republican governing class largely refused to serve under Trump. Even when some of them did, they tried hard not to implement the conservative and populist policies GOP voters thought they had voted for. That won't be the case in 2025. Conservatives have been preparing for their time in government and won't be caught short handed again. Efforts like Project 2025 -which is backed by a number of conservative think tanks-are preparing the Right to govern effectively.\n\nMoreover, conservatives are finally ready to reform the vast federal bureaucracy which is dominated by liberals and remove its ability to stop Republicans from governing. Though he was no match for Trump in the 2024 race, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has provided the blueprint for how to combat a liberal deep state.\n\nAnother Trump presidency won't be perfect. But politics isn't about perfection, something that conservatives are supposed to understand. If Trump wins in November, liberals will have good reason to worry about an administration that will roll back the wins Biden and his predecessors gave the hard Left-and conservatives will have every reason to celebrate.\n\nJonathan S.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nSeveral conservatives are pushing efforts to overturn the Supreme Court ruling that enshrines same-sex marriage in the United States, with conservative Christian lawyer Mat Staver declaring, \"It's not an if, it's just a matter of when.\"\n\nJune marks the 10th anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court decision Obergefell v. Hodges , which ruled that same-sex couples have the right to marry and that states cannot prohibit them.\n\nSome lawmakers, including an Oklahoma State Senator, and other anti-LGBTQ activists have pushed for the case to be overturned. Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito have signaled in a court dissent that the case should be reconsidered.\n\nA majority of Americans support same-sex marriage, though a 2024 Gallup poll found Republicans are less likely to back it than Democrats .\n\nPeople have protested Obergefell and its enshrinement of same-sex marriage rights since it was first decided. Since the court's 5-4 ruling, it has shifted to a more conservative majority after President Donald Trump appointed three justices during his first term. The court has also overturned previous decisions, most notably the abortion rights established in Roe v. Wade in 2022.\n\nHowever, same-sex marriage rights were bolstered in late 2022 when Congress passed, and President Joe Biden signed into law, the Respect for Marriage Act. The law \"requires that interracial and same-sex marriage must be recognized as legal in every state in the nation,\" the president said .\n\nStaver, chairman of the conservative Christian ministry Liberty Counsel, which advocates for anti-LGBTQ policies, said in a video appearance on World Prayer Network Wednesday night, that we're at \"a ripe time to overrule Obergefell .\"\n\nHe argued that \"there is no so-called constitutional right in the Constitution to same-sex marriage, that's ridiculous.\" Staver then said, \"It's not an if, it's just a matter of when\" Obergefell will be overruled.\n\nEfforts to chip away at the ruling are also taking place legislatively. Earlier this month, Oklahoma State Senator David Bullard introduced a bill seeking to provide tax credits to families with \"eligible dependent child\" which it defines as someone under 19 years old and \"is a natural child of both of the taxpayers.\"\n\nHe spoke about the bill's impetus Thursday on Jenna Ellis In the Morning , saying \"The reality is we have to push back on Obergefell.\"\n\nHe continued, \"If we wait too long on that Obergefell ruling to start actually sending things back up and challenging that stance that somehow we have to all get along and say that same-sex marriage is okay, it's going to be too late at some point for us to push back.\"\n\nNewsweek has reached out to GLAAD for comment via email on Friday evening.\n\nEarlier this year, Idaho Representative Heather Scott, proposed a draft memorial urging the U.S. Supreme Court to reconsider Obergefell v. Hodges , in a bid to \"restore federalism.\"\n\nA 2024 Gallup poll found that 69 percent of Americans support legal same-sex marriage, with more support among Democrats than Republicans. It found that 83 percent of Democrats support same-sex marriage, 74 percent of independents, and 46 percent of Republicans.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said in a X, formerly Twitter, post in 2022 following the passage of Respect of Marriage Act: \"The bill ensures federal recognition of marriage regardless of the sex, race, ethnicity, or national origin of either spouse. The bill does not, however, codify the right of same-sex couples to marry in all 50 states, as the Supreme Court deemed constitutionally required in Obergefell v. Hodges. If Obergefell is overturned, states would still be able to deny marriage licenses to LGBTQ couples.\"\n\nIdaho Representative Heather Scott said at the January hearing, per The Idaho Stateman: \"The purpose of this resolution is just to affirm our state authority to regulate marriage.\"\n\nBullard's bill is pending review in the Oklahoma Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee, which will determine whether it advances to the Appropriations Committee.\n\nAs of now, there is no case before the Supreme Court directly seeking to overturn Obergefell .\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nMandy Taheri is a Newsweek reporter based in Brooklyn.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nI'll get right to the point: conservatives, if you want to \"own the libs,\" then own the issue that they have dominated for too long. Take the lead on good climate policy and show how free market solutions are superior to progressives' proposals.\n\nIn politics, there are parties that come to \"own\" certain issues. For decades, conservatives owned foreign policy. The Right (and to be fair, a number of liberals agreed) set good policies in place that defeated the Soviet Union without the need to fight a hot war.\n\nFor their part, liberals have come to own environmental issues. That is a problem in a two-party system, but it is also an opportunity for Republicans . I'll say it again: if you want to \"own the libs,\" then own the issue that they have dominated for too long. Take the lead on good climate policy and show how your solutions are superior to theirs.\n\nTo be sure, we can and should continue to understand climate science better, and there's much we still need to learn. But one thing we already know without a doubt is that energy and innovation are good for people and the planet.\n\nThe best solutions, and the ones conservatives can and should lead on, are based on maximizing economic freedom across the economy .\n\nA system rooted in economic freedom generates more wealth for individuals and societies , allowing them to invest more in protecting the environment. In recent years the U.S. has been backing away from its support for economic freedom, but we can change all that as part of making our country greater \"again.\"\n\nIf economic freedom is the best solution to environmental problems, why not own the issue?\n\nThe best climate policy empowers people to choose, companies to innovate, and markets to move based on supply and demand rather than government fiat. The best climate policy respects consumer choice , competition, private property rights, and the rule of law. The best climate policy lowers barriers to adopting natural, practical solutions that are good for the climate, and especially for our food, water, and national security. The best climate policy recognizes the practical reality that every form of energy has tradeoffs and that there's no single perfect solution. The best climate policy ensures that as we transition to a cleaner energy future, we must ensure that energy is not only cleaner, but also abundant, reliable, and affordable, while also strengthening our national security.\n\nThe worst climate policy tries (but always fails) to pick winners and losers and ends up with people and the planet being the biggest losers in the end.\n\nThe Right can own the issue of climate change, and thus \"own the libs,\" by lowering taxes, lowering regulatory barriers, investing in research, fixing government failures, and accelerating American energy innovation across the board. The immediate expensing for research and development and equipment upgrades included in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act brought several environmental benefits and spurred investment and innovation in the United States. Modernizing permitting, which President Donald Trump prioritized while in office, would increase energy supplies and bring projects online faster, which helps everything from advanced nuclear energy to critical mineral mines. A return to these policies would be great for America, great for the planet, and great for people around the world.\n\nAmerica is already dominating in energy and innovation across many fronts. We are leading the world in energy innovation in everything from natural gas fracking and liquefied natural gas exports ( which Biden sadly \"paused\" ) to solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower, and new nuclear and AI for nuclear . We are the world's leading innovators in construction and concrete, carbon capture and use for products and regenerative farming, and even using methane for fertilizer . The list goes on and on and on. The U.S. energy portfolio is the world's greatest and most varied. It is one area where American greatness has never wavered.\n\nWe can all make, and keep, America great by supporting economic freedom and enjoying the environmental improvements it delivers. The best climate policies are good for people and the planet.\n\nBecause we have the best policies, conservatives have more than earned the right to own the issue.

      "text": "Do Young Conservatives Still Care About the Free Market?\n\nConservatism\n\nEmma Camp | 3.2.2023 5:35 PM\n\nIn recent years, the Republican Party has taken an undeniable turn away from its commitment to small government and free market economics. While the left and right are growing ever further apart on social issues, the two sides have inched closer on economics, with both parties supporting increased government spending and protectionist policies.\n\nBut what about young conservative voters? Do they share the same suspicion of the free, unencumbered markets?\n\nOf the dozen young conservative voters Reason interviewed at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), a significant majority voiced waning support for free market values, instead favoring regulation, protectionism, and cultural war zeal to battle abortion, \"wokeness\" in schools, \"cancel culture,\" and globalism.\n\n\"There has been a rethinking throughout the movement of the laissez faire-style economics. And that rethinking is to use more regulation toward things that Republicans feel are targeting them,\" said Zachary Wanuga, a senior at Salisbury University. \"So, for instance, Republicans are for free markets, they're against breaking up businesses and regulating them. However, they're taking a different approach now to the issue of Big Tech censorship, and they would like to see more censorship, they would like to see regulation.\"\n\nJacob Ashley, a 19-year-old student at Ohio Northern University, repeated the sentiment. \"I tend more nationalistic and 'America First' than opening up the free market completely,\" said Ashley. \"Globalization has done some damage, particularly to our culture and national identity.\"\n\nSupport for protectionist policies often collided with a broader alignment with conservative cultural values. \"Having policies that are going to limit [artificial intelligence] taking over blue-collar jobs I think is important. And ideally returning to a place where we can have families be supported on one income,\" said Conor Coutts, a 26-year-old communications manager at The College Fix , a conservative student publication. \"I'm certainly a capitalist, but I think some reasonable reform and restrictions are needed.\"\n\nFor most of the young CPAC attendees interviewed by Reason , economics takes a backseat to social issues. Not only did they consistently cite social issues like abortion and \"cancel culture\" as the issues they cared about most, but some even voiced a complete lack of interest in economic policy.\n\nOne community college student told Reason, \"It's not about money or jobs or fiscal conservatism\" but instead about \"upholding normal values, Christian values.\"\n\n\"Even compared to my generation, [Gen Z is], in my experience, more traditionally value-oriented, more traditionally conservative than even many conservatives or right-wing libertarians in my generation\" Aaron Miller, the 33-year-old county commissioner for Maury County, Texas, told Reason . Miller works with Run Gen Z, a group that mentors young conservative candidates for political office. \"Whereas free market policy has generally been at the forefront of the conservative movement, it's taken more of a backseat among Gen Z,\" Miller added.\n\nFor young conservatives who lean libertarian, this dynamic can often be frustrating.\n\n\"I think we really need to turn back toward lassiez faire and free market economics,\" said Jacob Tourville, the director of campus at Young Americans for Liberty. \"I think the rise in Trumpism is a major contributor to that.\"\n\nMost Republicans \"only expand the size of government, they never reduce it,\" Sammi Neves, a 22-year-old at Emerson College who identified his politics as \"in the middle\" of conservative and libertarian.\n\nShunning the free market in favor of protectionist policies and government regulation is increasingly popular on the left and the right. \"At a time of polarization, you might expect the right to react by doubling down on support for free markets and private property,\" wrote Stephanie Slade in Reason 's October 2022 issue. \"Instead, concurrent with democratic socialism's ascendance, many prominent conservatives have taken a leftward turn of their own.\"\n\nWith the current culture war continuing to heat up, a commitment to free market economic policy seems to be losing its allure for many young conservatives. When protectionism can be levied to achieve culture war ends, it seems all the more attractive.\n\nAs Noah Kitzman-a 23-year-old from Kalamazoo, Michigan-told Reason , \"Capitalism with morality is desperately needed.\"\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Conservatives Pushing 'Common Good Capitalism' Sound a Lot Like Progressives\n\nBig Government\n\nVeronique de Rugy | 5.18.2023 1:25 PM\n\n\"Common good capitalism\" is all the rage these days with national conservatives. But what exactly is it, you may ask? That's a good question. As far as I can tell, it's a lovely sounding name for imposing one's preferred economic and social policies on Americans while pretending to be \"improving\" capitalism. If common good capitalism's criticisms of the free market and prescriptions for its improvement were ice cream, it would be identical in all but its serving container to what much of the left has been dishing up for decades.\n\nThe wider adoption of the term Common Good Capitalism (CGC) can be traced back to a speech given by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) at Catholic University in 2019. While there are different strains of common good capitalism, they all have in common the goal of producing a more balanced and stable economy that better serves the nation and its people.\n\nThe common good is, of course, a vague and subjective concept, the details of which are hard to pin down. Its advocates claim it's an alternative form of conservative governance meant to promote things like tradition, workers' dignity, religion, order, and families, rather than the singular free market focus of personal liberties and economic freedom. How exactly government policies will be used to mold capitalism into achieving these goals-many of which go further than economics-is unclear. This haziness explains why those defending common good capitalism usually do so only by listing what they see as wrong with the free market, rather than by giving their audiences specific details.\n\nFor instance, common-good advocates' complaints about no-prefix capitalism often include excessive income inequality caused by greedy, cosmopolitan capitalists who heartlessly offshore jobs to low-wage foreign countries, or gripes about corporations somehow simultaneously charging monopolistically high prices that hurt consumers and low prices that threaten small firms and damage local communities. I wouldn't blame you if you thought these complaints were coming from the likes of Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).\n\nWhile I don't dismiss some of their complaints about the underperformance of the economy-specifically the hardships suffered by some workers and families-common good capitalists make the same mistakes as their counterparts on the left. They start by mistaking problems caused by government intervention for problems inherent in the free market. They end by offering up even more government interventions as supposed solutions.\n\nIt's striking to listen to CGC advocates act as if today's markets have been freed of all the fetters that I and other advocates of small government have warned about for decades. The size and scope of the government say otherwise. With $31 trillion in debt, more than $6 trillion in annual federal government spending, and a future 30-year government shortfall of $114 trillion, it's ludicrous to assert that the dominant governing philosophy in Washington over the past 50 years has been Milton Friedman-style market theory. Also contradicting the common-good capitalists' mythmaking is the well-documented burden imposed by the regulatory state at all levels of government.\n\nBut rather than demanding fewer government-erected barriers to exchange, employment, and housing affordability, the CGC crowd wants tariffs to obstruct consumers' access to inexpensive imports. They want to line the pockets of the firms they favor while punishing those they dislike. Further, these \"capitalists\" want to forbid the business practices that they think favor capital over labor, when in reality capital fuels innovation, hiring, and higher wages. And they want to make families artificially dependent on government design with policies such as federal mandated paid leave and extended child tax credits. These policies, of course, are favored also by the left.\n\nIn the end, CGC champions the same tired policies that big government types predictably propose whenever they see something they don't like. Industrial policy, export bans, and other forms of protectionism are, based on ample evidence, terrible for both economic resiliency and efficiency-and thus for workers and families. What's more, research suggests that giving relatively large amounts of money to parents without any strings attached disincentivizes work and makes more child poverty likely.\n\nAt every turn, common good capitalism implies a greater role for government in regulating and directing the market to achieve the fancies of common good capitalists. Who truly believes that such interventions won't result in more inefficiency, corruption, and political capture by special interests? I don't. I also worry that common good capitalists won't be interested in balancing the rights and the freedoms of those persons who disagree with their economic and social designs.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM .\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Will-to-Power Conservatism and the Great Liberalism Schism\n\nConservatism\n\nStephanie Slade | From the October 2020 issue\n\nIn the last few years, a major fault line has opened up on the American political right: Call it the Great Liberalism Schism. On one side are those of us who remain committed to classical liberal norms and values such as due process, free trade, and religious freedom. On the other side is an increasingly restless group of writers and thinkers at places like First Things and the Claremont Institute who say America has tried classical liberalism-and it failed us.\n\nThese \"post-liberals\" believe it's time for a conservative politics that stops worrying about protecting individual liberty and starts worrying about attaining the common good. Generally speaking, that means embracing \"strong rule\" by a government tasked, among other things, with \"enforcing duties of community and solidarity in the use and distribution of resources,\" as the Harvard law professor Adrian Vermeule put it in a March essay for The Atlantic .\n\nThere's nothing wrong with caring about the common good. It's just that the self-named Common-Good Conservatives don't have a monopoly on the idea.\n\nJust as there are many competing visions of the good life at an individual level, people frequently disagree about what a good society would look like. Most political leftists believe religiously affiliated employers should be required to pay for their workers' birth control-and the language they use in defense of that position and others like it is nothing if not moral. Yet most people on the political right see that understanding of the common good as utterly mistaken. In a democratic society, how do you ensure that only the correct vision is coercively enforced?\n\nAt a sufficiently high level, we can all agree the concept is tied to human flourishing. The Catechism of the Catholic Church defines the common good as \"the sum total of social conditions which allow people, either as groups or as individuals, to reach their fulfillment more fully and more easily.\" The dispute, then, is about how to help people thrive. For many of us, protecting individual liberty is crucial as both a component of and a requirement for achieving that goal.\n\nA free society is in itself a good thing. That doesn't mean freedom is the only good or even the highest good. But it is a good that must be included in any final accounting of the common good. To deny someone control over his own life is to assert your supremacy over him, violating his innate dignity as a person. The more coercion exercised, the greater the violation. While there may be pragmatic arguments against the institution of slavery, I trust we all recognize them as secondary. The first and most important reason to oppose human bondage, which is the opposite of human liberty, is that it's evil. A freer society is a better society, all else being equal.\n\nBut freedom isn't just a component of the common good. It's a prerequisite for other components as well.\n\nAny list of the social conditions that promote human flourishing would certainly include things like justice for all and material abundance . When classical liberals emphasize institutions such as due process and free trade, it's precisely because we see them as means to these ends. Hence libertarians' seeming preoccupation with what the economist Deirdre McCloskey has termed the \"Great Enrichment\" of the last 250 years.\n\nClassical liberals are not always comfortable employing common-good terminology, but creating the conditions under which people can thrive is undeniably the endgame of the classical liberal project. \"We consider cooperation so essential to human flourishing that we don't just want to talk about it,\" wrote Cato Institute executive vice president David Boaz in his 2015 book The Libertarian Mind (Simon & Schuster). \"We want to create social institutions that make it possible. That is what property rights, limited government, and the rule of law are all about.\"\n\nBut if the so-called Common-Good Conservatives are not alone in their concern for the common good, then their chosen moniker obscures what differentiates them rather than illuminating it. What might be a better appellation for this group? I suggest, to borrow a concept from German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche about human beings' natural desire to expand and dominate, they would more accurately be described as Will-to-Power Conservatives.\n\nIn 1651, Thomas Hobbes described the precivilizational state of nature as \"a war of all against all.\" It appears some people believe the introduction of rule of law did little to alter that fact. New York Post opinion editor Sohrab Ahmari, in a now-infamous 2019 essay for First Things , called upon conservatives to accept the hard truth \"of politics as war and enmity.\" All societies have rulers, the Will-to-Power Conservatives seem to be saying; what matters above all else is ensuring that our tribe is dominant.\n\nDon't take my word for it. In a recent symposium published by The American Conservative , editor of American Affairs Julius Krein (echoing his colleague Gladden Pappin) complains that \"contemporary conservatism\" lacks \"a serious approach to wielding political power.\" Hillsdale College's David Azerrad argues that conservatives must learn to be \"manly,\" \"combative,\" and \"comfortable\" using \"the levers of state power...to reward friends and punish enemies.\" And Claremont's Matthew J. Peterson insists that \"conservatism must not merely make arguments...it must act on them, wielding 'regime-level' power in the service of good political order to do so.\"\n\nAhmari in his 2019 essay mocked classical liberals' \"great horror of the state, of traditional authority and the use of the public power to advance the common good.\" He went on to urge conservatives to \"fight the culture war with the aim of defeating the enemy and enjoying the spoils.\"\n\nAnd what would the Will-to-Power Conservatives do with state control once acquired? The specifics vary from person to person, but the policy agenda can be characterized as right-wing on social issues (blue laws; crackdowns on pornography) and left-wing on economics (industrial subsidies; generous unemployment insurance). At the nexus of the two are proposals to use the tax code to encourage larger families, in which women preferably work less outside the home.\n\nThat formulation-socially conservative and fiscally liberal-may seem to have an uncanny valley quality, because it's the inverse of a common shorthand description of libertarianism. The Will-to-Power Conservatives make no bones about that: Their aim is \"to challenge the moral-cultural dominance of radical liberal individualism,\" writes Krein. It is collectivist, if not authoritarian, by design.\n\nClassical liberals seek a world in which everyone is free to live out his own conception of the good so long as he abstains from forcibly interfering with others' ability to do the same. We're therefore just as concerned with defending a person's right to view pornography or buy alcohol on Sundays (to the chagrin of some traditionalists) as we are with defending an employer's right not to be involved in the provision of his workers' birth control (to the chagrin of many leftists). One's freedom, as far as the law is concerned, does not depend on his using it to do what's objectively moral.\n\nFor Will-to-Power Conservatives, just the opposite is true: By virtue of representing the correct vision of the good, they say, they have every right to use the coercive power of the state to interfere with others' choices. In place of equal rights under the law , it's error has no rights . This is no way to achieve the common good.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Conservatives Embrace Anti-Discrimination Principles\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nDiscrimination\n\nIlya Somin | 6.28.2022 1:46 PM\n\nIn the twentieth century, anti-discrimination law was largely pioneered by the political left. What started as a campaign to restrict racial discrimination gradually expanded to other categories, such as sex discrimination, discrimination against people with disabilities, discrimination based on sexual orientation, and so on. By and large, these expansions were advocated by left-liberals, and often opposed by conservatives, or at least viewed with suspicion by them.\n\nMore recently, however, the political right has tried to use anti-discrimination principles to its own advantage, in a wide range of policy areas. Walter Olson of the Cato Institute recently wrote an insightful piece on this subject:\n\n[T]he Supreme Court yesterday ruled [in Carson v. Makin ] that the state of Maine violated the Constitution when it excluded schools that engage in religious instruction from an otherwise generally available program of tuition assistance payments to parents....\n\nIt's been widely observed that religious‐liberty litigators have been on a winning streak lately, but it is worth noting specifically how many of those cases have been won by framing each dispute in terms of anti‐discrimination principles. Masterpiece Cakeshop and Fulton v. Philadelphia come to mind, but also the Court's string of rulings in favor of churches against local COVID restrictions on grounds that they were not treated as well as one or another secular institution.\n\nTo some extent this must reflect the simple truth that anti‐discrimination principles have become a ruling theme both in law and in public life generally, exceedingly hard to argue against. If you can successfully invoke them you're well on the way to winning an argument.\n\nExamples from the progressive side are legion. But conservatives too are now apt to couch gripes about, say, social media moderation in terms of discrimination. Companies with a no‐guns‐on‐premises rule are \"discriminating\" against gun‐owning employees, we've heard .\n\nAnd so on. Why, it was asked, should cruise ship lines or nurse staffing agencies be permitted to engage in \"discrimination\" toward the unvaccinated?\n\nAs Walter notes, in addition to the well-known religious liberty cases hinging on government discrimination against religious people and institutions, conservatives have also sought to use the law to curb real or imagined discrimination against right-wing speakers on social media sites, gun owners, and the unvaccinated. The conservative campaign against affirmative action, of course, has long hinged on the argument that affirmative action policies unjustly and illegally discriminate against whites and Asians. But these other conservative uses of anti-discrimination principles emerged more recently, and represent a major expansion of the use of anti-discrimination theory by the political right.\n\nI think some of the conservative \"appropriations\" of anti-discrimination theory are well-justified. For example, I very much support Carson v. Makin and other rulings barring government discrimination based on religion. My main complaint about the conservative approach to this issue is the double standard that leads them to turn a blind eye to religious discrimination in immigration policy, most obviously when it comes to Donald Trump's anti-Muslim travel bans . The conservative case against affirmative action also has a lot of merit, particularly when it comes to the specious \"diversity\" rationale embraced by many universities , and many educational institutions' discrimination against Asian students .\n\nOn the other hand, I am very much opposed to conservative efforts to force unwilling private property owners to allow guns on their land (see also here ), and to the conservative campaign to force social media firms to host speech they disapprove of . The former violates the constitutional rights of property owners , and the latter is a menace to freedom of speech . Similarly, I think vaccination mandates are entirely justified in some situations, and that - at the very least - private institutions should be free to impose vaccination requirements as a condition of employment or of entry onto their land.\n\nBut whether justifiably or not, it is clear that anti-discrimination principles are no longer a preserve of the left. Conservatives have taken them up with a vengeance!\n\nOne interesting question is how far will this process go? Will conservatives follow liberals in expanding anti-discrimination rules to new categories? The attempts to add gun owners and the unvaccinated to the list of protected groups are already steps in that direction. Will the right also try to add other groups to the list?\n\nIn the 1960s and 70s, the left famously moved from promoting traditional nondiscrimination, to advocating affirmative action for historically discriminated against minorities. The argument was that affirmative action was essential to remedy past discrimination and to promote diversity in various institutions. Will conservatives imitate this innovation?\n\nIt's not hard to imagine how they might do so. Consider the following argument:\n\nUniversity X has long discriminated against conservatives. Given this history of institutionalized exclusion, formal equality is not enough to overcome the entrenched legacy of bias. In order to get beyond ideological discrimination, we must first take account of ideology [this, of course, is an adaptation of Justice Blackmun's famous statement that \"In order to get beyond racism, we must first take account of race\"]. Thus, we must have affirmative action in hiring for conservative professors, and affirmative action in admissions for conservative students. It can be phased out only after we have a \"critical mass\" of conservatives large enough to ensure that fellow conservatives feel welcome on campus, and other students are exposed to their distinctive perspectives.\n\nThis kind of argument can also be applied to the exclusion of gun owners, evangelical Christians, and other groups associated with the political right, at various institutions. Right-wing adoption of affirmative action for their preferred groups would be in serious tension with their position on racial and gender affirmative action. Perhaps that tension will preclude any such move. On the other hand, logical consistency is far from a high priority for political movements these days.\n\nThe right could also potentially adopt \"disparate impact\" theory, the idea that seemingly neutral practices are discriminatory because they disproportionately affect a particular group. For example, many on the left argue that the use of standardized tests in university admissions should be curtailed, because some minority groups score lower, on average, than whites. Conservatives could similarly argue that some seemingly neutral policies must be restricted because they disproportionately affect evangelical Christians, gun owners, Republicans, and so on.\n\nWhile expansions of anti-discrimination principles are sometimes justified, Walter Olson rightly worries that too great an emphasis on anti-discrimination can have negative effects:\n\n[S]omething is often lost in the pressure to re‐couch claims as equality claims. Sometimes what's really on our mind is something else - individual liberty, rights of self‐defense or bodily integrity, fair process, institutions that work.\n\nIn the religious freedom context, there is a strong logic to the idea that the Free Exercise Clause implies a robust principle that churches and their institutions may not be singled out for worse treatment as against otherwise comparable entities. But that's just one component of free exercise; there have to be others.... [P]arents' right to direct the religious upbringing of their children is a basic component of free exercise encroached upon by the Maine law. To take a different example, the Court has recognized in the Hosanna‐Tabor line of cases that free exercise requires the state to respect churches' internal autonomy, quite aside from equality concerns about whether it treats secular institutions the same way.\n\nMaybe churchgoers want freedom of worship for its own sake, not because they want to ensure churches are treated at least as well as drugstores in COVID regulations. Maybe fairness and benefit to kids are even better arguments for school choice in Maine than equality! But - in today's climate of jurisprudence - we may not get a chance to find out any time soon.\n\nI would add that one key limitation of anti-discrimination principles is that a violation of them can usually be remedied by \"leveling down.\" If it is unjust that some benefit or right is only available to Group X, but not Groups Y and Z, we can fix that by taking it away from X! In the wake of Carson v. Makin , Maine could comply with the Supreme Court's ruling simply by terminating vouchers for all private schools, whether religious or not.\n\nThat approach is fine when it comes to programs that aren't important, or shouldn't exist in the first place. But it's problematic if what's at stake is some vital right. In that event, the right thing to do is to \"level up\" by making the benefit or right available to everyone. In my view , this is the only just solution to the problem of racial and ethnic discrimination in immigration and refugee policy. But anti-discrimination principles can't get us there by themselves. Indeed, if we assume that discrimination is the only wrong at issue, \"leveling down\" will often look like an attractive option, even if it might actually exacerbate the wrong more than alleviate it.\n\nDespite such potential downsides, the conservative embrace of anti-discrimination is unlikely to stop anytime soon. Sometimes it has good effects, and other times not. It will be interesting to see how far it will go - and how progressives react to it.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Republicans pounce\n\nThe phrase \"Republicans pounce\" (or related phrases, such as \"conservatives pounce\" or \"seize\" ) is a term used by some conservative commentators in the United States to illustrate media bias against Republicans and conservatives . These commentators have argued that journalists downplay controversies and potentially negative stories about Democrats , liberals , and progressives by emphasizing the Republican or conservative response, rather than the negative aspects of the stories themselves. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ]\n\nAnalyses of U.S. news stories have shown that the \"pounces\" phrasing is used with roughly equal frequency to refer to Republicans and Democrats, while acknowledging the difficulty of measuring the phenomenon qualitatively. [ 1 ] [ 2 ]\n\nAccording to an analysis by Washington Post reporter Aaron Blake, the use of the \"pounce\" framing \"appears to be pretty bipartisan in its implementation.\" Searching U.S. newspapers and wire services between 2010 and 2019, Blake found 1,732 instances of Democrats or liberals \"pouncing,\" versus 1,427 instances of Republicans or conservatives doing the same. However, he cautioned that this approach had several limitations: it did not survey cable news ; it did not include similar verbs such as \"seize on\"; and it did not assess the severity of the controversy being \"pounced\" upon. [ 1 ]\n\nWall Street Journal editor James Freeman describes the term as a \"long-running joke among right-leading media skeptics\", but found little evidence to back it up. In a 2019 search of the Factiva news archive, he discovered 311 occurrences of the phrasing \"Democrats pounce,\" compared with 245 occurrences of \"Republicans pounce.\" While this suggested that the framing has been applied more toward Democrats, Freeman acknowledged that the phenomenon was \"difficult to measure qualitatively.\" [ 2 ]\n\nBlake identifies a 1933 New York Times article \"Revived Republicans Pounce on Democrats\" as one of the first occurrences of this phrasing in print, but says that the overwhelming majority of \"Republicans pounce\" headlines in the Times or The Washington Post have been printed in the 21st century.

[ 2 ] Commentary writer Noah Rothman argues that the \"Republicans pounce\" construction benefits Democrats, using the 2015 story \"Republicans seize on Planned Parenthood video \" in The Hill as an example. [ 6 ] Washington Examiner editor Nicholas Clairmont says that the use of the \"Republicans pounce\" trope is a form of \" othering \" by journalists, although not necessarily deliberate or inaccurate. [ 7 ]\n\nNational Review political correspondent Jim Geraghty has criticized \"Republicans pounce\" headlines for contributing to political polarization, saying that such headlines give the public a \"psychological permission slip\" to ignore legitimate issues or scandals based on who is criticizing them. [ 8 ] Another National Review writer, Charles C. W. Cooke , linked \"Republicans pounce\" to media coverage suggesting that Republican politicians are engaging in \" culture wars .\" [ 9 ]\n\nMother Jones writer Kevin Drum said that the claims Republicans made about the term were difficult to prove. He observed that only limited conclusions can be drawn from simple keyword searches, writing: \"What we really need to know is whether Republicans suffer more than Democrats from a general framing that focuses on the opposition response instead of the initial miscue.\" [ 10 ]"

      "text": "Conservatives Turn Further Against War-Except Maybe With Mexico\n\nCPAC\n\nJoe Lancaster | 3.3.2023 4:50 PM\n\nAt the nation's largest gathering of conservatives, many seem to be turning against the prospect of American military interventions-at least overseas.\n\nAs part of her speech at the 2023 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) took aim at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. According to Greene, \"He said he wants our sons and daughters to go die [fighting] in Ukraine.\" She pledged \"no money to Ukraine\" and said, \"that country needs to find peace, not war.\" To Zelenskyy, \"You better leave your hands off our sons and daughters because they're not dying over there.\"\n\nGreene made the same claim earlier this week on Twitter , based on an out-of-context statement: Speaking of a hypothetical Russian attack against a NATO member state, Zelenskyy said the U.S. would send its \"sons and daughters\" to fight. Ukraine is not a member of NATO. Under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, an attack on one member state could spawn a request for military assistance from other members. But after her speech, in an appearance at the Real America's Voice broadcasting booth, Greene and Steve Bannon clarified that the U.S. should not acquiesce to American soldier involvement in conflict over NATO states either.\n\nThe forthrightness of Greene's position marks a noticeable shift from conservatives of years past: After all, the only country to ever invoke Article 5 was the United States. Under a Republican president, the U.S. launched multiple wars against Middle Eastern nations under the rubric of a global war on terror after the September 11 attacks. But conservatives in the last few years have shifted away from the Republican Party's past militarism, and it showed in the speeches of the party's 2024 candidates.\n\nFormer South Carolina governor and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, who recently announced a run for the presidency, addressed CPAC on Friday. She refrained from any foreign policy specifics other than to say that \"we need our military to be stronger than ever,\" as \"a strong military doesn't start wars, a strong military prevents wars.\"\n\nFormer Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was another CPAC speaker who is expected to announce a presidential run. Like Haley's, Pompeo's speech was short on foreign policy specifics other than to tout his own achievements as a West Point cadet and as an Army officer. He spoke of the need for military-style \"victory\" but against enemies like \"wokeness\" rather than any particular geopolitical foe.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump announced his own reelection candidacy in November. Last month, Politico reported that Trump intended to run as an anti-war alternative to candidates like Haley and Pompeo.\n\nGiven that the post-9/11 military incursions resulted in the two longest wars in American history, we should welcome conservative skepticism toward flexing America's military might. But that's not the entire story.\n\nRepublicans often blame Mexican drug cartels and American border policy for American fentanyl deaths. Greene advocated targeting cartels by bombing Mexico, a clear act of war against another nation. Vivek Ramaswamy, who recently announced a candidacy for president as a Republican, pledged that as president he would use \"military force to decimate the cartels, Osama bin Laden-style.\"\n\nDuring a 2022 debate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) said the U.S. should \"declare the Mexican drug cartels a terrorist organization,\" a designation which he alleged \"allows our military to go to Mexico...and actually do battle with them.\"\n\nAnd earlier this year, Reps. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) and Mike Waltz (R-Fla.) introduced an Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) to target cartels. The U.S. Congress has yet to repeal the AUMFs still in effect since both 2001 and 2002-not to mention the AUMFs from 1991 and 1957-but some Republicans want to pass yet another one. While Waltz said this AUMF would not authorize soldiers, the 21st century is full of presidents using AUMFs in ways other than for their intended purpose.\n\nWhile a conservative skepticism toward military aggression would be welcome, Republican standard-bearers are all too happy to sign off on war powers in other ways.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

Ron DeSantis skipped this year's Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), but his ideas were still on display.\n\nConservatives and Republican officeholders gathered in the Washington, D.C., area for the first time since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Featured among the schedule of events and appearances was one talk titled \"Big Tech- Break 'em Up, Bust 'em Up, Put 'em in Jail.\" Panelists included Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.), Florida attorney general Ashley Moody, and former Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), who served nearly two decades in the U.S. House before resigning in order to serve as CEO of Truth Social, former President Donald Trump's social media service.\n\nWhile nominally about Big Tech companies and their role in everyday Americans' lives, the discussion touched on Section 230, the 1996 law that protects online platforms from legal liability for most content their users post. It allowed the internet to grow from nascency to ubiquity, but politicians on both the right and the left think it should be reformed or simply repealed.\n\nEach panelist has an unimpressive pedigree on free speech and internet freedom. Braun cosponsored the 21st Century FREE Speech Act , which would have replaced Section 230 with \"more limited protections.\" While in Congress, Nunes filed numerous lawsuits alleging hundreds of millions of dollars in defamation claims against people and personalities who said mean things about him on Twitter. And Moody, as Florida's top law enforcement official, is defending the state's blatantly unconstitutional social media law which DeSantis championed as \"guarantee[ing] protection against the Silicon Valley elites.\"\n\nOn stage, the panelists complained about Section 230 and its effect on the internet. Braun complained that \"Most of us do not get the benefit of having laws put in your favor-everybody else can get sued for whatever they do wrong,\" implying that tech companies cannot.\n\nWhen asked to explain Section 230, Moody mischaracterized the law, saying it allows platforms to \"publish information and not be held liable.\" The law does protect platforms from liability for what users post: If you publish information to a website, then you can be held liable for the content. The entire purpose of Section 230 is to place the liability on whoever created that content. If somebody posts something defamatory on Facebook or Twitter, then Facebook or Twitter cannot be held liable because they were not responsible for crafting the message.\n\nThe panel's moderator, Dan Schneider of the Media Research Center, lauded that all three panelists were \"fighting...the good fight.\" Unfortunately, all of the panelists misunderstood what Section 230 does and what it's good for.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Conservatives Say They Care About the Constitution. Until They Talk About Criminal Justice.\n\nConservatism\n\nSteven Greenhut | 4.8.2022 8:00 AM\n\nGOP senators who are attacking President Joe Biden's Supreme Court pick seem weirdly unaware of how our justice system works. By focusing in part on Ketanji Brown Jackson's former role as a criminal defense attorney, they act as if it's wrong to provide a defense to people accused of a crime-and that if the government levels a charge, it must be right.\n\nHey, if you haven't done anything wrong, you have nothing to fear-or something like that. \"Like any attorney who has been in any kind of practice, they are going to have to answer for the clients they represented and the arguments they made,\" Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said in reference to Jackson and other Biden nominees. Apparently, defense attorneys should only defend choirboys.\n\nYet I guarantee if Hawley-known for his fist pump in support of Jan. 6 protestors at the U.S. Capitol-became the target of an overzealous prosecutor who accused him of inciting an insurrection, he'd be happy to have a competent defense attorney to advocate on his behalf. That attorney shouldn't be forever stained for defending someone as loathsome as Hawley.\n\nThese hearings remind me of how difficult it is to have a calm debate about criminal-justice policy-and how tilted our system is on the side of the government. As the Christian Science Monitor pointed out , if confirmed Jackson will be the nation's first Supreme Court justice to have served as a public defender, with Thurgood Marshall being the last justice to have criminal defense experience.\n\nMarshall was born when Theodore Roosevelt was president and retired 31 years ago. A study last year by the libertarian Cato Institute found the Trump administration's judicial appointments tilted in favor of prosecutors over those who represented individuals by a 10-to-one margin. Only 14 percent of the liberal Obama administration's appointees defended individuals. Most judges strive to be fair, but their backgrounds color their worldview.\n\nThat brings us to district attorneys. Most people believe their role is to secure convictions, but that's not entirely the case. \"The primary duty of the prosecutor is to seek justice within the bounds of the law, not merely to convict,\" the American Bar Association explains . They are required to \"protect the innocent and convict the guilty, consider the interests of victims and witnesses, and respect the constitutional and legal rights of all persons.\"\n\nIn reality, DAs are ambitious political animals. As the Jackson hearings exemplify, it's much easier to get confirmed as a judge or elected prosecutor by playing the tough-on-crime card for the obvious reason that the public is fearful of crime-especially now, as long-falling crime rates are headed in the wrong direction . It's tougher for a DA to succeed by pledging a commitment to justice and balance.\n\nFor decades, prosecutors have been closely aligned with police unions, which partially explains why it's been so hard to hold accountable officers who engage even in egregious misbehavior or who are overly aggressive. Traditionally, it's been difficult for a district attorney to win an election without the backing of those unions, which represent rank-and-file officers.\n\nThat spurred a well-funded movement to begin electing \"progressive prosecutors\" -mainly in big, liberal cities with large populations of poorer people who have been on the receiving end of our justice system. Unfortunately, these DAs have gone too far in the other direction.\n\nFor instance, Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón initially banned \"prosecutors from seeking the death penalty or life sentences without the possibility of parole, while also severely limiting the way prosecutors could use sentencing enhancements,\" the Los Angeles Times reported . He also refused to sentence juveniles as adults.\n\nHe's changed course amid a backlash. But by imposing hard-and-fast policies rather than seeking out the just response in each case, Gascón's approach is the mirror image of a Neanderthal prosecutor who was hard wired to always be tough. Likewise, San Francisco DA Chesa Boudin is accused of refusing to prosecute many serious crimes that are turning his city into a scene from Road Warrior.\n\nTraditional prosecutors have overcharged people, winked at police abuse and filled the prisons with people who ought not to be there. But these liberal prosecutors have pursued an ideological agenda that has failed to consider legitimate public fears of dangerous criminals. They forget economist Adam Smith's quotation , \"Mercy to the guilty is cruelty to the innocent.\"\n\nOur nation is finally-albeit clumsily-debating justice policy. Even in law-and-order Orange County, the DA's race is pitting two candidates, incumbent Todd Spitzer and challenger Pete Hardin, who at least claim to seek some middle ground. Their race isn't more edifying than the Jackson hearings, as they prefer to trade race- and sex-related allegations rather than focus on the fundamentals of the job.\n\nMaybe someday soon, DAs and justices can apply to the justice system the Goldilocks Principle -not too hot, not too cold, but just right.\n\nThis column was first published in The Orange County Register.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "The Fight Conservatives Are Having Over Theocracy and Classical Liberalism Obscures How Beaten Their Movement Is\n\nConservatism\n\nNick Gillespie | 6.7.2019 4:25 PM\n\nWatching an ugly, name-calling rift on the right between theocratic Catholics on the one hand and classical-liberalish evangelicals on the other, you could be forgiven for thinking that the conservative movement still has some intellectual life left in it. In the scant week since New York Post op-ed editor Sohrab Ahmari attacked what he called \"David French-ism\" in a bilious article for First Things , the internet has exploded with dozens of pieces on the matter, including a long column in The New York Times by Ross Douthat, a detailed explainer in Vox by Jane Coaston, and an hour-long discussion of the stakes on a recent Reason podcast featuring Katherine Mangu-Ward, Peter Suderman, Matt Welch, and me.\n\nBut the deeper effect of the ideological slap fight is to underscore how social conservatives have lost essentially every culture-war battle they have prosecuted since the modern conservative movement got started with the launch of National Review in 1955. Whether they want to use power of the state to compel or restrict certain behaviors (as Ahmari argues) or believe they can win debates in a noncoercive marketplace of ideas (as National Review 's David French, the specific target of Ahmari's ire, posits), both sides have wanted the same basic social and cultural outcomes over the past several decades, including a rejection of marriage equality, a ban on abortion except to save the life of the mother, the continued prohibition of most or all currently illicit drugs, an end to no-fault divorce, restrictions on the number and variety of immigrants, tighter controls on whatever they deem to be obscenity and pornography, a bigger role for religion in the public square, and an embrace of what they consider to be traditional sexual mores, marriage conventions, and gender roles.\n\nThe most you can say is that conservatives may have slowed down social trends, thus validating National Review founder William F. Buckley's cri de guerre that conservatives existed to \" stand athwart history, yelling Stop .\" In the mid-1950s, Buckley targeted \"liberal orthodoxy\" and \"relativism\" as the immediate domestic enemies to be engaged. Writing a few months after the 9/11 attacks and after the capture of John Walker Lindh, the \"American Taliban\" soldier who was raised by hippies in Marin County and captured fighting against U.S. forces in Afghanistan, National Review 's Jonah Goldberg identified \"cultural libertarianism\" as the real problem:\n\nCultural libertarianism basically says that whatever ideology, religion, cult, belief, creed, fad, hobby, or personal fantasy you like is just fine so long as you don't impose it on anybody else, especially with the government. You want to be a Klingon? Great! Attend the Church of Satan? Hey man, if that does it for ya, go for it. You want to be a \"Buddhist for Jesus\"? Sure, mix and match, man; we don't care. Hell, you can even be an observant Jew, a devout Catholic or a faithful Baptist, or a lifelong heroin addict-they're all the same, in the eyes of a cultural libertarian. Just remember: Keep it to yourself if you can. Don't claim that being a Lutheran is any better than being a member of the Hale-Bopp cult, and never use the government to advance your view. If you can do that, then-whatever floats your boat.\n\nAs I argued at the time (and continue to do so), this is a serious misrepresentation of libertarian thought, especially regarding the right to question and critique the sagacity of other people's freely chosen decisions. (Any meeting of 10 libertarians will yield twice as many opinions about any topic.) For instance, granting freedom of religion, a core libertarian and classical liberal value, in no way implies that you're not allowed to question other people's theology or life choices. If anything, it may demand it. The same goes for the choices that particular businesses make. I believe that as a matter of law, Facebook and YouTube should have the right to adopt whatever content-regulation policies they wish, but that hardly stops me or anyone else from criticizing their specific choices, many of which are stupid beyond words.\n\nBut Goldberg was right to identify libertarianism, rather than liberalism or even progressivism, as the true engine of social change. Thanks to the rise of cheaper and better means of self-expression (most notably the internet), American cultural production and consumption has boomed and everything become more individualized and personalized. Since Goldberg's column, it seems inarguable that American culture has evolved in an increasingly libertarian direction, one that grants the individual, rather than the group, what Friedrich Hayek called in The Road to Serfdom \"the opportunity of knowing and choosing different forms of life.\" Even in an age of political correctness, one in which governments, corporations, and social movements are constantly trying to surveil, nudge, and scold people into particular types of approved or \"appropriate\" behavior, we all continue to be that scourge of 17th-century England, masterless men and women who refuse to conform to what our political and social betters demand of us.\n\nOn the issues that conservatives especially care about, we are becoming increasingly secular , accepting of same-sex marriage , and welcoming toward immigrants even as support for abortion rights remains strong and steady . The recent spate of highly restrictive abortion laws in states such as Alabama moved no less a social con than 700 Club host Pat Robertson to say , \"I think Alabama has gone too far...I think it's an extreme law.\" Far from indicating a groundswell in support, such laws, which will all be challenged on legal grounds and almost certainly struck down, suggest the death throes of a social movement that knows it no has chance of success.\n\nWe can put too much weight on coincidences, but it's striking to me that just as internecine warfare was breaking out among social conservatives, Jonah Goldberg filed his final column for National Review , where he worked for the past 21 years. He had previously announced that he and former Weekly Standard editor Steve Hayes were starting a new venture that is slated to come online later this year. Goldberg is hardly a stand-in for all of conservatism, but he is surely one of the most thoughtful and representative voices of that broad movement. (So, too, is Hayes, and the weirdly rapid demise of The Weekly Standard is one more indicator that the conservative movement has serious problems.) While conceding that he doesn't think \"Sohrab's utopian society, if achievable, would be such a terrible place,\" Goldberg embraces something that sounds more than a little like the \"cultural libertarianism\" he once denounced:\n\nSend power back to the communities where people live. If North Dakota wants to be a theocracy, that's fine by me as long as the Bill of Rights is respected. If California wants to turn itself into Caligula's court, I'll criticize it, but go for it....\n\nAnd the glorious thing about this kind of pluralism-i.e., for communities, not just individuals-is that if the community you're living in isn't conducive to your notion of happiness or virtue, you can move somewhere that is. We want more institutions that give us a sense of meaning and belonging, not a state that promises to deliver all of it for you.\n\nPeople are misdiagnosing the problem of social, institutional and familial breakdown. A healthy society is a heterogeneous one, a rich ecosystem with a thousand niches where people can find different sources of meaning or identity. A sick society is one where people find meaning from a single source, whether you call it \"the nation\" or \"socialism\" or any of the other brand names we hang on statism.\n\nOr from work, gender, sexual orientation, the family, religion, ideology-you name it.\n\nIn \" Why I Am Not a Conservative ,\" his postscript to The Constitution of Liberty (1960), Hayek posited that a major dividing line between conservatives and libertarians (professing an intense dislike of the word libertarian , he used the term liberal ) revolved around a fear of the future. Socialists and libertarians, wrote Hayek, were forward-looking in a way that conservatives were not. Conservatism \"by its very nature it cannot offer an alternative to the direction in which we are moving. It may succeed by its resistance to current tendencies in slowing down undesirable developments, but, since it does not indicate another direction, it cannot prevent their continuance.\" Although Hayek was speaking of an older European vision of conservatism, his insight holds increasingly true for contemporary American social cons, who are simply more and more out of step with what most people believe or want out of life.\n\nEspecially in a world in which the progressive left is spending increasing amounts of time and energy trying to police not just our economic choices but our speech, thought, and all aspects of our lifestyles, the libertarian alternative is more appealing than ever. It offers \"a rich ecosystem with a thousand niches where people can find different sources of meaning or identity,\" where we can learn from one another, and have the space to experiment with who we are becoming.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

When you have a clear lane to the hoop, you dunk.\n\nSo here it is, in four words: free Ozempic for all.\n\nIt's the perfect pander. Americans are chubby , love \"free\" stuff, and stopped caring long ago about limited government. If you can bribe them to vote for you by promising free access to a miracle drug that will give them the bodies they've always wanted without demanding the discipline of dieting and exercise, you don't think twice.\n\nYou dunk.\n\nGiven the trajectory of this campaign, whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris will be the first to propose taxpayer-funded skinny pills is less certain than that one of them will. Both have abandoned former ideological commitments in favor of more popular positions aimed at winning swing voters. As they pander their way to a harmonic convergence on policy , launching hugely expensive bidding wars for important constituencies , it's inevitable that one or the other will stumble into a pledge to make America thin and hot-with no cost to anyone, magically.\n\nHow far the two might potentially sink as they compete to out-pander the other was on my mind as I watched Trump sell out conservatives not once but twice in a single interview on Thursday. First, he was asked by NBC News how he'll vote on Florida's upcoming ballot initiative, which would have the practical effect of making abortion legal during all nine months of pregnancy if it passes:\n\nThere's no way to square Florida's current six-week ban with Trump's belief that \"we need more than six weeks.\" A spokesman for Gov. Ron DeSantis, who signed that ban into law, felt obliged to respond in a statement by reminding Trump that overturning the ban would lead to a number of outcomes he's-supposedly-against. Only after a day of pressure from pro-life supporters did the candidate finally relent and declare-on a Friday evening before a three-day weekend-that he'd vote no on the initiative .\n\nHis disdain for six-week bans is old news , though. The real news on Thursday came in this exchange:\n\nFree IVF treatments for everyone, paid for either by Uncle Sam or by private insurers under orders from Uncle Sam. Forget the harmonic convergence on policy, Philip Klein noted at National Review : Trump is now to the left of some prominent Democrats on this issue.\n\nGovernment-financed IVF treatment, which costs tens of thousands of dollars, would impose an enormous cost on taxpayers, or, as a mandated benefit, would dramatically drive up insurance premiums. Outside of requirements to sell insurance to older and sicker patients and capping the cost to them, IVF is one of the most expensive benefits one can mandate. By taking this position, Trump is calling for hiking premiums on every American who does not use IVF. Had Democrats tried to mandate IVF federally when Obamacare was being debated, it's quite possible that would have been the breaking point for the more moderate Democrats, and it would have tanked the whole bill. Put another way, Trump has taken a position that was deemed too left-wing for Barack Obama.\n\nAfter years of apocalyptic Tea Party rhetoric about government power over health care, the head of the GOP is endorsing ... insurance mandates, and not for any principled reason. He's afraid that abortion politics will cost him the election and is desperate to reassure voters about the IVF component of that debate , at least.\n\nSo he's bribing them, lavishly and blatantly, without even a pretense of caring that he's starkly undermined the traditional Republican position. Democrats now have invaluable political cover from the head of the GOP to push harder for mandatory benefits of all sorts in insurance coverage.\n\nWhat's left for conservatives in a party whose leadership is increasingly pro-choice and pro-Obamacare?\n\nI considered that question in March, during a Republican primary in which Trump was already in flight from the pro-life movement.\n\nBut there was reason to believe at the time that he might eventually tap the brakes on his leftward shift. After all, his opponent in the general election was feeble, unpopular, and had trailed him every day in the national polling average since last September. Trump didn't need to go all-out in pandering to the center to defeat an incumbent as weak as Joe Biden.\n\nThat was then.\n\nHis new opponent is polling higher than Biden and now leads in the national average . She's also proven surprisingly shameless about pandering in her own right, even on Trump's pet issue of immigration and notwithstanding the hard-left positions she took in the Democratic presidential primary in 2019. Kamala Harris' unexpected political strength has put heavy pressure on her opponent to keep pace with her in wooing undecided centrist voters. And so, suddenly, he's no longer tapping the brakes. He's stepping on the gas.\n\nWith the Republican moving left and the Democrat moving right, are we sure our friend David French is wrong in believing there's a conservative case for Harris , if only as the least bad choice among two very unconservative options?\n\nConsider the proverbial three-legged stool of Reaganism.\n\nThe first leg is fiscal conservatism, which should be an easy advantage for Republicans. Not anymore: Trump's desire to slash taxes on everything from income to Social Security to corporate revenue without commensurate spending cuts will create a deficit over the next 10 years that's nearly five times higher than the deficit in Harris' agenda.\n\nHe's crazy about tariffs, he won't touch entitlements, and he wants to set monetary policy to suit his political interests . There's nothing meaningfully fiscally responsible about this guy, in case his taxpayer-funded IVF scam-or the gigantic deficits he ran during his first term-didn't make that clear enough.\n\nThe second leg of the stool is hawkishness on national defense. To make the case for Trump over Harris here, you need to emphasize Israel to the exclusion of practically everything else. It's true that his party supports the Jewish state more solidly than Harris' does, although she's sounded more Republican than progressive in her comments about Israel lately . But it's also true that Harris' party is now more willing to enforce the Pax Americana globally than Trump's is.\n\nOn the question of who's more likely to defend NATO and contain Russia by supporting Ukraine, there's no contest. With respect to China, an evergreen rhetorical foil for Trump, there's reason to believe Harris is more willing to come to the aid of an American ally like Taiwan than he is . Presumably, Trump would be tougher on Iran than modern Democrats like Harris have been, but he's chattered lately about \"friendly\" relations with Tehran and the Biden White House has been willing to flex some naval muscle to restrain the mullahs from all-out war with Israel.\n\nAsk yourself this: Having lived through the last eight years, which of our two candidates do you believe is more likely to invite Ayatollah Khamenei to a big back-slapping summit? Kamala Harris or a guy who continues to burble to this day about the love letters he received from Kim Jong Un?\n\nThe last leg of the stool is social conservatism. For all the hype about the culture war, Trump isn't above capitulating in skirmishes and spends precious little time on the stump proposing DeSantis-style policy initiatives to advance a cultural agenda. The biggest right-wing cultural defeat of the last 20 years is the legalization and acceptance of gay marriage, and neither man on the Republican ticket has much to say about it, let alone about reversing it.\n\nOn abortion, even an increasingly pro-choice Trump is preferable to a liberal like Harris, who's keen to reinstate the Roe regime via federal statute. But abortion in the post- Roe era is tricky for pro-lifers: If there isn't enough public support to pass national restrictions (and there isn't), then reducing the number of terminations is more a matter of persuasion than legislation. And it's by no means clear that President Trump would be more useful in that persuasion effort than President Harris would.\n\nHarris is a traditional Democrat saying traditionally Democratic things about abortion. She isn't changing anyone's mind on either side. Trump, on the other hand, is at this very moment creating a permission structure for right-wingers to treat abortion as a minor priority by bartering away pro-life positions in exchange (he hopes) for votes.\n\nThis is what David French, a staunch pro-lifer, worries about in making his case for Reaganites to support Harris. If conservatives insist on sticking with Trump as he moves further and further left on abortion , they're inescapably validating the current national consensus that killing life in the womb is acceptable and should be lawful. The debate going forward will simply be over how generous state laws should be in legalizing terminations.\n\nTo force Republicans back toward the pro-life position, Trump has to pay an electoral price for his betrayal.\n\nAll in all, under the immense weight of Trumpism, each of the three legs of the Reaganite stool is breaking. Economist (and Dispatch contributor ) Brian Riedl wondered on Thursday after the NBC News interview aired: \"If a Democrat sought to destroy the GOP by creating a cult of personality, sabotaging other GOP lawmakers & candidates, making a mockery of its morality and character claims, all while undoing every conservative policy principle ... would he have done anything different than Trump?\"\n\nWould he?\n\nTrump's apologists are forever insisting that \"he fights!\" but stop and think for a moment: What is he actually fighting for at this point? His right to hawk digital trading cards ?\n\nI suppose the response to Riedl is that a Democratic imposter wouldn't have endorsed a plan to deport millions of illegal immigrants .\n\nAlthough ... maybe he would have? Mass deportation will almost certainly fail as a project ; when it does, even that element of Trumpism will be discredited as infeasible.\n\nTrump's not a Democratic imposter, though. He's a nationalist. He's never made (much of) a pretense of being a conservative. Nationalists prioritize a generous welfare state, strong measures to exclude foreigners, a much lighter military footprint abroad, and better relations with illiberal regimes. They fight the enemies within, not without. In hindsight, it was inevitable that the GOP's agenda under Trump's leadership would gradually elevate those priorities while sidelining traditional Republican concerns like the sanctity of life .\n\nThe remaking of the GOP as a nationalist project necessarily required its unmaking as a conservative one. So what are conservatives still doing in this party?\n\nOne answer to that is-they aren't. Many Reaganites have drifted out of the Republican orbit over the last nine years. As I was writing this very piece, news broke that Liz Cheney is likely to endorse Kamala Harris next month. Millions of former Republicans who've left the party since 2016 will vote Democratic this fall in the name of stopping Trump. Dispatch conservatives: They're real, and they're spectacular.\n\nBut many have stuck with the GOP and will continue to do so, even as Trump proceeds with his project to turn it into some sort of National-Front-style European party. And they'll rationalize doing so in a number of ways.\n\n\"Trump's centrist pandering is all rhetoric. Once he's reelected, he'll govern as a conservative.\"\n\nOne can't rule out this possibility, I suppose, any more than one can rule out Harris doing the same thing in reverse if she wins. Trump is wildly erratic on a good day, will be term-limited as president, and suffers from authoritarian instincts that make it unlikely that he'll show restraint. If a Republican Congress sends him a bill restricting abortion nationally, can you imagine him declining to sign it out of deference to states' rights? Has he ever shown deference to anyone, about anything?\n\nPlus, he's a pathological liar. Why wouldn't he lie about his intentions on abortion too?\n\nHe really might turn around after all of this moderate posturing and govern as the iron-fist abortion-banner of the pro-life movement's dreams. (That's certainly what the Harris people want voters to believe about his comments to NBC News.) But for what it's worth, Lila Rose of the anti-abortion group Live Action says she's spoken to his campaign and hasn't received any reassurances that he's being insincere . On Thursday, she declared that \" we have two pro-abortion tickets this year \" and hinted heavily that she won't support Trump this fall unless he changes course, a rare show of spine for a pro-life leader. There's no good reason to believe he's lying.\n\n\"Trump will lose. And once he's gone, the GOP will return to its conservative roots.\"\n\nIs that right? An entire generation of young Republicans has been weaned on Trumpism, not conservatism. Why would they suddenly prioritize fighting abortion after their hero taught them to prioritize fighting immigration and \"globalists\" instead?\n\nUnmaking nationalism as the party's guiding ideology will be even harder if Trumpist control of the GOP persists, as is likely. Trump will presumably continue as leader even if he loses a second time, thanks to the next round of idiotic \"rigged election\" propaganda immunizing him from accountability for his defeat. And after he dies or retires, a talented demagogue in the mold of Donald Trump Jr., Tucker Carlson, or Matt Gaetz would be more simpatico temperamentally with the new Republican base than a sober traditional conservative like Brian Kemp.\n\nIn fact, apart from Kemp and possibly DeSantis, there's hardly any conservative political talent left in the post-Trump GOP that seems capable of overcoming MAGA's \"uniparty\" hostility. (Right, Nikki?) Two days ago, I conceded that most Republican voters are malleable enough on ideology that they might revert to Reaganism if a charismatic leader came along and captured their imaginations. But who is that leader? The party could be pro-life again; who's going to convince them to do it?\n\nPro-life leaders? Please. Apart from Rose, they've rolled over .\n\nIf Trump loses, pro-lifers will argue that his defeat was due to him moving too far to the left on abortion, depressing his base-and they might be right. But it'll be trivially easy for nationalists to argue the opposite, that Trump didn't move far enough to the left to defeat the potent ongoing pro-choice backlash to the end of Roe at the polls. If the new nationalist Republican Party wants to truly neutralize this issue, they'll say, it'll need to make even more concessions. The sacred goal of defeating the \"deep state\" requires nothing less.\n\n\"Yes, the GOP is increasingly left-ish, but it's still better than the Democratic Party.\"\n\nUltimately, this is the rationalization that will convince most traditional conservatives to stick with the party.\n\nAnd why wouldn't it? It's the credo of anti-anti-Trumpism, the same rationalization that's convinced them to stick with the party until now. For nine years, small-government right-wingers have coped with their declining influence within the Republican Party by making themselves useful to their new nationalist masters. They've attacked Democrats incessantly, punctuated by sporadic pro forma reminders that they don't personally support Trump. In doing so, they've filled the same sort of niche that progressives occupy on the left, a rump ideological cohort that believes both parties are bad but that the other one remains, in important ways, meaningfully worse.\n\nFrankly, that might be unfair to progressives: They devote much-much-more of their time holding the Democratic leadership accountable than anti-anti-Trump conservatives do vis-a-vis Trump.\n\nDemocrats' own extremism on abortion in pressing for federal statutory rights and opposing practically all restrictions will supply plenty of reason for anti-anti-Trumpers to justify remaining with the GOP as the three-legged stool collapses beneath them. In fact, I wonder if abortion will ironically begin to take on outsized importance for the conservative rump as the differences on the issue between the two parties vanish. If it's a high priority for you to remain part of the right's partisan tribe, and if Trump's nationalist agenda is offering you zero reason to do so, even small disagreements with Democrats over the high moral stakes of abortion might be enough of a fig leaf to rationalize remaining within the Republican tent.\n\nBy 2032, many Republican partisans will insist that the fate of the country rests on electing an authoritarian who supports a 20-week abortion ban over a liberal who supports one after 23 weeks. Thanks to Trump and their own spinelessness, that's probably the future of conservatism.\n\nNick Catoggio is a staff writer at The Dispatch and is based in Texas.

      "text": "Conservatives Clinch the German Election\n\nPropelled by immigration issues, the far-right Alternative for Germany party also had a strong showing.\n\nHappy Tuesday! First Waffle House, now America's Diner. Denny's recently announced plans to implement egg surcharges as the bird flu drives nationwide poultry shortages. Who knew humble IHOP would be the last bastion of affordable chain restaurant breakfast fare?\n\nAfter more than three years with Chancellor Olaf Scholz at Germany's helm, Sunday's election cemented the country's lurch to the right.\n\nGermany held the early election after its three-party governing coalition of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), the Free Democratic Party (FDP), and the Greens collapsed late last year, ending with Scholz of the center-left SPD losing a vote of no confidence in December. But after this week's election the balance of power has shifted, inviting praise from the Trump administration and raising questions about the nation's future.\n\nA center-right alliance between the Christian Democrats and the Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) carried the largest share of the vote at 28.5 percent, setting up the CDU's Friedrich Merz to become the next chancellor. But the biggest story of the night was the runner-up. In line with polling in the leadup to the election, the far-right party Alternative for Germany (AfD) doubled its support from the last election in 2021 with 20.8 percent of the vote, making it the second-largest party in the parliament.\n\nAfter the historic showing, AfD leader Alice Weidel spoke in front of a crowd that chanted \"Alice für Deutschland\"-a play on the Nazi secret police slogan \"Alles für Deutschland,\" or \"Everything for Germany.\" Along with flirtations with Nazi rhetoric, the anti-migration and anti-Ukraine AfD has been accused of ties to Russia and China . German intelligence labeled the party a \"suspected extremist\" organization last year. Germany's political parties have a longstanding \"firewall\" against far-right groups, wherein they pledge non-cooperation with AfD in an effort to effectively lock it out of governance.\n\nSurprisingly, some of the AfD's most vocal supporters came from outside Germany-within the ranks of the Trump administration. Vice President J.D. Vance criticized the firewall policy after meeting with Weidel just nine days before the election. Meanwhile, Elon Musk, head of the Department of Government Efficiency, praised the party and decried Germany's focus on \"past guilt\" at an AfD campaign rally in January. But with AfD's vote share holding steady with polling leading up to the election, it's unlikely that the pair's input had much effect.\n\nScholz's SPD, on the other hand, had its worst showing in the party's history , dropping to 16.4 percent-nearly 10 points below its 2021 vote share. As the third-highest vote-getter, it will still be the most likely candidate for a governing coalition with the CDU/CSU, and Merz has confirmed coalition negotiations are underway. Still, SPD's decline in support signaled widespread dissatisfaction with the country's current leadership as two key issues came to the fore: immigration and the economy.\n\nMigration has been a particularly salient issue for voters after a string of violent attacks perpetrated by non-citizens. A Syrian refugee allegedly stabbed a man at the Holocaust memorial in Berlin just days before the election, and an asylum-seeker from Afghanistan drove his car into a crowd in Munich the week before, killing a mother and her baby. An Afghan man who reportedly was denied asylum status fatally stabbed two people-including a baby-in late January, and in December, a Saudi Arabian national allegedly barrelled his car through a Christmas market, killing six and injuring hundreds.\n\nMore than two-thirds of Germans now oppose accepting more refugees. This growing frustration with existing migration policies has been a \"key issue,\" Jörn Fleck, senior director of the Atlantic Council's Europe Center, told TMD , adding that voters are concerned not just with the policies themselves but also the enforcement of the laws already on the books.\n\nAfD has leveraged Germans' concerns to corral support for the party's staunchly anti-migration policies, including \"remigration,\" a term for mass deportations. But other politicians have toughened their rhetoric as well, albeit while distancing themselves from AfD's more extreme views. Merz has been outspoken in his support for tightening migration policies, saying he would order the Interior Ministry to turn away all migrants trying to enter the country illegally. In January, he also pushed a nonbinding motion through the parliament that called for stricter migration policies, but he relied on the AfD's votes. The move invited criticism from Scholz and even former Chancellor Angela Merkel, and led to a public backlash against Merz for working with the far-right party.\n\n\"That sparked a huge debate in Germany over whether [Merz] was breaking the firewall,\" Fleck said. Exit polls suggest that it led to a countermobilization effort from young voters that benefited Germany's far-left party Die Linke, which received 8.8 percent of the vote on Sunday after failing in 2021 to reach the 5 percent threshold necessary to enter parliament.\n\nBut the economy was an equally important factor in Sunday's results. \"You're talking about Europe's largest economy that's in the second year of a recession,\" Fleck said. It's also under competitive pressure from China in key sectors like the automobile and chemical industries that have underpinned Germany's economy in recent decades, he explained. Voters are dissatisfied with cost of living increases , and the country's GDP growth has stagnated .\n\nThe three-party governing coalition failed last year in its attempt to loosen the country's \"debt brake,\" a legal limit on government deficits, preventing it from using increased spending to jumpstart the German economy. \"Money was short,\" particularly after Germany's highest court blocked the government's use of $65 billion in money set aside to combat the COVID pandemic in 2023, Joachim Behnke, a political science professor at Germany's Zeppelin University, told TMD . Infighting over the distribution of money followed, marching the coalition toward its eventual demise. And with the debt brake still intact, the incoming coalition's ability to revitalize the economy and increase defense spending could be just as limited.\n\nIt takes two-thirds of the parliament to pass a constitutional amendment-which would be required to lift the debt brake-and Merz's probable coalition with SPD wouldn't have the votes, with AfD and Die Linke opposed to the change. But Merz is currently exploring the option of getting an amendment to loosen the debt brake through the outgoing parliament , which can convene until late March. The Greens have already called on Merz and Scholz's three-party coalition to come up with a solution before that deadline.\n\nBut it remains to be seen whether Merz can deliver the economic change Germans want, with or without debt brake changes. And recent moves by the United States are doing little to assuage economic fears. \"You also have a U.S. administration that's driving some pretty significant challenges on the trade policy front,\" Fleck said. Approximately 10 percent of Germany's exports go to the U.S., and the threat of significant tariffs looms over the economy.\n\nAnd Washington's shifting attitude toward Europe goes beyond just economics. Vance recently said Europe's free speech and immigration policies pose the greatest danger to the continent, and President Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed his skepticism toward NATO. His turn away from support for Ukraine has catalyzed European leaders to make preparations for the possibility of U.S. disengagement from the continent.\n\n\"My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA,\" Merz said as the election results rolled in on Sunday. \"After Donald Trump's statements last week at the latest, it is clear that the Americans, at least this part of the Americans, this administration, are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe.\" The latest developments add additional pressure to raise the debt brake, as Germany plans to step up its own military aid to Ukraine if Washington pulls back its support.\n\nBut warm ties between Germany's new leadership and the Trump administration are still possible. Trump cheered the strong conservative showing in a Truth Social post on Sunday: \"LOOKS LIKE THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY IN GERMANY HAS WON...THIS IS A GREAT DAY FOR GERMANY.\"\n\nFleck, meanwhile, had an optimistic prognosis for the future of U.S.-German relations. \"Even if transatlantic relations at the moment are definitely in a bad state of affairs,\" he said, \"I do think the strategic view of that partnership will prevail.\"\n\nNew York Times : [Former White House Press Secretary] Jen Psaki Gets Nightly Prime-Time Show at MSNBC\n\nThe Hill : Trump Administration Backtracks From Latest Musk Storm\n\nThe Trump administration on Monday appeared to be quickly retreating from Elon Musk's demand that all federal workers send an email by the end of the day highlighting their achievements or resign. The missive from Musk, which echoed a tactic he used during his 2022 takeover of the social platform X, then known as Twitter, led to a chaotic weekend for thousands of federal workers\n\n...\n\nBy Monday afternoon, responding to the email was voluntary, according to guidance from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), a clear signal that even within the administration, some saw Musk as having gone too far.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, had the following exchange during a joint press conference on Monday:\n\nTrump: Europe is loaning the money to Ukraine, they're getting their money back.\n\nMacron: No, in fact, to be frank, we paid.

      "text": "Small-Government Conservatives Should Give DOGE a Chance\n\nWhat's the downside?\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's announcement of a \"Department of Government Efficiency\" (DOGE) caught many conservatives off guard. On paper, a parastatal entity determined to \"dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies\" should be catnip to small-government types. And yet, many Reaganites rolled their eyes. Oddly enough, a scattering of leftist lawmakers, including Bernie Sanders and Ro Khanna , have shown more enthusiasm-or at least an openness to hijacking DOGE's brief-to streamline defense spending. Several budget hawks on the right, by contrast, have largely dismissed DOGE as a sideshow to Congress.\n\nWe understand the skepticism. Didn't David Stockman, the \"father of Reagonomics,\" try cutting spending in the early 1980s in his role at the Office of Management and Budget, only to conclude that Americans rather liked their government goodies? President Trump himself oversaw growing deficits and has made entitlements sacrosanct.  He didn't want to use the debt ceiling to force spending restraint while in office, and just tried to demand a higher debt limit as Congress rushed to pass a stopgap spending bill. Meanwhile, a permanent army of Washington lobbyists stands ready to defend every subsidy under the sun. To fiscal veterans, DOGE might look like another tough-talking shop, at best a balloon that will pop as soon as it hits the pin of politics.\n\nYet this reflexive cynicism seems self-defeating and might even become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Just a month ago, barely anyone inside the Beltway talked of downsizing a single federal program. Systematic deregulation was as fashionable as powdered wigs. Making serious cuts to America's bloated bureaucracy seemed like quaint, early Reagan-era pipe dreams. Yet Washington's conversation has already shifted. DOGE's leaders Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy regularly rail against vast swathes of federal spending, talk up the deficit problem, and have flexed political muscle in the continuing resolution negotiations. What can be gained by rubbishing their bigger effort before it's even founded?\n\nIf there's even a 1 percent chance that DOGE could live up to half of Musk's or Ramaswamy's stated ideas, that would be worth champions of small government investing time and energy to making it happen. The potential prize is bigger than most of our careers: a real and lasting reduction of the scope of the federal Leviathan.\n\nWhat's the downside? Even if the enterprise fizzles out, DOGE is already reintroducing the idea of cutting programs or privatizing entities into public debate, blasted to Musk's nearly 210 million X followers. Expanding the Overton window on government spending is a first step that will, at the very least, leave behind some intellectual real estate for future campaigns.\n\nThat's why we rallied our optimistic cadre of libertarian Cato colleagues into writing a report of recommendations to the DOGE . We collated 23 chapters of recommendations, detailing spending cuts worth around Musk's stated ambition of $2 trillion per year alongside major deregulatory overhauls of sectors like energy, child care, finance, and marine transport. As good libertarians, we hold no truck for sacred cows: There are recommendations for defense cuts that will annoy many conservatives, as well as steps to stem the growth of entitlement spending. Yet the bulk of this work should appeal to DOGE, including transferring government functions back to the states and ending almost all government special privileges and subsidies-for renewables, student loans, farming, and more.\n\nRight now, DOGE's scope and scale remain uncertain. Washington insiders urge a narrow, timid mission: a big glossy report to identify government waste, improve procurement, or switch off a few lights in empty federal buildings. Sure, rooting out such glaring inefficiencies is all well and good. But if DOGE confines itself to improper payments and outdated IT systems, it will become a glorified housekeeping service for a mansion that gets bigger and more expensive every year. A legacy of \"making Big Government more efficient at doing bad things\" is surely not what Musk and Ramaswamy have in mind.\n\nNo, to achieve progress worth having, DOGE must think bigger. The plain fact is that the federal government is so large that it can't help but fall over itself. One arm subsidizes crops going into unhealthy foods; another pays for nutrition campaigns . The feds write expensive checks for disaster relief while subsidizing insurance in flood zones . We could go on, but the list of contradictions would be longer than the continuing resolution that the DOGErs killed. No operational tinkering can fix those fundamental tensions. Achieving meaningful efficiency is impossible without cutting back the state's functions to a few legitimate tasks that can then be monitored.\n\nOur most important message in the report is that DOGE can play a dual role: not just working with the Office of Management and Budget to identify things the executive can do to eradicate waste but also acting as a political pressure agent on Congress to pass laws to shrink the government.\n\nMore importantly, though, we want to offer concrete policies for DOGE to consider. For decades, politicians mouthed platitudes about \"waste\" and \"red tape\" while federal spending and regulations soared. Our report doesn't gesture vaguely toward reform; it lays out specific proposals-executive orders, rule changes, and legislation-that could combine to balance the budget and liberate vast swathes of the economy from regulation. The logic is straightforward: Identify activities that are superfluous, destructive, or beyond the government's proper role, then excise them. Streamline only what remains.\n\nThe underlying principles that drive these recommendations should appeal to small-government conservatives. First, tie federal activity strictly to constitutionally enumerated powers. That means devolving huge areas (like most of education) back to the states while shrinking Washington's reach dramatically in sectors like energy, the environment, child care, and elsewhere.\n\nSecond, deregulate as far as possible. Taking the lead from Argentina's Javier Milei , DOGE shouldn't waste time identifying regulatory changes that pass some easily gameable, technocratic cost-benefit analysis. In fact, broad and sweeping deregulation is essential for political buy-in: You want industries and businesses arguing to get rid of others' privileges, rather than scrambling to protect their own. Unless there are clear externality problems, new technologies should be permitted to develop and thrive, and existing price, entry, social, labor, medical, antitrust, and other supply-side controls should be eliminated.\n\nGoing beyond specific deregulation, DOGE should encourage Congress to salt the earth to prevent the sprouting of new rules. Sunsetting statutes that authorize agencies' rule-making authority and putting a time limit on the regulations themselves would force Congress to periodically revisit these powers. The REINS Act, which has passed the House many times but not become law, would require congressional approval of any new major regulation via an expedited process.\n\nThe spending logic is equally plain. There's a strong macroeconomic case for reducing expenditure now to mitigate our currently unsustainable debt path. Most government spending is distortionary to the economy anyway, meaning most cuts will help strengthen economic growth prospects, long-term. While President-elect Trump will likely reject cutting entitlements, the key debt driver, DOGE might start eating away at the political support for various subsidies and favoritism. In fact, Musk has extra credibility on this given his stated ambition to eradicate subsidies in one of his own industries, electric vehicles. A few tens of billions of cuts here and there can add up to real money saved and the scope of government reduced.\n\n\"Stroke of the pen, law of the land. Kinda cool,\" crowed former Clinton adviser Paul Begala, neatly capturing what small-government types despise about executive orders. But here's a twist to warm your heart: What a pen puts in place, another can just as easily strike out. Presidents hold enormous power to rip up their predecessors' rulebooks. And on this we agree with Ramaswamy : Scrapping directives that stomp on economic liberties, trample individual rights, and bloat the state isn't overreach-it's a long-overdue purge of meddling unsanctioned by Congress. We come with specific orders to revoke or revise policy issues as diverse as energy, environment, the administrative state, education, health care, and more.\n\nTaxation may not be DOGE's immediate priority, but it's impossible to ignore. Many Trump-era tax cuts are set to expire at the end of 2025, and the code is stuffed with special-interest giveaways and green boondoggles signed by President Biden. Junk them-no recycling, straight to the landfill!-and revive the principle of broad-based, and low-rate taxation. For DOGE to take a stand against cronyism in taxation would be a logical extension of its spending mission.\n\nAll of this can-and should-be coupled with genuine efficiency measures, of course. There's nothing wrong with upgrading government technology, eliminating duplicate agencies, and insisting on accountability and merit in the civil service. But that only makes sense in service of a broader objective: cutting government down to size. If anything, efficiency reforms without strategic cuts just make an overbearing state harder to resist. Other than the people directly employed, who benefits from a machine churning out DEI mandates or squandering cash on green junkets more effectively?\n\nWe are under no illusions that this sort of all-encompassing reform agenda is possible within a four-year term, or indeed that Congress would want to do it all. Not only would many politicians reject our libertarian premises, but the political economy of Congress, not to mention the government itself, makes fundamental change incredibly difficult. But should that doom us to sit on our hands and merely complain about how attempts to shrink government always fail? Of course not.\n\nPolitics can sometimes surprise you. Previous major legislation, like the 1986 tax reform, seemingly came from nowhere and experts predicted it couldn't overcome the power of special interests.\n\nDOGE also comes at a time when a more originalist judiciary has largely made conditions more favorable for weakening the executive , Democratic interest groups are reeling from the election defeat, and a raft of doers and shakers from the tech sector are headed to Washington wanting to get the country building again.\n\nDOGE's underlying mission is vast, thorny, and controversial. Still, if Bernie Sanders and Ro Khanna can spot a narrow window of opportunity here, small-government stalwarts could surely feed in productive ideas to give it the best chance of success.\n\nRyan Bourne occupies the R.

      "text": "Conservatives have a special duty to protect iconoclasts.\n\nAt first blush, this idea doesn't quite square. Conservatism, properly understood, seeks to protect order and tradition. Why should it defend those who challenge the status quo?\n\nThere's a simple answer: Because iconoclasts sometimes raise the right questions. Conservatives, at any given moment, could be preserving a bad idea, an unfair practice, or an outdated system. By making room for those willing to dissent, conservatives are actually guarding against decadence and a misguided sense of certainty. Ideas now considered invaluable were once thought heretical, after all: Isaac Newton's and then Albert Einstein's theories on gravity, Adam Smith's understanding of markets, Frederick Douglass' and Susan B. Anthony's approaches to equality, Luis Alvarez's research on the extinction of dinosaurs.\n\nAt the same time, however, we must never forget that iconoclasts are often dead wrong. Their ideas can be loopy, even dangerous. They'd have us believe in deranged conspiracy theories, in ancient aliens, that the position of planets and stars dictate human events. If some of these iconoclasts gained power, they could undermine generations of hard-earned wisdom and wreak havoc in essential institutions-the very things conservatives fight to prevent. America's right must be confident enough in their own beliefs to listen to iconoclasts' objections while staying principled enough to generally keep them away from positions of authority.\n\nPerhaps Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, has some worthwhile thoughts about food production. Perhaps Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's pick to serve as director of national intelligence, raises a decent point about the importance of civil liberties in an era of heightened surveillance. But, as with so many other iconoclasts, their occasional defensible ideas are wrapped up with a host of wrongheaded beliefs and troubling behaviors . Yes, hear them out. Sure, consider them intellectual provocateurs. But don't let them within a country mile of federal executive power.\n\nMany conservatives in the Trump era have adopted an anti-institutional posture that's typically been reserved for progressives and radicals, and understandably so, as many of our most important institutions have failed in recent years to carry out their core missions. The pandemic, for example, revealed the poor judgment and politicization of too many public-health professionals. Too many elite universities have been hostile to viewpoint diversity and free speech. Too many journalists substituted their political preferences for dispassionate reporting . Some leading banks helped precipitate the Great Recession, and Congress seems incapable of seriously engaging with the most important issues plaguing the nation. Prosecutors in a number of our largest cities have grown indifferent to basic matters of law enforcement.\n\nIn such cases, the typical conservative approach of preservation and prudence-the approach perhaps best embodied by G.K. Chesterton's fence allegory -would seem wholly inadequate. In those areas and plenty of others, we need major change-not more of the same. But the error some on the right are making in this moment is forgoing strong, stubborn, sober reform and instead finding common cause with people whose impulse is to swiftly and dramatically upend or tear down. Kennedy, Gabbard, and Elon Musk among others are conservative in neither political philosophy nor disposition. They seem to be animated primarily by their animus toward institutions.\n\nBut that's not how conservatives choose allies; that's typically how we choose opponents . Edmund Burke, arguably the founder of modern conservatism, is best known for his criticism of the French revolutionaries who wanted to overturn longstanding governing bodies and religious and social arrangements. More recent conservatives have seen themselves as fundamentally at odds with critical race and critical legal theorists and Marxists, all of whom argue that our key institutions are built on and perpetuate injustice and therefore need to be undone. Strong conservatives don't team up with such institution-levelers in order to win a current scuffle; we oppose them because they threaten lasting societal damage.\n\n\"Even if conservatives are frustrated with an important institution, we must recognize that those institutions should never be led by those whose primary qualifications are eccentricity and provocation.\"\n\n\"The dilemma of the last century has been resolved in favor of skepticism toward liberal scientific expertise that had marginalized the right for so long.\"\n\nThis anti-institutional fervor on the right has fostered a strange type of argument in favor of Kennedy, Gabbard, and Kash Patel-as well as figures like Matt Gaetz, Pete Hegseth, Linda McMahon, and Mehmet Oz. \"Sure, they might not be traditionally 'qualified' for these jobs,\" the thinking goes, \"but previous 'qualified' people in those roles were terrible. At least these people will shake things up .\"\n\nOf course we should be frustrated if someone purportedly qualified for a job fails at it. But if you have a bad experience with a doctor, you don't seek a second opinion from someone unfamiliar with human anatomy just because he or she will \"shake things up.\" You find a better doctor. If your daughter's teacher isn't very good, you don't \"shake things up\" and ask for a replacement who's ignorant about phonics and child development. You find a better teacher. We should respect our institutions and the work of governing enough to recognize that disruptive novices are not the answer. There are plenty of tough-minded, highly experienced Republicans and conservatives-former governors, U.S. attorneys, state attorneys general, veterans of previous GOP administrations-who could responsibly implement meaningful reforms.\n\nThere's one more reason for conservatives to avoid embracing figures like Kennedy and Gabbard, and it has less to do with their deficiencies than our understanding of and respect for key governing institutions.\n\nOver the last generation, we seem to have lost the distinction between those who talk about politics for a living and those who actually take responsibility in positions of authority. Commentators and pundits think they are ready to govern, people in governing positions act like commentators and pundits, and the public ends up believing the two groups are interchangeable. That Kennedy, Gabbard, Hegseth, Oz, and so many other Trump nominees have been gadflies and television personalities is not a coincidence: This is the consequence of blurring the line between the two lines of work.\n\nBut experience in criticizing, speculating, and agitating is not sufficient preparation for devising and implementing the myriad reforms our institutions require. No, we need leaders deeply knowledgeable about policy content and process and who possess the hands-on experience and disposition needed to lead at the highest levels. Conservatives should be the first to protect the integrity of our governing institutions in this way and the last to allow those institutions to be turned into platforms for those pushing insensible ideas, whether related to vaccines or the traitorous Edward Snowden .\n\nI want to be very clear here about what I am arguing-and what I'm not. Individuals have every right to take unusual, even wrongheaded, positions. But that does not mean that the most powerful seats in the American government should be held by those with poor judgment. We should appreciate that there is a fundamental difference between what a citizen can do and what a high-ranking public official should do.\n\nFour years ago, as debates were raging over truth, disinformation, exaggeration, conspiracies, and the infamous seriously-not-literally divide, I defended (in a long essay for National Affairs ) the use of a wide array of rhetorical devices, arguing that truth and meaning can be conveyed in a number of ways that may not pass the test of \"literal accuracy.\" My first point was that the public's understanding of an issue can be aided by caricatures, fables, hyperbole, myths, parables, parodies, satire, and tall tales, even if each of these have some degree of untruth. But my second, larger point was that, while citizens and private groups might use these devices, public institutions and their leaders should not. We need the most authoritative institutions to be absolutely reliable, straightforward, judicious, and respectable. Americans must be able to trust such entities because so much rides on their statements and actions. Americans will only give these institutions the massive power they need to succeed if Americans believe those institutions are worthy of that power.\n\nThis is the same way we should understand the difference between the wild-eyed views of private citizens and prospective leaders. A citizen has every right to hold avant-garde positions far outside of the consensus of medical professionals. But we should not put such a person atop the nation's largest public-health agency. A citizen has the right to be transgressive and express sympathy for some of our nation's enemies. But we should not put such a person at the head of our intelligence community. A citizen has the right to bombastically include in a book a list of supposed agents of the deep state and imply criminal or civil action against opponents. But we should not put that person in charge of the FBI.\n\nEven if conservatives are frustrated with an important institution, we must recognize that those institutions should never be led by those whose primary qualifications are eccentricity and provocation. You don't strengthen an institution by elevating people who will bring chaos and subversion to the body; that is a recipe for the institution's downfall. Conservatives must not lose the distinction between an external agitator and an internal leader.\n\nThere is always a role for inexperienced, intemperate iconoclasts in society. There's even a small role for them in conservatism. We should be aware of their arguments and the evidence they marshal. But because they typically have too little respect for and too little familiarity with key institutions and because those institutions are so important to this nation, we should keep them out of the most important positions of public authority.\n\nUse the options\n                below to copy or email a special link so that friends or family can access this article without a\n                subscription."

      "text": "No, J.D. Vance Isn't 'Ultraconservative'\n\nThe right's divisions are real, but we need better labels.\n\nWho is an \"ultraconservative\"? Having spent most of my career leading conservative organizations, I couldn't begin to offer you a coherent definition. Neither, it seems, can anyone else.\n\nFor example, news outlets and political opponents are labeling Sen. J.D. Vance, Donald Trump's newly minted running mate, as \"ultraconservative.\" Yet his views on federal spending, entitlement reform, tax reform, and labor policy are far to the left of the typical traditional Republican stance. And Vance is one of several \"ultraconservative Republicans\" opposed to aid for Ukraine.\n\nThese are hardly the only promiscuous uses of the term. Last month, Sen. Dick Durbin and much of the media claimed an \"ultraconservative\" majority on the Supreme Court is advancing a reactionary agenda and ripping up the Constitution, all the while doing the bidding of Donald Trump. But he ignores that the same justices have affirmed gun-control laws, tossed out a legal challenge to abortion pills , and rebuffed Trump's demand for \"complete and total immunity\" from criminal prosecution.\n\nWhat about the former president himself? While it's uncommon for news outlets to apply the label to the ideologically mercurial Trump, critics often blast his allies and policies as \"ultraconservative\"-except when Trump is describing same-sex marriage as a \"settled\" issue, watering down the anti-abortion plank of the Republican platform, or decrying past military interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan launched by the Bush-Cheney administration (which was, of course, labeled \"ultraconservative\" back in the day).\n\nMoreover, a Trump-endorsed primary challenger recently defeated Virginia Rep. Bob Good, head of the \" ultraconservative \" House Freedom Caucus. As for Trump's right-wingman, Steve Bannon, he and the organizations he runs are frequently labeled \"ultraconservative.\" That's hard to square with Bannon's advocacy of more federal spending on infrastructure, income tax hikes on upper-income Americans, and tariff tax hikes on everyone else.\n\nAnd what survey of political nomenclature would be complete without consulting Wikipedia? Its entry suggests ultraconservatives \"typically rely\" on appeals to \"populism\" while also adopting \"neoliberalism\" as their \"primary economic ideology.\" This formulation is absurd. In policy terms, populism and neoliberalism are opposites.\n\nI don't deny that the American right encompasses a wide range of voices, views, and institutions. We need terms to define and discuss them. The problem with such labels as \"ultraconservative\" and its cousin \"archconservative\" is that they describe variations of intensity or consistency. Some people are only slightly conservative. Others are very (ultra) conservative. The rest lay somewhere in between.\n\nIt's a flawed model. The key differences among conservatives aren't in degree. They're in kind.\n\nIn the summer of 2022, a group of right-leaning nationalists and populists released a document titled \" National Conservatism: A Statement of Principles .\" In 10 paragraphs, the several-dozen signatories summarized their views on such important issues as national sovereignty, immigration, free enterprise, industrial policy, foreign policy, family stability, and the proper relationship of church and state.\n\n\"We see the tradition of independent, self-governed nations as the foundation for restoring a proper public orientation toward patriotism and courage, honor and loyalty, religion and wisdom, congregation and family, man and woman, the sabbath and the sacred, and reason and justice,\" the self-styled NatCons wrote.\n\nA year ago this month, a rival group of several dozen signatories-including Jonah Goldberg, Kevin Williamson, and other Dispatch writers-released \" Freedom Conservatism: A Statement of Principles .\" Too many people on the left and right, they wrote, \"reject the distinctive creed that made America great: that individual liberty is essential to the moral and physical strength of the nation.\"\n\nThe FreeCon statement's 10 paragraphs addressed most of the same issues, agreeing with the NatCons in some areas while drawing sharp contrasts in others. For example, the NatCon statement offered tepid support for American federalism, describing it as \"a delegation of power\" to \"subdivisions of the nation\" and stating that in communities where \"law and justice have been manifestly corrupted, or in which lawlessness, immorality, and dissolution reign, national government must intervene energetically to restore order.\" In their statement, FreeCons flipped this conception on its head-it is the national government to which limited powers are delegated-and argued that \"much of the discord in America today comes from the fact that too many decisions are made for us by centralized authorities.\"\n\nNatCons blame \"globalized markets\" for despoiling America. FreeCons extol the capacity for freer trade to raise our standard of living. NatCons want America's public life to be \"rooted in Christianity,\" while FreeCons emphasize pluralism and freedom of conscience. NatCons call for a \"Cold War-type\" program of federal spending on research and development. FreeCons place a higher priority on fiscal restraint, naming our \"skyrocketing federal debt\" a \"threat to the future prosperity, liberty, and happiness of Americans.\"\n\nAs one of the organizers of the FreeCon statement, I make no claim of neutrality here. Still, I credit the NatCons for offering a clear conception of what they believe American conservatism ought to be-and for giving it a useful name. I also won't claim that national conservatism and freedom conservatism are the only alternatives. By all means, let a hundred crimson flowers bloom.\n\nBut first things first. Let's stop pretending the robust debate on the American right is between ultra- or archconservatives on one side and moderates on the other. It's more complicated-and interesting-than that. What about passionate pro-lifers who oppose cuts to Social Security and Medicare? Or gay conservatives who favor increased military aid to Israel? Or critics of the administrative state who favor returning teacher-led prayer to public schools? Or anti-DEI activists who think big corporations are undertaxed?\n\nBy definition, conservatives seek to conserve. When we differ, it's usually because we disagree about what most needs conserving at present. NatCons say it's \"the idea of the nation.\" FreeCons say it's \"individual liberty.\" I'm all for hashing it out -and for ditching the silly terms \"ultraconservative\" and \"archconservative,\" now and forever.\n\nJohn Hood is president of the John William Pope Foundation, a North Carolina-based grantmaker, and one of the editors of FreedomConservatism.org.\n\nYour membership includes the ability to share articles\n                with friends.

      "text": "How Affluent Conservatives Fuel the Culture War\n\nTrumpism is a type of cultural alarmism most ardently embraced not by the working class but by wealthier voters.\n\nIn his book The Idea of Decline in Western History , historian Arthur Herman writes, \"﻿Perhaps the most salient feature of the twentieth century has been the tremendous upsurge of ... cultural pessimism, not just in the realm of ideas, but directly into the arena of politics and culture.\" This sense of decline, which Herman chronicles as a recurrent feature of modern society, has long animated a loud minority of the political left, and has now become a feature of an increasingly large share of the political right. It is worth pausing to consider what is happening, and what it means for policymaking.\n\nUntil Donald Trump's electoral defeat in November 2020, Trumpism was largely understood by the political class and media as a collection of anti-elite sentiments and policy notions aimed at the working class. Since then, a number of commentators have noted that Trumpism-if that is even the right name for it-is a type of cultural alarmism most ardently embraced not by the working class but a more affluent set of voters. Sure, many of the bozos who stormed the Capitol on January 6 personified the media's idea of the conventional working-class Trump voter, but the anxious, anti-leftist rhetoric conservative political leaders deploy today is aimed at a more affluent, professional-class (and thereby statistically more active) voter.\n\nShortly after the 2016 election, Cato pollster Emily Ekins identified among Trump voters a more educated, professional \"free marketeer\" voter who was Trump-skeptical but voted for him to avoid the alternative. This group has now largely gone all-in on alarmism about the left's cultural agenda, which is one of the most unexpected political phenomena of the past four years and probably why it was mostly overlooked until recently. They are members of what David Brooks has recently called the \"GOP gentry\" and the \"proletarian aristocracy\"-a mix of family and small business owners, middle managers, ranch and franchise owners, and so on. They gravitate toward the \"plutocratic populism\" that political scientists Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson have identified (and that Price St. Clair has covered for The Dispatch ), which appeals on cultural rather than economic grounds. While such voters still care about policies that create economic opportunity, they are more emotionally invested in the fight against censorship, speech codes, and the left's general assault on traditional values.\n\nEven though some members of Congress continue to push economic policy along the lines of working-class concerns, the incentives all point in the direction of cultural conflict as a larger share of active, more influential voters in the base ascribe to alarmism. When Republican Study Committee Chairman Jim Banks of Indiana urged his committee members to \"lean into the culture war,\" he was channeling the heart of the right's current anti-elitism, which is angst over cultural demise more than a concern for everyday Joes working hourly wage jobs.\n\nCultural anxiety among more affluent conservatives overtook economic alienation as a primary concern a while before the political class woke up to it. Even after four years of donning \"Make America Great Again\" merch, Trump's most ardent supporters were the gloomiest among all demographic groups on the eve of the 2020 election in that they were the most likely to say America's best days are behind us. This helps explain why-even in the wake of the disturbing scenes of the U.S. Capitol on January 6-survey data show that an astonishing 55 percent of Republicans believe the traditional way of life in America is disappearing so fast that force may be necessary to save it.\n\nThe distinctive class element on the right over today's culture wars-battles over cancel culture, critical race theory, and speech codes, for instance-is less evident in the older culture wars over abortion and same-sex marriage. According to survey data from the American Enterprise Institute shortly before the 2020 election, wealthier conservatives are roughly as conservative as lower-income conservatives on the older culture-war issues, while considerably more anxious about the new ones. On the left, the situation is flipped.  Affluent and working-class liberals are more likely to think both sides have roughly the same power on today's cultural issues, while affluent liberals are considerably more progressive on the old culture war issues such as abortion.\n\nCulture wars are about ideological power, and when one side loses it, anxiety ensues. When asked who controls America's culture and way of life, 61 percent of conservatives with a college degree say liberals do, compared to 43 percent of working-class conservatives. By comparison, only 16 percent of both educated and working-class liberals think they have the most cultural influence. Forty-two percent of working-class conservatives and 44 percent of affluent liberals (i.e., those earning more than $100,000) think both the left and the right have the same amount of cultural influence, compared to about a third of college-educated and affluent conservatives. Ironically, conservatives with arguably more cultural power-they are more politically active, engage civically at higher rates, and have more access to elite institutions-are more likely to believe they have less of it than their less-affluent and less-connected ideological compatriots.\n\nA class gap also exists on views of the ideological nature of the media. Eighty-six percent of affluent conservatives believe journalists have personal or political agendas, compared to three-quarters of the working-class on the right. Meanwhile, among liberals, only 41 percent of the affluent and 46 percent of the working class believe the same. With justification, conservatives could argue numbers like these prove their point-namely, liberals are simply blind to media bias since they regard \"mainstream news\" as unbiased. But the class distinctions are notable.\n\nThe case of religion in America is especially illustrative. Six in ten college-educated conservatives say it has become more difficult to be a Christian in the U.S. compared to just 44 percent of working-class conservatives and 39 percent of the nation overall. Working-class liberals track with the national average on this question, but only about a quarter of educated liberals believe it has gotten harder to be a Christian. What's interesting is the cultural aspect of this issue. Educated conservatives may have heightened worries about anti-Christian sentiments, but they are considerably less likely to think society depends on Christianity. Compared to 57 percent of working-class conservatives, only 42 percent of college-educated conservatives think belief in God is necessary for someone to be a moral person, which is on par with the national average. Christianity as a cultural more than moral force seems to be what makes the professional class on the right most anxious.\n\nConservatives are not wrong to believe liberals are gaining ground ideologically in America, but Gallup's long-term trend has long shown conservatives enjoying a healthy ideological plurality over liberals. Educated conservatives are less likely than educated liberals to say they have been attacked for their political views, and less likely to feel stressed during political conversations. But anxiety abounds nonetheless.\n\nConservatives are right to be concerned about the left's ambitions, but wrong to let alarmism dominate their political outlook. Anxiety blinds people, first, to past cultural upheavals that are arguably worse than the present, and second, to longer-term, more constructive strategies for strengthening U.S. culture, as I have argued elsewhere at length. Instead of \"leaning into the culture wars,\" conservative policymakers and thought leaders could lean into a more positive agenda, focused on opportunity and everyday concerns like jobs, schools, and public safety. These issues resonate with a politically exhausted majority of people, who are not particularly interested in the left's ambitions or the right's cultural anxiety.\n\nRyan Streeter is the director of domestic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nRyan Streeter is the director of domestic policy at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nYour membership includes the ability to share articles\n                with friends.

      "text": "A 2020 Election Report 'By Conservatives, For Conservatives'\n\nFormer judges, senators, and politicos take a deep dive into claims of fraud and find them baseless.\n\nEight prominent conservatives released a report on Thursday examining \"every claim of fraud and miscount put forward by former President Trump and his advocates\" following the 2020 presidential election and reached an \"unequivocal\" conclusion: \"Joe Biden was the choice of a majority of the Electors, who themselves were the choice of the majority of voters in their states.\"\n\nFormer federal judge Thomas B. Griffith, who spearheaded the report's creation and recruited other members of the group that produced it, told The Dispatch the report has been in the works for nearly a year and a half. Along with Griffith, the signatories include two other former federal judges (J. Michael Luttig and Michael W. McConnell), two former senators (John Danforth of Missouri and Gordon H. Smith of Oregon), former U.S. Solicitor General Theodore B. Olson, Republican election lawyer Benjamin Ginsburg, and David Hoppe, former chief of staff to Paul Ryan. Two of the signatories-Ginsburg and Luttig-have testified before the House committee investigating January 6.\n\nMotivated in part by a \"fundamental dissatisfaction with having to rely on others for the information,\" Griffith recruited others of like mind to volunteer for a fact-finding mission.\n\n\"I just got on the phone and started calling fellow conservatives who I trusted,\" Griffith said. \"Let's do a deep dive. Let's-don't rely on what others are telling us, let's look at it ourselves. And, you know, if we come to the conclusion that there are serious problems with our election system, that it's rife with fraud, then let's be the advocates for getting that fixed, because that's not sustainable. On the other hand, if we find out that those stories aren't true ... then let's get out and tell folks that.\"\n\nHoppe-who said he joined the effort about 10 months ago-told The Dispatch \"the process started with saying, OK, if we're going to analyze this, how do we do it? How do we make it manageable for a bunch of people who have daytime jobs, but want to do this and want to do this as effectively and thoroughly as possible?\"\n\nHoppe said the group \"had a lot of volunteer help-different people, different law firms, different lawyers with different backgrounds.\" According to Griffith and Hoppe, at least some of those lawyers came from Griffith's and Ginsburg's firms. It was a volunteer effort, and no one was paid for their involvement, they said.\n\n\"We would discuss it as different pieces of it came together, different states came together,\" Hoppe said. \"We would sit down and discuss it, Zoom calls, telephone calls, and go through and ask questions. We would point out where there were weaknesses in the report, point out where we thought we might have found something to add another question. We wanted to pursue those sorts of things.\"\n\nIn the executive summary, the authors provide a broad overview of the court cases in question. Less than half of the cases brought by Trump and his supporters-30 out of 64-included a hearing on the merits, and \"[o]nly in one Pennsylvania case involving far too few votes to overturn the results did Trump and his supporters prevail.\" Of the other 34 cases, \"twenty were dismissed before a hearing on the merits, [and] fourteen were voluntarily dismissed by Trump and his supporters before a hearing on the merits.\"\n\nThe report walks alphabetically through the six battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, providing both a written analysis and an addendum of court cases and their results for each state.\n\nThe section on Arizona also includes an addendum comparing the claims of the Cyber Ninjas' post-election review with responses from Maricopa County. (Cyber Ninjas was a firm hired by the Republican-controlled Arizona Senate to investigate claims of election fraud, but the group presented no evidence of such fraud.)\n\nOne claim in Arizona was that ballot drop boxes were not fairly distributed throughout the state. The report notes that the plaintiffs in one lawsuit-who alleged that Arizona \"unlawfully located more drop boxes in areas that tend to vote for progressive candidates than it did in traditionally conservative voting areas\"-voluntarily dropped their suit. \"We stress that the claims were voluntarily dismissed,\" they write. \"It is a disservice to the public for advocates of a candidate to continue to make claims of electoral improprieties when they have chosen not to test those claims in a court of evidence and law.\"\n\nIn Georgia, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger conducted a hand recount-and \"the variance in total vote count between the machine and hand recounts was 0.1053%, far less than the 1.0 to 1.5% variance found in past Georgia elections.\"\n\nIn Michigan, \"Trump supporters made public claims that hundreds of thousands of absentee ballots were sent to voters without a prior request, in violation of Michigan law.\" Instead, the state's Republican-controlled Senate Oversight Committee found that many of the people making these claims had \"actually received an absentee-ballot application, which is called for under Michigan law.\"\n\nIn Pennsylvania, \"the Associated Press identified just 26 potential cases of voter fraud, but these represent just 0.03% of Biden's margin of victory, far, far too few to have any impact on the result.\"\n\nThe list goes on. While the report goes deep in the legal weeds-it runs to 69 pages and includes 280 footnotes, one of which references a Dispatch fact check -Griffith said it was drafted to be \"digestible and easily understood,\" with a particular audience in mind: conservatives.\n\n\"The idea is that it's written by conservatives, for conservatives,\" Griffith said. \"We recognize the people who are watching [ Morning Joe and CNN] are probably not the people we're primarily interested in. I mean, we're happy to tell our message to anyone, but it's really the folks who are conservatives who think the election was stolen.\"\n\nIn the report's executive summary, the eight men take pains to emphasize their conservative bona fides. \"Every member of this informal group has worked in Republican politics, been appointed to office by Republicans, or is otherwise associated with the Party,\" they write. \"None have shifted loyalties to the Democratic Party, and none bear any ill will toward Trump and especially not toward his sincere supporters.\"\n\nGriffith and Hoppe acknowledge that what they are saying is not new. They are simply confirming what Trump's own Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, and FBI said in the weeks following the election. And their report is narrowly focused on the question of whether the 2020 election was lost or stolen. Although Hoppe said his personal view as a non-lawyer is that reforms to the Electoral Count Act of 1887 \"[deserve] to be looked at,\" the group as a whole has not taken a position on election law reform.\n\nThere have been points in American history where widespread election fraud was a huge problem. As recently as 1960, there were credible allegations of widespread voter fraud in Illinois and Texas-allegations the losing candidate, Richard Nixon, chose not to pursue, telling a friend that \"our country cannot afford the agony of a constitutional crisis.\"\n\nGriffith believes that today, election security is much better.\n\n\"I was really surprised to learn that over the past 20 years or so-actually primarily since Bush v. Gore -that there has been a real professionalization of election administration,\" Griffith said. He praised the seriousness with which election officials in the country-from both parties-do their jobs. \"It isn't perfect, and we can get better, but it's pretty darn good, and as a conservative, you know, my sensibilities, my temperament, is always that we preserve institutions. That's what we do, right? We preserve the good, and this is something that's really good. We ought to be preserving it instead of taking a sledgehammer to it with these accusations that it's filled with corruption, because it's just not-that's just demonstrably false.\"\n\nPrice St. Clair is a former reporter for The Dispatch.\n\nYour membership includes the ability to share articles\n                with friends.

      "text": "The Deciders\n\nWill anti-Trump conservatives swing the election?\n\nThere are three approaches a Reagan Republican might take toward this election. I understand two of them.\n\nOne is Liz Cheney's. She's set aside her policy differences with Democrats and endorsed Kamala Harris because she believes defeating a coup-plotter requires nothing less. By doing so, she's forfeited whatever meager influence she might have wielded in a post-Trump GOP. I understand her rationale.\n\nThe second is Nikki Haley's. She's set aside her civic differences with MAGA and endorsed Donald Trump because she believes defeating the left requires nothing less. By doing so, she's preserving whatever meager influence she might have wielded in a post-Trump GOP. I understand her rationale too, contemptible as it is.\n\nThe third is Mitt Romney's. I don't understand the rationale for his position at all-which is a strange feeling, as no Republican since 2016 has been more consistently sensible than Mitt.\n\nHere he was a few days ago responding to a question about why he hasn't endorsed Harris:\n\n\"I've made it very clear that I don't want Donald Trump to be the next president of the United States, and you're going to have to do the very difficult calculation of what that would mean,\" Romney said.\n\nRomney said he wishes to \"to continue to have a voice in the Republican Party following this election,\" saying he believes \"there's a good shot that the Republican Party is going to need to be rebuilt and reoriented, either after this election, or if Donald Trump is reelected, after he's the president,\" he said.\n\n\"I believe I will have more influence in the party by virtue of saying it as I've said it,\" Romney added. \"I'm not planning on changing the way I've described it.\"\n\nWhat on earth is this man talking about?\n\nSet aside the fact that he strongly implies in the clip that he plans to vote for the Democratic nominee, undermining any goodwill he might have earned on the right for remaining formally neutral. The idea that Mitt Romney, of all people, will \"have a voice\" in the party after this election is pure fantasy.\n\nNo figure in the party has antagonized the Republican base more thoroughly over the past decade. Romney was making speeches calling Trump \"a con man\" and \"a fake\" even before the primaries were over in 2016. He voted to convict Trump at both of his impeachment trials. He's spent $5,000 per day on private security for his family since the January 6 insurrection because he fears for their safety from crazed populists.\n\nEven in the rosiest Never Trump scenario, where Harris skates to a surprise landslide victory, there's no future in which dejected Republican voters crawl out of the rubble and turn their eyes to Mitt for leadership. After everything he's witnessed since 2015, it is astonishing that he retains enough faith in the decency of the right to believe they might crave a more virtuous politics post-Trump and choose to drop the ferocious grudge they bear him. If anything, the opposite is true: It'll be Mitt Romney and other wayward Reaganites whom MAGA populists blame for Trump's defeat, I expect.\n\nAnd you know what? Maybe they should.\n\nWith the election on a knife's edge, it's plausible that anti-Trump conservatives will provide the margin for victory for Democrats.\n\nI'm too pessimistic by nature and too traumatized by Trump cultism to believe that Reagan conservatives will do the right thing next month.\n\nA few will. ( The Dispatch has 500,000 email subscribers!) Just not enough. My easiest Eeyorish prediction for November is that the \"Republicans for Harris\" vote will turn out to be an enormous bust. The right has spent nine years being conditioned to believe that loyalty to the tribe isn't just the supreme civic virtue; it's the only civic virtue. That conditioning will pay off.\n\nBut if you're the sort of hopeful sucker who hasn't given up completely on America, there are a few numbers floating around to suggest that I'm wrong.\n\nKevin Williamson flagged one yesterday. According to the latest New York Times national poll, Harris \"has begun making inroads among Republicans: 9 percent said they planned to support her, up slightly from 5 percent last month.\" The same survey found that 17 percent of voters are still persuadable and that they're now evenly split between the candidates after favoring Trump slightly last month. Some right-leaners have begun to tilt left, it seems.\n\nOr consider Wisconsin, where the race is within half a point . Five percent of voters there are undecided in Marquette Law School's polling , and they lean toward Trump by around 20 points-and no wonder, as the single largest cohort in the group turns out to be Republicans and Republican-leaning independents.\n\nBut they haven't managed to convince themselves to commit to him yet. With less than a month to go before Election Day, their misgivings have remained strong enough to keep them in the persuadable column for Harris.\n\nOne more. On Wednesday The Bulwark published new data from the left-leaning polling firm Blueprint indicating a surprisingly large share of Republicans and independents who voted for Haley in this year's GOP primary plan to vote Democratic next month. Trump leads Harris 45-36 among the group; four years ago, the same voters favored him over Biden by a spread of 59-28. Among Republican Haley voters specifically, his support has dropped from 64 percent in 2020 to 49 percent now. Among independent Haley voters, it fell from 48 percent to 38 percent.\n\nA marginal shift in a marginal-ish group wouldn't matter in a race where either candidate had even a small cushion in polling. But when the battleground numbers look like this , every crossover vote is meaningful. If there were any doubt as to why Harris wanted America's most outspoken Never Trump conservative on the trail in Wisconsin last week , the data I just gave ought to remove it. \"Haley Republicans\" could actually decide the presidency.\n\nWhich raises an obvious question: Why hasn't Donald Trump tapped Haley to campaign for him?\n\nIf the presidency hinges on a battle for the soul of Reaganites, it's strange that only Democrats are aggressively deploying Reaganites to fight it.\n\nMarc Thiessen pondered the mystery of Haley's absence on the trail in a column a few days ago. \"Haley voters are precisely the swing voters Trump should be targeting-Americans who are willing to vote for a Republican but are hesitant to do so for Trump,\" he wrote. \"He should be appearing with her at rallies and basking in her endorsement.\" Why isn't he?\n\nCould it be that he's asked her and she turned him down, not wanting to dirty her hands by abetting an authoritarian's return to power? Of course not. She's already endorsed Trump, spoken on his behalf at the Republican convention, and assured CBS News last month that she's \"on standby\" and \"ready if he ever needs me\" to campaign for him. Nikki Haley doesn't care about America's future; she cares about Nikki Haley's.\n\nThiessen's own explanation for why she's MIA is surely correct in part: \"Trump considers her disloyal for having run against him\" and doesn't want to give her the satisfaction of telling her that he needs her help to win. The same goes for Ron DeSantis, who was conspicuously missing from Trump events this year even before Florida's weather became his full-time preoccupation. A man as vain, vindictive, and consumed with fealty as King Donald won't lightly forgive the vanquished pretenders to his throne, even if his vendetta risks costing him votes.\n\nAnd that might be particularly true for Haley. She wasn't just personally disloyal in challenging him, she also sought to topple his kingdom and bring about a Reaganite restoration in doing so. The highest priority of MAGA populists is consolidating the power they've gained over the GOP since 2015 by marginalizing traditional conservatives, even if that means nominating unelectable nutjobs over centrist Republicans in primaries. Go figure that the populist-in-chief might feel a special aversion to empowering a vestige of the right's ancien régime like Haley to carry him over the finish line.\n\nUltimately, though, I suspect Trump hasn't called on Haley for the simple reason that he doesn't-or didn't-believe that he needs her. Why would he? Haley bowed out of the presidential race in March by warning him to reach out to her voters or else; he replied by mocking her and ignoring them, and she ended up endorsing him anyway. From the beginning, he recognized that conservative Republicans are some of the weakest, most pitiful people in politics . He doesn't need to offer them anything to get them to vote or campaign for him. They'll do it for reasons of pure tribalism.\n\nListen to the man himself. At a fundraiser in June, Trump told a crowd of donors that he doesn't like Haley and wasn't worried about offending her supporters by declining to make her his running mate. \"All those people are going to come vote for us anyway,\" he shrugged. \"Who are they going to vote for?\"\n\nWho indeed? See why I'm bearish on the \"Republicans for Harris\" vote next month?\n\nAs much as he might disdain having to call on Haley, though, the polling leaves him little choice. If we're destined for pure toss-ups in the battlegrounds, as seems increasingly likely, he'll need every weapon available.\n\nHis ego will resist it. But as his aides bring him the data I listed above, throwing a jolt of fear into him that Haley Republicans are at last ready to jump ship, he'll conclude that he can't risk leaving Nikki Haley on the sidelines any longer. Losing this election doesn't just mean feeling embarrassed, remember. It means prison.\n\nWe'll see her by his side soon, creating a true arms race between the parties to deploy as many Reaganite surrogates as each can muster to campaign for center-right votes. And Trump will have the advantage: As admirable as Cassidy Hutchinson, Sarah Matthews, and Alyssa Farah Griffin are in hitting the trail for Harris, they lack the stature of respected Republican governors like Brian Kemp, Glenn Youngkin, Chris Sununu, and Mike DeWine. Most \"normie\" conservative officials are supporting Trump this year, to their lasting disgrace.\n\nUnder those circumstances, with both sides scrambling to arm up and create competing \"permission structures\" for Haley Republicans to support their candidate, is Mitt Romney really going to sit this race out?\n\nHe's not just any ol' Never Trumper, you know. He's the last pre-Trump Republican nominee for president. The only person arguably better positioned to appeal to mainstream conservatives' nostalgia for the old GOP is George W. Bush, and Dubya carries a ton of baggage from his presidency that might weigh Harris down by association. Besides, Bush has kept his mouth shut through the tumult of the MAGA years, depriving him of the civic cred that Romney has accumulated over time with Trump-skeptical righties. At this point, Mitt's endorsement might mean more with the center-right swing contingent.\n\nRomney biting his tongue also forces Harris to do more of the work in courting the center right, which carries political risks. \"The base of the Democratic Party does not get super excited about Vice President Harris pursuing Dick Cheney harder than she's pursuing voters for whom Gaza is the top policy issue,\" a co-founder of the anti-war group Uncommitted National Movement complained recently. Ideally Never Trumpers like Mitt would be out on their own on the trail drumming up votes for the Democrat; the more Harris herself has to pick up his slack, the more ambivalent progressives might come to feel about her. Annoying reliable voters on the left to woo reluctant voters in the middle is quite a gamble.\n\nWhat's most obnoxious about the reason for Mitt's formal neutrality, though, is how naive it is.\n\nDespite what Romney seems to think, choosing not to endorse Harris is itself a choice. By hinting that he'll vote for her but refusing to call on other Reaganites to join him, he's somehow landed on a position that's both likely to do Harris harm and to piss off Republicans whom he imagines might come crawling back to him someday.\n\nMy former colleague Andrew Egger addressed his strategy in appropriately mocking terms: \"You've reduced your influence by letting everyone know how you're gonna vote-but you've minimized your impact by not formally announcing your vote. Well done!\" Worse, by continuing to observe the Republican commandment that thou shalt not endorse Democrats, even over fascists , Mitt is signaling to otherwise persuadable conservatives that, yes indeed, crossing the aisle remains a grave partisan sin that even a maverick like him doesn't lightly commit.\n\nBy declining to create an affirmative \"permission structure\" for Haley Republicans to support Harris, in other words, Romney risks implicitly creating one to oppose her. The permission he's granting, wittingly or not, is for fellow Trump-skeptics on the right to treat their disagreements with Harris on policy as a sufficient reason to withhold their votes from her despite knowing that Trump will benefit from them doing so. If ever there were a Reaganite whom you would think is attuned to the poisonous dynamic of the Republican hostage crisis and eager to end it, you would think it'd be Mitt. But no.\n\nHis reward for his scrupulous neutrality was Trump saying this at a rally in Pennsylvania on Wednesday: \"I think stupid Mitt Romney was at like 4% [among Hispanic voters] or something. How about him? How do you like having him as a partner? Mitt Romney? Aren't we glad we're getting him the hell out of here?\"\n\nWin or lose, Trump will remain the most influential voice in the Republican Party until 2028, certainly enough so to thwart any \"rebuilding\" effort by Romney. And Mitt is 77 years old; Nikki Haley can afford to play the long game in gaining influence within the GOP, but Romney cannot. He doesn't even have the excuse of being on the ballot in this year's Utah Senate race to justify his refusal to endorse Harris. He's retiring. He's free to support whomever he likes.\n\nThere's simply no leverage to be gained for him on the right at this point by staying neutral, plainly. Yet somehow he's convinced himself that making a Trump victory more likely by withholding his \"permission\" for conservatives to vote for Harris will lead to a more Romney-esque GOP in the near-ish term. As a feat of logic, it's downright bizarre.\n\nBut maybe this isn't about logic. Maybe it's about fear.\n\nLast month Romney told The Atlantic that he worries his family will become a target of President Trump's \"retribution\" tour next year. \"How am I going to protect 25 grandkids, two great-grandkids? I've got five sons, five daughters-in-law-it's like, we're a big group,\" he wondered. In light of Trump's campaign rhetoric and how he conducted business during his first term , Mitt's fear is eminently reasonable. If you vote Republican next month, that's what you're voting for-presidential \"enemies' lists\" and wanton abuse of federal power to harass political enemies. Don't kid yourself.\n\nRomney has been a profile in courage in trying to hold Trump accountable for his civic offenses over the last five years. But he failed, thanks to the corruption of Republican voters, and now he faces a credible threat of reprisal. Maybe his fear of antagonizing his nemesis at this point, now that he's so close to regaining power, finally got to him and steered him away from formally throwing in with Harris. A grandfather has to look out for his grandkids, after all.\n\nI hope he changes his mind, though. In various ways, it would be good for America if Trump not only lost this election but lost it due to a surprisingly strong crossover vote for the Democrat. Reaganites would have reestablished themselves as a political force; populists would have learned that there's a price for authoritarianism; and, maybe , the Trumpist urge to blame conservatives for Trump's defeat would take some of the wind out of the sails of their \"rigged election\" nonsense.\n\nBetter that they regard the outcome as legitimate and decided by Romney-esque \"traitors\" than that they sink into febrile paranoia about another grand yet somehow unprovable conspiracy.
