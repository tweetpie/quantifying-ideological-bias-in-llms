      "text": "When women become allies to save watersheds and wildlife\n\nThe word \"Minnesota\" derives from one of two Dakota words, either Mni Sóta meaning clear blue water or Mnissota meaning cloudy water. Just one letter can change the entire meaning. Just one oil spill could ruin the entire ecosystem.\n\nI traveled to northern Minnesota with Jane Fonda and Tessa Wick in March to stand with the Ojibwe who are fighting a massive assault on their ancestral territory. Line 3 is a pipeline that was built in the 1960s and currently has 900 structural problems according to Enbridge, the Canadian company that owns it. Under the guise of replacing it, Enbridge is in fact abandoning the old one and aggressively laying the infrastructure to expand it into a larger pipeline with greater capacity. The proposed monstrosity would snake through 200 pristine lakes and rivers in northern Minnesota including watersheds for the wild rice that is unique to this part of the world and has been intrinsic to the Anishinaabeg/Ojibwe way of life for centuries. A spill could permanently destroy rice beds as well as the fish and wildlife habitat. Enbridge has had over 800 spills in the last 15 years, most notably the largest inland oil spill in U.S. history when 1.2 million gallons leaked into the Kalamazoo River in 2010. A spill is inevitable.\n\nDuring his lame-duck period, Donald Trump approved Line 3, in spite of no environmental impact study. It is currently under review. Now that justice has been rendered in the George Floyd case, there is hope that Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison will turn his attention to the social and environmental injustice of Line 3. President Biden should overturn the Army Corps permit to Enbridge as he did with the Keystone XL pipeline.\n\nOur first stop was at a compound on the White Earth Reservation. It houses 8th Fire Solar , a facility where tribal members are building thermal solar panels. It is the headquarters for Honor the Earth , an organization founded by Winona LaDuke, with the mission of creating awareness and support for Native environmental issues. Winona is a magnetic and fiery leader who has long been a vital force protecting the earth. In addition to harvesting wild rice (manoomin) and building solar panels, Winona runs a fledgling hemp business, taps maple trees, and has ventured into small-batch coffee roasting. The people on the White Earth Reservation are making every effort to be self-sufficient through sustainable activities.\n\nWe were served delicious buffalo egg rolls while the women water protectors shared stories of getting roughed up by the local police for protesting the pipeline. They were strip-searched and kept in overcrowded cells-in the time of COVID-19. The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission has created an Enbridge-funded account to pay for policing Enbridge opponents-meaning they are paid more when they harass and arrest activists. When we were convoying to a press conference, the two women driving in front of us were pulled over for not signaling 100 feet before turning. Fortunately, they were both constitutional lawyers-and white, I might add. After delaying them for 15 minutes, the officer realized what she was up against and backed down.\n\nOn the banks of the Crow Wing River, against a backdrop of Ojibwe grandmothers in traditional garb, Jane and Winona shared a panel with Tara Houska, an Ojibwe, Yale-educated tribal lawyer who hung up her suit in D.C. to come back and live with other water protectors on a 70-acre resistance camp called the Giniw Collective.\n\nJane's presence had brought out a slew of media. She has become the wise woman educating and inspiring her vast network of old and new fans. She spoke knowledgeably on the salient issues surrounding climate change. She emphasized the importance of good-paying jobs being in place as we transition from fossil fuels to sustainable energy. She mentioned a statement Winona made about a moment when we had the choice to have a carbohydrate history or a hydrocarbon history, and we chose the wrong one, adding, \"It's time to correct that.\" Tara explained the illegitimacy of Line 3 being built on public lands. She has joined the charge of young activists fed up with ineffectual political policy who are using their bodies and agency to say \"no more.\" Winona quoted Arundhati Roy, urging us to see the \"pandemic as portal\" : \"We must go through the portal leaving dead ideas behind, ready to imagine a new world.\"\n\nThe crowd was energized; everybody was wearing red. There was a festive feeling of optimism in the air. At key points, a giant black bear puppet roared with approval or grunted with displeasure. Indigenous drummers drummed. River otters played.\n\nFour years ago, I accompanied Jane on a flyover of the Canadian tar sands in Fort McMurray, Alberta, source of the dirty oil that Enbridge exports. From the air, the open-pit mines made me think of cancer sores with the outgoing vessels bringing disease to the rest of the body. The jobs pay well. It's how my sister and her husband bought their home. Workers go where the money is. But it's a dying industry. Justin Trudeau enthusiastically signed on to the Paris climate accord and vowed to invest in renewable energy sources, but he has bowed to the corporate powers who are squeezing out every ounce of filthy lucre from the tar sands before they collapse. Not only is tar sand extraction the dirtiest and most inefficient process, but it's also the most uneconomical. If the government took the bold step of subsidizing other sectors of the economy such as renewables, housing and transportation, to the degree they subsidize the tar sands, it would be far more beneficial to the economy and people's lives-in the long run. But they are shortsighted.\n\nThe fish and wildlife that the Métis First Nations of the Athabasca region have traditionally subsisted on are riddled with deformities and tumors. Eighty-seven percent of the community believes the tar sands are responsible. We sat with Cece, who was a heavy equipment operator for seven years. At 60 years old, she had outlived all her coworkers, including her husband, who died of cancer the year before. She ran for tribal chief on a platform of pushing for stricter tar sands regulations, but the industry bribed her opponent with the promise of a senior care facility if he would show his support. She lost by one vote. Divide and conquer, the age-old tactic of domination.\n\nWith Line 3, Enbridge does not want to repeat the clashes they encountered at Standing Rock, so they have pumped money into targeted communities. The chronic neglect of government on the reservations, exacerbated by the economic downturn from the pandemic, has served to Enbridge's advantage. People need to feed their families, and Enbridge is there with the jobs. Enbridge created a trust from which the Fond du Lac tribal government doles out monthly payments to their members. It's a terrible dilemma for individuals who fear reprisal if they express opposition. The project has created deep divisions within the Indigenous community, but the vast majority are fervently against it.\n\nWith people coming to work from all over the country, the Enbridge man camps are potential COVID-19 superspreaders. According to the Violence Intervention Project in Thief River Falls, at least two women have been sexually assaulted. Numerous women say they have been harassed by pipeline workers and do not feel safe. Two Enbridge employees based in Wisconsin were recently arrested for sex trafficking.\n\nJane did a Skyped interview with Lawrence O'Donnell on MSNBC. In a breathtaking six-and-a-half-minute uninterrupted spiel, she laid out the micro and the macro of the entire situation. Later, she worried it might have come across as manic. No, Tessa and I assured her, it came across as urgent.\n\nAfter a long drive, Tara led us down a narrow, snow-covered dirt road to a small encampment of tents where they were sugaring the maple trees. Sap is collected and continuously poured into a gigantic hand-hewn pot mounted over an open fire, then reduced down for several days. It's very labor-intensive-the ratio is 26 gallons of sap to make one gallon of syrup. They are not selling the syrup; they want to hold on to it in case there's a shortage or some other catastrophe occurs. They're holding on to their wild rice too. Everyone is on tenterhooks waiting for a decision from the White House. Their future hangs in the balance.\n\nBarbara Williams is a Canadian musician, actress, and activist.

      "text": "We must dismantle the war machine to avoid the climate catastrophe\n\nHere we are, a full three decades after NASA scientist James Hansen raised the specter of a looming climate crisis with Congress , looking at the first generation of severely impacted youth and telling them they're right: We have completely squandered their future. For too long, our dominant culture has practiced unsustainable growth and consumption, ushering in the end of a habitable planet and with it civilization as we know it. Those most impacted are the communities who have contributed the least to climate change, a direct extension of the settler colonization project that has unfolded across the globe over hundreds of years.\n\nJane Fonda and her Fire Drill Fridays are linking social movements across issues, eyeing the connections between the myriad problems we see causing climate chaos, many of them rooted in capitalist consumer culture. From the need to tease apart incarceration from profit to outrage at our treatment of asylum-seekers at our southern border, we've witnessed rapid wins in the movement to divest public dollars from the private prison industry after years of hard work behind the scenes. The same asylum-seekers who are fleeing nations ravaged by wars and conflicts-many driven directly by U.S. policy-and the impacts of climate crisis are being held in appalling conditions in concentration camps and prisons, many of them run by the private prison industry. We are encouraged by intersectional organizing, and thrilled that Jane is connecting the dots that link militarism, weapons corporations, migration, and the climate crisis. We are clear on the impact: the Pentagon is the single largest consumer of oil on the planet , but the nationwide call for a Green New Deal has not yet given attention to our military spending as either a massive driver of the climate crisis that cannot be ignored, nor as a source of much-needed funding for a project as massive as the Green New Deal.\n\nMovements to divest from the military and movements to divest from fossil fuels often face the same bad actors. Recent actions targeting the massive asset manager BlackRock are drawing attention to their investments in companies behind Amazon deforestation. Investing in these companies undermines our ability to maintain a livable planet, namely by destroying the forests that are the lungs of the earth in the Amazon basin. Here at CODEPINK, we have also given considerable attention to BlackRock because they are the world's top investor in weapons manufacturers, but even this more explicitly anti-war action connects to the climate crisis. The same weapons that are used in wars and conflicts all over the world are a crucial component of the war machine that makes up a significant portion of the Pentagon's fossil fuel use- the U.S. military has released 1.2 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases since the start of the global war on terror in 2001 . Moreover, those same weapons are a major factor in conflicts that lead to migration by asylum-seekers-weapons that are in turn produced by corporations that are propped up by our public dollars, to the detriment of our communities . When our public institutions invest public money in weapons corporations like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman, they are underpinning the war machine that draws public dollars away from projects benefiting our communities and puts them into an already bloated defense budget. There is a clear thread running from the Pentagon budget to weapons corporations to our impoverished communities to migrants fleeing wars and drought to greenhouse gas emissions driving the climate crisis. Imagine a snake consuming its own body: that is the war machine's connection to climate breakdown. We must begin rapidly removing our public dollars from the war machine if we are to save humanity and the planet-which, like the climate crisis and the war machine, cannot be separated.\n\nThe time has arrived to build the next big divestment movement made up of people coming together across the planet to divest from the war machine-by withdrawing our public dollars from weapons corporations and putting them into local needs, including local green new deals, housing, health care, and education. The path to divestment has been laid by successful movements before ours; it is paved with the South African Apartheid regime, with coal and gas extraction companies, with gun manufacturers and tobacco companies, and with the private prison industry. The opportunities for divestment from the war machine abound. Cities, public pension funds, and university endowments invest public dollars in private corporations that often include weapons corporations, and elected public servants often accept campaign contributions from weapons-makers. Together we can demand that they divest because it is morally unacceptable to build our communities on top of global conflicts. At the same time, we must demand that we instead invest our public resources in projects that positively impact our communities, starting first with a rapid response to the climate crisis that is exacerbated by endless wars.\n\nJoin Jane Fonda Thursday night, November 7, for her teach-in on the connections between war and climate chaos. On Friday, I will bring this message to the Fire Drill Friday rally on the east lawn of the U.S. Capitol to call on all of us to engage to Divest from War . We will then march to the White House to call out the current resident who just took steps to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement. Join in person or on the Fire Drill Friday livestream .\n\nJodie Evans is an activist and co-founder of CODEPINK .\n\nThis article was produced by Local Peace Economy , a project of the Independent Media Institute."

      "text": "Kathy Griffin still gets death threats: 'People want to kill me on stage'\n\nShe's been pushing buttons for three decades now as a comic, a reality star, an actress. But with one incendiary photograph , she became something else: an alleged credible threat in the eyes of the FBI and a vocal authority on the First Amendment rights for all of us. The owner of the second most famous blue dress in presidential politics has a hell of a story, and she's turning into a new documentary performance film, \"A Hell of a Story.\" It's premiering for a one night only special Fathom Event on July 31.\n\nGriffin joined us for a recent \"Salon Talks\" interview, where we discussed comedy, death threats and the movie nobody thought she'd make.\n\nYou went through a period two years ago where it didn't look like any of this was going to happen.\n\nNo. I still don't have a day of paid work ahead of me the rest of my life. For God's sake, go see this movie. You're going to laugh, or cry, or whatever.\n\nIt's a docu-comedy. At first it was a comedy concert film, because nobody in television would touch me or even look at a 30 second demo reel. Then my publicist Alex got me into South by Southwest and they played the concert movie there and it did well. Then Fathom Events - thank you, Fathom Events - decided to show it as this one night, one showing only thing, which is very popular. I begged, and they let me have the first third of it be documentary footage. Honey, I'm telling you, this is raw. This is iPhone, ugly-crying Kathy raw. Raw, but truly in the moment. Get ready.\n\nI want to talk about that. Because it is fully in the moment, ugly-crying Kathy. You called the tour \"Laugh Your Head Off.\" When you look at this movie, you run out dancing onto that stage of your tour every night in the blue dress [from the photo]. Kathy, it seems at a certain point, something in you decided, \"I'm going to take full ownership of this.\"\n\nWell, I had to. I did every show like it was my last and I still do. The death threats are still coming. The reason I wore the dress is I just thought, I want the audience to know what they're getting. Because I had a lot of really, really bad advice initially.\n\nSome of it in the form of public letters.\n\nYes, many, many public letters from Trump supporters, or invasion of the body snatchers or walking dead, however you want to refer to that group. I thought, OK. I want to wear the blue dress on tour because, first of all, I played a lot of countries I've never even played before because of the photo. The photo actually allowed me to play countries that I never could. Non-English speaking countries, Singapore, the Nordic countries, Australia, the great halls. I played the Sydney Opera House and London Palladium.\n\nThe poster was similar to this. It was a play on the photo. I thought, you might as well let the audience know I'm not going to run away from this. When the wall of sh*t fell on me, I would have very powerful Hollywood idiots going, \"Here's what's going to work. Never say the word Trump again. Don't curse. Don't swear. Don't ever bring up this picture again.\" I was like, no, no. This picture is going to be with me the rest of my life. I decided to lean in, not in a Sheryl Sandberg way.\n\nI name names now because I have zero f*cks left to give. I'm the mayor of Zerof*cksville, thank you, reporting for duty. I have a standup comedy disorder and the show started two hours. There were some times that I would do three hours and 40 minutes. One time I passed out in Dublin and the New York Times was there, which I didn't know. That made me feel fancy that they sent someone, but I passed out in the wings. I'm happy to be alive every minute. Trust me.\n\nThat is a big thing for you. Because, as you say in the film, your sister was receiving death threats.\n\nMy sister was battling cancer and, unfortunately, she lost the battle. One of the things I did was I had shaved my head in solidarity because I knew it would make her laugh, and it did. She would always play with my head. Then, the right wing media would see a photo and they'd say, \"She's become more unhinged, she shaved her head.\"\n\nI was in a place, and still am, where I'll do anything for a laugh. It was an illustration of life goes on . I tried to shield my sister from as much of it as possible, but these Trumpers are so hardcore. I have been doxxed so many times since that photo that there were Trumpers that actually tracked down my sister in the hospital and she had to deal with death threats until the day she died. They tracked down my mom, who is 99, in her retirement village. That scared the hell out of her. And me, of course, they tracked down very easily.\n\nIt was an eye-opening thing. I'm eternally an optimist, but it is something like I've never seen and experienced. A large group of people, though the minority, have such vitriol that this is what they would consider some sort of badge of honor.\n\nAnd that this would then be a full time job for them.\n\nI don't know what's going on. Roseanne Barr, who I used to know as a normal person many years ago, I heard her say that she doesn't troll on her official account anymore, but she keeps opening other troll accounts so she can troll people. God forbid any of you post anything positive about me. I apologize in advance. You're going to get a lot of robots in broken English, or Roseanne, I'm not sure. These are grown people. I'm a 58-year-old woman. I was confronted by people my age, older, younger, and it still goes on.\n\nI actually was in England where I got to give a speech at Oxford University. Perhaps you've heard of it. I gave a speech about the First Amendment, because now I'm a political, First Amendment comic and that's fine with me. I love them both.\n\nI was in England to give the speech and very honored. The driver who took me from London Heathrow to the hotel told me that he recognized me from the photo. I immediately started apologizing for Trump. He said, \"He's the greatest president ever.\" I said, \"You're from Morocco. You know what he said about Africa being sh*thole countries?\" He said, \"I don't believe that.\" It's kind of a long drive, and it was raining, and it was on a freeway. And he said, \"If we were in Morocco, I could cut your tongue out.\" That was just a few months ago. People are having a hard time getting over my little photo.\n\nBut you have chosen, as you said, to lean into this. You have said, \"I'm not going to go away. I'm not going to hide. I'm not going to go into seclusion. You want to bring it up? I'll bring it up first.\" That has been your methodology from a very early point in this. Yet as you talk about in the film, even in spite of all of this taking control of the narrative, people always ask, 'You probably have like no regrets, right?'\"\n\nTon of regrets. I have a scroll of regrets. That's how you learn.\n\nThis has been a process of you learning and evolving in real time in front of the world. I know you have regrets, but what are you proud of about all of this?\n\nThe most important thing and the reason I made the film is, it's just so important to me to show to younger people, gay people, people of color, marginalized groups, that they got me, but they never got me down. My joke is, long after I kick the bucket, some young person is going to see this movie and go, \"That crazy redhead. They knocked her about a little bit, but she got back up again.\"\n\nI think that's really what life is. You have to keep getting back up. That's what I love about comedy. When you've had decades and decades of bombing, and then doing well, and doing OK, and then not so well, you do learn every time and you learn how to get back up. This was such a giant event. The fact that it was historic is why I was so hellbent on making the film.\n\nI was so disappointed when nobody would make it a comedy special. I have the world record for more TV comedy specials than any comedian, male or female. I thought, OK. I can't go in the front door, I have to figure out how to slide in the side window again, which is my whole career.\n\nI think that's the story of women. I think that right now we're seeing more than ever that the browning of America that is scaring the sh*t out of these guys. A lot of the guys that came at me after the photo, the Jeff Zuckers, and the agency heads, and the studio heads. I almost laugh because these are the same guys who told me 20 years ago my nose is too big, or I'm too old, or I'm too ugly. I've generated billions of dollars of revenue for all these companies. I've worked for every network you can imagine. I've made probably about $75 million in my own career. I'm an earner. My tour made $4.4 million gross. I spent most of it on security.\n\nI thought, I have to keep proving it in ways that different groups can understand. If I can make people laugh, that's always the first and foremost. But I still have these old white dinosaurs that I have to give all the analytics too. The stuff they say to my face to this day is just unreal. These gross, middle-aged, ugly guys with the trophy wife telling me I'm never going to work again; I'm a failure; I'm too this or I'm too that. I'm just saying, well, you were happy to take the 10% all those years. It's a real bite and scratch back.\n\nYou and certainly people in your wake are coming along and saying, actually, you know what? Maybe we could do things a little differently.\n\nLet's all collaborate. But my goodness, to be spending all this time telling people that they're nothing, or worthless, or never going to work again. Also, I'm 58 years old. I wouldn't be doing this if I was 28. I wouldn't have the balls. I'd be too scared. But, at 58, I'm going, if you're not going to stand up for something, sit down.  I'll take the heat for it. I always will.\n\nBut this one is important. This administration, there has never been anything like it in my lifetime. I remember watching the Watergate hearings as a little kid and being riveted. I can't imagine we're going through something even worse than Watergate now. Everyone's complicit. Everyone is bored, or they're blaming the Democrats because they don't understand what a whip count is, and it's all Nancy Pelosi's fault. Well, she doesn't have the votes yet, even though it's the Democratic House. It's these simple things that - I grew up where you had to know by the time you were at least like 12.\n\nI think Trump and his administration, they embody the dumbing down of America. I'm just a comic, but the stuff that I talk about in this movie, it's information people need to know. People need to know they can take your phone at the airport. They can take your sim card, no questions asked. No elected [official] can get you out of it. I was put under a federal investigation by two federal agencies. I had to testify under oath. I was on the no fly list for two months.\n\nI want to ask you about that, Kathy. You talk about the part of what you had to do, testifying under oath, and what they wanted you to do. Can you just describe a little bit about what was floated to you?\n\nThey started the investigation without even calling me or saying anything. I actually made phone calls to the other folks who allegedly made a threat towards Trump. Snoop Dog didn't pay a price . Johnny Depp , the singer Morrissey, Peter Fonda, and some of them got a call from the Secret Service, maybe. Bette Midler got a call from the Secret Service. I said, \"Please tell me they're not putting you under investigation,\" and she said no.\n\nWith me, they just put me under an open investigation by the Secret Service and the U.S. Attorney's Office ready to prosecute if they found anything, searched my home and did no-knock raids like I'm Paul Manafort . Put me on the no fly list for terrorists. They made it very clear to me that they were considering charging me with conspiracy to assassinate the president of the United States.\n\nIt's never happened in the history of this country. I even called Jane Fonda and she said, \"The local PD got me, but not the feds.\" I talked to David Steinberg and he said, \"I was on the Nixon list. But those were secret, which is a little bit different.\" The great Lenny Bruce was bothered by local PD. I talked to a great First Amendment attorney, Ted Boutrous, who's going to do the Q & A with me after the Fathom screening on July 31st. He did the legal heavy lifting. He said, \"Yeah. I looked it up and it's never happened like this before.\"\n\nI never even had the opportunity to say \"Hey, hey, hey, I'm a comic. I do outrageous things.\" I think that was very much on purpose. I think it came directly from the Trump family and from Jeff Sessions, to be put under investigation by the Secret Service, the Department of Justice.\n\nI have to say the FBI was fantastic. They were over at my house many times talking to me about different levels of threats. The day that I filmed the concert part of the movie, the FBI did what's called a no-knock raid. They were letting me know that there was a new threat and it was Cesar Sayoc, the pipe bomb or the MAGA bomber . Three weeks prior they had called me to say that I was on his kill list, so I knew that. They came over that day to say that while they were interrogating him, they discovered that he had a different list and he had shared it with like-minded people.\n\nI said, \"I have a performance tonight. What should I be worried about?\" They said, \"We can't say. It's an open investigation.\" Most of my death threats are people want to kill me on stage. So I've got the wands, and all the metal detectors. I found out that, when my tour was canceled, it was mostly robo-calls and stuff like that. But the lengths people will go to to make whatever point it is they think they're making is still something I'm trying to work through.\n\nWhen you think of what happened with Amy Schumer , these insane people really will go out there and commit acts of violence. Acts of violence, particularly against women. That is a very real thing.\n\nYou go through that and you talk about how they wanted you to perp walk, which is astonishing.\n\nMy lawyer called me and said the Department of Justice was calling his office every single day for two months saying, \"Will she come in? Is she coming in today?\" I kept saying, \"Wait, what am I coming in for exactly?\" That's when he said, \"They're looking to possibly charge you with conspiracy to assassinate the president of the United States.\" I didn't know anything about the system. I've never been arrested. He said, \"I'm negotiating with the U.S. Attorney's Office.\" I said, \"When did they get involved?\n\nHe negotiated a situation where I could be interrogated under oath in his office, because they wanted me to actually do a perp walk in the jumpsuit and the cuffs to the jail in downtown L.A. to get the footage. That's when I lost it. That's when it did cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees. But truly, I was just not going to do that perp walk because I thought, well, that's going to live forever. Who knows who's going to see it in the future and what they're going to think? More importantly, what kind of police state message does that send?\n\nBy the way, if I had violated the law, I would. If I violated the First Amendment, I would. But I didn't. I knew, if I did that perp walk, people would think I did, and people already thought that I should be locked up and had broken the law. It's just very important to me to let people know, if you've got a 13 year-old kid and they put that same picture up on Twitter or something, they shouldn't have to go through a federal investigation and go through the no fly list and things like that. It was really just harassment.\n\nKathy, before we go, I want to do a lightning round with you. I'm going to say a word or phrase and I want you to give me something.\n\nLove it.\n\nMike Pence.\n\nGoebbels. Watching those men in the cage doing nothing, nothing, but saying, \"We've been here 40 days,\" and with his arms folded like, good job. Appalling. Very glad that video went viral.\n\n\"Saturday Night Live.\"\n\nI watch the show. I'm a fan. It would have been nice if they had just thrown me five lines just to  let the world know I'm network friendly and I've worked for that network a long time. But it didn't happen.\n\nJack Dorsey.\n\nOh, I can't stand Dorsey. I have been begging friends for his cell number because I've got to take him down to Chinatown. He has way too much power. It seems like he has very far right leanings that are very frightening to me. The folks that he lets spread their venom on Twitter, and yet he acts like he doesn't quite know how dangerous it is, I don't believe it for a second.\n\n2020.\n\nI'm all about the down-ballot. I think we're way too obsessed with the presidential candidates. We have an amazing stable, so don't let the Republicans convince you we're a mess. We have a great stable. But I'm all about the down-ballot. Your local representatives, your state senators, your United States senators, your congress representatives, your county supervisors, these are all elected positions. Twenty minutes of research for your district, I swear, and you'll know how to vote. Vote down-ballot. Change the Senate.\n\nFriends.\n\nI'm down to three. You're one of them, so I have four now. I'm going to just be honest about that. I lost about 75% of my friends and they just didn't come back. I'm still in a phase where I'm toxic. I've been a one-man band my whole career anyway. I've never been someone that was like cloaked with a studio, or a movie franchise, or anything like that. So, thank God for stand up, and thank God that nobody can stop people from buying tickets."

      "text": "The scam of the Reagan-era neoliberalism is crumbling - and there's a battle for its replacement\n\nDo we stand on the edge of a grand new progressive era, with good wages for all, racial and gender equality and justice, and a reduction of the political power of reactionary forces in America? Or will the next president gleefully overthrow American democracy, shutter the free press, and imprison those who object?\n\nWhen Mussolini put Antonio Gramsci, the founder of Italy's Communist Party, in prison in 1927, Gramsci wrote from his prison cell that, \"[T]he old is dying and the new cannot be born; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear.\"\n\nTwo forces in American politics are similarly on a collision course today: neoliberalism and progressivism. In the friction zone between the two, the \"morbid symptom\" of Trump's white-power neofascism is claiming territory and has largely seized the power structures of the GOP.\n\nWhether American history goes in cycles, as Strauss and Howe posit in The Fourth Turning , or merely \"rhymes\" as in the apocryphal quote from Twain, we can identify periods when a particular political and economic philosophy holds court - and the periods when that philosophies or regimes begin to collapse.\n\nThe Fourth Turning posits roughly 80-year cycles in American history, each ending with an economic crash and a war, then each rebooting into a new progressive era: the Depression of the early 1770s and the American Revolution, the Panic of 1856 and the Civil War, the 1930s Republican Great Depression and World War II.\n\nIt's been about 80 years since the end of that war, indicating, if this theory is right, that a crash and war may be around the corner.\n\nAnother way of looking at the cycles of American history is through the lens of \"regimes,\" as articulated by Stephen Skowronek in his 1993 book The Politics Presidents Make and recently revived in The New York Times by Professor Corey Robin .\n\n\"The Jeffersonian regime lasted from 1800 to 1828,\" Robin writes, \"the Jacksonian regime, from 1828 to 1860; the Republican regime, from 1860 to 1932; the New Deal order, from 1932 to 1980.\"\n\nThe Reagan order is thus now almost certainly in its calcification stage, becoming brittle, more fragile, and less vigorous as inevitably happens with every turn of regimes.\n\nIn my opinion, the progressive movement - for example the unionization effort where Kellogg's fired their workers and irate young people crashed their job-application server - is the ascendant group that will soon take power and hold the country for another turn of history.\n\nUnless, of course, Trump's neofascists succeed in closing off that option by utterly destroying our system of government.\n\nEvidence abounds that the Reagan era or regime is rapidly disintegrating; that the Trump neofascist movement isn't strong or broad-based enough to replace it (although they can cause considerable violence and distress); and, like in the 1930s and 1960s, that a young progressive movement is rapidly acquiring and consolidating political power.\n\nIf I'm right and that's what's happening, it's almost certainly because Americans are realizing that Reagan's neoliberalism regime (which was carried on by the following five presidents) was largely a scam designed to disempower the working class while enriching the already well-off.\n\nAll its vaunted rhetoric about \"fiscal responsibility\" and \"conservative values\" was just a smokescreen to hide naked theft, racism and misogyny.\n\nIn overthrowing FDR's New Deal politics and economics, Reagan's era:\n\nReagan, of course, had what he thought was a good rationale: he was holding back a growing tide of social change that intimidated wealthy older white men like himself and, he believed , threatened \"The American Way.\"\n\nIt started back in 1951, when Russell Kirk electrified a small coterie of conservatives like William F. Buckley and Barry Goldwater with his prediction that the middle class was growing too rich, and the inevitable result would be massive and widespread social upheaval in this country.\n\nThis little band of conservatives predicted that if the middle class continued to gain income and wealth faster than the top 1% (which was the case in 1951), soon \"the rabble\" of working class people would be so wealthy that they'd feel safe challenge the institutions and social norms of America.\n\nRacial minorities would demand parity with white people, these conservatives warned us, women would disobey their husbands and leap into competition in the nation's workplaces, and young people would openly defy their elders.\n\nThe result, they predicted, would be social chaos and out of that chaos would come a new and perhaps even communist - certainly more socialist - America, unrecognizable to the John Wayne-loving white men of America.\n\nFew in America took Kirk's warnings seriously at the time, as I laid out in detail in The Hidden History of American Oligarchy . Buckley was sidelined to public broadcasting and Goldwater lost the 1964 election in an historic landslide.\n\nBut then came Jane Fonda, Tim Leary and the Beatles:\n\nSuddenly, every conservative in America was reading Russell Kirk, as right-wing foundations and billionaires were rushing to fund \"conservative think tanks\" and groups to influence the media and the courts.\n\nRichard Nixon rode the white fear of this change into office that year and set the stage for the 1971 Powell Memo and the rise of Reagan ten years later. Reagan then brought to a screeching halt much of the forward motion of those three movements, along with the gay rights movement, by stripping working-class people of wealth and political power while demonizing gays around AIDS.\n\nBut nothing stays the same. Circumstances change, failures are exposed, new generations acquire power as old generations pass away. If there's a constant to politics it is this: every new cycle is eventually rejected and replaced as time moves forward.\n\nWhen Mussolini used state violence to imprison the progressive workers' movement that was then sweeping both America and Europe, Gramsci wondered out loud : \"Will the interregnum, the crisis whose historically normal solution is blocked in this way, necessarily be resolved in favor of a restoration of the old?\" Or, will this \"lead in the long run to widespread skepticism and a new 'arrangement'\"?\n\nAfter all, Gramsci noted , that \"new arrangement\" would require \"a reduction of the highest superstructures\" of politics and society, \"in other words, the possibility and necessity of creating a new culture.\"\n\nAnd, indeed, it appears that's just what's happening today in America.\n\nStarbucks just got their first unionized American store in their 50 years of existence. Kellogg's is engaging in extreme union-busting, firing and replacing striking workers, while Amazon is facing a renewed effort to unionize their warehouses.\n\nMuch like with Mussolini's state violence, the only reason there's not been a widespread and successful wave of unionization efforts in America is because multiple Supreme Court decisions since the 1960s have eroded union rights in this country so severely, tilting state power against workers.\n\nWhile last-gasp-reactionary states like Texas are fighting to put women back into the bedroom and kitchen, progressive states like California are preparing for a post-Roe America by expanding and institutionalizing women's rights to healthcare, contraception and abortion.\n\nProgressive states like Oregon have decriminalized all drugs and provide terminally ill people with a \"right to die with dignity,\" while reactionary Red states are doubling down on their death penalties and Nixon-era anti-drug laws.\n\nBifurcation, a splitting apart, appears to be the current state of America, but significant social change always happens just as \"opposite\" forces like these battle for the approval of the larger culture and its media, to soon be followed by its voters.\n\nCorey Robin points out in The New York Times how \"regimes grow brittle\" and, much like the way the Reagan regime replaced FDR's New Deal regime, we may be at the end of our generation's 40-year neoliberal experiment (my phrase, not his).\n\nFor this to actually happen, though, is going to take not just a cultural shift but an actual change in the political and legal structures Reagan's neoliberalism and its reactionary predecessors erected.\n\nIt will require, as Robin notes, ending the filibuster, overcoming the resistance of a small handful of sold-out Democrats in Congress (from Sinema/Manchin in the Senate to the \"corporate problem solvers\" in the House), expanding voting rights while ending partisan gerrymanders, and returning to an explicit right to unionize. I'd add overturning Citizens United and breaking up corporate monopolies to Robin's list.\n\nAll of these are within our grasp and, for the first time in over 50 years, are supported by the administration in power and the Democratic Party overall.\n\nThe question is whether the forces arrayed against such change, from corporate media (and social media) to packed courts to cranky billionaires, can be overcome.\n\nIn a brilliant little (63 page) book ( The Old is Dying and the New Cannot Be Born ) whose title came from Gramsci's famous quote, Nancy Fraser argues that progressive populism is today on the verge of replacing neoliberalism in its several forms.\n\nShe makes a strong argument, although notes candidly that it will take all of us, particularly requiring a widespread mobilization of the young people who will face the worst outcomes, from the ravages of climate change to the rise of neofascist bullies, if we fail.\n\nWe stand on the verge of major social and political change.\n\nThe GOP has embraced the oligarchic strong-man police-state values that reigned in the South between 1830 and 1865.\n\nThe Democratic Party is returning to its progressive and populist roots more rapidly than anybody would have thought possible just five years ago.\n\nAs the old cliché goes, we face a moment of great danger, but also one of great opportunity.\n\nThom Hartmann is a talk-show host and the author of The Hidden History of American Healthcare and more than 30+ other books in print .

      "text": "How progressives can finally make this country ours: Part two\n\nIn Part 1 I talked about the necessity of Progressives moving beyond our self-defeating defensive strategy of resistance shifting instead to an offensive electoral strategy for power making a Progressive future actually possible. I suggested that we move away from our defensive mindset by building a national multiracial electoral organization directed for the first time by a unified central Progressive Command, with regional coordinators tying us together east, west, north and south guiding and maximizing our collective efforts around the country.\n\nBut HOW do we do it? How do we shift power away from Wall St. to Main St. Although I can't give you every detail, what I can offer are enough specifics that if followed WILL get us to the future we seek.\n\nSo to start, our new national organization would originate in each state by setting up Progressive Unity Summits to get us acquainted, build trust, and start to identify a common agenda that gets us on the same page as much, as often and as soon as possible. Step 1 will be to identify every Progressive group in the state, get a building with a date and time about 2-3 weeks out and then send out a motivating invitation. Over these weeks in preparation we'll identify each group's priorities and develop an agenda that encourages building relationships toward the unity necessary for success. We'll call for the creation of local, state, and national teams that would begin the process of identifying, vetting and supporting Progressive candidates. Remember this is about electing Progressives toward majorities from the Congress to the local level. Those attending this first summit and those who later join, will comprise a statewide steering committee that will receive recommendations from each team for their collective input and support. About 2-3 months out we'll contact key Progressive groups around the country to plan our first NATIONAL Unity Summit. There we'll create a central decision-making authority, assign regional coordinators and announce our candidate preferences.\n\nAs we get underway in our states with the Summit, our individual groups would focus on two basic committees - one addressing our material necessities and the other creating a personal community design addressing an even deeper discontent that transcends our material needs. It would operate independent of but in tandem with our political agenda. This 3 part community plan will address the deeper meaning needs of our human communities focusing on the personal connections vital to our emotional, physical and collective well-being. It will include - Personal Story Circle's to get to know one another beyond the surface, Social Activities for FUN to know each other more informally, and Extended Families to minimize the isolation felt by too many of us. On the material side our priority will be the Summit developing a neighborhood outreach strategy (during and between elections) that personalizes our approach beyond just saying hooray for our issues and candidates. We will do that by reminding one another of our deeply held SHARED values of democracy, justice, equality and freedom, and our human values of kindness, empathy and simply looking out for one another. This more visceral approach is intended to address today's profound level of distrust. Do you ever wonder why the American people, who support most of our issues, are rarely there for us at the ballot box?\n\nSo what do I do NOW? First touch base with a current Progressive group. But if there are none or they're unwilling to prioritize the Summit strategy or the necessity of a personal community design then find a handful of like-minded persons and launch it yourself. That's what I personally intend to do. Eventually we'll have a website that includes exactly HOW to set up our groups but until then feel free to contact me for further discussion. rcohen2@comcast.net\n\nThrough it all remember that our future is in our hands but only if we put it there by doing the work DIFFERENTLY. Also never forget that who we've BECOME, whether collectively or individually, is NOT who we ARE. There is, as Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, an \"imprisoned splendor in each of us\" So the best is yet to come!\n\nRich Cohen has been an ACTIVE Progressive dating back to his participation in the student strike at San Francisco State College in 1968. Since then he has built Progressive groups in Los Angeles and Portland Or. including working with Tom Hayden and Jane Fonda to help bring Rent Control to the city of Los Angeles and more recently in 2015 setting up the Bernie Sanders Speakers Bureau in Portland Oregon and then preparing to do the same for Elizabeth Warren before she ended her 2020 campaign.

      "text": "Ohio GOP secretary of state wants Kent State to cancel Jane Fonda's commemoration speech\n\nIt was half a century ago - on May 4, 1970 - that the Ohio National Guard opened fire on unarmed anti-war protestors at Kent State University. Actress Jane Fonda, known for her vehement opposition to the Vietnam War, has been invited to speak at an event marking the 50th anniversary of the Kent State Massacre. But Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, is asking Kent State to rescind the invitation .\n\nIn a tweet posted on February 16, LaRose wrote, \"There's still time to right this wrong @KentState - rescind your invitation to @JaneFonda. The anniversary of this tragedy is not the time to pay a speaker who betrayed our service members.\"\n\nKent State President Todd Diacon, earlier this month, announced that Fonda had been invited to speak at the event. The actress, now 82, is scheduled to speak on May 3. And according to LaRose, Kent State has offered her $83,000.\n\nLaRose wrote, \"The 50th anniversary of one of Ohio's darkest days has the potential to serve as a moment of unity, understanding and healing in a nation that is deeply divided,  However, Kent State's decision to pay Jane Fonda $83,000 to speak at their commemoration event does the very opposite.\"\n\nFonda set off a major controversy when, in 1972, she visited North Vietnam and was photographed on top of an anti-aircraft gun - a photo that drew criticism even from some liberals and progressives who shared her opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. Interviewed for an HBO documentary in 2018, Fonda expressed regrets over that photo but not over her anti-war activism of the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nLast week, Diacon asserted that in the HBO documentary, \"one of the things she said very powerfully is that she does not regret having opposed the war in Vietnam - that it was absolutely the right thing to do - but she has regrets about the way she did it. It was a very meaningful moment that spoke to this goal we have of reconciliation.\"\n\nAfter Fonda (the daughter of actor Henry Fonda and sister of actor Peter Fonda) visited North Vietnam in 1972, some critics called for a boycott over her films. Regardless, she continued to have major roles in Hollywood films, including \"The China Syndrome\" (which warned of the dangers of nuclear power) in 1979.\n\nAt Kent State University on May 4, 1970, members of the Ohio National Guard fired roughly 65 rounds. Four students were killed, and nine others were wounded.\n\nMany of the students were protesting against the Vietnam War and the bombing of Cambodia by U.S. forces. But not all of the students who were shot were participating in the demonstration; some of them were walking nearby or were merely observing it."

      "text": "Why Is Jane Fonda Being Accused Of An \"Attack On The Heart and Soul Of Israel\"?\n\nYou know how those flamboyant Hollywood types like to exaggerate. And when people anywhere talk about the Israel-Palestine conflict, moderate words are usually in short supply. Put the two together, and it's not surprising to find heated language flying on every side. But if, as William Blake said, the road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom, we might learn a lot about the Middle East tragedy from excessive words coming out of Hollywood.\n\nActually, right now, they're coming out of Toronto, the latest place where Hollywood has met the Middle East -- appropriately enough, perhaps, since Toronto has huge active Jewish and Muslim communities as well a very creative film scene.\n\nThis year the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) is honoring the 100th anniversary of the founding of Tel Aviv by spotlighting 10 Israeli films. That has sparked a protest (not a boycott, contrary to some rumors) by more than 60 artists, including Danny Glover, David Byrne, and Eve Ensler.\n\nBut the big catch for the protest organizers was two-time Oscar-winner Jane Fonda (Best Actress: 1971 for Klute , 1978 for Coming Home ). When she signed the protesters' \"Toronto Declaration: No Celebration of Occupation,\" she put the whole controversy even more firmly in the headlines.\n\nThe Declaration declares that Tel Aviv cannot be looked at in isolation from the suffering of the Palestinians; the TIFF program \"ignores the suffering of thousands of former residents and descendants\"; the festival's claim to encourage diversity is \"empty given the absence of Palestinian filmmakers in the program.\"\n\nJohn Grayson, the Canadian filmmaker who initiated the protest, further charges that TIFF, \"whether intentionally or not, has become complicit in the Israeli propaganda machine.\" \"We're not protesting the Israeli films or the filmmakers,\" he says. \"Our target is TIFF's Spotlight on Tel Aviv itself, and specifically its connections to the 'Brand Israel' campaign [a campaign supported by major Canadian media companies to polish Israel's image] and the Israeli Consulate, which make the spotlight look and feel like a propaganda exercise. We're telling TIFF that eight months since the Gaza massacre, this is no time to be uncritically 'celebrating' Tel Aviv.\"\n\nThose are generally measured words, though it does seem unfair to call the focus on Tel Aviv a \"celebration of occupation\"; an \"obfuscation of occupation\" would have made the point more precisely. And in fact TIFF will show two Palestinian films along with the Israeli films.\n\nBut whatever bit of exaggeration the protesters may engage in is dwarfed by the sharp retort they've elicited from another two-time Oscar-winner, Rabbi Marvin Hier. He's not quite as famous as Jane Fonda, to say the least. But he does indeed have as many of those golden statuettes as she has on the mantelpiece (Best Documentary, Features: 1997 for The Long Way Home ,1982 for Genocide ). And he is an ordained rabbi. Hier produced his award-winning documentaries as part of his better-known work: He's founder and dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles.\n\nRabbinical Nonsense\n\nRabbi Hier blasted the TIFF protest in overheated language, as \"an attack on the heart and soul of Israel. ... People who support letters like this are people who do not support a two-state solution. By calling into question the legitimacy of Tel Aviv, they are supporting a one-state solution, which means the destruction of the State of Israel. \"\n\nHe went on to say, \"If every city in the Middle East would have the cultural diversity, the freedom of expression, and treat its citizens, Jews and Arabs, the way Tel Aviv does, peace would have come to the Middle East long ago.\"\n\nWell, there may be some truth in that. In fact, if every city, town, and village in Israel were as liberal as Tel Aviv, Israeli Jews would have agreed to a genuinely independent and viable Palestinian state long ago.\n\nBut nothing else the rabbi says makes any sense. The starting point of his argument -- that the Toronto Declaration \"question[s] the legitimacy of Tel Aviv\" -- is a subjective interpretation of the text. I don't read it that way; neither does Fonda, who wrote: \"The letter certainly did not call for the destruction of Israel or call into question the legitimacy of Tel Aviv as a city.\" But I can see how someone might read it that way. Hamas leader Khaled Meshal, for example, might be inclined to question the legitimacy of Tel Aviv.\n\nBut Meshal has accepted the existence of the state of Israel (and, presumably, its largest city). That doesn't mean he likes it. It simply means that -- as the Toronto Declaration suggest -- there are realities that we accept as givens, even though they are built on tragic historical legacies. But those legacies deserve to be carefully remembered.\n\nSo even if some of the protesters view Tel Aviv's founding as illegitimate, to jump from there to the claim that \"they are supporting a one-state solution, which means the destruction of the State of Israel,\" is what philosophers call a \"howler,\" an argument totally without logic. The Toronto Declaration says nothing like that; not even close.\n\nJane Fonda made this clear in her response to Hier: \"I, in no way, support the destruction of Israel. I am for the two-state solution. I have been to Israel many times and love the country and its people.\" It is perfectly consistent for Fonda to sign the Declaration as a way to pressure Israel to move more rapidly toward a two-state peace agreement, as she says: \"It is out of love for Israel and all that it promised to be that I protest the use of art (which is meant to search for truth) in this branding campaign. The greatest 're-branding' of Israel would be to celebrate that country's robust peace movement by allowing aid to be delivered to Gaza and stopping expansion of the settlements. That's the way to show Israel's commitment to peace, not a PR campaign. There will be no two-state solution unless this happens.\"\n\nTo accuse Jane Fonda of \"an attack on the heart and soul of Israel\" is just plain silly. It would make as much sense to say that anyone who talks about the theft of native American land is promoting the destruction of the United States.\n\nHow did an educated rabbi miss this obvious point? Most likely, because he wanted to miss it. He's been trained to miss it. Everyone he counts as a friend or colleague would probably miss it too. People who call themselves \"pro-Israel\" because they support a right-wing anti-Palestinian agenda tend to hang out with each other and reinforce each other's narrow-minded perspective.\n\nThough the rabbi does have his Oscars and his Hollywood connections, I'm quite sure his penchant for exaggeration about Israel comes much more from his Jewish connections. I say that having grown up in the Jewish community, having read and heard Jewish views on the Middle East for over half a century, and having endured similar extremist criticisms directed against myself for many years.\n\nThe unfortunate reality is that too many Jews are as intemperate and unreasonable in their views as Rabbi Hier. Too many thrive on discovering new criticisms of Israeli policy and treating each one -- no matter how thoughtful or how minor -- as if it were a threat to the very existence of Israel.\n\nA rabbi with such close links to Hollywood, the world's most image-conscious city, should know better. Shrill, hysterical responses to mild (and usually quite legitimate) criticism does nothing to help the image of \"Brand Israel\" or its Jewish supporters. On the contrary, crying \"wolf\" when there is no wolf tends to invalidate everything else the crier says. It looks like an attempt to manipulate people in the service of a hidden agenda. And it raises disturbing questions about what's going on inside the hysteric's mind.\n\nUnreasoning, Unjustified Terror\n\nI don't know Rabbi Hier. But I've known plenty of people who were just as quick to turn any critique of Israeli policy into an attack on Israel's existence. It was pretty clear to me what was going on in their minds: fear. And not just any old fear, but \"nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror,\" as Franklin D. Roosevelt put it in his first inaugural address. A mind filled with that kind of terror can easily interpret a difference of opinion or a minor slight as a life-threatening assault.\n\nFDR said fear was the only thing we have to fear. Well, it's certainly not the only thing Palestinians have to fear. They deal every day with teenaged soldiers licensed to kill them, settlers free to attack them, roadblocks manned by soldiers or bureaucrats determined to grind them down, and an endless array of insults and assaults on their basic human rights.\n\nBut the irrational terror that haunts too many Jews when it comes to Israel is the greatest threat to Israel itself, because it's the strongest factor preventing Israel from agreeing to a fair and just two-state solution. Why so many people would cling to just self-defeating terror is a vexing question. I've got a few ideas of my own, but perhaps no one will ever really understand it.\n\nTerror, whatever its source, is a bad basis for policy. It breeds hysteria, which prevents clear thinking. By now, the \"pro-Israel\" hysterics have been at it in so many places, for so long, and with such powerful effect that much of what they say gets taken seriously, as if it were sensible and worthy of thoughtful discussion. Once they win that point, really thoughtful discussion is no longer possible. And without thoughtful discussion, the peace that Israelis and Palestinians need to make them secure is not possible either.\n\nThe unreasoning cries of alarm raised by the likes of Rabbi Hier are far too common in the Jewish community. They distort public perception of the Middle East conflict, creating a huge emotional cloud that blinds people to the very real possibility of rational solutions. And their obvious, even ridiculous, tone of hysteria hurts everyone. Even right-wing Jews who are out to prevent a Palestinian state would serve their cause better by creating a more reasonable image. An Oscar-winner from Hollywood certainly ought to know that.\n\nPerhaps, if they would just calm down and at least pretend to be reasonable for a few minutes, they will begin to understand why they should listen to the thoughtful criticisms coming from pro-Israel peace-lovers like Jane Fonda. No one can think constructively about security -- which is presumably what Rabbi Hier wants for Israel -- until they can first distinguish between real and unreal threats to security.\n\nWhether a nation with over 200 nuclear weapons and the world's fourth of fifth most powerful military, vastly more powerful than any of its neighbors, can have any real security threats is an open question. Whether a nation that acts out of fear and refuses to make compromises for peace can ever be secure is an equally challenging question. To think about these questions in any fruitful way, the first step is just to be able to think, rather than responding with unreasoning, unjustified terror."

On Saturday, \"We > Tar Sands\" rallies we mounted. And on Sunday, activists participated in the March for Jobs, Justice and the Climate in Toronto.\n\nRELATED: North American Scientists Call for End to Tar Sands Mining\n\nThe #JobsJusticeClimate actions included the formation of a giant human chain on the sea wall at Vancouver's Sunset Beach, a flotilla of boats - including a solar-powered catamaran - touring the Salish Sea in British Columbia, as well as musical performances, poetry readings and speakers discussing jobs, unions and front line resistance to support climate action.\n\nOn Sunday, actress and activist Jane Fonda, environmentalist and scientist David Suzuki and author and social activist Naomi Klein joined Labour groups, First Nations leaders and hundreds of people outside Ontario's legislative buildings for a rally and march calling for a green economy and climate action.\n\n\"This is the kind of coalition that will make the difference,\" Fonda told the crowd. \"They are saying we don't have to choose between the environment and the economy. That's a false choice. In fact, renewable energy - doing away with the fossil fuel-based economy - will create more jobs, more democracy and more justice .\"\n\nRELATED: Could Frustrated Tar Sands Industry Start Shipping Oil Through Arctic?\n\nThe actions came ahead of two major international summits this week. From July 7-9, 300 regional government and business leaders from across the hemisphere - including former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard, California Governor Jerry Brown and the former President of Mexico Felipe CalderÃ3n - will convene in Toronto for the Climate Summit of the Americas . The summit will \"work towards commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and highlight opportunities for investing in a global low carbon economy.\"\n\nAnd from July 8-10, Toronto will also host the Pan American Economic Summit , which will bring together executives from Shell, the Rockefeller Foundation, Canada's Finance Minister, former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Perez and U.S., Canadian and European Chambers of Commerce to discuss the connection between climate action and low-carbon economies.\n\n[vimeo_embed https://player.vimeo.com/video/110577520?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0 expand=1]\n\nKlein wrote about the actions in The Nation :\n\nRELATED: Naomi Klein: We Can Save Ourselves, but Only If We Learn to Work With Nature\n\n[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_original\",\"fid\":\"601312\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"class\":\"media-image\",\"height\":\"500\",\"style\":\"width: 600px; height: 314px;\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\",\"width\":\"955\"}}]]\n\nActions calling for jobs, justice and climate action are sweeping across Canada.

(AP Photo)\n\nATLANTA (AP) - Jane Fonda says the work of the Georgia-based nonprofit organization she founded to prevent teenage pregnancies has become \"far more important\" in the months since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the constitutional right to abortion it guaranteed to women in the United States.\n\nThe activist and Oscar winner has been an outspoken critic of the court's decision, previously calling it \"unconscionable.\"\n\nWhile a post-Roe world will be harder on girls because they are the ones who would have to carry a baby, the work to fight teen pregnancy must also focus on adolescent boys, said Fonda, who was in Atlanta for a fundraiser Thursday to celebrate the 27th anniversary of the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Power & Potential.\n\n\"We have to help our boys understand that they don't have to get a girl pregnant to be men, that being a real man means taking care of yourself, respecting your body and the body of your partner,\" Fonda told The Associated Press. \"Things are much, much harder for boys and girls now and, so, teaching them skills around their reproductive health, how to stay healthy, how to stay pregnancy-free, how to say no, how to have agency over their body, these things are more important than ever.\"\n\nFonda, 84, founded the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention in 1995 when she lived in Atlanta and when Georgia had the highest teenage birth rate in the United States.\n\nIn 2012, the organization changed its name and expanded its mission beyond teenage pregnancy prevention to include nutrition and physical activity. The group says its programs now reach more than 60,000 young people every year.\n\n\"We have to educate them about how their bodies work so that they will know how to protect themselves,\" Fonda said. \"We have to help young people see that they have a future that will be productive, that they can work for - towards, that they can reach towards - and getting in trouble when they're a teenager and having a baby when you're very young will make reaching for that future that much harder.\"\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention , the birth rate for 15- to 19-year-olds in the United States in 2020 was down 8% from the previous year and down 75% from its peak in 1991.\n\nArkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana have the highest teenage birth rates in the U.S. Birth rates also remain higher among Native American, Hispanic and Black teenagers.\n\nFonda served as GCAPP's chair until she moved from Atlanta to Los Angeles in 2010.\n\n_____\n\nFollow Alex Sanz on Twitter at @AlexSanz .\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(Photo by Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) - As beguiling and powerful as Jane Fonda is onscreen, she has yet to play a role that's a match for her whiplash-inducing life of artistry, celebrity and polarizing activism. Then there's the personal drama, including serial marriages to three very different husbands with their own claims to fame.\n\nWhen the 80-year-old Fonda decided to participate in a documentary about her - \"Why not?

It was at the end of his life that she managed to draw him closer: They starred opposite each other as an estranged father and daughter in the film \"On Golden Pond.\"\n\nThe 1982 Academy Award ceremony at which Henry Fonda won his only Oscar is what Jane Fonda readily points to when asked to name a Hollywood career highlight.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nActor Jane Fonda briefs reporters on expectations for the new High Seas Treaty, Tuesday, Feb. 21, 2023, at United Nations headquarters. (Loey Felipe/United Nations Photo via AP)\n\nUNITED NATIONS (AP) - Actress and activist Jane Fonda is campaigning for a treaty to save marine creatures that are hunted for food including sharks, swordfish, octopus and tuna, saying they feel joy, feel sadness when they lose their offspring, and \"are our brethren in the ocean.\"\n\nA day after talks resumed at U.N. headquarters to forge a long-awaited and elusive treaty to safeguard the world's marine biodiversity, the 85-year-old Oscar winner told a news conference Tuesday that these marine creatures \"play with us and they feel emotions - and how dare we so lack humility that we will risk killing them off for money and for food.\"\n\nFor almost four years, Fonda said, she has been working with Greenpeace, and she came to New York to deliver 5.5 million signatures from people in 157 countries demanding a strong Global Ocean Treaty to Rena Lee, president of the U.N. negotiations. A key aim for the treaty is to turn 30% of the world's oceans into marine sanctuaries by 2030 where fishing is banned.\n\nGrowing up in Santa Monica, California, Fonda said she loves the ocean and was at the beach every day that it was warm enough. And she said she has been scuba diving at the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, in the Galapagos in Ecuador, in the Caribbean, and elsewhere in the world.\n\n\"I've swum with some of the most magnificent creatures, and I know that they may very well be more intelligent than me,\" Fonda said. \"And I love them, and I think that we should all understand that we're talking about saving the last great wild animals that are hunted for food.\"\n\nFonda said the world can't survive without healthy oceans, which scientists say provide 50% of the oxygen we breathe. But the oceans are subject to overfishing and pollution, including pieces of plastic that fish eat, she said.\n\nThe heating of the ocean as a result of climate change is also killing kelp beds that many marine creatures depend on to live, she said, and the leaching of fertilizer from industrial farms \"is causing massive and expanding dead zones in the ocean.\"\n\n\"The ocean is our ally,\" Fonda said. \"Let us love and respect it.\"\n\nHervé Berville, France's secretary of state for the sea who sat next to Fonda, said he believes \"we have the political momentum\" during negotiations that end on March 3 to overcome the remaining challenges and reach agreement on a treaty protecting 30% of the ocean by 2030.\n\nFonda warned that time is running out.\n\n\"Even dogs don't poop in their kennel, because they know that the kennel provides security and a home for them,\" she said. \"We're pooping in our kennel.\"\n\nHumans are destroying things they don't understand, Fonda said.\n\n\"Why the treaty is important is it will force us to behave right, and to save this great ally that we have called the ocean - the one ocean on this blue planet that can save us,\" she said. \"There's a lot at stake.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)\n\nCandice Bergen hatched the idea for a sequel to \"Book Club\" before the first had even come out.\n\nIt was 2017 and they were flying to a convention of movie theater owners to drum up excitement for their movie where she, Jane Fonda, Mary Steenburgen and Diane Keaton play friends who decide to read \"Fifty Shades of Grey.\"\n\nLike all movies, it wasn't the easiest to get made - somewhere along the line someone even suggested a younger cast. But they were pretty sure they had something that audiences were going to like and that a sequel would happen. Bergen said, \"It has to be Italy.\"\n\nWhy Italy? Well, about the same reasons anyone would choose Italy: the food, the wine, the history, the art, the people.\n\nAnd their dream came true: \"Book Club: The Next Chapter,\" out Friday, finds the women traveling to Rome, Venice and Tuscany. It's part bachelorette party for Fonda's character, who is getting married for the first time (to Don Johnson) and part bucket list fulfillment - years ago, life got in the way of a trip and post-pandemic they're all feeling a little more adventurous.\n\n\"On the first film, we were only together when we got together for a book club meeting. It was about our individual storylines,\" Fonda said. \"This time we were together all the time.\"\n\nThat meant full filming days, dinners out with everyone and weekend excursions to Florence and gelato in between takes. One morning, a makeup artist spotted Fonda at 5:30 am outside the Pantheon with a map in hand and hat on her head. A few hours later, while filming, she'd exclaim she'd already hit 10,000 steps.\n\n\"We had a schedule,\" Bergen said. \"It wasn't like anarchy. When the day wrapped we went to dinner.\"\n\n\"But the dinners out were very important,\" Steenburgen added. \"There were a lot of discussions about where we were eating, who was eating and dreaming about Aperol Spritzes. At least for me.\"\n\nThough there was support for a sequel after the first made over $100 million at the box office, at the studio there was a fixation on the book choice being the hook. But director Bill Holderman and his co-writer Erin Simms were pretty sure that wasn't it.\n\n\"We felt like the driver of the success was the women, their friendship and the bond,\" Holderman said. \"We had to go through a bit of a journey to convince everyone that we didn't need another 50 Shades style book.\"\n\nUltimately, they chose Paulo Coelho's \"The Alchemist,\" inspired by something Steenburgen had said about getting written off after a certain age.\n\nTheir four stars, though of somewhat similar generations with ages ranging from 70 (Steenburgen) to 85 (Fonda) hadn't known each other very well and had never worked together before the first film. But they soon became real friends and have stayed in close touch - usually waiting for \"Candy,\" as they call Bergen, who lives on the East Coast, to tell them she's coming to Los Angeles. Then they scramble to figure out whose house they'll go to for dinner. All have hosted at least one.\n\n\"The biggest gift by far of these two movies for me is just the friendships with these beloveds in my life,\" Steenburgen said.\n\nItaly was a dream for everyone. Some had filmed there before. Fonda had once stayed in Rome for a year doing \"Barbarella\" with Roger Vadim, and Bergen had shot Lina Wertmüller's \"A Night Full of Rain\" there. When it came time to make \"The Next Chapter,\" she suggested they call on her co-star from the 1978 film, Giancarlo Giannini, to play a part.\n\n\"He definitely has a little crush on you,\" Steenburgen teased. \"He couldn't keep his eyes off of you.\"\n\nBergen politely disagreed. Besides, they were all focused on being together.\n\nBy the time the rest of their male counterparts arrived for the final scenes, including Johnson, Craig T. Nelson and Andy Garcia, Fonda laughed it was like, \"Who are you? We felt very complete unto ourselves.\"\n\nNone took the film for granted, either.\n\n\"They really understood how lucky they were to be together and to be doing this,\" Simms said. \"Not everybody sends older women to Italy to go make a movie. I think they really felt that and it bonded them more deeply.\"\n\nSteenburgen thought back to when she was starting out, in the late 1970s, looking at women in the business who were just a generation ahead of her and wondering why there weren't more opportunities for them.\n\n\"They were brilliant and amazing and still just had so much to offer and there was nothing happening for them,\" Steenburgen said. \"I've been in the business long enough to know that it wasn't a given that something like this could happen.\"\n\nBut times have changed for the better. \"Book Club 2\" is Fonda's third release this year, after \"80 for Brady\" and \"Moving On.\"\n\n\"Studios are noticing that older women are the fastest growing demographic,\" Fonda said. \"It's just good business.\"\n\nBergen added: \"They're not quite so dismissive of us anymore.\"\n\nFonda and her co-stars have also noticed that it's often younger people who talk to them about \"Book Club.\" She thinks part of it is that it's simply comforting to see more mature women having fun, which, she hopes takes some of the stigma and fear out of aging. And, yes, they're already scheming up a possible third movie with Bergen driving the brainstorm.\n\n\"Our next one will be in Hong Kong,\" Bergen said.\n\nSteenburgen reminded her she also suggested Burning Man.\n\nBergen: Did I?\n\nSteenburgen: You forget, but I make notes on all your ideas.\n\nBergen: That would be funny.\n\nSteenburgen: And hot. And uncomfortable.\n\nFonda: I'll phone that one in.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

Now it says its programs reach more than 60,000 young people every year.\n\n\"Twenty-five years ago, if we had gone into Grady County or White County or said we'd like to talk to you about teaching comprehensive sexuality in school, we would have been thrown out or arrested,\" Fonda told The Associated Press. \"Counties that didn't want us to be there are now inviting us in, and that's very gratifying.\"\n\nFonda is hosting a virtual celebration and fundraiser on Thursday with recording artist Trisha Yearwood.\n\nRetired Major League Baseball right fielder Hank Aaron will present the Lifetime Humanitarian Award to Fonda's ex-husband, CNN founder Ted Turner. President Jimmy Carter is also expected to deliver a message during the celebration.\n\nIn 2012, the organization changed its name to Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Power & Potential and expanded its mission beyond teenage pregnancy prevention to include nutrition and physical activity.\n\n\"If you put a map across the United States that showed pockets of poverty and distress, those would correspond with where our teen pregnancy rates are high,\" Fonda said. \"Hope is the best contraceptive. If you help a child see a future for themselves they will be motivated to either not have sex or to use contraceptives responsibly when they do.\"\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention , the birth rate for 15- to 19-year-olds dropped 5% in 2019. It's fallen almost every year since 1991.\n\nArkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana have the highest teenage birth rates in the United States. Birth rates also remain higher among Native American, Hispanic and Black teenagers.\n\nFonda served as GCAPP's chair until she moved from Atlanta to Los Angeles in 2010.\n\n_____\n\nFollow Alex Sanz on Twitter at @AlexSanz .\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Then there's the personal drama, including serial marriages to three very different husbands with their own claims to fame.\n\nWhen the 80-year-old Fonda decided to participate in a documentary about her - \"Why not? I don't know how much longer I'm gonna live\" - it was with award-winning filmmaker Susan Lacy, who made an intriguing choice: using the men in Fonda's life as the organizing principle for \"Jane Fonda in Five Acts.\"\n\nThe film, debuting from 8 to 10:15 p.m. Monday EDT on HBO, devotes its first chapter to Fonda's fraught bond with her emotionally reserved dad, the acclaimed actor Henry Fonda.

      "text": "Calamity Jane\n\nThe incoherent life (so far) of Jane Fonda\n\nSorry, but I can't help it: I keep thinking we might all be better off if Jane Fonda had married Dan Rather. Imagine the meeting that could have spared us these two experts in banana-peel celebrity. Texas, 1965: On the sweltering, gamy set of Arthur Penn's unforgettable epic The Chase , a coltish actress moodily watches a pickup truck solidify the baked horizon's shimmer. This is her first Lillian Hellman script-yet she feels mysteriously empty inside. As luck would have it, she looks mysteriously empty outside, too, at least to the hardy but troubled young newsman behind the truck's wheel. While his upcoming network assignment to the green jungle hell of Indochina could be the making of him, a strange hunch that he'll never be as beloved as Walter Cronkite has him as poleaxed as a crawfish in Jell-O.\n\nTheir eyes lock. \"My name is Dan,\" he says. \"My name is Jane,\" she answers, noticing how his hairline mimics the virile contour of his jaw. The rest is scrapbooks. She gives up acting; he bails on CBS. Today they're an elderly husband-and-wife team of veterinarians in Lubbock, renowned halfway to El Paso for their unique sensitivity to the posteriors of horses. Otherwise, no one on God's earth has any idea who they are.\n\nWhat makes this daydream tempting isn't only that right-wingers would have been denied decades of fun with Dan and Jane, who certainly have done more for Rush Limbaugh than they ever did for liberalism. The real reason they belong together is the magnificence of their delusional self-images. Convinced that he's America's cracker-barrel uncle, Rather will never grasp how often his idea of folksiness on the CBS Evening News resembled a mad Klingon taking over for Hal Holbrook in Mark Twain Tonight! No less doggedly, Fonda believes that her life is, above all, instructive-sort of like Saint Augustine's, with a bit of Dorothy Day tossed in. Since their lack of humor about themselves is sterling-virginal, you want to say-neither of them could tolerate realizing that they're two of the most hilarious figures of the twentieth century.\n\nThat's why no matter what your preconceptions are, Fonda's My Life So Far is never boring. It's clear we're in for no minor feast of fatuity as soon as she explains that her purpose in looking back is to give her life, a hurricane in a pawnshop if ever there was one, unity: \"Call me a control freak, but I don't want to be like Christopher Columbus, who didn't know where he was headed when he left, didn't know where he was when he got there, and didn't know where he'd been when he got back.\" As sunset nears, it's time to name those purple mountain majesties, and you have to admit that hubris this innocent has its charm.\n\nHowever, we'd better understand that the endeavor has its useful, socially productive side. According to Fonda, she couldn't have written My Life So Far unless a key insight had (c'mon, guess) \"liberated\" her to do so: \"Coming to see my various individual struggles within a broader societal context enabled me to understand that much of my journey was a universal one for women-played out in different ways and with different outcomes, perhaps, but with common core experiences.\" It's also played out with different incomes-and how much sweeter it is to be universal when you're traveling first class. Yet if nothing else, her predictably ludicrous but unexpectedly endearing determination to play schoolmarm during her celebrity striptease is enough to settle any remaining doubts about the validity of this woman's U.S. passport. That Fonda can still be an unconscious narcissist after all these years is triumphant proof that she's as American as smart bombs and Bozo.\n\nHonestly, how can you hate someone whose idea of a mea culpa is \"Change always holds an element of self-interest, and mine was quite simply that I wanted to be a better person\"? She's not entirely lacking in shrewdness, though, since she knows that to some extent her best shot at revising our perceptions of her is to accede to them. \"A persistent assumption about me is that I am a puppet, ready for a new man to pull my strings,\" she writes. \"There was some truth to this.\" Her first and best string-puller, of course, was her celebrated father, who notoriously saved his warmth for his movies; offscreen, Henry Fonda was a fjord, not a Lincoln. Just how effective his stony emotional withdrawal was in making him the parent to please is in no doubt. Even the trauma of her mother's suicide, soon after Henry asked for a divorce, drove the twelve-year-old Jane to shut down-Dad's ideal-instead of acting out, her more vulnerable brother Peter's reaction.\n\nAs Fonda grows, we get a litany of adolescent troubles, including the bulimia she didn't overcome until her forties-this book's major (trite) revelation-along with delayed menstruation and much sexual anxiety about her apparently malfunctioning \"down there.\" (While I have every intention of sparing you the sentence that begins \"I write about my vagina and vagina-related fears because ... ,\" its motives are so virtuous as to make you nostalgic for Cora Pearl.) Tragically, she goes to Vassar; starts modeling for Vogue ; studies acting with Lee Strasberg, even as her Barbie-doll debut in Joshua Logan's Tall Story makes her doubt her calling (working for Logan might have made Olivier doubt his calling). Dad stays remote. To fans of the immortal movie version of Herman Wouk's Youngblood Hawke , it's touching to learn that she lost her virginity to actor James Franciscus, known to Jane as \"Goey\" and to us, of course, as \"Bloody.\" Dad, by now on his fourth wife, whose name Fonda can barely bring herself to print-she's \"the Italian\" for some time-still stays remote.\n\nJane skips to Paris, an innocent abroad. Through her friends Yves Montand and Simone Signoret she discovers \"France's intellectual Left, which included the other Simone (de Beauvoir), and her longtime companion, Jean-Paul Sartre, and of course Albert Camus, who had died in 1960.\" Although presumably inadvertent, the Weekend at Bernie's suggestion of a mummified Camus at the Café de Flore is charming; but the ripeness is all, and Fonda isn't yet ripe for politics. Enter Roger Vadim, the Hugh Hefner of the Nouvelle Vague.\n\nFond of Rogering his leading ladies (Brigitte Bardot and Catherine Deneuve among them), and also prone to choosing film locales for their proximity to casinos, Vadim is such an engaging satyr that describing him warms our autobiographer briefly into her least typical mode: frank enjoyment of life's quiddities for their own sake. After a few colorful pages, though, she's back in the self-actualization saddle, fretting over \"whether my emotional under-development could surmount his 'charming' addictions\" (to booze, gambling, etc.). Swept away on clouds of romance, Gauloises, and low self-esteem, Fonda even goes along with her lover-then-husband's taste for group sex-clearly the confession she's most embarrassed about. All the same, her bedroom contortions may have been as nothing compared with the verbal pretzel she turns herself into to rationalize her complaisance: \"So adept was I at burying my real feelings and compartmentalizing myself that I eventually had myself convinced I enjoyed it.\" Later she isolates one reason she did enjoy it: \"I liked having an up-close view of the varied ways women express passion,\" she tells a friend. As they say in Hollywood, it's all about the work.\n\nBigger storms are brewing, though. As she jets from L.A. to Vegas to marry Vadim, Watts is on fire down below-\"an omen, though I didn't see it as such at the time,\" Fonda reflects. She also doesn't say of what, tempting us to picture flames that spell out he's a bum, jane. Then comes 1968: \"perhaps the most turbulent, tumultuous year of the century,\" she reminds us with nostalgia. (Poor old 1945-always a bridesmaid, never a bride.) She and Vadim have just completed Barbarella , but Jane is restless; filming a silly sci-fi comedy \"when so much substantive change was taking place in the world had acted as yeast to my malaise.\" She's also about to give birth to their daughter, and her inner radical is on the verge of blossoming too: \"My pregnancy during that fertile year-1968-created a rich loam.\" Yeast, loam, malaise-suddenly Vadim's drinking looks so sensible.\n\nSince Fonda is all too aware that in some quarters her antiwar activism will stigmatize her forever, her chapters on the Vietnam era are inevitably the most detailed and painstaking self-justification in the book. Her canniest defense is to locate the sources of her radicalism in the example set by a certain screen avatar of American ideals, with wise old Simone Signoret playing Glinda the Good Witch to spell out the connection: \"I could see in her face that she had been waiting for this to happen,\" Fonda writes, as Simone-breaking out a bottle of \"fine cabernet\"-welcomes her to the Rolls-Royce barricades. \"Somehow, through all the silliness of my lifestyle, she had maintained a firm belief that what she loved about my father from his movie roles was waiting inside me to manifest itself through action.\" The brilliance of this is that, in one fell swoop, Fonda not only places herself squarely in the American grain but also slyly ups the authenticity ante on Dad: he only pretended to be Tom Joad, the old fraud.\n\nStill, her self-image is nothing if not ecumenical. On her way to Hanoi in 1972, Fonda breaks her foot: \"Bulimics have thin bones.\" An idle comment? Guess again. A page later, flying over Vietnam, she's struck by an eerie resemblance.\n\nShe stops short of imagining them binging and purging, but we get the picture: Jane, too, will be pummeled, by rhetorical B-52s. What she never wholly faces up to is that the only real damage she did was to the antiwar movement, whose reputation she permanently sullied. Left-wingers, rather than jingoes, should be the ones least willing to forgive \"Hanoi Jane\"; although her characteristically vainglorious, self-dramatizing decision to publicly oppose the war was the most morally justified one of her life, her judgment of how to put it into practice was disastrous.\n\nBecause Fonda is only human, I think it's understandable that this lavishly illustrated book omits the famous photograph of a delighted-looking Jane sitting behind a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun. She does print a somewhat less damning picture taken moments earlier, which as honesty goes is fair enough, and her own account of what happened during a \"two-minute lapse of sanity [that] will haunt me until I die\" is predictably overwrought, a mite disingenuous, and as fascinating as a lecture on zeppelin safety from the Hindenburg 's captain. Even if her unduly earnest attempt to put herself in hostile vets' shoes goes from reasonable (she's \"Henry Fonda's privileged daughter,\" who seems to be thumbing her nose at her country) to goofy (\"Barbarella has become their enemy\"), she's not wrong to remind us that in much of her stateside antiwar activity she'd gone out of her way to portray American servicemen as victims of U.S. policy, not antagonists. But so what? Perhaps she can't see why that photo is of a piece with her life, if not her ideology, but we can. Fully in the moment , as actors put it, she wasn't thinking like a propagandist. She was thinking like a star.\n\nIt didn't stay one for long. Throughout My Life So Far , Fonda has taken care to portray herself as a creature of enthusiasms, never calculation. But when the fitness tycoon starts gushing that she's no businesswoman, you may want to reach for the truth serum. Just look at what a ninny she is! First she sheds the partner who actually originated the exercise routine (\"At least I've tried over the intervening years to make it up to Leni\"). Then, with Jane Fonda's Workout making money hand over fists-on-hips, she snips its pipeline to Hayden's nonprofit: \"I felt we had more than fulfilled our original mission of providing [the CED] with a solid financial base.\" Her husband's presumably thrilled reaction to the news that poverty in California is under control goes unrecorded.\n\nIf you ask me, this unlikely but lucrative self-reinvention as an empowered Barbie doll-not her turn as \"Hanoi Jane\"-marks Fonda's apotheosis: the glorious moment when her life's incoherence becomes sui generis, and no longer a reaction to circumstances. From now on, in the great tradition of star-spangled imbecilism, nothing she does can make us bat an eye-not ending up as the ultimate trophy wife when Ted Turner, who clearly awed Fonda by being so much more blissfully self-centered, decided she was Scarlett to his Rhett; not the excruciating mix of celebrity therapy and guaranteed box office that was her onscreen \"reconciliation\" with her father in On Golden Pond . In her dutifully lachrymose description of filming with Henry, one story stands out. As they rehearse their big scene, Jane-knowing the gesture will disturb him-resists her impulse to touch his arm while telling him she wants to be his friend; resists it, that is, until the take, when Dad's surprise produces exactly the spontaneously flustered reaction she wants. \"It worked,\" she reports. \"I was so happy.\"\n\nHenry Fonda was seventy-five and in poor health, but spotting the glint of that shiv of professional opportunism in his daughter's valedictory bouquet is actually refreshing. It's one of too few times this book reminds us that manipulating emotions is what movie stars get paid for-and that Jane, for all her vicissitudes, is no slouch at delivering when the cameras turn. Still, her two Oscars to the contrary, she's unlikely to be remembered as a great actress-good, yes; great, no-and one king-sized irony of her whole fraught saga is that today nobody much under thirty even knows who the hell Henry was. Because his daughter has spent her life playing both clown and trapeze act in the American circus in a way Dad never did, she's now the more immortal of the two. Anyone who wants to protest that Jane is less deserving is more unpatriotic than she ever was, or just takes no delight in slapstick. There are times when I suspect they come to the same thing.\n\nWhen you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission. Thank you for supporting The Atlantic."

      "text": "Grace and Frankie : A New Kind of Divorce Comedy\n\nIn Netflix's new show, Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin star as women whose husbands fall in love, raising questions about sexuality and ageism.\n\n\"I'm leaving you\": Works of entertainment have lobbed those sad Three Little Words at everyone from Dustin Hoffman to Tina Fey . The life-after-divorce genre is so robust-how many films has Woody Allen made?-that when Martin Sheen's character, Robert, breaks up with Jane Fonda's Grace over dinner in the first moments of the new Netflix comedy Grace and Frankie , viewers can already guess what's to come: scenes of the recently jilted scarfing Ben & Jerry's and treating her ex's possessions in a less-than-respectful fashion.\n\nBut there's a twist to this relationship's end. Robert's leaving his wife for the man who's across the table: his law partner Sol (Sam Waterston), sitting next to his own wife, Frankie (Lily Tomlin). The two men have carried on an affair for 20 years, while the two women have done all they could to avoid each other: Grace is a pill-popping former businesswoman who disdains even the sight of carbohydrates; Frankie is a muumuu-clad artist known to meditate on dining tables. Having ex-husbands who're in love might be the first significant thing they've ever had in common.\n\nThe conceit helps Grace and Frankie to not feel redundant even as it trades in well-worn breakup tropes, odd-couple hijinks, and writing that's as broad and nonsensical as the '90s sitcoms that co-creators Marta Kauffman ( Friends ) and Howard J. Morris ( Home Improvement ) worked on. In fact, the interplay between the relatively novel premise and the all-too-familiar material gives the show some edge. Is being ditched in your golden years because of sexual orientation all that different from being ditched because passions have dimmed, or because your husband was sleeping with another woman? At first, it doesn't seem different at all. Both Frankie and Grace are devastated and embarrassed like spurned lovers of TV show eternal; at no point in the first three episodes I've seen do they express any empathy for their exes' decades-long identity struggles.\n\nBut soon, it sinks in that this is a very specific shock hitting very specific people. \"I'm feeling like the last 40 years have been a fraud,\" Grace says as she maniacally brushes her hair, to which Robert expresses mystification that she doesn't take the breakup as a relief: She never loved him in the first place. Frankie and Sol, on the other hand, really did have a deep bond; for them and their kids, the end of the marriage might mean the end of blissful times spent at farmer's markets, movie nights, and \"Jewish Christmas.\" Meanwhile, the men excitedly start a new life together. Sol at one point tells Robert he feels guilty for leaving Frankie, saying, \"You know what makes it worse? I'm so fucking happy .\" But Robert refuses to agonize; he did enough of that when he was playing straight.\n\nGrace and Frankie joins a pop-culture boomlet of stories about people coming out as something other than what their loved ones thought they were, late in life. In the most recent season of Girls , Hannah Horvath's father abruptly exits the closet; Amazon's Transparent tells of a family's patriarch who starts living as a woman; in the non-fiction realm, Olympian and reality-TV dad Bruce Jenner has transfixed the nation by revealing that he's transgender. As queer acceptance rises, the frequency of tales like these in real life and on screen is bound to rise as well; in Grace and Frankie , the uncloseting happens as the direct result of same-sex marriage becoming legal (\"I hosted that fundraiser,\" Grace moans). Often, the people affected by the coming-out receive as much or more attention than the person who's actually coming out: Loreen Horvath rages bitterly against her gay husband; the Transparent kids shift the drama from \"moppa\"-mother and papa, in one-to themselves; the Kardashians' reactions to Jenner's announcement get their own TV segments. This focus on how LGBT liberation affects everyone else might strike some as insensitive, but it's probably necessary when society has led so many relationships to be built on repressed truths.\n\nIn Grace and Frankie , the emphasis on the title characters allows the show to be somewhat radical on yet another front: portraying the tough position that single older women can find themselves in. Boomer icons Fonda and Tomlin play into some grandmotherly stereotypes-there are ongoing gags about hearing loss, bad backs, and the difficulties of text messaging-but also fiercely defy toward how circumstances and society treats them. At one point, they flip out at a supermarket employee who ignores them to instead help a younger woman, with Fonda roaring \"What kind of animal treats people like this?\" The moment is hammy but also poignant, well-earned after the show has methodically chronicled the stages of the women' s nightmare: First, they face emotional shock; then, financial and legal indignities; then, boredom, lack of purpose, and invisibility. How will they overcome? The question feels fresh, even if not all the jokes do."

      "text": "How to Write a Golden Globe-Nominated Song With Google\n\nA search engine can be a great source of lyrics.\n\nThe film Youth turns on a song. Released last month and starring Michael Caine, Jane Fonda, and Harvey Keitel, the movie begins as a royal messenger asks the aging composer Fred Ballinger (Caine) to conduct his most famous work for Prince Phillip's birthday. It's not until the film's final minutes that we finally do hear that piece: \"Simple Song #3.\"\n\n\"Simple Song\" is up for a Golden Globe for best original song on Sunday, the only classical entry in a field dominated this and most years by pop stars. (Wiz Khalifa, Sam Smith, and Brian Wilson are nominated in the same category .) But \"Simple Song\" was written by David Lang, a contemporary classical composer with little prior film experience whose best-known work remains the Pulitzer Prize-winning Little Match Girl Passion .\n\nSo \"Simple Song\" represents something a little different for both Lang and the Globes. And a survey of its lyrics reveal that they also seem ... a little different. They spin out, phrase over phrase, in a repetitive syntax that feels just shy of familiar:\n\nI feel complete I lose all control I lose all control I respond\n\n\"Simple Song #3\" must play a delicate emotional role in the film: It's both Ballinger's most beloved work and one that transmits a hidden emotional message to his wife. But Lang was faced with how to write a conceivably popular song that amounts to, as he put it, something someone would whisper to their love: \"what people say to their lovers that they don't want anyone else to hear,\" he told me Wednesday.\n\n\"I was trying to think of how to convey to an audience what the most personal statement between this man and his wife would be,\" he said. \"He's made this song, he's offered it to the world, and the world understands it in a particular way but that's not the way he understands it.\"\n\n\"That kind of really focused, personal communication is more like a whisper. It's not something you would sing or shout or yell or publish, it's something you'd whisper to a lover,\" said Lang.\n\nSo he chose an unusual text-assembly method.\n\n\"I just typed in a Google search-I just typed, 'when you whisper my name I...,'\" he said. \"I got thousands of pornographic things and terrible things and things that were so specific I couldn't really use them. But I got a general catalog of what people say to their loved ones that they don't want anyone else to hear.\"\n\nLang then accumulated some of those results into a text, repeating some as necessary.\n\nIt worked, he said, \"because people share everything on the Internet-things you wouldn't want to say to your best friend, you have no problem broadcasting them to the world.\"\n\nReturn to the lyrics, and their unusual structure becomes more clear. When you whisper my name, I...\n\nI feel chills I wake I know on those lonely nights I know on those lonely nights I know everything\n\nThese sound like Google auto-complete suggestions.\n\n\"In a way it doesn't matter what he's whispering to his lover. But the idea that he has this private communication, that's the thing,\" Lang said.\n\nIt was the first time Lang had worked with Paolo Sorrentino, the Italian director behind Youth, though it was not the first time Lang's music had been used in his films. Sorrentino licensed and chose various Lang compositions for La grande bellezza, which won the 2014 Oscar for Best Foreign Language film.\n\nLang collaborated with Sorrentino almost entirely by emailing him demo recordings. Sorrentino then would reply by email, essentially saying whether the music sufficiently moved him. As Lang told the Times : \"I kept sending demos of the song to Paolo, things that I thought were emotionally devastating. He would write back and he'd say, 'I'm sorry, I am crying a little, but I need to cry a lot.'\"\n\nSorrentino never wanted Lang to describe his method-either at music composition or text arrangement-to him, which meant that when \"Simple Song\" finally made Sorrentino cry a lot, Lang never told him certain elements of its writing.\"I never ran [the text] by him. I never showed it to him,\" he told me this week. \"I never told him I got it from the Internet.\""

      "text": "For Women, Is Exercise Power?\n\nIn Let's Get Physical , Danielle Friedman traces the fascinating, loaded history of female fitness.\n\nOf all the cult workout products that have dominated the American imagination over the past few decades, the one I least expected to be rooted in feminist protest was the ThighMaster. Consider this TV spot from 1991: \"Great legs,\" a male voice opines as a pair of disembodied, high-heeled gams stroll onto the screen. \"How'd you get 'em?\" The legs are revealed to belong to the TV actor Suzanne Somers, who explains to the camera that after doing aerobics \"until I dropped,\" she finally found an easier way to \"squeeze, squeeze your way to shapely hips and thighs.\" Male TV hosts mocked the ThighMaster relentlessly (Jay Leno used one to juice an orange on The Tonight Show ); consumers-mostly women-bought millions of them anyway, sold on Somers's cheerful closing pitch: \"We may not have been born with great legs, but now we can look like we were.\"\n\nThe ThighMaster was one of the defining symbols of the '90s, and yet it might never have burst onto the national stage if not for wage inequality in Hollywood. In 1980, while negotiating her contract for a fifth season of the ABC sitcom Three's Company , Somers demanded a salary increase that would have brought her pay up to what her co-star John Ritter was making. ABC refused, shrank her role down to infrequent cameos, and then fired her altogether. After a decade spent in the TV wilderness, the ThighMaster was Somers's ticket to financial autonomy-a home-fitness empire predicated on the troubling idea that women's bodies could be bought and built, that \"problem areas\" could be conquered one workout product at a time, that fat could be squeezed, squeezed , into submission.\n\nRead: The dark side of fitness culture\n\nThe ThighMaster exemplifies the paradox the writer Danielle Friedman explores in her fascinating new book, Let's Get Physical: How Women Discovered Exercise and Reshaped the World . Power and strength, she argues, are not simply figurative entities; they are physical attributes too, and progress for women means having the ability to exercise both. For most of the 20th century, she writes in her introduction, \"men enjoyed a lifetime of practicing how to use and trust their bodies; women did not.\" Women were corseted and girdled in ways that restricted movement. They were warned of the dire health consequences of running more than two miles at a time, and told that strenuous exercise might impair their reproductive organs and even cause their uterus to fall out. The fight to be able to exercise-to find freedom and release and power in the use of one's body-is, Friedman explains, tied up inextricably with other battles, as Somers's own history demonstrates. \"When women first started exercising en masse,\" Friedman writes, \"they were participating in something subversive: the cultivation of physical strength and autonomy.\" Who knew where it might lead?\n\nBut exercise, for women, also became inextricable from diet culture and beauty culture and everything else built on the truism that the easiest way to get rich is to help a woman feel bad about herself. Early pioneers in the fitness movement quickly realized that their advocacy would seem less threatening if it was feminized-if exercise was touted less as a practice that could make women strong, and more as one that could keep them young and make them beautiful. The sticky marriage of fitness and desirability is one that still needs to be untangled. Friedman writes about discovering barre workouts a few months before her wedding, when a studio near her home promised to transform her \"thirty-five-year-old body into that of a ballerina.\" That sounded, she thought, \"highly probable and completely perfect.\" Friedman's is a common reaction, but why? To harness the true potential of our bodies, we first have to question everything we've been taught about them, felt about them, or wanted to change when we looked in the mirror.\n\nThis is the time of year when-for the slothlike, the wine-soaked, the people who find oneness and tranquility in the casomorphins of soft cheese (and, to be clear, I am all three of these)-even reading the news can be a fraught activity, rife with briefings on how to actually run a marathon this year , or how a month off alcohol can be revelatory , or why women gain belly fat as they age . To channel my colleague Faith Hill, resolutions are not the vibe for 2022 . And yet, reading Let's Get Physical , I found myself craving the unthinkable: a room filled with other people, a Tina Turner CD, and a really exhausting workout.\n\nFriedman's book, which persuasively encapsulates the relatively recent history of women's fitness and the wide-reaching impact its trailblazers had, originated from a story she wrote for The Cut called \"The Secret Sexual History of the Barre Workout.\" In researching barre, only one of the latest classes to hook women with its promise of sculpted athleticism, she discovered that it was created by Lotte Berk, a \"free-love revolutionary,\" dancer, and former morphine addict who thought exercise could encourage women to pursue sex for pleasure. Berk's classes, established in London in 1959, coincided with a moment during which women's clothing was liberating its wearers and exposing them at the same time. Already, the promise of exercise as a radical tool was being negated by the message that women should change their body to fit a limiting image of beauty.\n\nLet's Get Physical is defined by characters like Berk: Jane Fonda, Judi Sheppard Missett-who created Jazzercise -and Bonnie Prudden, one of the first women to state plainly, during the 1950s, that all Americans should exercise, regardless of what they were being told by their doctors and the media. (\"I've observed hundreds of physical education classes around the world,\" she was fond of saying, \"and I have never seen a uterus on the gym floor.\") Friedman incisively notes the cultural context each woman was working within at the time. Amid the postwar Baby Boom, American identity was shaped by a sense of easy abundance, not collectivist effort. During the Cold War, she writes, the sculpted bodies of Soviet female athletes contributed to a bias against women who dared have any muscle tone at all. And the message for women in particular, after working and striving during the Great Depression and World War II, was that they should relinquish power, \"for the sake of the country and the proper social order.\"\n\nThe idea that women should exercise for their own sake defied the notion that they should be wives and mothers first, people second. It could be popularized only when it was neutered. Prudden, a scrappy descendant of Davy Crockett who channeled her limitless energy into so-called boyish activities such as skiing and mountaineering, was able to persuade women to exercise only when she appealed to their sense of wifely duty. She sold, Friedman writes, \"the idea that vigorous physical activity could be a desirable path to beauty, grace, and sex appeal.\" It was a formula that stuck throughout the rest of the century.\n\nRead: The fitness craze that changed the way women exercise\n\nIn subsequent decades, women broke goals and records and rules; still, societal norms reminded them that their bodies existed as objects to be surveyed, not just tested. The first female track athletes to appear on the cover of Sports Illustrated , in 1964, were members of the Texas Track Club-a group, Friedman writes, that was founded to prove \"women runners could be fast and feminine,\" whose athletes competed in full makeup and with their hair teased in elaborate bouffants. The first-ever all-women road race in America was sponsored by Crazylegs, an S. C. Johnson shaving gel, and featured Playboy Bunnies at the starting line. The progressive evangelism of Jane Fonda's Workout -that women should seek strength and athleticism for its own sake-became muddled, as Friedman writes, with \"a cultural mandate that women strive for physical perfection.\" Rather than setting them free, the mainstreaming of exercise added yet another to-do item (pursuit of their best body ever ) to women's lists.\n\nNevertheless, Friedman is on fitness's side. After finishing her book and catching up on where her subjects are now (to save time: many of them are in their 80s and 90s, still exercising, and still vital, socially active, and happy), I was too. Let's Get Physical is clear-eyed about assessing the flaws in the fitness movement-its mixed messaging, its propagation of toxic ideals, its longtime exclusion of differently abled women, plus-size women, and particularly women of color. When Friedman writes about the popularization of running during the 1970s largely among white people, while \"Americans of color risked their safety every time they hit the street in sneakers,\" it's impossible not to mourn Ahmaud Arbery, and how far we haven't come.\n\nBut Friedman also understands the different dimensions of power, and how incidentally one kind can lead to another. \"As women become more physically competent, they change,\" she writes. Let's Get Physical is packed with stories of people who come to classes because of how they want to look, but stay because of how those classes make them feel: strong, supported, engaged, and empowered. To lightly adapt some seminal '70s literature, our bodies are our selves. And the pursuit of fitness-not for aesthetic reasons, but for individual fulfillment and collective strength-is a feminist issue.\n\nWhen you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

      "text": "The Fabulous Desperation of Our Celebrities\n\nJennifer Lopez would like us to take her seriously now.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nThe latest avalanche of content from Jennifer Lopez has me thinking about Richard Wagner, the German composer who argued in 1849 that the \"consummate artwork of the future\" would be Gesamtkunstwerk - \"total artwork,\" combining elements of many forms into one. This lofty notion, once associated primarily with opera and architecture, is now commonplace. Visual albums, installation art, video games, and TikToks routinely blend the auditory, the visual, the narrative, and the poetic-sometimes spectacularly, quite often unsatisfyingly.\n\nHuman beings can be Gesamtkunstwerk too. Or at least, that's the best way of thinking about what Lopez is up to at age 54.\n\nSince the '90s, Lopez has been culturally inescapable not for any single skill, but for gliding between acting, music, fashion, and various ceremonial duties. Now she's made a multi-hyphenate manifesto of sorts with the Amazon Studios musical film This Is Me ... Now: A Love Story . Mashing up pop videos and dialogue-driven dramedy over 65 minutes, it fuses sci-fi, slapstick, and Hallmark-movie aesthetics-as well as cameos from Jane Fonda, Trevor Noah, and a grab bag of other celebrities. Along with a new, similarly titled album, the project is clearly meant to be her opus, a self-aware burst of uncategorizable too-muchness. And yet it's also, hauntingly, not nearly enough to achieve her goals.\n\nAlthough the project might sound outrageous, it looks familiar: The director, Dave Meyers, has, over decades, created tonally similar fantasias for Missy Elliott, Ariana Grande, and Lopez herself. In this film, the camera swoops through busy CGI backdrops and overdecorated sets. Squadrons of dancers perform fierce choreography blending the lyricism of interpretive dance with the pulsation of hip-hop. The details are splendid (Lopez's outfits demand pause-and-rewind admiration), and the concepts are campy but fresh. Lopez battles an abusive lover in a honeycomb of glass walls; she tries to repair her heart in a grease-streaked, steampunk factory. But as in so many superhero movies, the overall effect is hyperactive yet deadened, causing the viewer's gaze to bounce off the screen rather than be drawn into it.\n\nThe experience is improved if you know anything about Lopez herself, which is good because a large chunk of Earth's population does. This Is Me ... Now: A Love Story riffs on the famous fact that she has been married four times, most recently to Ben Affleck, the actor she legendarily first dated and broke up with in the early 2000s. Her serial-monogamy blues fueled the 2022 rom-com Marry Me , but here, it is fodder for surreal myth. Throughout this film, her alleged addiction to love is criticized and mocked by two groups of commentators: a band of friends on Earth and a council of astrological gods played stiffly by those aforementioned celebrities. In the film's best sequence, a pink-festooned wedding scene, the face of Lopez's new hubby keeps switching between those of different hunks while her friends look on with exhaustion.\n\nHow does this ring cycle end? Lopez's new album of competent pop R&B presents Affleck's reemergence in her life as a fairy-tale culmination to her story, but the movie is more about interior milestones: loving oneself, healing one's inner child, and other psychoanalytical concepts. (Oh yeah: The rapper Fat Joe plays her therapist, rocking dorky sweaters with majesty.) The supposed baring of Lopez's soul is a bit facile, but of course it is: She's using multiple aesthetics and moods not to create depth and complication, but to bedazzle the same indomitable image she's always hustled to project. As she put it in her 2022 documentary, Halftime , \"One of the things I'm proud of is that I'm able to hold it together in front of everybody, without anybody knowing how I feel.\"\n\nWhat's moving about the new project isn't what's on-screen, but what its ambition represents. The harshest public criticism about Lopez isn't that she loves too much; it's that she's just a pretty face without great talent. (For example: The comedian Ayo Edebiri, who hosted SNL the same week that Lopez performed on it, recently found herself in a light scandal when it emerged that she had called Lopez's success a \"scam\" on a 2020 podcast.) Two years ago, Halftime portrayed Lopez as struggling against a deep inferiority complex. Now the gutsiness and excess of This Is Me serve as another attempt to be taken seriously.\n\nYet, really, Lopez shouldn't have anything to prove. No one becomes one of the most enduringly successful figures in a generation by fluke-and no amount of sweat and expense will convince skeptics otherwise. To be famous is to be doubted, and Lopez-or any contemporary titan of metanarrative and self-victimhood, such as Taylor Swift and Drake-cannot escape that fact. Later this month, Lopez will release yet another filmed commentary on herself: a making-of documentary about This Is Me , featuring her reading love letters from Affleck. It will likely offer another reminder that our era's defining art form is really the performance of self, seeking approval that can never feel total."

      "text": "Are Gorgeous Comediennes Really That Rare? Your Thoughts\n\nFormer Disney CEO Michael Eisner recently made controversial remarks about female beauty and humor. Our readers join the public debate that ensued.\n\nLast week at the Aspen Ideas Festival, Michael Eisner stirred up controversy during his on-stage conversation with actress Goldie Hawn, a friend and former colleague of his. The Atlantic 's Spencer Kornhaber reported the remarks:\n\n\"From my position, the hardest artist to find is a beautiful, funny woman,\" [Eisner] said. \"By far. They usually-boy am I going to get in trouble, I know this goes online-but usually, unbelievably beautiful women, you [Goldie Hawn] being an exception, are not funny. [...] In the history of the motion-picture business, the number of beautiful, really beautiful women-a Lucille Ball-that are funny, is impossible to find.\n\nIn the context of a public conversation with Goldie Hawn in which I was complimenting her on being both beautiful and funny, I said such a combination is hard to come by in Hollywood. I certainly did not say Goldie was the only one. My point was simply that Goldie, unlike many, has not been defined exclusively as one or the other.\n\nInfluencers and decision-makers who share the views that Eisner was stupid enough to say out loud actually decide whether or not I work, my career and sometimes my personal fate. People who share his views, and all the other men who think the things about women that he is expressing verbally, should simply be subjected to a panel of women - women of my choosing - who decide his career fate and legacy based on his physical appearance.\n\nThe panel might include Amy Schumer, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Tina Fey, and Patricia Arquette:\n\nSchumer, by the way, recently made a whole episode, \" 12 Angry Men Inside Amy Schumer ,\" parodying the way men sometimes judge the beauty of female comedians. (Watch one of the brilliant scenes here .) Eisner's comments also got a lot of scrutiny this week from writers such as Ann Friedman , Amanda Marcotte , and Catherine Rampell . The latter had the strongest original point:\n\nIf Eisner really had been hell-bent on casting comic beauties, he was, in his heyday, almost uniquely positioned to locate this supposedly missing talent. Or rather, to create it. He did after all helm Disney during its animation renaissance, when the studio churned out classics such as \"The Lion King,\" \"Aladdin,\" \"Beauty and the Beast\" and \"The Little Mermaid.\" But even in these beloved animated films, wherein female characters' appearances could be drawn to any comely specification imaginable, the comic roles were still dominated by dudes. Where, pray tell, was the lady version of Pumbaa ? Better yet, where was the hot lady version of Pumbaa?\n\nIndeed, in this list of \"Disney's 10 Funniest Comic Relief Characters,\" the only female one is Vanellope von Schweetz in Wreck-It Ralph . The writer openly wonders, \"Why are so few comic sidekicks female?\"\n\nRegarding Eisner's remarks, Atlantic readers had a discussion in the comments section that was more nuanced and substantive than the public debate. Here's SAlfin :\n\nI could list lots of funny, beautiful women: Diane Keaton, Jane Fonda, Sofia Vergara, her co-star Julie Bowen, Jane Curtain, Kaley Cuoco, Mary Tyler Moore, Cybill Shepherd, Jane Krakowski, Debra Messing, Megan Mullally, Julia Louis-Dreyfuss-heck, I could do this all day. The issue isn't \"beauty cancels out funny.\" The issue is that Hollywood has made roles for women one-dimensional so the ingenue can't be funny; she just has to look pretty.\n\nAsurbanopol adds:\n\nTruth is, roles for women in general in movies and TV have always been handicapped by the fact that most writers are men, most directors are men and most film executives are men. The reason a lot of men were even attracted to film in the first place was to hook up with sexy girls by occupying a power position in an industry notorious for exploitation.\n\nBut many of our readers didn't find the remarks especially offensive or simply gave Eisner the benefit of the doubt. Here's Paxmelanoleuca :\n\nEisner's observation wasn't totally unreasonable, although you don't see many smoking hot male comedians either. A lot of comedy comes from awkwardness and discomfort that people experience as part of their feelings of not meeting society's unwritten expectations, socially or physically. Maybe it's an experience that beautiful people don't have that often.\n\nDavis MacCaulay also looks at the issue in gender neutral terms:\n\nAttention is a fairly basic need while growing up, so it stands to reason that physically attractive people (male or female) aren't generally going to feel the need to strive in areas other than \"being attractive,\" since that gets the job done.\n\nBut kryten8 complicates that point:\n\nIt seems clear that struggling with adversity is one way to become a great comic, and being a funny-looking guy is one way, but being a woman (beautiful or funny-looking) can provide you with a good deal of adversity.\n\nMujokan adds along those lines:\n\nIn the counterfactual, Eisner would be having the conversation with a very handsome comic actor, someone like George Clooney. And probably the same problem would be there because not many people are that good looking and not many people are that funny in general, so it is a rare combination.\n\nDuncan Tweedy discusses how male comedians often downplay their looks for comedic cred:\n\nWhen Louis C.K. portrays himself as a young man, he invariably describes a younger version of the way he looks now, i.e. sorta fat and pudgy and kind of ugly. He apparently doesn't want to admit that when he was a young man doing stand-up, he was a generally handsome and physically fit guy. There's plenty of footage from those days to confirm this.\n\nIf Louis C.K. was still a good-looking guy, would half his material connect nearly so effectively? I think not. Losing his good looks was a fantastic boon to his career.\n\nSelf-deprecating humor just doesn't connect as well when it comes from a beautiful person. And as difficult as it might be for an audience to sympathize with a good-looking man, that difficulty will be an order of magnitude worse for a woman. An \"unbelievably beautiful woman\"* does not elicit the same extreme reactions as a beautiful man (outside a gay bar anyway). People will trip over themselves to offer beautiful women all sorts of advantages-nor are all these reactions beneficial, as Hawn's Al Capp story illustrates. [Listen to that disturbing story here , retold by Hawn to Eisner at the A.I.F.] People both revere and resent beauty, and that undercuts opportunities for comedy.\n\nI don't think Eisner should be excoriated for this comment. He wasn't saying women aren't funny, which is a stupid and indefensible argument. He was merely noticing that \"unbelievable\" physical beauty makes being a successful female comedian much more difficult. I think there's plenty of evidence for this.\n\n* Some complicating factors bear taking a closer look at. I think Amy Poehler and Kristen Wiig are \"unbelievably beautiful\" (see also Lucille Ball). However, if you compare them to A-list female movie stars, you see that there's a difference, if not in quantity of beauty, certainly in quality. I'm laughing just remembering the dopey faces Poehler and Wiig (and Ball) use to great comedic effect. Anne Hathaway or Jennifer Lawrence, great actresses though they are, just couldn't pull that off. Most of what makes an A-list actress beautiful is very similar to a top model's beauty. Most of what makes Poehler, Wiig, and Ball beautiful is in the twinkle of their eyes and the funny expressions they make.\n\nHerein lies the confusing convergence: In a very real way, funny is beautiful.\n\nWhat do you think? Email hello@theatlantic.com and I'll update the post with any original points. And regarding our last reader's point about Louis CK downplaying his looks for comedic effect, be sure to check out a piece Ashley Fetters wrote for us a few years ago, \" Why Do So Many Pretty Female Comedians Pretend They're Ugly? \" Update from a reader, Beverly Haynes, via email:\n\nMen are mesmerized by extreme female beauty. The thought process necessary to perceive humor and deliver laughter is interfered with, broken by beauty. Also, the ability to make people laugh is powerful, and women tend to not want to give drop-dead gorgeous women more power than they already have.\n\nUpdate from another reader, Susan Silver, who wrote for The Mary Tyler Moore Show and asked Hawn a question about ageism at the Aspen Ideas Festival talk:\n\nAs the former Casting Director of Laugh-In , I was so happy to see Goldie again.  And I had worked for Michael a few times.  I was surprised more at the answer he gave to my question about ageism, particularly towards women in the business.  He sort of side-stepped it, saying something like \"When we were young we had success ...\" The way I took it, he implied that now it was others' chance. Huh?\n\nAgeism is the new sexism. A few years ago, we members of the Writer's Guild who were affected got a very nice financial settlement and acknowledgement that studios and agencies were ageist.  So I'm not sure what Michael meant as far as beautiful women not being funny; we know that is not true.\n\nOh well, Goldie was great and is involved in a very important project with education and children's brains.\n\nMore on that project here . And below is the full audio of Silver's question to Hawn about ageism (Eisner's odd response starts at the 2:50 mark):\n\nAnother email comes from Dawn Sesta in L.A.:\n\nA problem exists with our definition of beauty. Michael Eisner is defining beauty in the traditional, passive sense. It is a quality someone possesses effortlessly that is of no utility, only aesthetic pleasure. Comedy is not passive. Comedy is active and reactionary, moving, conversational, living and breathing. When a woman is funny she makes herself a player of the game, not a prize to be acquired. And I don't think the way beauty is being defined here is able to exist in a realm where everyone is on the same field."

She joked about how characters are often misinterpreted. The men she rose up against on film, she said, are often called, \"losers or p---ies.\"\n\nShe specifically praised Sebastian Stan, who plays Donald Trump in his Oscar-nominated performance in The Apprentice . She called on viewers to understand people-and then rally against them.\n\n\"Make no mistake, empathy is not weak or woke. And by the way, woke just means you give a damn about other people,\" Fonda said to huge applause. \"A whole lot of people are going to be really hurt by what is happening, what is coming our way. And even if they are of different persuasion we need to call upon our empathy and listen with our hearts and welcome them into our tent. Because we are going to need a big tent to resist successfully what is coming at us.\"\n\nShe then recalled her film career beginning in 1958 at the tail end of McCarthyism, remarking that \"Hollywood resisted,\" before tying everything back to current politics and how film creates empathy.\n\n\"Have any of you watched a documentary about one of our movements, like apartheid or the civil rights movement or Stonewall and asked yourself, 'would you have been brave enough to walk a bridge?' Or 'would you have been able to take the hoses and the batons and the dogs?' We don't have to wonder anymore because we are in our documentary moment. This is it. And it's not a rehearsal. This is it.\"\n\nWhile the audience applauded, Fonda stood proud and certain while she delivered the end of her speech:\n\n\"We must not isolate. We must stay in community. We must help the vulnerable. We must find ways to project an inspiring vision of the future, one that is beckoning, welcoming...there will still be love, there will still be love, there will still be beauty, and there will be an ocean of truth to swim in. Let's make it so.\"\n\nSenior Editor, Obsessed\n\nkevin.fallon@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "Follow Jane Fonda and Sharon Osbourne's Hair Example. Go White, Not Gray.\n\nJane Fonda's hair was a late-evening Oscars surprise. A mere three and a half hours into the interminable ceremony, the actress breezed onstage, slinging the crimson red coat she wears during her now-weekly arrests over her shoulder. It was a meaningful nod to civil disobedience chic, but my eyes stayed focused on her snow white hair.\n\nIt's not surprising that an 82-year-old woman would be going gray, of course, but Fonda's was a heightened take on the \"natural\" color. It wasn't just platinum or icy or edgy-it was as sharp as an arctic stalactite.\n\nIt came courtesy of Jack Martin , colorist and owner of a salon in Orange County. On Instagram, Martin wrote that the dye process took over 7 hours, during which Fonda got some work done, writing chapters for her book, memorizing lines, and answering emails.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis past weekend, Sharon Osbourne sat in Martin's chair. Again, Martin took to Instagram to describe how Osbourne, 67, has dyed her hair \"once a week\" for 18 years to maintain her ubiquitous cherry red mane. No longer-after eight hours, Osbourne emerged from the salon with her \"natural\" white hair in tow, thanks to some bleach and toner.\n\nDespite what the ceaseless hair dye ads that play during my true crime podcasts want me to believe, it's OK to go gray . That's true now, and has been true for quite some time. Susan Sontag's skunk stripe was described as \"leonine,\" \"striking,\" and \"magnificent.\" Helen Mirren, Emmylou Harris, Maye Musk, and Carmen Dell'Orefice have repped the shade for years, each one exuding an all-knowing, uncomplicated beauty.\n\nIn November, Alexandra Grant-a visual artist who is unfortunately better known to the internet as \" Keanu Reeves's date \"-drew praise for stepping onto the red carpet alongside the actor with salt-and-pepper braids piled high on her head. Editorial writers congratulated Grant on \"embracing\" her age (46). Maybe she was just being it.\n\nEither way, Fonda and Osbourne's color is different. Their hair isn't gray, or at least not the gray we're all going. It's not quite platinum blonde, either. It reflects light magnificently in photos, but on its own it's not shiny.\n\nThe style does not fit the dwarfed perception of how women are supposed to look once they're too old to date Leonardo DiCaprio-that is, homely and sexless. In fact, if Osbourne tousled her pixie just a bit, she'd look pretty punk rock.\n\nOne colorist from Massachusetts named Daniel Tetreault dubbed his ultra-white dye jobs \"nordic,\" which took off on Instagram last year . Online, he's known as \"Platinum blonde daddy,\" and his clients are decades younger than Fonda or Osbourne. The look's appeal spans generations.\n\nRM, the 24-year-old rapper and member of the K-pop boy group BTS, has flirted with white hair over the past few years. Lexi Brumback , a star of Netflix's Cheer whose tumbling videos I watch pretty much once a day, also sports the style. She's 20.\n\nIn my early 20s, I also bleached my hair. I did it because I was feeling a little adrift. I was gaining weight and losing agency. I felt like I was watching someone else live my life, like a movie scene, so I thought at least that person should be hot and blonde.\n\nI was not prepared for the deluge of comments I would receive from everyone, but especially other women, mostly strangers who came up to me saying they wanted to dye their hair too, so badly, they did not want to ruin it. At this, I would finger my many split ends, which I had taken to naming, so I would hate them less. Despite this, I plan to go white again, this weekend-why not, spring is coming. And sorry, but I like the attention.\n\n\"Everybody wants what many people can't have,\" Tetreault told The Daily Beast. \"They want something expensive. Any girl with a clean, healthy platinum blonde, another girl knows she's paid a lot of money for it.\"\n\nAs indicated by Fonda's stylists, and many others, it takes many hours of sitting in a chair to lift someone's hair to angel-white status, and then a copious amount of products to help the color last. That's a lot of time and money to invest in anything. For some, this means the color can be a visual flex, like a Rolex in the '80s. Look, I can afford this.\n\n\"That hair is like an Hermès bag,\" Tetreault went on. \"A girl sees that bag, she knows if it's a baby Birkin , regular Birkin, or crocodile Birkin. Girls know the difference.\"\n\n\"A lot of women toy with the idea of going white, but it's kind of hard,\" Stephanie Brown , a New York-based colorist, said. \"But it's hard to get there, especially if you're young and not already gray. You're in the salon for hours, getting your color out, putting gray on top of it, then there's upkeep. Platinum is for a certain group of men and women who have the time and don't mind having hair that breaks.\"\n\nFor as many bright young things who consider getting white hair another part of their grooming regime, there are older women who look at it as a rejection of standards. \"[Going white] is a nice way to give one of your beauty things up,\" Brown explained. \"If you go naturally gray, that means you don't have to worry about getting your hair done every week.\"\n\nOr, as Fonda and Osbourne's anything-but-grizzled manes prove, going gray does not have to \r\rmean a \"giving up\"  of anything. A woman can enjoy the ritual of leaving a salon with her hair feeling silkier, her head held higher. But she can also want to exit looking just a bit more normal. But not too normal. This is Jane Fonda and Sharon Osbourne we're talking about, after all.\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "I'll Never Forget Jane Fonda Announcing 'Parasite' Won the Oscar for Best Picture\n\nEntertainment Critic\n\nIt's tough to think about anything related to the 2020 Oscars ceremony without being reminded of the dour fact that we were just weeks away from a global COVID lockdown. As Kyle Richards once said , \"We were all so happy that day, it's hard to even imagine how terrible things would soon become.\" In this case, \"terrible\" would be the world's biggest understatement.\n\nJust a short time after 2020's Best Picture winner, Parasite , heralded the dawn of a new age when it was given cinema's highest honor, the industry came screeching to a halt. Would Parasite 's epic sweep really be the signal of a shifting standard, or would it be the last of its kind?\n\nThree years later, we know that it was, thankfully, the former. The industry has restarted after an extended break, along with plenty of new pandemic protocols. And though Parasite 's monumental win hasn't exactly resulted in the systemic shake-up many had hoped for, it still stands as a formative Oscar moment-one that made undeniable, impactful history.\n\nIn the months leading up to the ceremony, Parasite had become the competition's dark horse. After a buzzy run on the festival circuit, where it won Cannes' coveted Palme d'Or, the film had spent the rest of 2019 picking up a major following. Word of mouth among audiences got viewers into theater seats to see just how incredible Bong Joon-ho's latest was.\n\nBy the end of the year, Parasite was a shoo-in for the Best International Film category at the 2020 Oscars. But when the film scored a nomination in several other major categories as well-including Best Picture and Best Director-it seemed like the Academy had finally begun to take the criticisms of its practices to heart.\n\nEver since the 2016 race ignited the viral hashtag, #OscarsSoWhite , the Academy had been under a microscope when it came to acknowledging the cinematic efforts of non-white industry members. With Parasite 's unprecedented popularity and irrefutable brilliance, relegating the South Korean movie solely to the Best International Film category would've been another egregious misstep. Everyone held their breath watching the nominations be announced. Lo and behold, Parasite came away with six Oscar nominations total, making it the first South Korean film to receive Oscar attention.\n\nOn the night of the ceremony, the film picked up accolades for Best Director, Best International Film, and Best Original Screenplay. Things were looking good, but there was still plenty of time for the Academy to shoot itself in the foot and give its highest honor to-gulp- Jojo Rabbit . When the legendary Jane Fonda emerged from backstage to present the final award of the night, there was a collective hush of anxiety in both the Dolby Theater living rooms around the world.\n\nFonda began her speech by highlighting the importance of raising awareness for social issues. \"Tonight, we've hopefully brought to light the impact that films have made and can make on our lives, as individuals, and on society as a whole.\" The statement seemed like a nod to Parasite 's clever dissection of the discrepancy between economic classes. Upon seeing the clips from each film nominated, it was clear to everyone watching that one film stood out among the group.\n\nAs Fonda opened the envelope, she took a pause before uttering the winner. It was a brief moment of reflection, privately held for just a fraction of a second by an actress whose lifelong activism has been just as impactful as her film career . Fonda understood the gravity of this instance; history was about to be made. With a glint in her eye, a smile on her face, and an emotional crack in her voice, Fonda spoke one word to deafening cheers: \" Parasite .\"\n\nParasite was the first-ever non-English-language film in the 92-year history of the Oscars to win Best Picture. It took the Academy nearly a century to recognize the merits of a film outside of its myopic Western bubble. Parasite was a triumph that began far outside the golden gates of Hollywood, and its win indicated that doors that had once been firmly sealed to international filmmakers were now open-or, at the very least, ajar.\n\nJane Fonda gives the Best Motion Picture Oscar statue to Bong Joon Ho at the 92nd Academy Awards in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, U.S., February 9, 2020.\n\nWhile the Academy still has miles to go when it comes to noticeable diversity and actionable change, Parasite 's win was the first of several steps toward a brighter future for the beleaguered telecast. Furthermore, it was a win so glorious that its shine cannot be dimmed by the memory of COVID looming right around the corner.\n\nFew moments from the first two months of 2020 can be remembered without a depressing melancholy. But the sight of Bong Joon-ho, Kwak Sin Ae, and the entire Parasite crew accepting their award-emboldened by an audience of celebrities shouting for their momentous speech to continue as long as possible-is a memory too shining to ever dim.\n\nRead more of our picks for \"My Favorite Oscars Win\"\n\nThree 6 Mafia winning Best Original Song\n\nRead more of our picks for \"The Oscars Moment I'll Never Forget\"\n\nThe emotional 2009 acting tributes\n\nJohn Travolta's 'Adele Dazeem' gaffe\n\nKeep obsessing!

She talks to Sophie Heawood about racism, cosmetic surgery and the joys of working again with Robert Redford\n\nJ ane Fonda has ruined me. I never want to interview anyone under the age of 80 again. Specifically, I never want to interview anyone who isn't 80, and who doesn't phone me for a catch-up call from a limo in Cannes, in which they are being driven to the airport, having gone to a deeply glamorous film festival party the night before and now finding themselves, as Fonda puts it delicately, \"slightly hungover\". Fonda isn't even hugely interested in Cannes these days, not like back in the day \"when people wore their own clothes and went there to talk about movies\".\n\nNo, she's hungover in the limo, but wants to talk about the Black Lives Matter movement ; about what she has recently learned of the mass incarceration of African-Americans in her country and how it isn't enough for white women like her to be empathetic. They have to stand up and make this stop, because America is a country built on slavery and it isn't over yet.\n\nIt's a continuation of the conversation that began a few days previously, when I met her backstage at the Ellen DeGeneres chat show in Los Angeles. Fonda was preparing to promote her new film, Book Club , in which she plays one of four women who have reached a certain age, read Fifty Shades of Grey in their book club, and decided to do something about their passions. The link between spicing up your sex life and committing to ending gross inequality might not be an obvious one, but she explains that Book Club is about female solidarity and women having each other's backs, and so is much of her \"feminist activism\". Even though, when she first got interested in politics, she had just starred in the 1968 erotic sci-fi film Barbarella \"and I took a lot of heat on it from feminists. The new women's movement was in its early stages and there was a lot of...\" she adopts a comically stern voice: \"'How do you feel making a movie that exploits women, like Barbarella ?' You'd kind of want to say: 'Well, honey, nobody forced me.' But,\" she concedes, \"it wasn't much fun to make it.\"\n\nFonda's small, white, fluffy dog Tulear is perched beside her. She actually wanted to name the dog Barbarella, but her daughter Vanessa, whose father, Roger Vadim, directed the film, wasn't keen.\n\nIf Book Club is a sort of geriatric Sex and the City , then Fonda plays the Samantha character, a leopardskin-clad businesswoman who schedules sex and won't commit. \"Vivian is sassy, she doesn't want any emotional entanglements, and that was kind of fun.\" Fonda explains that back in the early 20th century, \"before there were the Nielsen ratings or whatever, the censor, there were actresses such as Myrna Loy, Barbara Stanwyck and Mae West playing dangerous women - the parts they played were like guys. Then puritanism crept in. But I think there are going to be more women-centric movies, like Book Club , now. A lot of these movies are doing well, and I don't think this is a phase - I think this is it.\"\n\nJane Fonda was born in 1937, the daughter of the actor Henry Fonda, and while her life was socially privileged, her home life was agony, and her mother, Frances Ford Seymour, killed herself in a psychiatric hospital. (Fonda was 12 and only found out that her mother's death was suicide from a movie magazine - nobody ever spoke to her about it.) Jane herself was also sexually abused and in her memoirs she writes movingly about the concept of disembodiment - how it took her until the age of 62 to fully inhabit her own body.\n\nHer marriage to Ted Turner had just ended, \"and I was single again and I realised... I'm not scared,\" she says of it now. \"I was alone in the house, looking out through my own eyes and I could live inside my own skin. It was a revelation. It was something else.\"\n\nHow painful is it that it took so long to get herself back?\n\n\"I feel very sad that so many girls are abused all over the world and that men don't understand what it does to them. It's not something that happens lightly, it can alter a person. And then you have to be very intentional about getting back into your own skin, but it can be done. It wasn't so much that I felt sad about all the wasted time, because I wasn't fully authentic, but on the other hand, why not instead just be proud of yourself that you got there and you didn't stop trying?\"\n\nShe also links plastic surgery to sexual abuse and has said that when she sees the face \"of a woman who has made herself into a mask, I always think to myself... I wonder, I wonder.\" She had her own breast implants taken out and has also had several facelifts of which she says she is not proud.\n\nAs for #MeToo, is it also painful to not have had such a movement 50 years ago? Fonda once again takes my negative and turns it into a positive.\n\n\"I am very grateful to be alive through this,\" she says softly. \"I did not think I would live to see it. Yes. And I think that it's going to continue, it's not just a moment. I love the Time's Up aspect of it. We're working with women from all different places. I'm going to DC to lobby with domestic workers. The farm workers up in Bakersfield. It's all of us together, having each other's backs.\"\n\nThis is why she made the film 9 to 5 in 1980, which became one of Hollywood's highest grossing comedies ever, despite its subject matter of the awful way men treated women in the workplace. Fonda wants to produce a new version of the film, with younger actors, who now find their work life even more precarious on zero-hours contracts. We discuss the state of the labour unions in the United States. \"So all this is not so new for me. But it is for a lot of other actors, and that's why it's a very valuable thing to hear what other women in other industries have to put up with, women who are much more vulnerable than we are.\"\n\nI have to say it: Jane Fonda looks stunning, immaculately coiffed and made up, and with the poise and elegance that has always been hers. It's thanks to a lifetime of fitness regimes for which everyone remembers her videos, and also to the facelifts. But they, she says, were more about survival in her industry than about vanity. \"They bought me an extra 10 years.\" Like it or not, it does seem to be true. How many other 80-year-old women currently have a hit comedy series on Netflix ( Grace and Frankie ), as well as movies coming out, a documentary on their life about to hit HBO, and no signs of stopping any time soon?\n\nOf course this is all down to much more than surgery: it is the third act of a career that began more than half a century ago and has involved two Oscars for Best Actress (and a further five nominations) along the way. Curiously, it is the fitness videos that people in the UK remember her for the most. In the States, there are still people who boycott Jane Fonda's films because of how deeply involved she got in protesting against the Vietnam war. Not that any of that stopped her.\n\n\"Oh, I just feel damn lucky,\" she says of her current renaissance. \"I retired for 15 years. I left at 50 and came back at 65. I was married to Ted Turner and Ted didn't really help me with confidence and things like that. [They are great friends now, however, and he recently attended her 80th birthday party.] So after that I wanted to see if I could enjoy it again. But, at 65, I never thought I'd have a career. And a hit TV show! I'm 80! I keep pinching myself! I can't believe it! I didn't think I would live this long!\"\n\nIn Grace and Frankie , which is now approaching its fifth season, she and Lily Tomlin's character become accidental, grumpy housemates after their husbands fall in love with each other. When I tell people I'm going to interview Jane Fonda, a surprisingly wide range of people tell me how much they love that show. \"I know,\" she says, her voice dropping to an absolute whisper. \"We're stunned. We did not expect that. We're trying to figure it out!\" she hisses.\n\nShe loves working with her old friend Tomlin \"because she's a working-class gal who grew up in a fascinating family. People visit the set who were with her in elementary school. She is just so funny - and I've tried to learn that from her. But it just comes naturally to her.\" Surely you're funny, too, I say. \"Oh no,\" replies Fonda, \"I don't have a natural funny bone. I come from a long line of depressed people.\" She laughs.\n\nHaving been married several times and lived with various partners, and recently split up with her last boyfriend, the music producer Richard Perry (she describes him as \"a younger man\" - she also wrote a blog about him having Parkinson's), Fonda now lives in a gated retirement enclave with her own house, but a shared community centre with a pool and tennis courts \"where I always see one or two other residents who seem infinitely older than I am, but they probably aren't. I never thought I would ever live there, but it's great.\"\n\nShe does yoga and Pilates and has even made a whole new series of workout videos, \"and their label is Prime Time, as they're for older people. I can't do the original workouts any more, because I'll hurt myself,\" she gestures to her hips, \"as I have joint replacements.\" In fact, she says her main form of exercise these days involves jumping into things \"before I really know what I'm doing. It's called a leap of faith and it's my main form of exercise. It's what keeps me young, too. That's my new workout. When you take a leap of faith you don't always land in the right place, but you sure do learn things. It's good for the heart.\"\n\nWhich is why she recently made a speech at the United State of Wome n Summit, and asked to bring Patrisse Cullors , the co-founder of Black Lives Matter, with her. \"What I said was, when Trump was elected and white supremacy was exposed, I realised that, as a white woman, the lens through which I was looking at race was too narrow. I think a lot of Trump's election had to do with white supremacy and anger at a black president. I was stunned at how close to the surface racism in the United States is, and I needed to understand it better, so my intention right now is to try to understand more profoundly what it means to be black in the United States. And so I started studying. And I started reading books and I read Patrisse Cullors' book, and I read Ta-Nehisi Coates . I read The New Jim Crow [by Michelle Alexander]. So I talked about what I've learned, specifically about mass incarceration. I'm a white woman and this is something that we white women have to know: you can't just be empathic, you have to be very intentional. We have to confront racism. We have to stop this. Not buy into the lies that we're told about how the prison system stops crime. No, it creates crime.\"\n\nAt the weekends, she leaves Los Angeles to go knocking on the door of Trump voters. \"When you're talking to them you can't criticise Trump. You can't criticise Fox News. All you can do is listen to what they care about and what they're afraid of, and then maybe tell them something that they don't know. Because we're all in our bubbles, including me.\" Do people recognise her? \"I was in Bakersfield last Saturday and knocked on 30 doors. Only one person saw me coming and said: ' Grace and Frankie !' It was a kick! Nobody else knew who I was. I just say: 'I'm Jane.' They don't need to know.\"\n\nShe has also been acting with Robert Redford again. I tell her that I recently watched Barefoot in the Park , the 1967 film where she and Redford are giddy newlyweds in New York, and then went to Netflix and watched Our Souls at Night , in which she and Redford reunited in 2017 to play widowed grandparents who get together to end their loneliness.\n\nI tell her it was a really beautiful night of cinema, to see these two actors come back together with their war wounds, their egos bruised, their hearts more honest in later life. To my surprise, Fonda's eyes start to water. \"Ohh,\" she says softly. \"It moves me that you say that.\"\n\nShe has said that she was always in love with him when they worked together, but they were always married to other people. He said recently that he had no idea she loved him. Do they keep in touch? Send texts? \"Oh no. He doesn't text, number one; two, he's a loner. So that's that.\" She says she won't ever fall in love again. \"I love men, I'm not done with men, but I'm done with marriage and dating.\"\n\nFonda is unimpressed by the romance in many modern films. \"I'm not a big mouth opener on camera. Every time I see a love scene with young ones - they come at each other like this...\" she mimes a big wide-open slobbering jaw, \"...and I'm thinking, well where does the fun come in? Because the fun is the sensuality of lips. And then slowly moving beyond that. But not trying to swallow each other.\" She giggles. \"I would not want to go right into a tongue kiss, quite frankly.\"\n\nAnd then Woody Harrelson walks past the dressing room. Fonda sends somebody to get him back. \"I want to hug you!\" she says, standing up to greet him. \"I saw Three Billboards again last night because I had a house guest who hadn't seen it. You're so good Woody, God!\" she says. \" You're so good, Jane!\" says a glowing, goofy Harrelson. It's like watching a peacock hug a panda.\n\nAnd then they both have to go off and be on the telly, and I am left with the sense of having just been visited by grace and greatness.\n\nBook Club is in cinemas from 1 June\n\nThis is the archive of The Observer up until 21/04/2025.

      "text": "Jane Fonda on the climate fight: 'The cure for despair is action'\n\nSometimes the only way to get attention is to break the rules. Fifty years after my first arrest, I've embraced being locked up in the name of the planet. As Cop26 nears, here's why it's time to rise up\n\nThe good fight: the climate activists risking everything\n\nT he first time I was ever arrested, I was picked up for smuggling drugs into the US from Canada. They were vitamin pills, but that didn't seem to matter to the police officer in Cleveland, who mentioned that his orders had come from the Nixon White House. It was 1970. I had just started a campus speaking tour protesting against the Vietnam war, and was under surveillance by the National Security Agency. I raised my fist for the mugshot, and after a night in jail, they let me go.\n\nI think the idea was to discredit my opposition to the war, and maybe get my speeches cancelled. Instead, students turned up in their thousands. My first arrest wasn't for an act of civil disobedience, exactly, but the lesson I took away from that surreal experience was just how powerful it can be to set your ideals against the machinery of the state. Half a century later, it still works. And, as the extraordinary activists who tell their stories here attest, it remains an indispensable means of being heard by those who would prefer to ignore us.\n\nToday, the climate crisis requires collective action on a scale that humanity has never accomplished, and in the face of those odds a sense of hopelessness may occasionally descend. But the antidote to that feeling is to do something. The question is: what? Changing individual lifestyle choices like giving up meat and getting rid of single-use plastic won't cut it when time is not on our side. We need to go further, faster. Instead of changing straws and lightbulbs, we need to focus on changing policy and politicians. We need large numbers of people working together for solutions that work for the climate. Nonviolent civil disobedience can help to mobilise that movement. At 83, I'm still ready to get arrested when the occasion demands it.\n\nIn 2019, for example, I was arrested four times . I had been inspired by the global rising of Extinction Rebellion , the Sunrise Movement , and Greta Thunberg . Young people like Greta were calling on older generations to step up, and, well, I'm definitely older. It made sense to me: why should the burden of fixing this problem be on those who didn't create it? In the same year, almost 400 scientists from more than 20 countries called for civil disobedience, arguing that \"the continued governmental inaction over the climate and ecological crisis now justifies peaceful, nonviolent protest and direct action, even if this goes beyond the bounds of the current law\". I thought: maybe if I could get arrested in my 80s, it would get noticed. People might say: if she can do it, so can I.\n\nWith the help of Greenpeace, I launched Fire Drill Fridays . For four months we held weekly rallies in Washington DC followed by acts of civil disobedience including standing on the Capitol steps with banners, chanting, and blocking roads. We started small: about 16 of us walked up the steps of the Capitol, and turned to face the crowd of supporters and media that had followed us. There was something routine, almost ritualistic, about it: a line of 10 police officers had parted to let us take up our position. Then, as we had been told they would, they gave us the first of three warnings that we had to leave or face arrest.\n\nWe kept chanting and waving our signs. After the third warning, they stepped towards those of us who had stood our ground, and began to secure our hands behind our backs with white plastic cuffs. They stayed silent, almost stoic, as they led us to the vans. But we felt energised. I wasn't scared: this was what I wanted to do, to put my body on the line, align myself fully with my values. There is something powerful about not knowing what's about to happen, knowing that for a period of time you will have no control, and then to go ahead, and do it anyway.\n\nI don't mean to cast myself as a hero: the simple calculation is that my age and celebrity secures the kind of national and global press attention that the cause needs. That's why I invited friends like Catherine Keener and Rosanna Arquette to join me. Another time, I shouted my acceptance speech for a Bafta while they led me away in cuffs. My publicist had hoped I'd come back to Los Angeles for it, but I'm told they liked the video in the auditorium.\n\nEvery Friday, people travelled to join us from all over the country. Most had never risked arrest before, and many told me they found the experience transformative. But as a famous white woman, I am under no illusions that my experience had much in common with that of a Black person without the international press in tow. We have to grapple with that dreadful reality if we want to be sure that what we're doing is something more than tourism.\n\nAfter a certain number of prior arrests, the police take a firmer line, and so, after my fourth, I wound up spending the night in jail. They shackled my hands and feet, and led me to a cell of my own: just me and the cockroaches. I got a baloney and cheese sandwich on white bread (I happen to like baloney). They stationed an officer outside \"for my protection\", which freaked me out a little bit: given the lock, who could they be protecting me from but themselves? I used my sweater and scarf as a pillow, and put my coat over me, and tried to get some rest. When the officers were clanking up and down, making an awful lot of noise, I summoned all my upper-class-lady powers to ask if they could please be quiet so I could go to sleep. It didn't make any difference.\n\nThe next day was an object lesson in how differently the state treats you depending on your race and position in the world: before I left, I was held with a number of other women, most of them Black, many seeming as if they needed proper care, not incarceration . I walked out, but they did not.\n\nI hope that my disobedience can be a small contribution to the fight to press our governments to make immediate, bold policy changes that end all new fossil fuel development, ensure a just transition for affected workers and communities, and invest in the green energy systems to replace them. Hundreds of millions of lives hang in the balance with every half degree of warming we either enable or avoid, and right now world leaders are going in the opposite direction.\n\nThere is plenty of evidence that nonviolent civil disobedience can change the course of history. Think of the Boston Tea Party , Gandhi's salt march and its role in securing India's freedom from British colonialism, and the Montgomery bus boycott . Climate activists have spent years petitioning, writing articles and books, exposing officials to evidence, generating hundreds of thousands of texts and letters to officials, marched, lobbied: all to no avail.\n\nThis is what justifies nonviolent civil disobedience today - and it must be nonviolent if it is to secure public support. Research by the Yale Project on Climate Communication has found that 11% of Americans are alarmed by the climate crisis, but haven't campaigned because nobody has asked them to. Around 10% of Americans aged over 18 are ready to engage in nonviolent disobedience, but have never been asked to do that, either. Well, it's time to ask. Fire Drill Fridays started with a handful of arrests, and ended with hundreds: since then, we have continued to reach out with virtual Fire Drills during the pandemic. We had 9 million viewers across all digital platforms in 2020; viewers we are educating about climate and inviting to action. It is the \"Great Unasked\" that must be mobilised now worldwide.\n\nWe have all seen documentaries of activists willing to break unjust laws, face hoses and police batons, and asked ourselves what we would do if put to the test. Now's our time. This is our moment. We don't all necessarily need to face the hoses or get arrested, but unprecedented numbers of us need to rise up and put relentless pressure on the leaders who will attend next month's Cop26 summit in Glasgow. We are the last generation that still has a chance to force a course change that can save lives and species on a vast scale. Remember: the cure for despair is action . And if you can put yourself on the line, who knows who you might inspire?"

      "text": "Jane Fonda: 'I'm very rarely afraid. Maybe emotional intimacy scares me'\n\nAfter 50 years of getting arrested, Jane Fonda is still protesting at 82 - this time over the climate crisis. She talks Hollywood, husbands and activism now\n\nRead an exclusive extract from her new memoir, What Can I Do?\n\nW hen Jane Fonda was arrested in Washington DC last December, days shy of her 82nd birthday, there was an overwhelming sense of history repeating, and not just because this was the fifth time she had been arrested in almost as many weeks. Fonda was taking part in her very public - and ongoing, albeit now online - protest against what she sees as the US government's criminal inertia over the climate crisis. When he heard about Fonda's arrests, President Donald Trump crowed to a rally : \"They arrested Jane Fonda - nothing changes! I remember 30, 40 years ago they arrested her. She's always got the handcuffs on, oh man.\"\n\nTrump was partially right, although he underestimated the time. Fonda was first arrested in 1970 ; half a century later she is still protesting, still being arrested and still being mocked by US presidents. On Richard Nixon's notorious White House tapes, he can be heard discussing Fonda in 1971, dismissing her even more public protests against US involvement in the Vietnam war. \"Jane Fonda. What in the world is the matter with Jane Fonda?\" he said. \"I feel so sorry for Henry Fonda, who's a nice man. She's a great actress. She looks pretty. But boy, she's often on the wrong track.\" Less than a year later, Nixon would be taped plotting the Watergate cover-up . Someone should tell Trump that Fonda has an excellent track record of winning the long game, and that her critics don't.\n\nStill, being derided by the most powerful people on the planet must take some getting used to. Does Fonda ever feel scared?\n\n\"The fear part - I don't know why this is true, but I am very rarely afraid. I've been in all kinds of situations: I've been shot at, I've had bombs dropped on me; but I tend not to be afraid. Maybe emotional intimacy scares me. That's where my fear lives,\" she says from her home in Los Angeles, with a self-mocking laugh.\n\nMy fear lives, a tiny bit, in the prospect of interviewing Fonda, precisely because she is so fearless. The first time she was arrested, it was because officials insisted the vitamins in her suitcase were illegal drugs. \"I'm taking orders from Washington!\" one of the customs officials shouted at her - yet she was so undaunted she raised and clenched her fist in her still iconic mugshot.\n\nWhat was she thinking when they took that photograph? \"Defiance,\" she replies firmly, and adds, \"I'm just glad the lighting was good!\"\n\nHow does she feel when she looks at the notorious photographs of her in Hanoi in 1972, sitting behind an enemy anti-aircraft gun as if she were about to shoot down US planes, which led to decades of vilification. \"I want to throw up. I understand why that girl... why that happened. But it just sickens me, the whole thing. But do I regret going? No, never. It was the most life-altering experience I could ever, ever have.\" She apologised a long time ago for sitting behind the North Vietnamese guns, but continued to protest against the war, even though people demonstrated outside her films for years to come.\n\nShe has won two Oscars (for Klute and Coming Home), but Fonda's extraordinary life has, for many, long overshadowed her career. To some, she will for ever be Hanoi Jane; for others, she is the queen of aerobics. To this day, Jane Fonda's Workout remains one of the biggest-selling home videos ever. But Fonda only made it to raise money for the Campaign for Economic Democracy (CED), the non-profit organisation she ran with her second husband, the radical left-wing firebrand Tom Hayden . Wealthy housewives doing pelvic thrusts to the Workout had no idea they were contributing to a cause that wasn't a million miles from socialism, and Fonda raised more than $17m for the CED. (In classic man-of-the-left style, Hayden occasionally made \"disparaging remarks\" about the Workout. \"I would just think, OK, I'm vain. [But] where else would you have got $17m?\" Fonda writes in her 2005 memoir, My Life So Far .)\n\nAs if to prove how little things change, during lockdown Fonda has been making workout TikToks to raise awareness of her environmental protests, still exercising for activism at 82. \"It's fun and it attracts a younger demographic, doing TikTok,\" she says, with the breeziness of one fully fluent in social media.\n\nFonda still looks astonishingly like her father and, with those high cheekbones and dark brows, she has the demeanour - as Henry did - of someone who does not suffer fools. \"In addition to being funny and fun, boy is she ever honest, frank, available and a total straight shooter,\" Sam Waterston, her co-star in the excellent sitcom Grace And Frankie tells me.\n\nFonda has a new book out, called What Can I Do? I tried to count the number of books she has published and I think it's a dozen, but neither of us is sure. On the surface, they seem a somewhat random mix, from a guide to being a teenage girl to the Workout books. But every one is underpinned by Fonda's activism. Being A Teen was partially born out of her work with her foundation, the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Power & Potential (GCAPP), set up in the 90s to help reduce the state's high rates of teen pregnancy. The Workout books were Das Kapital smuggled inside a leotard (sort of).\n\nWhile it is easy to mock celebrity activism, no one can doubt Fonda's bona fides; she has been shouting about the environment since the 1960s, after learning that car emissions damaged the atmosphere. But why keep doing it? Why endure prison with its metal slab of a bed (\"I'm quite bony, so that was painful,\" she admits) instead of enjoying a nice, quiet life in her ninth decade?\n\n\"Oh my God, for my own sanity! Last year, I was going insane, I was so depressed, knowing things were falling apart and I wasn't doing enough. Once I decided what to do, all that dropped away,\" she says.\n\nWhat Can I Do? is a how-to guide and memoir of her protest campaign, known as Fire Drill Friday . This took place in Washington DC every Friday in late 2019, and led to the arrest of Fonda and many of her celebrity friends, including Waterston. \"When we heard what she was planning, we all volunteered,\" he says. \"Jane is one of those people who walks toward the fire. She's out to make a difference.\"\n\nIt takes more than a global plague to break Fonda's stride, and her first online climate protest was so popular the website crashed. \"Can you believe it, a quarter of a million people follow us! This is not what I expected. I'm so busy, I can spend the entire day sitting at my desk on Zoom meetings. I need to go back to work so I can have more time,\" she says, referring to Grace And Frankie, which starts shooting again this autumn.\n\nIn her book, Fonda details her endearingly earnest attempts to get to grips with the climate crisis. But my favourite moments are when she laughs at herself, such as when she catches up on her wall squats in prison (\"Hey, you gotta seize the opportunity\"). \"Well, there's a lot to laugh at! If I didn't laugh at myself I'd be crying,\" she says.\n\nIn January 2018, she posted a photo of herself on Instagram , looking distinctly bedraggled in a designer evening dress she had worn the night before. \"Here's me the next morning. I couldn't get my dress unzipped so I slept in it... Never wanted a husband in my life until now,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Haha, you saw that?\" she cackles.\n\nI not only saw it, I discussed it with Dolly Parton, Fonda's co-star in 9 to 5 , when I interviewed her last year . She said she admired it, but would never do that herself. \"I thought it was cute, but no, never!\" she gasped.\n\n\"Ha! That doesn't surprise me. I once spent 10 days with Dolly on her tour bus and never saw her without full regalia,\" Fonda says, laughing.\n\nParton and I also talked about the time she, Fonda and their other 9 to 5 co-star, Lily Tomlin, presented an award at the 2017 Emmys, with an on-the-nose swipe at Donald Trump.\n\n\"Back in 1980 in [9 to 5], we refused to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot,\" said Fonda.\n\n\"And in 2017, we still refuse to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot,\" added Tomlin. The audience cheered and Parton - doubtless thinking of her southern Republican fanbase - went wide-eyed with alarm.\n\n\"I just did not want everybody to think that whatever Lily and Jane think is what I think,\" Parton later told me. \"I don't really like getting up on TV and saying political things.\"\n\nI ask Fonda if she and Tomlin had taken Parton by surprise.\n\n\"Oh no, we planned it before. But I think [Parton] got a reaction and that's what upset her. I don't think she thought at the time about that reaction,\" says Fonda blithely, unintentionally getting her co-star into trouble again.\n\nW henever Fonda tells her life story, she has to start with her father, Henry . A second world war veteran, he was regarded by the public as an American hero, the only actor who could have played both Tom Joad in The Grapes Of Wrath and Davis, the truth-seeking juror in 12 Angry Men. In her memoir, Fonda writes that her father once \"kicked in the television set\" when the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) hearings were being broadcast. Yet, she adds, he didn't join other celebrities who flew to Washington DC, where the HUAC hearing were taking place, to publicly support the writers and directors accused of communist sympathies, known as the Hollywood Ten . Given how political she is, does Fonda find that strange in retrospect?\n\n\"Oh no. For him, voting for the Democratic candidate who promised to end the war was what he felt comfortable doing. And he did that. It was a generational thing, I think,\" Fonda says protectively. (I don't have the heart to point out that others of Henry's generation spoke out against HUAC, including Humphrey Bogart and John Huston.)\n\nBut she revered her father and felt \"in his shadow for years\". It was a long shadow, even if Henry was occasionally more of a theoretical than actual presence during her childhood, leaving her, her younger brother, Peter, and their mother, Frances, for work and, later, for other women. When Fonda was 12, her mother killed herself. Soon afterwards, Henry dispatched his children to boarding school; he and Jane never spoke about Frances again.\n\nFonda spent much of her life trying to get her father to see things from her perspective, with limited success. Her Vietnam protests were an especial source of rancour between them. \"I tried to make him understand. He just couldn't. I told him what I was hearing from soldiers who had been in Vietnam about the atrocities. He had said, 'If you can prove to me this is true, I will lead a demonstration to the White House.' So I brought in a Green Beret who talked to him about it - but still he just couldn't. It wasn't his style,\" she says.\n\nI ask if she ever rewatches On Golden Pond, the 1981 movie in which the Fondas play an emotionally reserved father and headstrong daughter.\n\n\"On Golden Pond? I rewatch it all the time. And I... \" Fonda breaks off, sobbing. \"God, even talking about it!\" she begins, but has to stop again.\n\nI tell her I'm so sorry: I didn't mean to make her cry.\n\n\"Oh, that's OK. Nothing wrong with crying,\" she says.\n\nI tell her I always cry at On Golden Pond, too, and always at the scene when the daughter touches her father's arm and he looks down, as if suppressing tears. (In Fonda's memoir, she says she improvised that gesture, and that her father's tears were real.)\n\n\"Oh God, I know. I'm just the luckiest person in the world. The fact that I was able to do that movie with him right before he died, because he died five months later,\" she says, choking up again.\n\nBoth Fondas were nominated for Oscars for the film, but only Henry won, his first and last Academy Award. He was too ill to attend the ceremony, so Fonda accepted it on his behalf. It was, she has said, \"the happiest moment of my life\".\n\nIt is a testament to Henry's influence that both Fonda and her brother, Peter, went into acting (as did Peter's daughter, Bridget, and Fonda and Hayden's son, Troy Garity.) Peter died last year at the age of 79. Were they close?\n\n\"Yes and no. We were very different. I didn't see a lot of him. I didn't even know that he was sick. But he eventually sent me an email and said what hospital he was in, a few weeks before he died. I went there almost every day, and we would laugh and laugh. I'm so grateful that that's how it was at the end between us.\"\n\nAs much as she adored her father, Fonda is clear-eyed about him. \"Dad had an obsession with women being thin. Once I hit adolescence, the only time my father ever referred to how I looked was when he thought I was too fat,\" she writes in her memoir. She learned from an early age that if she didn't show hurt or need, she would be praised for being strong; she learned so well that, even when her mother died, she didn't cry. But pain resists repression. At boarding school, Fonda embarked on a 30-year struggle with bulimia, finally kicking it in her 40s.\n\nI tell her I, too, developed an eating disorder as a teenager, and that I'm grateful to her for talking about how long it really takes to recover.\n\n\"Oh yeah - years! It was so hard to do. I remember Jason Robards , who had been a terrible alcoholic, talking about the third step of the AA programme, the higher power. And I always thought, what a lot of bullshit. I discovered later, that it is true,\" she says.\n\nSo it was faith that finally helped her stop being bulimic?\n\n\"It was a combination of a lot of things. Part of it was willpower, but it happened more when I received a spirit. I was suffering terribly and - God, this is so weird to say to the Guardian! - but I was alone in my house and I had really hit bottom. I said out loud, 'There must be a reason that God wants me to suffer like this.' And I looked around and said, 'Who said that? I'm an atheist!'\n\n\"But right at that time, everything began to change. I'd had an epiphany, I could feel it happening in my body. I could feel myself coming together and being one person. You know, it's like you look at a double exposure and slowly the doubleness comes together and they sit perfectly. That's what happened. It's the absence of that which causes the anxiety that leads to eating disorders,\" she says. In 2001, Fonda became a Christian .\n\n\"But how about you? Are you OK now?\" she asks.\n\nI tell her I'm fine, although it wasn't a higher power that helped: it was having kids - suddenly there were people who needed me to eat. I apologise for how unfeminist that must sound. \"No! Not at all. It's totally true, I get it,\" she says with feeling.\n\nFonda's recovery from bulimia was closely followed by her embrace of aerobics. Was she swapping one form of body obsession for another? \"I think exercise was for me a healthy way to control my body in a way I couldn't do otherwise,\" she says.\n\nShe has talked in the past about having facelifts and breast implants. Was the plastic surgery another way to punish her body? \"Oh yeah, plastic surgery, that's interesting. Well, no matter what I do, I'm stuck with this [idea]: if you don't look right, you're not going to be loved. So I always wanted to try to look right. I think when you're poor you cut yourself, and when you're rich you have plastic surgery,\" she says.\n\nA s an adult, Fonda swapped one dominating male figure for three: her husbands. When she was with the film director Roger Vadim , who was previously married to Brigitte Bardot, she became a Bardot-esque sex kitten in Barbarella and engaged in threesomes with him, eventually leaving him after the birth of their daughter, Vanessa. Married to Hayden, she took to the barricades with him. When she married media mogul Ted Turner in 1991, she swapped her off-grid life for that of a billionaire's wife.\n\n\"I always wanted to date someone who was the opposite of my father,\" she explains. \"I didn't realise that, in the ways that really mattered, I picked men who were just like him because they all had a hard time with intimacy.\"\n\nFonda says she and her father never talked about her mother because she was scared of hurting him, and that she also struggled to express her feelings to her husbands. And yet she was out loudly campaigning for American GIs to come home from Vietnam, for girls to have better sex education, for indigenous fishing rights.\n\n\"Yes, but that was an external courage. It wasn't about my heart,\" she says.\n\nI had read Fonda's memoir directly before reading What Can I Do?, and it was jarring to go from her tales of near daily private jets with Turner, to urgent warnings about the environment. Does she have regrets about that period of her life?\n\nThere is a long pause. \"I wouldn't have given up a moment of it, for anything. I mean, he owns two million acres, OK? I used to try to imagine what they would be if he hadn't been able to buy them. There would be, how many McMansions? He saved all this land and the only way he could get around to them all was to have his own plane. So I didn't mind it,\" she says.\n\nInstead of slogging it out with all these protests and arrests, why not ask Turner to donate, say, half a billion dollars to environmental causes? Surely that would achieve at least as much.\n\n\"Yes, um, I have not asked him. He has a family foundation and, you know, all family foundations have hit hard times now. So no, I don't go to him for money,\" she says in the careful, ever-so-slightly strained voice she uses whenever we talk about Turner. Their relationship sounds if not controlling then certainly restrictive, with Turner scheduling every hour of their days months in advance. He insisted she always be by his side, and Fonda made no films during their marriage, which ended when she left him in 2001. He then flew her in his private plane from his ranch to Atlanta, Georgia. His new girlfriend, who - unbeknown to Fonda - had been waiting in the airport, flew back with him to his ranch in Fonda's still-warm seat.\n\nIn the past, Fonda has said that she allied herself to strong men because she felt so unsure of herself. But isn't it more likely that she needed strong people because she is an extraordinarily strong character herself?\n\n\"Oh yeah, whenever I've been with men who are not strong I've had a really hard time,\" she agrees. \"I'm now five years older than my dad was when he died and I've realised that I am, in fact, stronger than he was. I'm stronger than all the men that I've been married to.\"\n\nThese days, Fonda is firmly single. \"[That part of my life] is gone. I can tell. It's just over - I've closed up shop. I'm extremely happy on my own,\" she says. A common refrain in her memoir is that she allowed her husbands to shape her too much because of her \"disease to please\". Another way to look at it is that she is just admirably open to new experiences: with Vadim, she embodied the sexual experimentation of the 1960s; with Hayden, 1970s activism; and with Turner, the monied life of the new 1990s elite. Now she is eagerly learning from a new generation of activists. Shortly before our interview, she posted on Instagram a speech she made with Patrisse Cullors , one of the co-founders of Black Lives Matter; during lockdown she has hosted Fire Drill Friday events with trans activists.\n\n\"Oh, it's the most exciting thing in the world, to keep learning!\" she says. \"It's one of my mantras: it's more important to be interested than to be interesting. I feel like a student and that's really good. All these young people are so good at knowing what to do and not to do, what to say and what not to say, and they provide tremendous insight. I'm just learning so much every day and it makes me so happy. It's a whole new chapter.\"\n\nWhat Can I Do?

      "text": "Jane Fonda: 'If Greta Thunberg can do it, so can I'\n\nIn an exclusive extract from her new book, the actor recalls the beginnings of her climate crisis protests outside the White House\n\nRead an interview with Jane Fonda\n\nD uring Labor Day weekend in 2019, I was in Big Sur with my pals Catherine Keener and Rosanna Arquette. I've been an environmental activist since the 1970s, installing a windmill at my ranch in 1978 and solar electricity in my Santa Monica home in 1981, speaking at rallies. And later, getting an electric car, stopping my use of single-use plastic and cutting back on red meat.\n\nBut I was still ill at ease. I had just learned that there are 2.9 billion fewer birds in North America than there were in 1970. I knew that sea turtles are being strangled by tumours caused by pollution in the oceans, and untold numbers of people were living in the midst of oil wells and refineries. But I hadn't really focused on what the scientists were saying. I knew we needed to invest in clean energy alternatives, fast, but these things remained a disturbing reality sitting out there somewhere, removed from me.\n\nI knew this fatalist thinking was a cop-out. Catherine reminded me recently how, on the five-hour drive to Big Sur, she would go on an hourly rant: What can I do? Where are the leaders? I need someone to tell me what to do! I felt impotent, angry with myself for my inability to give her answers because I felt the same way.\n\nThe morning we left for Big Sur, I'd received an advance copy of Naomi Klein's book, On Fire: The (Burning) Case For A Green New Deal . I was moved by the way Naomi wrote about Greta Thunberg , the brave, young student exhorting us to get out of our comfort zone and do something. And the fact that we don't stand a chance at changing course in time without profound change.\n\nWhen you're famous, there are so many ways to lift issues and amplify voices. God knows I've done it before, with varying degrees of success. I knew what I needed to do, and I felt it so strongly I was quivering all over. \"I'm going to move to Washington DC for a year and camp out in front of the White House to protest against climate change,\" I told Rosanna and Catherine over dinner. \"If Greta can do it, so can I.\" I'd said it to my pals, and I couldn't back out. Being brave, gung ho gals, Catherine and Rosanna were all for it and pledged to join me when they could.\n\nOver the next few days we hiked, and I kept reading Naomi's book. I felt more strongly that if I got the word out, others would join me. It had happened before during the later years of the Vietnam war. I've done a lot of camping in my life and had all the right equipment, but I'd never camped in a city. Where will I poop and pee? I wondered. I'm way older now and have to get up during the night more often. We studied maps of DC, trying to pick a spot where I would set up, but I realised I didn't want a lonely vigil. I needed expert help to plan this. That's when I decided to call Annie Leonard, the director of Greenpeace USA.\n\n\"Annie, it's Jane Fonda here, do you have a minute? I'm reading Naomi's book, and I've decided to move to Washington for a year and camp out in front of the White House. I want to start in three weeks. Can you help me figure it out?\" I'm someone who, when she gets an idea, is 100% ready to take a leap of faith. In fact, leaps of faith are my only form of exercise these days.\n\nThere was a long silence, and then she said, \"Well, Jane, that's wonderful and I'm blown away that you're ready to put yourself out there like that, but you can't camp overnight in Washington. It's illegal since Occupy Wall Street camped there. But let's figure out what is possible.\" She offered to set up a conference call with her, Bill McKibben, co-founder of 350.org , Naomi Klein, the environmental lawyer Jay Halfon, and me. Bill suggested a once-a-week protest that involved civil disobedience. Fridays had been claimed by Greta Thunberg and the student climate strikers, but the youth had also called on adults to join them. \"Maybe you could do an action on Fridays as well.\"\n\nI'd been getting ready for this my whole adult life - a weekly action that culminated in nonviolent civil disobedience. And I wouldn't have to worry about pooping. I began planning for the maximum time I could spend in DC before I had to get ready to film our last season of Grace And Frankie on 27 January 2020. It added up to four months, 14 Fridays.\n\nI asked Debi Karolewski, who began assisting me in the early 80s, to come with me. I knew I'd need my little dog, Tulea. I couldn't imagine being without her for four months. I also knew how sad I'd be not to see my 10-week old grandson, Leon, for that long.\n\nBut I had come to realise that as important as our individual lifestyle decisions are, they cannot be brought to scale in time to get us to where we need to be by 2030. It's structural change that we need to focus on while continuing our individual commitments to the planet. Maybe the Friday actions would help bring about that policy change.\n\nOn 27 September, en route to the Los Angeles airport, my little Tulea had a seizure; she had been diagnosed with an enlarged heart. My own heart sank as I came to grips with the fact that I'd have to leave her behind.\n\nI conjured up the image of Greta. You have to leave your comfort zone. I left. It wasn't easy.\n\nWhat Can I Do? by Jane Fonda is published by HQ, at £20. To order a copy for £17.40, go to guardianbookshop.com . Delivery charges may apply."

      "text": "Jane Fonda says cancer is in remission, three months after revealing diagnosis\n\nThe actor described feeling 'blessed' to cease chemotherapy treatments for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma\n\nThree months after revealing that she'd been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Jane Fonda 's cancer is in remission, the US actor and activist has announced.\n\nIn a blog post headlined \" Best Birthday Present Ever \", Fonda wrote that her oncologist had told her she could \"discontinue\" the chemotherapy treatments she had received for her illness.\n\n\"I am feeling so blessed, so fortunate,\" the blog post from Fonda - who turns 85 on 21 December - also said. \"I thank all of you who prayed and sent good thoughts my way. I am confident that it played a role in the good news.\"\n\nFonda, who has been a fitness guru as well, added that chemotherapy had been relatively \"easy\" the first four times besides the fatigue it caused. But her most recent treatment - which lasted two weeks - was more challenging and made it \"hard to accomplish anything\", leaving her relieved to learn that signs of the cancer had reduced.\n\nShe said she plans to attend a rally and do some lobbying work in Washington DC while also speaking at two separate events.\n\nThe actor's announcement in early September that she was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma noted that she had been prepared to undergo chemotherapy for six months. Fonda at the time also said that she felt fortunate because doctors consider that particular illness as \"very treatable\", with about 73% of people diagnosed with it surviving for at least five years, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nFonda has used her diagnosis to call attention to how many Americans lack access to quality healthcare and medical insurance, and she has also sought to call attention to how fossil fuels and pesticides cause cancer.\n\n\"I have ... access to the best doctors and treatments,\" Fonda said in September. \"Almost every family in America has had to deal with cancer at one time or another and far too many don't have access to the quality healthcare I am receiving, and this is not right.\"\n\nThis is at least the second bout that the two-time Oscar winner has had with cancer. She had been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010. After the tumor's removal, Fonda's publicist said the actor was cancer free.\n\nFonda won Academy Awards for Best Actress in 1971 and 1978 for her roles in Klute and Coming Home, respectively. She stars on Netflix's longest-running show, the comedy series Grace and Frankie.\n\nThe actor made a name for herself off the screen protesting the Vietnam war as well as for her climate and feminist activism."

      "text": "Jane Fonda\n\nLord Puttnam: Good evening. I don't know how many of you have read the book [Jane Fonda's My Life So Far]. Or, like me, have heard Jane reading it on the radio this week. I thought it was a completely remarkable book and that it, in a sense, redefines autobiography because it has an honesty and frankness that people in the future are going to find it difficult to match.\n\nI was looking for a way of describing and came across this Nobel prize speech by Solzhenitsyn, and he uses a phrase which to me perfectly summed up the book: \"It is useless to assert what one's heart does not believe.\" It seems to me that, sometimes with great pain, you've gone right through this book asserting exactly what your heart believes, and has learned to believe. And that's why it's a journey, not an autobiography - I felt like I'd been on a journey with you. What I'd like to do, because I've become pretty familiar with a lot of the book, and this being a rather more anoraky audience, is to concentrate on the movie industry aspects. And if I may, concentrate especially on a 10-year period in your career between 1969 and 79, from They Shoot Horses, Don't They? through to the completion of The China Syndrome. Where it seems to me that your choice of material was immaculate, and the way in which your life was bouncing between what was going on and the movies you were making, and how these movies in turn were affecting your life, was, I think, exemplary. One of the reasons why I'd like to do this is because I'm not sure that we're living in an era in cinema where that's necessarily true. And I think it's certainly true that I and the people I was working with in the 70s and 80s were learning an enormous amount by what you were doing and achieving and the way you were living your life real, and the way you were using the metaphor of cinema to make points which badly needed to be made.\n\nOne of the key films for me - and I went through Jane's oeuvre in the past week - was, and I didn't expect this when I started, Coming Home. It falls pretty well in the middle of that period, and I think it's a superb movie. If it were made yesterday it couldn't be more relevant. And so tonight I'm using two clips from that, including the one we've just seen [Sally and Luke's first date]. So I'd like to start with They Shoot Horses, and the events that led up to you getting that part, what you learned from that role, and what you feel it did for you in terms of feeding your career from that point onwards.\n\nJane Fonda: Well, it was a book written by Horace McCoy, sort of the first existential American novel, that was very much loved by the French left. My husband at the time, Roger Vadim, knew the book. When I was offered the role - it was not a very good script, and I said no, and he said, \"No, you have to do this\", so I did. And I'm glad I did. Because soon after I accepted the role and arrived to do it, the original writer-director was fired and this young Sydney Pollack - who had only done one other feature film prior to that, but had become famous in television in the US - was hired to direct it.\n\nThe first really seminal moment was when he came to my rented house and he brought the book with him. He sat down and said, \"I want you to read the book and I want you to tell me what you think are the key elements in it that need to be brought out in the film.\" Doesn't seem like a big thing to you, maybe, but nobody had ever asked me to really participate in the content of a movie that I was in before. This was 1968 - it was a very tumultuous time, a time of a lot of change. The movie I'd made before that was Barbarella. So it's interesting to go, in the year 1968, from Barbarella to They Shoot Horses, Don't They? Phew! And I was also morphing from a noun into a verb. And the movie of They Shoot Horses was kind of the beginning of my being a verb. And the fact that Sydney asked me what I thought was part of that process. It's very important to me - I work with young people now and I learned from that experience with Sydney the importance of asking children's opinions, and really listening to them. At any rate, it was the first time I'd done a movie that was relevant to what was happening in the world. The marathon dances of the Depression were a metaphor for American consumer society that was killing our souls, and I'd never done anything like that before.\n\nLP: For me, just looking at the films that ran up to it, there is a transformation in you, as an actor. Here's a clip from early on in They Shoot Horses.\n\n[Runs clip where Gloria and Robert start dancing and make conversation]\n\nJF: Man, she was a tough...\n\nLP: She was one tough girl. I think that line, \"I've been disqualified by experts\" is sensational. Pauline Kael, when reviewing the film, said, \"Jane Fonda has been a charming, witty, nudie cutie in recent years, and now gets a chance at an archetypal character. Fonda goes all the way with it, in a way that screen actresses rarely do once they become stars. Jane Fonda has a good chance of personifying American tensions and dominating our movies in the 70s.\" Pretty prescient review - they don't always get it as right as that.\n\nJF: Good old Pauline Kael.\n\nLP: But it did represent an enormous step change. To what extent did that segue quite naturally into Klute?\n\nJF: I had just finished making it when I was offered the role of Bree Daniel in Klute. It seemed like a really good idea. A year went by between my agreeing to do it and when I actually did it, and during that year I was travelling around the United States, trying to understand the country because I'd been living in France since I married Roger Vadim. I'd been out of the country for eight years. How long should this answer be? I could talk a lot about this film.\n\nLP: Well, it's a pretty important film.\n\nJF: I'll tell you a funny part of it. So the production manager had arranged for me to spend time with prostitutes and madams prior to shooting. So I did that, I went to New York. I didn't look like I was supposed to because I'd been Barbarella and now I had this short, brown shag that became famous in Klute. Nobody knew who I was. I could tell some pretty good stories about what they told me and what I saw - man, it was wild. And the whole time, I would be going to these after-hours clubs, and no pimp would pick me up. Not even a wink. They didn't know who I was, so what that said to me was that I was wrong for the part, I just didn't have what it took. So I begged Alan Pakula to fire me, I said, \"I can't do it, Alan\" and gave him a list of actors, starting with Faye Dunaway - I said, \"She should do it.\" And he just laughed and I did it.\n\nSomewhere in there, I just ... and it was the first movie I did where I experienced this: there was like a marriage, a melding of souls between this character and me, this woman that I didn't think I could play because I didn't think I was call girl material. It didn't matter. I didn't know until I was writing the book why. I knew women like her, very talented - she could have been a very good actor. But she'd been abused when she was a child, so she wanted to be in control. And she didn't want intimacy, and hooking was a great way to get money for acting classes and she would always be in control - because hookers are in control, except when they're killed. I studied the effects of child abuse on girls. Originally, a male psychiatrist had been hired, and I said, \"Alan, it can't be a male, she would never open up to a man.\" So he put a woman in the role. And all those scenes were improvised, because by then I had inhabited her, and I knew why she hooked, why she wanted johns, I knew it in my skin. And of course I realise there was a lot of me there, but I didn't know it at the time.\n\nLP: There's a very early scene in that: the lineup for the modelling job that you go for, of 12-14 girls. And the coldness, the sense of absolutely unjustifiable rejection, sets up the film brilliantly. You can't understand it, why would anyone put themselves up for that kind of rejection and not be badly damaged by it. Brilliant start. The clip I've chosen, ironically, is one of the scenes where Jane is talking to the psychiatrist, and I didn't know that it was ... Did you agree with Alan going in that you would ad lib those scenes?\n\nJF: Uh-huh.\n\nLP: Perfect. We chose well.\n\n[Runs clip: Bree talks to psychiatrist about why she's a call girl]\n\nJF: There was a turning point for me in that movie. It was toward the end of the movie, when I find myself with a john, and he puts on a tape recorder. On the tape is the voice of my friend, a junkie who's disappeared and we don't know where she is. And in the course of listening I realise that the man is the one who killed her and he's going to kill me. Prior to that scene, I had asked Alan to arrange for me to go into the New York City morgue. And the police showed me file after file after file of women, hundreds of them, who'd been beaten to death, by johns, by husbands, by boyfriends. I knew about violence against women but I hadn't realised ... It had flesh and bones to it now, it had faces. And that scene, where I'm listening to the tape and realising that this man is going to kill me, I had decided not to prepare. I have a hard time acting fear. So I was just going to listen, because I'm a good listener. And what happened to me was I felt so sad, for all of us, for women, who are so vulnerable to the misplaced anger of men, so vulnerable that it seemed so inevitable that we were all beaten and bloodied and killed and it was going to happen to me, and I began to cry. I was crying for women, and tears were coming out of my nose; it was a very affecting scene that had an effect on people. I didn't think it would at the time. But when the scene was over, I knew something new about myself as an actor. I knew that my newfound activism and feminism was going to improve my acting, because I was now seeing things not just in very narrow, individual, kind of Freudian terms, but seeing them in a much broader, societal way that was going to deepen and enrich my talent. And that was the moment that it happened. It was a very important time for me right then.\n\nLP: I think the core of my thesis for this evening is the degree to which the interests you were developing, and the life you were beginning to lead, were beginning to seriously impact material which you chose to involve yourself with, and indeed the films that got made that just absolutely would not have been made had you not thrown yourself into them, Coming Home being one. It's this synthesis that interests me a lot. Can you develop that at all?\n\nJF: Well, studios weren't banging on my door to offer me parts. And I was working really hard to try and end the war. I thought, it takes three months to make a feature film and I just couldn't imagine spending three months making a film just for the money. And I thought, well how am I ever going to make movies that speak to my heart and to my values? So I was at an anti-war rally with a guy in a wheelchair named Ron Kovic. Maybe some of you saw Tom Cruise play his story in Born on the Fourth of July. Ron, very fiery, very charismatic, had been real gung-ho; he re-enlisted for three terms in Vietnam, had been shot and was paralysed from the waist down and was in a wheelchair. I was speaking at the same rally, and I heard him say - he was talking to students - he said, \"I may have lost my body but I've gained my mind.\" That, I don't know, that just kind of pierced me, entered me. For weeks, I kept thinking of that contradiction: he had lost his body but he had come to understand that the war was wrong. He had come to shed the traditional warrior ethic to become a full human being. And I said, we could make a movie about that, and that's what evolved into Coming Home.\n\nLP: When Patsy and I watched the film, she said she saw Ron Kovic in a relatively small part in the film. Was he there?\n\nJF: Could have been - we had a lot of vets in wheelchairs. Can I talk about the sex part of it?\n\nLP: If you insist.\n\nJF: Well, I don't know; how much time do we have?\n\nLP: In my experience, we've got enough time to deal with sex.\n\nJF: Somewhere along in there, I thought, because it was becoming clear that this was becoming a love story: a triangle between a woman who was an officer's wife - and he was the kind of real gung-ho, I'm-gonna-go-I'm-gonna-be-a-hero; Bruce Dern played that part - and Jon Voight, who doesn't have the bottom part of his body. A love story. And I thought, maybe this is a way to redefine sexuality, sensuality; away from the traditional genitalia and masculinity and pumping, and make it be about what women know really matter, which is when the man is really sensitive to what we need and listens to our bodies and pays attention to us because they want to please us. And I thought, well this would be a great way to not only expose what's happening to Vietnam vets but to redefine sexuality. The problem was that ... there were a lot of these guys in wheelchairs on the set, extras on the film, and there was this guy who had a really cute girlfriend and there was clearly a lot of sexual energy between them. So I asked them about the sex between them because we had this love scene coming up and I didn't know how you do it with somebody who's paralysed. So she said, \"You never know when he's going to get an erection. It can be anytime, and sometimes it lasts four hours.\" Phew! I was totally fascinated by it but I was also kind of disappointed because I was hoping that it wasn't possible because then it would be a movie where there was no penetration. The problem was that the director, the fabulous Hal Ashby, also heard the story about the four hours. And so the movie became the battle of penetration. He wanted to have the penetration and I didn't. Can I just finish off?\n\nLP: I wish you would. Put it in another way, I'd never be forgiven if you didn't.\n\nJF: We knew it had to be a really sexy and groundbreaking kind of scene. And I didn't want to have to do it myself so we got a body double to shoot the long shots. And I didn't want to make Jon Voight selfconscious, so I wasn't there when they shot with the body double. I came to the rushes the next day, and there was definitely penetration - she was moving on top of him, it was pretty clear what was going on. I said, \"Hal, you can't use that! I thought we agreed.\" And then I thought, aha, when it comes to shooting my close-ups, I won't move, so he won't be able to cut it in. And so the day of the love scene - it's always interesting to shoot love scenes: they're skin on skin, and they hang sheets. I don't know if you did this in your films, but I'm kind of modest, so they hung sheets around, and there's only the camera operator and the director who are sort of there with long lens cameras. We spent the day rolling around in bed, and trying to say, \"It's OK, it's only acting\", right? And so towards the end of the day, I'm on top of Jon, and I hear Jon saying to me, [stage whispering] \"Jane, Hal's yelling at you.\" And I was so into the scene that I hadn't heard. But suddenly, I listened and from the distance, I hear Hal Ashby saying, \"Ride him, goddammit!\" I refused, I wouldn't do it, and he stormed off the set. Right now, you can't really tell - some people think it's penetration, some people don't - but for the day, it was really a hot scene, wasn't it?\n\nLP: My only experience of this was - and this might end up selling a lot of videos of a film that no one's ever seen - I produced a really execrable film in the mid-70s called Lisztomania, and I hope that no one here's seen it. It had Roger Daltrey and a very, very nice girl called Fiona Lewis in an early scene. And all they had to do was lie in bed underneath a silk sheet. And Ken Russell, who's not the easiest person to produce, was directing everything else that was going on around them. But they lay there for hours. And it was just before lunch, and Ken suddenly got it into his head, \"I wonder if we can do it without the sheet\"; and he whipped the sheet back and there was silence.\n\nJF: They were getting it on!\n\nLP: Well, I didn't know we were going to go there. So, Coming Home. Here's another clip I'd like to show which I think is sensational. I think this is really exquisite acting. You mentioned that a lot of this also was improvised. So another improvised scene from Coming Home, but which I think is fabulous.\n\n[Runs clip: Sally and Luke on the beach on the eve of her husband's return]\n\nJF: You know, what's so striking is that nowadays movies don't let scenes play out like that. You don't find movies any more that sort of take the time to let it happen. It's so great for an actor to be able to do that.\n\nLP: It's absolutely true - Jane and I first met at the pre-Oscar party the year that she won for that performance, and you were very, very gracious to a very nervous Alan Parker and I. But when you think of that year, the films nominated for best film were Coming Home, The Deer Hunter which won, An Unmarried Woman and Midnight Express. It's hard to imagine that level of seriousness happening today. And I guess one of the things that's driving me throughout this is how can we get back to that, how can we get back to films that will allow that to happen on the screen. I'd like to talk to you about Vietnam for a moment because you are so eloquent about it in the book; the passages on Vietnam are wonderful. I wonder if you could both read that very short paragraph and talk a little about that.\n\nJF: Oh yes, I'm in Hanoi, out in the country. I had visited a city that had been bombed, and we were on our way back. We were maybe an hour outside Hanoi, and bombing was taking place. I was told that I had to get out of the car and run because the bombers were coming. So I did, with my translator, and we ran. All along the side of this road at regular intervals were these manholes for individual people that had thick straw lids that you pull over to protect you from the bombs and the shrapnel. So I was running and suddenly a young Vietnamese girl comes up behind me and pulls me down into one of these holes. She was a schoolgirl, she had her books wrapped up in a belt. She dropped them and pushed me down into this hole and then she got into the hole with me and pulled the top on. And then shortly thereafter you could hear the planes overhead and you could feel the bombs thudding, thudding, thudding. It was very small and we were sandwiched in together - I could feel her breath, and her eyelashes, on my cheek. I swear to God, I thought, this can't be real. I can't be in a manhole in Vietnam with a Vietnamese girl who's just saved my life. It's not possible. When the bombing raid was over, she pushed the top over and crawled back out, and I came out, and this is where I'll begin to read now: \"I began to cry, saying over and over to the girl, 'I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.' She stops me and starts speaking to me in Vietnamese. Not angry, very calm. Huoc - he's the translator - translates. 'She says you shouldn't cry for us. We know why we're fighting. The sadness should be for your country, your soldiers. They don't know why they are fighting us.' I stare at her and she looks right back, right into my eye. Certain.\"\n\nLP: Last autumn, I worked with Unicef and Patsy and I were in Hanoi for the first time. And I walked into a hotel and bumped into a group of people I'd known at Warner Bros, guys my age. And I said, \"Have any of you been here before?\" And they all said, \"The last time we were in this country, we wouldn't have been as welcome.\" And they'd all been GIs, and what struck them, as I'm sure has struck you many, many times since, was how ludicrous the entire Vietnamese adventure was. Here they were in a very nice hotel in a rapidly becoming prosperous city. And none of them could work out, for one moment, what that war had been about. Domino theory, none of it made any sense at all.\n\nJF: Yeah, the so-called Enemy One, and we're big export-import traders with Vietnam; it's one of the key destinations. A tragedy that never had to happen. I hope I'm going to be able to see Robert McNamara - he's going to be in Hay-on-Wye. I really admire the fact that he admitted that it was wrong.\n\nLP: I don't know if many of you have seen Fog of War - if you haven't seen it, it's well worth seeing, the McNamara documentary. Remarkable document, actually.\n\nJF: I saw it back to back with The Trials of Henry Kissinger. Huh. Talk about two different kinds of human being. I mean, McNamara was one of the architects of the Vietnam war; how hard, what courage it took for him to finally say, \"We were wrong.\" Boy. You don't find Kissinger doing that.\n\nLP: The penultimate clip that I've chosen doesn't have Jane in it, but I think has enormous resonance and is touched on in the book and you even use it as a sort of chapter heading. It's from The Grapes of Wrath. For those at home watching the webcast, I do apologise but you won't see it. Instead of which you may well see a photograph of Rupert Murdoch, who decided that we shouldn't be allowed to webcast this particular set of images. So sorry about that. It's three minutes and 35 seconds long, so if you're at home, go and make a cup of tea and we'll be right back with you.\n\n[Runs clip: Tom Joad's \"I'll be there\" speech]\n\nLP: That's one of my favourite scenes from any movie, but I think that that's a series of thoughts that run right the way through this book, from cover to cover. You're constantly, in a way, circling exactly that group of thoughts.\n\nJF: Yes, it's true. I believe it's true, and I know that my father lives on in that same way. I know one of Martin Luther King Jr's daughters, Yolanda King. And while I was writing this book, she called me about something one day, and I had been thinking a lot about my father, and I asked her, \"Yolanda, did your father ever take you on his lap when you were a little girl and talk to you about values and how to live life?\" And she said, \"No, he never did.\" I said, \"Yeah, my dad never did either, but you have his sermons, and I have my dad's films. This is how he speaks to me. Not everyone can verbalise, right? I feel so blessed that I had a father that chose these kinds of roles - Young Mr Lincoln, Grapes of Wrath, Ox-Bow Incident. There was a dialectic between him and those characters that spoke to me.\n\nLP: Would you read that - it's the last thing I'll ask you to read, I promise.\n\nJF: This is ... my dad died, and I'm talking about being in his home with his widow and my family. \"We'd sit together and watch his eulogies on television. All week they went on, and it hit me that this wasn't just my loss, the family's loss. It was a national loss. Dad was a public figure, a hero who didn't just belong to us. Dad lived out these quintessential American values. He represented things that we all wanted to be, and that the country wanted to be. He often said that he was attracted to certain kinds of roles - the working poor, powerless people and the men who helped them get some power for themselves - because somehow their characters might rub off on him, and he would become a better person. But now I saw that there had been a dialectic. He did have many of those qualities.\"\n\nLP: The interesting thing for us in the UK, certainly for anyone who's my age, is that he didn't just have it for Americans, he represented something that's very, very fundamental and very, very important, and he's left a gap. It means that if you're like, in your 60s, you're scratching constantly for a notion of what's good that isn't around you. And I certainly feel this terrible vacuum that's been created between the ideals that your father was able to beautifully expound, and the pretty tatty, tawdry world that most of us are forced to deal with.\n\nJF: I see it all the time, it's just not represented in our leaders, but it's in the people. I feel particularly optimistic now because I've been travelling for five weeks now to promote my book, through the so-called red states. I tell you what, there's a lot of blue in those red states, and a lot of red in the blue, which means that we're all basically purple. Anyway, 800-900 people would come to the book signings, and I'm very optimistic. They represent the values my father stood for.\n\nLP: What you've proved to me is that I spend too much time around politicians.\n\nJF: That'll do it, that's a killer. Oh!\n\nLP: I stand corrected.\n\nJF: But I hate to create cynicism about politicians, too. We just need to invade. Regular people need to run for office and keep their balls and ovaries intact.\n\nLP: Some of us are trying. Before moving out to questions from the audience, I wanted to tell you one thing: I was really nervous about doing this evening.\n\nJF: You're kidding.\n\nLP: I was, and it's probably become evident already that I am no Terry Wogan or even Barry Norman. But I remembered something: in the late 80s, Patsy and I were at a very, very glamorous evening in Hollywood to celebrate a very, very important Hollywood star, and you were the emcee for the evening. It was fantastically, beautifully produced. Then the band struck up, and you walked on to introduce the evening. And you said, \"We're all here this evening - this was a big, televised event - to celebrate the life and the career of Barbra Streisand.\" And there was silence, because you remembered in the same moment that we remembered, that we were there to celebrate the life and career of Barbara Stanwyck. And I was knocked sideways when you said, \"Oh, shit\", walked off and you walked back on again to rapturous applause and got it exactly right. And I thought, if I can't survive being on stage with someone who can do that, then I'm some kind of schmuck. So it gave me a lot of confidence. OK, who'd like to start asking the real questions? Stuart, you had your hand up.\n\nJF: You know everybody's name?\n\nLP: I told you, this is a small country and an even smaller industry. Nick then.\n\nQuestion 1: You faced a lot of criticism in the US - how did you survive when you came back from Hanoi?\n\nJF: Oh, well. Because when you know in your heart why you did something, and you feel and you know that in spite of all the controversy that it was right, doesn't matter. I'll give you a very superficial example: this movie that's playing now with me, Monster-in-Law, with Jennifer Lopez. The critics! I mean, it's like, \"What was Jane Fonda thinking?\", \"What is the matter with her?\" But I know why I did it: I did it to have fun, I did it to see if I could have fun again and I did. And audiences love it, so screw the critics. It doesn't matter because I'm real clear about why I did it. And I was real clear about why I went to Hanoi, and I made a mistake and I've apologised for it, but it wasn't going to Hanoi that was the mistake.\n\nQuestion 2: Given the increasing commercialism, competition for advertising, money, etc, do you think it's still possible to be an actor with a conscience, for somebody to choose work as carefully and with as much consideration as you have?\n\nJF: I appreciate where that question is coming from. It's really much, much harder. Although David and I were talking ... there are a lot of fine films coming out of America, all kinds of good films. But for an actor to want to develop their own projects today, I think, is a lot easier. The huge change is that nowadays, if you don't have the audience the first weekend, you're through. And what that means is that young actors and fragile, unusual films don't have the time to garner their fans, their support, the audience. There's no time. It's very hard. You know, On Golden Pond, at the time, we couldn't get it financed in the United States. Sir Lew Grade put up the money for it - we had to come here to get money, for a movie that made $300m, because it was seen as not commercial enough. We could never make a movie like Coming Home now in America. Although, my son's just made a movie that I think cost $15,000. It's called Milwaukee, Minnesota, and he plays a retarded, ice-fishing champion, and it's gotten some really good reviews. But major Hollywood films, no, you couldn't do it. Is Mario Van Peebles in the audience?\n\nMario Van Peebles: Yeah.\n\nJF: Hey! I was hoping you'd be here. Hi! Good to see you. Yes, he worked with my son. Do you have a question?\n\nMVP: I was interested, you know, in Baadasssss, working with your son, and then growing up with my dad and then having my son in it ...\n\nJF: Melvin Van Peebles, his dad.\n\nMVP: How did you handle, as a parent, how much you got involved, or try to guide him career-wise or anything?\n\nJF: I didn't do anything unless he asked. And he tends to ask. He gives me the script and he asks me to kind of work with him. When he was making his first big film, Bandits, I went to the set and I would give him notes, and when he came to the set of Monster-in-Law, he gave me notes. But I don't do it unless he asks.\n\nMVP: Well, my dad does it whether I ask or not. He still gives me notes.\n\nJF: Well, he also can still breakdance, as you've told me. How old is he?\n\nMVP: He is 72 years young, and he can outrun me.\n\nJF: Holy cow! No kidding. I'm only 67 and I'm getting a hip replacement. I could never breakdance.\n\nMVP: But you look good.\n\nJF: Is your dad here?\n\nMVP: No, I sent him home.\n\nQuestion 3: I would just like to say that there were five films that weren't mentioned there. I have different roles in my life, so I would just like to say, as a husband, thank you for Barefoot in the Park; as a father and a son, I want to say thank you for On Golden Pond; as a friend, I want to thank you for Julia; as a teacher, I want to say thank you for Stanley & Iris; and in my most important role, that of getting closer to God, I want to thank you for Agnes of God. Thank you very much.\n\nJF: I appreciate that, thank you.\n\nLP: We're going to end, actually, with On Golden Pond. Interestingly enough, I was telling Jane earlier, she's won seven nominations for Oscars and seven for Baftas, but interestingly, different wins. You won Baftas for Julia and The China Syndrome. We paid attention to you very early because we nominated you for Cat Ballou and Barefoot in the Park. The Americans only got you a lot later. Make of that what you will.\n\nQuestion 4: During your career recess, which movies did you see where you thought, \"That part has my name on it\"?\n\nJF: None. You know something, I didn't miss it a whit. Not a whit. I love movies, I see all movies, and I would go and see a great woman's performance and I'd go, \"Wow! What a choice. I wonder if I had had that part, would I have made that good a choice?\" I never thought, \"I wish I'd been in that movie\", ever. I was done, I never wanted to go back. What about a woman? Is there any woman who has a question?\n\nQuestion 5: For me, the film in the late 60s that really changed everything was Easy Rider, and I noted that you mention it in your book. That was, I feel, the first film where actors took control and I wonder - obviously, your brother was in it - but what impact did that type of film have on you?\n\nJF: What impact did Easy Rider have on me? I quote your playwright, David Hare: he thinks the best place to be radical is at the centre. I'm kinda of that school of thought - movies that I produced were more centrist, stylistically very normal, even though the ideas were more controversial. When I saw Easy Rider, I thought, \"Oh my God, no one's going to see this movie. How can you make a movie about people who drop acid in a graveyard and smuggle kilos of cocaine in their bikes. This is just too much.\" Wrong. I was married to Roger Vadim then and he knew right away that this was going to change things. And of course it did. Peter was always out there, and I'd be making stupid little white bread movies like Any Wednesday, and I'd come home from work and Peter would come over after having filmed Wild Angels. And I'd say, \"What did you shoot today, Peter?\" and he'd say, \"Well, we raped somebody in a church and we sang Everly Brothers songs together.\" And I thought, \"Oh man, I am so out of it.\" I was way behind.\n\nLP: We've got some web questions that have come in from people watching. Someone called Anonymous asks, if you could be 20 again today, what work direction would you take with the knowledge that you have.\n\nJF: Oh gosh almighty, what would I do? I would read my book. I would definitely finish college, and I would definitely study the kind of things which it never occurred to me to study in the brief time I was there - sociology, psychology, child development, and so forth. And then I'd probably have become an actor. And I probably would have done exactly what I did. It's just that I would have chosen better, husband-wise and movie-wise.\n\nLP: There's a version here of an earlier question but maybe we'll press you a little on this. It's from Karen West who asks, \"Are there any performances in movies made in the past 15 years that you particularly admired and perhaps you'd have liked to play those roles yourself under different circumstances?\" I'd just like to extend that: are there any performances in movies that you admired and wished you had, and that you believe you could have added value?\n\nJF: No. I never see myself in...\n\nLP: Or what about ... I had the experience, when seeing Raging Bull the first time in 79, of really thinking that maybe I should just jack the whole thing in, because it was so much better than anything I'd ever done and, frankly, the way it was made, I couldn't imagine getting to that. And it took me a while, I think it was a few months after that that I arrived at a different feeling, which was, to hell with it, there are great movies to be made. Did you have a film like that?\n\nJF: No, but I was in a play with Geraldine Page, a Eugene O'Neill play called Strange Interlude. It was an eight-hour play, I think, with two intermissions where you went out for dinner and came back. Monumental play, and first day of rehearsals, Geraldine Page came in and she not only knew the whole script - she'd memorised it - she inhabited it already. That was the time I said, \"I'm packing it in, forget it, I am never going to do a play again.\" In movies, Sophie's Choice, I guess. I did Meryl Streep's first movie with her, and it was Julia. I'll never forget it. I'd never heard of her because she'd never done a movie. We had a scene where Lillian Hellman walks into Sardi's after the triumphant opening of Little Foxes. And there's a character called Anne Marie, with black hair and everything. I wasn't even paying any attention to this actress; I just did my stuff. The next day, I went to rushes, and the camera - Doug Slocombe, brilliant cinematographer - they bring me into Sardi's and they pan across several people, one of whom is this black-haired character called Anne Marie. Then I walk off and they stay on this Anne Marie, and with a slight gesture to her mouth, and a cloud across her eye, an entire character and all her thoughts about Lillian Hellman became apparent, and I went, \"Holy shit!\" Me and my partner were casting for Coming Home, and I went right to the phone and woke him up, I said, \"Bruce [Gilbert], it's really a weird name, Meryl Streep. I'm telling you, this is the first actress since Geraldine Page. This is something phenomenal.\" I feel so honoured that I experienced that with her.\n\nLP: That Pauline Kael moment.\n\nJF: Yeah, that's right.\n\nQuestion 6: Could you talk a little bit about your working relationship with directors?\n\nJF: One of the wonderful things about being an actor is that every director is different. For example, Fred Zinnemann, Julia, never would shoot twice, it was one take. He would cast brilliantly and he knew where to set the camera, you could tell volumes just by where he put the camera. Hal Ashby started out as an editor, and he would shoot 30 or 40 takes of Coming Home and print all of them. And he would never tell us to do anything different; he would just do it over and over and over and over and over. Then he'd go into the quiet of his editing room - I don't think he really liked people - he would chisel like Michelangelo. He'd take a moment here, and a pause there, and a gesture there, and he'd create, sometimes things that we never intended. So, so different. Sydney Pollack was an actor, so he knows how to get down there, deep into the psyche. Same with Alan Pakula. Alan had a particular chemistry with women and really liked to disappear into their psyche and draw out things you never knew you had. I use the analogy of sports, because I play a lot of different kinds of characters - well, I've already mentioned how I didn't think I could do Klute, and I once played a very wizened, tough rancher, and I didn't think I could do it.\n\nBut, for example, think of anger as a muscle. The way you express anger isn't the way that I do, or you. If you have a good director, you will find that he's getting you to use an entirely different muscle that you never even knew you had - it's real hard and sore, then after a while it becomes normal. And you discover all these new muscles when you enter a new character - that's what a director does for you. And it's just blessed to be in that situation, because we all, in fact, carry so many people inside us; the only difference is that actors get paid for it, and we sort of spruce it up a bit. So with fine directors, you can allow these people to come out, and bring new people in. It's primarily a profession of empathy, and so directors who allow you to tap into your empathy... that's why actors are usually progressive. A few exceptions, but mostly actors are progressive because we are accustomed to all the nuances of human life, whereas dictators just try to flatten it all out. So we usually try to stand up to dictators like, well, we won't mention names.\n\nLP: I was at a screening with Fred Zinnemann and he told me that when he cut Julia together, he was quite unhappy with it and fretted a lot. One day he was screening the movie in London, and the first reel arrived late, and so he started the film without it. And that was the movie - the problem with the film was the opening reel, which he actually didn't need. He said to me, \"The greatest discipline of film-making that you have to learn, is first lose your darlings.\" What happens is that you fall in love with a scene or a line, and all of a sudden you've built something that really shouldn't be in the movie at all, just to protect one component.\n\nJF: Yeah, it's true of writing as well, I've discovered.\n\nQuestion 7: Did you enjoy making Barefoot in the Park with Robert Redford?\n\nJF: It was great fun.\n\nQuestion 7 add: And did you fall in love with him?\n\nJF: Yes, I did. I made three movies with him and I fell in love with him every time. And I still love him, he's just great. But he doesn't like to do love scenes, that's the problem. I'd look forward to the love scenes and he'd want to get them over with as soon as possible.\n\nQuestion 8: Compared to acting, how did you find writing as a creative endeavour? Was it very different?\n\nJF: Yeah, because you're totally in control of what you do. There'd be days when I'd wake up before the sun and I'd be headed to the kitchen for coffee and I'd think, maybe I'll go back to my laptop and take a quick look at what I did yesterday. And the next time I became aware, the sun had gone down, and I didn't even brush my teeth. Sometimes, I was so zoned out that I'd literally sit there for 15 hours. Because movies are collective, cooperative endeavours, which I like a lot. But writing is all up to you, it's what's so scary; it's just you and that page. But I really like it a lot.\n\nQuestion 9: How was it working with Katharine Hepburn , and how was it working with your dad?\n\nJF: OK, Katharine Hepburn: the first words she said to me was, [does Hepburn voice and shake] \"I don't like you.\" And the last thing she said to me, when I called her the day after she won her Oscar to congratulate her was, \"You'll never catch me now.\" In other words, it was prickly. But it was also ... almost my favourite chapter in the book is the chapter called On Golden Pond, because I think I really captured the experience. She did not like me, I don't think, and she was extremely competitive. You have to understand, she was old and I was in my 40s, so I was a bigger box office star than her, and I was producing the movie for my father, and so she actually thought I was going to try to get billing above her and all kinds of things which never even occurred to me.\n\nHowever, there were times when I ran into trouble because of my father - like there was a scene where we were having an intense, angry exchange about parcheesi and beating people, and they shot my close-up first and there was so much light in my eyes that I couldn't see his eyes, and so I had the cameraman put some light on his face so that I could see him. When the camera turned around and it was now on him, and before we shot, I said, \"Is it OK, Dad? Can you see my eyes?\" He said, \"I don't need to see your eyes. I'm not that kind of actor.\" And the way actors are, half of me was demolished, like the character, Chelsea. I just felt so hurt and awful. And the other half of me was saying, \"Yes! This is so great, this is just like the character.\" But the bad part took over, and at the end of the day, when everybody was leaving, I was just immobile on the couch, I was so wiped. And suddenly Katharine Hepburn came up and just put her arms around me; nobody knew it but she just did. And she said, \"He doesn't even know that he hurt you. You don't take it personally. Spencer used to do that all the time to me. He'd say, 'I don't need you to be here for the love scenes. Go. I'm not that kind of actor.' They don't know that they've hurt you.\" And it meant the world to me. That kind of thing, she would do.\n\nAnd then my favourite bit. I had no intention of doing the back flip - I hate going over backwards, especially into cold water. And I had a stunt double all lined up. So right after the \"I don't like you\", it was \"Are you going to do the back flip?\" And right as she said that I remembered that dive in Philadelphia Story. And I thought, oh God, I'm going to have to do it. So I said, \"Yes, I'm going to do it.\" And so I spent a month working with a trainer, with pulleys and ropes and mattresses. I can't tell you how hard it was. Finally, I graduated to that raft out there where I finally did it in the movie. I practised and practised and practised, and one day, I finally actually got over - I did a flip, a pretty good flip, better than the one in the movie. I was covered in bruises and I come crawling up on the beach, and out of the bushes comes Kate. She walks over to me and she says, \"How do you feel?\" And I said, \"I feel just great.\" And she says, \"That's all right. You've earned my respect. You've stood up to your fears. If you don't do that, you become soggy.\" And that stayed with me. Now, whenever I'm afraid of something, I just say, man, I'm not going to get soggy; I'm just going to go into it. She would come in and stir things up. She felt it was the obligation of a star to be fascinating. My father thought it was the obligation of a star to do the work. And it's why I'm happy that I'm his daughter - she was fascinating, but I'm glad I've got his genes. She was prickly.\n\nLP: Everyone I talked to about the book, and I mean everybody, sooner or later raises the issue of that scene with your dad in On Golden Pond, and all the issues that emerged. And I wonder if you wouldn't mind talking us into that and then we'll run the clip."

      "text": "This much I know: Jane Fonda\n\nCynicism makes me angry. It's like: why bother to live, then? What's the point? And it's so common today. I'm a fairly hopeful person. I've seen too many people change in profound ways for me to be cynical.\n\nI think the current protests around the world are great , even if I don't agree with what they're about. I like to see people putting their beliefs on the line - it means there's some freedom.\n\nMost of the advice I got from my dad [Henry Fonda] came through the characters he played in films like 12 Angry Men , The Grapes of Wrath and The Wrong Man . He played these characters that were brave and strong and believed in justness and equality, which taught me to pay attention to those traits.\n\nI only learn from failures and tragedies. It's in the ashes of a disaster that the phoenix can rise again. You think you're breaking down, but you're really breaking open.\n\nI had a nervous breakdown at the end of my second marriage. I couldn't walk, I couldn't eat, I couldn't speak above a whisper. I worked out, which kept me alive - I ache, so I must be still here. Exercising through the trauma kept me going.\n\nThere's a difference between isolation and solitude. I choose solitude.\n\nI've learned that people tend to get happier over 50 - less stressed, less anxious, less hostile. They don't know why, but scientists surmise it's because we've been there, done that, and none of it killed us. You don't make mountains out of molehills, you make lemonade out of lemons. Everything becomes more positive.\n\nOlder is happier. The worst time for women is your early 50s - menopause is so difficult, but it gets better! I call this time the fertile void - learn lessons from it, because you'll come out the other side so much stronger.\n\nSex is important to me , but only because I'm in a relationship. Some women are like: \"Thank God that's over\" and get quite upset when Viagra rears its head. Friendships, grandchildren, travel - there's a tremendously fulfilling life to be had without a sexual relationship later in life.\n\nSex at my age can be difficult, but it can be better, because the biggest sex organ is the brain. Intimacy is easier when you know who you are, which can be very sexy.\n\nI rely on careful lighting and a lot of candles. The hardest part of ageing for me is the sagging skin, and I work out regularly. I position myself as well as possible.\n\nI feel more like me than ever. I didn't feel like me while shooting Barbarella . The director was my husband and my marriage was on the rocks. I'd love to do it over.\n\nMine is an incredibly positive story because I'm a late bloomer. Now that we live on average 34 years longer than we did a century ago, this has its advantages.\n\nI was brought up to believe that you have to be perfect in order to be loved - look perfect, be thin, be emotionally perfect - and my parents didn't know how to make me feel like I was good enough. It's hard to get over that. Therapy helped.\n\nI'm a very flawed woman who's made the most of what she's been given, who remains youthful because I remain curious - I'm always learning.\n\nJane Fonda, Prime Time: Fit & Strong is out now on DVD\n\nThis is the archive of The Observer up until 21/04/2025. The Observer is now owned and operated by Tortoise Media."

I wrote in my journal: 'Don't understand the Women's Liberation Movement. There are more important things to have a movement for, it seems to me.'\"\n\nThe actor, who is a two-time Academy Award winner, was a prominent opponent to the Vietnam war and civil rights activist before becoming a supporter of feminist causes. \"I began to identify myself publicly as a feminist, although it would be many years before I would look within myself and locate the multiple ways in which I had internalised sexism and the profound damage that it had done to me,\" she wrote.\n\nFonda said that although she supported female candidates, brought gender issues into her film roles, produced women-centred films, and made exercise videos to help women get strong physically, her feminism was theoretical: \"in my head, not my blood and bones\".\n\n\"For me to really confront sexism would have required doing something about my relationships with men, and I couldn't. That was too scary,\" she said. Fonda revealed that her father, actor Henry Fonda, would send her stepmother to instruct her to lose weight and wear longer skirts. \"One of my stepmothers told me all the ways I'd have to change physically if I wanted a boyfriend,\" she said.\n\nFonda has been heavily involved in the V-Day movement, which works to stop violence against women and girls and was inspired by the Broadway show The Vagina Monologues. In 2001, she established the Jane Fonda Center for Adolescent Reproductive Health at Emory University in Atlanta, which aims to help prevent adolescent pregnancy.\n\n\"When I turned 60 and entered my third and final act, I decided that I needed to heal the wounds patriarchy had dealt me,\" she wrote. \"I didn't want to come to the end of my life without doing all I could to become a whole, full-voiced woman.\""

I just had some 'work' done on my chin and neck and had the bags taken away from under my eyes so I decided it would be good to get a new hair cut so people will think it's my new hair.\" He thought that was so funny he actually toasted me for doing what he said he'd never heard anyone do before: admit they'd had work done. I was planning on blogging about it anyway so who cares? I'm writing a book about aging so I couldn't very well NOT talk about it. It's been 2 weeks. I was in front of the camera all day yesterday and was photographed at Eve Ensler's luncheon 9 days after the procedure so, obviously, it went well. I swore in 2000 I'd never have anything done again but this year I got tired of not looking like how I feel and I wanted a more refined chin line like I used to have so I changed my mind. I'm still a little swollen but not much and what pleases me is that I won't looked pulled or weird...or tired all the time. And my crows feet are still alive and well. I wish I'd been brave enough to not do anything but, instead, I chose to be a somewhat more glamorous grandma.\n\nEnsler's luncheon was on February 11.

      "text": "Interview with Jane Fonda on Her New Book About  \"Being a Teen\"\n\nWriter and interviewer\n\nJane Fonda is well known as an Oscar- and Emmy-award winning actress and for her best-selling books and exercise videos, as well as for her activism around a variety of issues, such as co-founding the Women's Media Center . What you may not know, is that Fonda also has a long and varied history of working with children and teenagers. Back in 1977, Fonda and her former husband Tom Hayden started the Laurel Springs Performing Arts Children's Camp that served disadvantaged children for fifteen years, and she also founded several non-profits and initiatives that specifically serve adolescents, including founding the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Power & Potential (GCAPP) in 1995 and the Jane Fonda Center for Adolescent Reproductive Health at Emory School of Medicine in 2000. Helping teens has been a longtime passion, and learning about their needs, problems and questions compelled her to write her comprehensive new book, Being a Teen: Everything Teen Girls & Boys Should Know About Relationships, Sex, Love, Health, Identity & More for which she consulted with a variety of additional resources and experts.\n\nFonda says these \"challenging\" teenage years are especially critical for our overall development because, \"it's when the stage is set for who you become as an adult. It is the gateway to adulthood.\" With directness and clarity, Fonda provides detailed information and helpful guidance on many sensitive topics that parents and teens frequently have a difficult time talking about, ranging from how their bodies work, to sexuality, how to be authentic and discover their identity, challenges like bullying, eating disorders, and sexual abuse, what constitutes healthy relationships and much more. This book, which takes on modern day issues that impact today's teens, including social media, cyber bullying and sexting, is an invaluable and timely tool for parents, educators and teens themselves.\n\nI recently talked with Fonda about her inspiration to write Being a Teen , the advice she wishes she had received as both teenager and parent, and her hopes for this book and for teens today.\n\nMarianne Schnall : I am happy to interview you about this project, which strikes a personal chord with me - I have two teenage daughters, 13 and 16, so I'm in the throes of it, and I also remember facing many of these issues myself. So I'm very grateful that you've written this book.\n\nJane Fonda : Thank you.\n\nMS : What inspired you to write a book for teens?\n\nJF : Well, I had a difficult adolescence. And I didn't even think of it much until I started running a children's camp in California with Tom Hayden for 15 years. It was a performing arts camp. And, you know, you spend a summer with a bunch of adolescents and you begin to see - they were of all socioeconomic backgrounds - I mean, there was Angelina Jolie and there were kids who came through parole officers and there were very poor kids, or very rich kids - and I saw that the things they needed, what kind of advice they were looking for, all the confusions. Kids were feeling these new feelings, but didn't know what to do with them - and didn't know that because they had the feelings, it didn't mean that they should act on them.\n\nAnd then I married Ted Turner and moved to Georgia, which had the highest rates of teen pregnancy in the country. And I started an organization in 1995 called the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention. And not only because of us, obviously, but for all kinds of reasons, the rates have dropped 50% in Georgia. And we have expanded our focus now to include health and fitness and healthy relationships. So now the acronym is the same, but the name has become the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Power & Potential (\"GCAPP\"). And in 1997 I started the Jane Fonda Center for Adolescent Reproductive Health at Emory School of Medicine, and I helped create the state-of-the-art Teen Clinic at Grady Hospital; which is the largest emergency hospital in the southeast.\n\nSo for 20 years in Georgia I have really up close and personal worked with teens, especially disadvantaged teens. And members of my Board of Directors about four years ago were saying, \"We need a book!\" Because their kids were approaching teen-hood. And so I decided to write one. The profits will go to GCAPP. And here it is!\n\nMS : What are your highest hopes for the book? What are you most hoping to accomplish?\n\nJF : I would love schools to buy it in bulk and use it as part of their sex ed curricula. I'd like parents to buy it and use it with their kids. I'm assuming that it would be parents or grandparents that will buy the book, and at least glance through it. And with younger teens, they would want to read certain sections with them. For older teens, like your 16-year-old, you could look through it and then just give the book to them and they can dip in at whatever stage they want to read. You know, if they want to read about relationships or sexual identity - because that chapter on sexual orientation, I think it's one of the best - I haven't read anything better for kids, to help them understand gay, lesbian, questioning, trans - all of that, which I think is very important, and the importance of compassion. Living in Georgia and seeing the homophobia and how it affected kids just broke my heart.\n\nAnd I hope that a lot of teens will be able to have access to it. I know that libraries are starting to buy it, which makes me very happy. And I know some people that run sex ed courses and they're buying it. I just hope there will be more of that.\n\nMS: So many important issues are covered in this book. What strikes you as some of the issues of most concern for teens today?\n\nJF: Boys are a little different than girls. For girls: what is a real relationship? What is a healthy relationship? That's a question I was always asked a lot, so I've spent a lot of time writing about what a healthy relationship should feel like. And then, what is a not healthy relationship?\n\nI think the influence of the media is very, very important now, more so than when I was a kid, and so I spent time writing about that.I mean, this is something that my book offers that most other books for teens don't talk about, which is: become conscious of what the media is doing to you. How it's making you feel like you're supposed to be, 'manly', you're supposed to be this kind of a guy, if you're a guy, or this kind of a girl, sexy and thin and so forth. If we can politicize that and make them aware of it, it helps them distance themselves from it, it's like social inoculation.\n\nSo making adolescents conscious of the fact that what's happening to them right now, along with all the body changes, is they're forming their identities that will take them through the gateway into adulthood, and they should do it consciously. What kind of person do you want to be? What kind of values do you want to represent? Write them down so you can internalize them more easily and focus on them, and then, every now and then, go back to the list. Are you being those things? Are the friends that you've chosen to hang with people who encourage you to be those things? The focus is not what do you want to be when you grow up, but who do you want to be? What kind of a person do you want to be? And to make them conscious of it, because this is what's happening to them as adolescents. They're moving from concrete thinking of today and what's right there around them, to abstract thinking. What is the future, and so what is my identity forming that will take me into the future? And the more conscious that we can make them of that, I think the healthier they'll be. And the more they'll be able to handle what comes along the way.\n\nYou know, I talk to my friend Paul Kivel who's written a lot of books for boys, and he uses the analogy which I quote in the book, \"Adolescence - it's like being on a boat on a stormy sea. You can't just let the boat drift. You have to know where you want to go and set your sails for it and steer in a direction where you want to go.\" And so that's what I've tried to give them, are the tools to do that, to steer their boats.\n\nMS : What were your own teenage years like? And looking back, what piece of advice that you now offer in your book, do you wish you'd most known in your own teenage years?\n\nJF : Oh, God! [laughs] Well, I wish I'd known that it was okay to say no. And that no is a complete sentence. I wish I'd known what to look for, before I said yes, like trust and the ability to communicate. That you shouldn't have sex with someone, until you could talk to them about sex beforehand and talk about, 'No, I don't want to do that. I'm not prepared to go that far. Don't push me to go that far.' I wish I'd known that I shouldn't be in a relationship with someone who tried to manipulate me in going further than I wanted to. I wish I'd known that I shouldn't be doing something just to please the guy, in the case of a heterosexual relationship. I should be aware of what I want. And wait until I'm in a situation where I feel enough trust to be able to ask to be fulfilled in my own self and not just think about what I'm doing for the other person.\n\nI mean, I didn't even know - I didn't get my period until I was 17 and it scared me to death. I thought maybe I was in the wrong body. I thought maybe I was supposed to be a boy. It was very fraught for me. And if I had been able to read a book like this, I would have been much more empowered, I think.\n\nMS : Many parents may feel reluctant to bring up some of these very sensitive topics with their teenagers. What advice do you have for parents who feel squeamish about bringing up some of these topics with their kids, like sexuality?\n\nJF : What not to do is wait for the \"big talk\" - sort of girding your loins and having a drink or something, and, \"OK, now I'm going to have the 'big talk' with my teenager.\" Because you think that you're having the \"big talk\" and later on if somebody interviewed the teen, they would probably feel that no one has really talked to them. As hard as it is for the parent, it's something that has to be ongoing, it has to start early. Parents have to use opportunities - like I remember one guy who said he would watch \"Sex in the City\" and use that as an opportunity to talk about different things with her - what seemed right, what wasn't right, etc.\n\nTeenagers - and it's not unhealthy, because they are individuating - they make a parent feel that they don't really want to hear them, that the parents are old fogies that have nothing to say - but the fact is that adolescents need us to talk to them. But we should also listen. Be an approachable parent so that you can listen without being judgmental. The child has to feel that they can come to you and that you can listen without being judgmental - that's a very important component. Otherwise the kid will never come to you. And I'm saying this as a parent who was not approachable. I didn't do a good job with my kids at adolescence, which is another reason, you know, you teach what you need to learn. It's why it was so important for me to study parenting, because I feel that I didn't know enough when I was... I was not particularly parented properly. You know, my mother died when I was young and my father was very busy, and so I didn't quite know how to do it. But you can learn it! And so I've learned it. Being approachable, starting early to talk about difficult things, takes the onus off when they are actually getting to an age when they might have sex and you're not so scared. You know, when I started talking to my daughter, I was two years too late. Because I waited too long, because I was too scared.\n\nMS : Another issue that you cover in your book that affects teenagers' relationships with their bodies, especially girls, are eating disorders. I know that you've written very openly about your own history with eating disorders, and I experienced eating disorders myself as a teen, as did many of my friends - and it's still such an epidemic for girls today. What insight or advice do you have for girls on cultivating a healthy relationship with our bodies, and resisting the pressure to fixate so much on their looks or to think of their bodies as nothing other than an ornament that they wear?\n\nJF : Yeah - and to realize - because I think I wrote about this, that eating disorders don't represent a lust for food. It represents a loss of authentic self. It's when there's something about our lives and our relationship to ourselves and others around us that is inauthentic. And we're trying to fill an emptiness. That's what I think it's really about. It's a spiritual and emotional hole that we're trying to fill with food. And so it's important that if you do suffer from an eating disorder, to find help - not a nutritionist. It has nothing to do with nutrition. I give a lot of resources of places to go, with therapists who are used to dealing with girls, and some boys, who suffer from eating disorders, who have experience with it and who know how to bring them back into their authentic self, regain their voice that tends to get lost at puberty.\n\nIf girls are in inauthentic relationships, they are more apt to have eating disorders. And if girls have been sexually abused, as one in three have, they will tend to have eating disorders. They need to receive help, of a very specific kind. I wish I had had time to write a book for parents, because when it comes to a serious eating disorder, the parent has to play an important role. And parents shouldn't be obsessing about dieting, obsessing about weight. Talking to the child about weight. My father, always - not him directly, but he would send the various wives to tell me I was too fat. But these are the kinds of things that you should not do to a teenage girl or boy. Let them grow up. Love them unconditionally. Don't talk to them about being fat or thin. Set a good example by exercising yourself and eating properly and having good, healthy, fresh food in the house. And set a good example, but don't say you're too fat, don't eat that, you're eating too much. It will cause anxiety - it's anxiety and feeling bad within yourself and inauthentic, that causes the eating disorders, don't you think?\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

I think what's also so important that you cover in this book are the cultural influences that are the source of so many problems teen face - for instance, the pressures on boys. I was looking back on one of our previous interviews where you talked to me about connecting boys with their hearts, and the importance of teaching our sons to remain \"emotionally literate\". How do you see the special challenges for boys in terms of our culture and the development of healthy masculinity? Even in what you were talking about earlier, encouraging girls to learn to say no, it's also about explaining to boys on the flip side that they don't have to pressure girls, or act in a certain way, to be considered masculine.\n\nJF: That's why I say boys can be strong and vulnerable. They can be brave and compassionate. They can still have a heart and be a real man. And real men are people who respect women and don't bully people who are different. And I write about that in the book and that was very important to me to write. And I have a special place in my heart for boys. I think in some ways, even though men still have more power in our society, it's really hard for boys. Because as I have told you before, the loss of empathy, the loss of heart happens so young, they think that's just the way it is. For girls the loss of authentic self, or the voice going underground at puberty, that's learned, so you don't have to dig too far in girls to get back at what they were before puberty and turn them into resistors. It's harder with boys. It's harder to find a safe space for boys who are sensitive and caring and who remain whole and germane. It's difficult, but we have to begin to consciously raise boys to stay in touch with their hearts.\n\nMy advice for parents, and I've done this with my grandson, is draw pictures of emotions: happy, sad, in between emotions like melancholy and wistfulness. Teach them how to identify and read other people's emotions. How do you think that person right now is feeling? Look at their body language, what is it saying to you? Are they angry? Are they sad? Just teaching boys to pay attention to emotions. And also setting examples in front of boys of men who were strong and yet vulnerable and compassionate: Jesus Christ. Gandhi. Martin Luther King, some examples. Just like we should put examples in front of girls of women who were not necessarily beautiful, not necessarily popular, but incredibly important in history and made huge contributions: Eleanor Roosevelt, Florence Nightingale - you know, there are so many of them.\n\nMS : What does it mean collectively, for our society and culture, to have teenagers grow up - as you're saying they have the capacity to - in command of their bodies, being their authentic selves, having agency over their lives?\n\nJF : Well, we have to pay more attention to young boys at 5 and 6 when they first enter schooling, to make sure that the messages they get aren't all messages about being a \"real man.\" ' You know, don't cry. Don't be a sissy. Don't be too attached to Mama. It's okay to bully. It's okay to not respect girls. 'That's a societal message that affects too many young people and so that has to be changed. And girls at adolescence have to be encouraged to not turn into pleasers - they have to be encouraged to hang onto their authentic self.\n\nMS : I was thinking about your last book, Prime Time , which is such an inspiring and helpful guide for navigating the later years of life, and you have now written a book about adolescence, and it made me think that maybe we as a society need to see life as a journey and evolution and realize that there are these different phases that have different considerations and needs that we need to stop and think about.\n\nJF : Yes. Like Erik Erikson. I mean, I've learned a lot from Erik Erikson. There are unique stages of life, each with its own challenge. What's important about adolescence is it's when the stage is set for who you become as an adult. It is the gateway to adulthood. And it's a very challenging time, especially for boys, because the new hormones that are raging in boys are testosterone, which drives sex and aggression. Girls' estrogen is more of the cuddly, romantic, empathic hormone, but testosterone raging through a developing boy's body, whose brain is in still under construction, especially the prefrontal cortex where planning and decision making takes place - it's like high octane jet fuel in a Model T Ford - you know, it's asking for trouble. Not that it happens to all boys, or all teens, or all teen girls, but there's a reason why it's a challenging period, and for a long time adolescence wasn't even viewed as a unique stage in human development, so the more we understand it as such, the more we learn to love adolescents.\n\nYou know, it's easy to love kids. It's not so easy to love adolescents - they're prickly. And they make you feel like they know everything and you're just an old fogie and have absolutely nothing to teach them, and yet they want us to talk to them. Even though you think they're not listening, but they are. And just like the third act of life is a unique time with its own unique challenges, as I wrote in Prime Time , it has to be thought of in a whole new way, especially now that we're living longer.

      "text": "Jane Fonda Calls Out Bill Maher For Claiming Trump Won Because Of 'Nutty' 'Far Left'\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nJane Fonda and Bill Maher agree that they're not fans of President-elect Donald Trump - but their shared opinion seems to end there.\n\nThe \"Grace and Frankie\" star was a guest on Sunday's episode of Maher's \"Club Random\" podcast, during which he gave his thoughts on why Trump won the 2024 election.\n\n\"There is two parts of the Trump coalition. ... There's about a third of this country that's very hard right. Of course they love Trump. When he left office, he had an approval rating of 34%. So he really only had those people. Why is he now, like, tied?\" Maher said.\n\n\"Because the other part of the coalition are people who, they don't really like him that much,\" Maher continued. \"They just think the far left has gone so nutty on so many issues.\"\n\n\"That's what they're being told ... by people like you,\" Fonda interjected.\n\nMaher has become increasingly critical of the Democratic Party and liberals in general, with the crux of his criticism seeming squarely aimed at his disdain for \"woke\" culture.\n\nLast year, he raged on X , formerly called Twitter, about how he felt the \"Barbie\" movie was \"preachy\" and \"man-hating\" while also arguing that the \"patriarchy\" doesn't really exist anymore. And earlier this year, he argued that Louis C.K. shouldn't be canceled anymore after admitting to sexual misconduct allegations, despite the comedian having gone on to release four comedy specials - one of which won a Grammy - since the accusations were made in 2017.\n\nAfter Fonda called Maher out, she asked him to define what he means by \"far left\" and to give an example.\n\nIn response, Maher brought up the NAACP and cited the organization's travel advisory against going to Florida last year after it accused the state and its governor, Republican Ron DeSantis, of being \"openly hostile toward African Americans, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals.\"\n\nAlthough Fonda did not push back at this or some of Maher's other arguments, it was abundantly clear that she did not agree with his opinions. This came to a head later on in the episode, when Maher rambled about Fonda's long career of activism and implied that even if she lived in a utopia, \"it would be the greatest pain\" for her because \"you're there for the cause ... but also the cause is there for you a little.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "How Feminism Taught Jane Fonda The Importance Of Female Friendships\n\nReporter, HuffPost\n\nJane Fonda is more than an actress-fitness-guru-antiwar activist. She is officially \"an embodied feminist.\"\n\nIn the March 22nd Lenny Letter newsletter, Fonda wrote of her journey to \"blood and bones\" feminism, and growing beyond her public and \"theoretical\" feminist identity.\n\nFonda initially discovered the feminist movement in the 1970s. As she became a prominent voice in the antiwar movement , she heard a feminist speak to a group of active-duty soldiers in effort to educate them on the women's movement. This served as a major turning point for her. She realized that feminism was not about women hating men, but about empowering them both.\n\n\"Although,\" she said,\"it would be many more years before I would be brave enough to look within myself and locate the multiple ways in which I had internalized sexism and the profound damage that it had done to me.\"\n\nOf this internalized sexism, she discussed the implications that harmful gender stereotypes had on her:\n\nThe culture that incubated in me since childhood insists that to be loved, a female has to be perfect: thin, pretty, having good hair, being nice rather than honest, ready to sacrifice, never smarter than a man, never angry.\n\nFonda spent much her adult life with an eating disorder -- \"probably to fill the emptiness\" -- and using romantic relationships with men to validate her self-worth. But that changed completely when she reached a milestone age.\n\n\"When I turned 60...I decided that, no matter how scary it was, I needed to heal the wounds patriarchy had dealt me,\" she said. It was during this time of her life that she shirked the security of romantic relationships:\n\nFor me, the personal meant becoming a single woman, no longer silencing my voice, slowly becoming the subject of my own life. My friendships with women grew deeper and more fulfilling...In the process, I discovered that what I'd thought were just my issues were, in fact, shared by other women.\n\nHer friendships grew stronger, her comprehension of feminism deeper, and -- arriving at this wholehearted feminism 30 years after discovering it -- she finally gave herself permission to be a late bloomer.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Jane Fonda Reflects On The Shockingly Sexist Incident That Sparked Her Acting Career\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nJane Fonda says she stumbled into acting after being fired for an unsettling reason.\n\nThe activist and \"Book Club: The Next Chapter\" star told People in an exclusive video for its most recent cover story about her that, despite her father being actor Henry Fonda, she had no interest in pursuing the profession.\n\n\"He never brought joy home,\" Fonda said of her dad after a day of work on set. \"I never felt he got joy - I believe that he did, actually - but it never manifested when he came home. So it was not like, 'Oh my god, I want what he's got.' No.\"\n\nFonda also explained that even if she had the desire to act, she didn't feel like she was cut out for it.\n\n\"I didn't think I had talent. I didn't think I was pretty enough. I had a lot of body dysmorphia,\" she said, later adding, \"I was pretty lost as a young person.\"\n\nSo, Fonda decided to get an office job, which, oddly enough, ultimately led her to acting.\n\n\"I got fired as a secretary because I wouldn't sleep with my boss,\" Fonda said. \"I didn't know what else I could do, and I became friends with Susan Strasberg, daughter of the famous acting coach, Lee Strasberg.\"\n\n\"And she told me that I should try to do an interview with him and maybe he would accept me into his class. And I did, and he did,\" she said. \"And then he told me I had talent. Nobody had ever said that to me, so that kind of did it.\"\n\nFonda went on to do films like 1965's \"Cat Ballou,\" 1967's \"Barefoot in the Park\" and 1968's \"Barbarella.\" The last of these films turned Fonda into a bona fide sex symbol, but the \"Grace and Frankie\" star has expressed having pretty \" complicated feelings \" toward \"Barbarella.\" She told Glamour in May 2022 that she felt conflicted about the plot and found it a \"bit objectifying of me and women.\"\n\nFonda told Vanity Fair in 2022 that she only did \"Barbarella\" because her husband at the time, the film's director Roger Vadim, wanted her to do it - and she was pretty passive in their relationship.\n\n\"If he didn't want me to do a particular movie, I wouldn't do it,\" Fonda said. \"I was pretty much doing whatever the men in my life wanted me to do.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nIn 1974, after years of grinding war in Vietnam had exhausted most of the antiwar movement, Tom Hayden and Jane Fonda came up with a new strategy: an educational and lobbying push targeting Congress to stop funding the war machine.\n\nIndochina Peace Campaign organizers hanging out in Tom Hayden and Jane Fonda's backyard in Santa Monica, California, in 1974. (Courtesy of Paul Ryder)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nFifty years ago, New Leftist Tom Hayden and actress and activist Jane Fonda infiltrated the Capitol. Congressman Clair Burgener (R-UT) was enraged: \"A course in 'American imperialism' taught by Miss Fonda and Mr Hayden for employees of this Congress is more than I can accept.\"\n\nBurgener delivered this statement on the House floor on March 18, soon after discovering that his colleagues' advisors were attending Hayden's 1974 lectures on the Vietnam War inside a subcommittee room at the Capitol. Dozens of mostly young staffers gathered in the Rayburn House Office Building for six classes over three weeks led by Hayden.\n\nA Freedom Rider who was one of the first Americans to visit Hanoi, Hayden was known to many as the principal author of the Port Huron Statement and as one of the defendants of the Chicago 7 trial in 1969. In 1974, he found a way to gain influence inside the Capitol with the help of one of the most famous actresses and activists in the world.\n\nJoining Burgener were several other representatives like Trent Lott (R-MS) and Richard Ichord (D-MO), the last chairman of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Lott called Hayden's seminars \"communist propaganda.\" Ichord condemned antiwar congressman Ron Dellums (D-CA) for giving Hayden the room to \"preach to impressionable young congressional aides.\"\n\nPolitical observers had previously deemed Hayden and Fonda far outside the mainstream. In 1974, with Watergate weakening President Richard Nixon, they were now lobbying inside the halls of Congress on behalf of their new antiwar organization, the Indochina Peace Campaign (IPC). Both had gone beyond enemy lines, with Hayden visiting North Vietnam three times between 1965 and 1972. Fonda's highly publicized solo trip in 1972 helped raise awareness of Nixon's plans to bomb the country's dikes. The trip also began a decades-long campaign from the Right to vilify Fonda, paying extra attention to images of her smiling while sitting on an anti-aircraft missile and going on Vietnamese radio.\n\nWhat has been forgotten by most is that politicians met and listened to Hayden and Fonda after their trips helped expose the devastation caused by US bombs. Senators were now willing to listen to their pitch to cut off funding to the anticommunist South Vietnam and pledge not to support any attempt to escalate US involvement. As the founders of IPC, they helped elevate the antiwar movement further into the mainstream. Decades later, a new generation of organizers trying to halt America's brutal warmaking abroad should study their lobbying work.\n\nHayden and Fonda's decision to take to the halls of Congress to try to stop the war came at a moment when the antiwar movement felt stuck. In 1973, the Paris Peace Accords brought home the last remaining US troops in Vietnam, and peace activists were adrift. After eight years of grassroots protests, ranging from teach-ins to massive single-day actions, many were prepared to move on to other issues. But the remnants of the antiwar movement were justifiably concerned that Nixon could break the peace as soon as fighting resumed between the North and South and authorize a new bombing campaign.\n\nHayden began the 1970s in court as one of the Chicago 7 , a group of primarily well-known New Left activists whom the federal government accused of conspiring to start a riot at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. After a shambolic set of proceedings that received regular coverage on the evening news, Hayden was one of the four who was convicted of crossing state lines with an intent to incite a riot. The US Court of Appeals eventually overturned the widely lampooned sentences in 1973.\n\nThe stress of the trial weighed heavily on Hayden. Facing a five-year prison sentence and constant FBI surveillance, he became even more convinced that he was living under fascism. At the time, Hayden lived in a radical collective in Berkeley known as the Red Family . Members practiced martial arts, went to target practice, and regularly debated the exact nature of the coming revolution. His time in Berkeley disrupted his pragmatism, a core part of Hayden's political identity that stretched back to the early days of the reform-minded Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) of the early 1960s. He embraced the confrontational tactics throughout the decade while also seeking out links to conventional politics.\n\nHayden met with administration officials in President Lyndon Johnson's administration, governors, and even presidential candidates while also traveling to Cuba and Vietnam. The tumultuous events of the late 1960s and Berkeley's radical political scene altered his worldview and made him question his almost innate sense of political practicality. By the decade's end, Hayden flirted with joining the underground and publicly called for the Left to create nebulously defined \"liberation zones\" across America.\n\nBy the summer of 1971, the Red Family kicked Hayden out for male chauvinism and other alleged manipulative behavior. Hayden was guilty of specific transgressions such as infidelity, but his dismissal was also part of a broader feminist wave against predominantly white male leaders that reshaped many movement spaces in the early 1970s. Women took control of these groups from male leaders who had long dominated leftist groups and were slow to respond to growing calls for gender equality. Other male leaders, including several of Hayden's fellow codefendants like Rennie Davis , faced similar charges.\n\nEventually, the Red Family dismissed other male members and collapsed shortly after they banished Hayden from Berkeley. Much like other splits within the broader movement, a well-deserved corrective devolved and eventually crippled the Red Family. The episode was extremely painful for Hayden, who, at age thirty-one, decided to live under a pseudonym in a shabby studio apartment in Venice, California, filled with books on Irish history. He practiced yoga and karate on the beach and reevaluated his place within the movement. He developed antiwar slideshows with students who took his class on Vietnam at Immaculate Heart College and worked with close friend and lawyer Leonard Weinglass on whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg's defense team.\n\nTeaching the history of Vietnam gave Hayden a new sense of direction, but his relationship with Fonda helped him develop a new antiwar campaign. Fonda was already a dedicated activist before meeting Hayden, as she was a vocal supporter of antiwar GIs in the early 1970s. A year after a brief encounter at an antiwar GI meeting, Hayden and Fonda met again at an antiwar event in downtown Los Angeles, where Fonda was a featured speaker. Like Hayden, Fonda had become weary of the sectarianism that had defined movement politics and sought more structure for her antiwar work. Soon, the two began collaborating on slideshows; not long after, in January 1973, they were married.\n\nIn the early months of their budding romance, the two worked with fellow organizers in southern California to form the IPC in the summer of 1972. The IPC began as an education campaign about the war and coordinated a national tour of midwestern states just weeks after Fonda's controversial visit to North Vietnam. Amid the initial backlash over the Hanoi trip, Hayden and Fonda successfully toured Middle America, showing the slides that brought them together. Joined by singer Holly Near and antiwar GI and POW George Smith, they began their voyage at the Ohio State Fair. It was one of many atypical venues for an antiwar rally.\n\nMonths after the successful tour, Hayden and Fonda set up an IPC headquarters in Santa Monica in January 1973. Both were determined to create a new organization to help unite peace groups nationwide. Hayden, a skilled strategist who was unafraid to lead, recognized that there was \"a lack of any day-to-day work or organization about Vietnam.\" He also added that there was a severe \"lack of non-rhetorical education about Vietnam since the \" teach-ins \" of 1965. IPC organizers were in search of a more proactive approach to antiwar politics. Shifting away from the mass demonstrations that had defined the movement, the IPC was more interested in mobilizing local communities outside the nation's antiwar hotspots. Soon, the IPC established dozens of chapters across the country.\n\nThe IPC's main link to Washington was Larry Levin, a friend from Venice who bonded with Hayden over their interest in the Northern Ireland civil rights movement. After helping Hayden and Fonda establish the IPC, he moved to the nation's capital to lobby on behalf of a new umbrella organization, the Coalition to Stop Funding the War, in January 1973.\n\nMade up of religious organizations, unions, and other longtime peace activists, the coalition explicitly sought to direct activists' attention toward Congress to prevent Nixon from violating the Paris Peace Accords. The antiwar movement had lobbied Congress before, but the coalition offered a steadier outlet for activists interested in working on Capitol Hill.\n\nLevin and others recall that Hayden was initially skeptical of the congressional strategy. Still bruised and battered by the events of the '60s, Hayden was wary of alliances with politicians. By the fall, the politics of Vietnam and Watergate pushed the IPC toward lobbying. Fighting between the North and South had resumed, and a war-weary public was beginning to learn more about the president's abuses of power. The IPC formalized their support of congressional lobbying at a Germantown, Ohio, conference in October . Hayden sought to capitalize on what he referred to as the \"Watergate Opportunity,\" as he and other IPC organizers agreed the time was right to pressure Congress to cut funding to South Vietnam and stop Nixon from taking drastic military action.\n\nWith established relationships on Capitol Hill through Levin and other coalition organizers, Tom, Jane, and their infant son went to Washington in January 1974. In their press releases, they highlighted the corruption of South Vietnam and the plight of the nation's hundred thousand political prisoners. They also announced their intention to have members of Congress sign on to their three-point pledge, which called for the prohibition of direct US involvement in Indochina, a settlement based on the Paris Peace Agreement, and an end to US aid for police and prison systems in South Vietnam.\n\nThe couple purposefully avoided courting media attention, but a few journalists reported on their arrival. Mary McGrory, the venerable liberal columnist for the Washington Star, described the couple as the \"most unexpected and most unnerving lobbying team on Capitol Hill.\" She echoed other observers who marveled at their interactions with members of Congress. \"People expected bandoliers and funny hats,\" said one congressional aide to McGrory. \"But they're not like that at all. She's very refined, and they're both practical and serious about what they're doing.\"\n\n\"Fonda and Hayden are Now Models of Establishment,\" declared another columnist who interviewed the latter about the IPC's shift in tactics. When asked by a reporter about the move from radical protest to lobbying, Hayden, in between Capitol Hill appointments, argued, \"The situation has changed.\" \"Now a majority of the people are on our side about Vietnam,\" he added, and insisted that it was now appropriate to engage with the mainstream.\n\nWith Levin's help, the two met with approximately fifty members of Congress to convince them to oppose the president's recent request for an additional $474 million in military aid. The new proposal tested the antiwar movement's influence versus Nixon's.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the vote, Hayden and Fonda detailed their mostly positive meetings with politicians in memos sent to other IPC organizers. Senator James Abourezk of South Dakota was one of the more enthusiastic supporters. He told them he was \"willing to introduce any Indochina amendments if no one else will\" to restrict funds. In their notes, the IPC identified Abourezk's then aide and future Democratic senator majority leader, Tom Daschle , as one of the more helpful figures on Capitol Hill. Marvin Esch, a moderate Republican congressman from Michigan, did not sign the IPC's pledge but added that he felt he could be pressured to sign if his constituents pressured him. Esch eventually became a reliable ally and voted to restrict aid to South Vietnam.\n\nHayden and Fonda's presence provided a jolt to the coalition's lobbying efforts in 1974. \"Everyone wanted to mentor Tom and Jane. They wanted them to be part of the system,\" said Levin. Bay Area congressman Ron Dellums, with the help of his then intern Barbara Lee, provided the space for Hayden's classes on the history of US imperialism and played an essential role in strengthening the IPC's ties with legislators and their staff.\n\nMany of the staff members were in their twenties, which meant they were very familiar with Hayden's work as both an activist and a New Left intellectual. They knew that antiwar sentiment had already spread on Capitol Hill and that the IPC could get their bosses on their side with enough pressure. After the Vietnam seminars, legislative aides began to give direct quotes and statistics from Hayden's classes to members of Congress for their speeches.\n\nDespite the warm welcome, some on Capitol Hill pressured the IPC to tone down its presentation to the American public. A Senator's office once called Levin for what they described as an urgent meeting. He rushed to the office, wearing shorts and his pair of Ho Chi Minh rubber sandals, the latter popular among certain antiwar activists as a symbol of anticolonial resistance.\n\nWhen he arrived, the senator's aide held up the latest cover of the IPC's newspaper, Focal Point , which featured an illustration of a North Vietnamese woman with a rifle. An American plane was in the background.\n\n\"Do you want to win votes? Is this what Tom Hayden and Jane Fonda represent?\" the staff member exclaimed. \"I thought you guys were beyond this.\" Before Levin departed, the aide made sure to add, \"Get rid of those goddamned Ho Chi Minh sandals. I don't want to see them in Washington again.\n\nThere was obvious tension between the IPC and liberal Democrats, but public opinion helped override the differences between liberals and the Left in 1974. With the help of the IPC's literature campaign and lobbying, the Coalition to Stop Funding the War reported that thousands of telegrams, petitions, and endless phone calls were arriving from Americans who wanted to end the war in Vietnam that spring. \"Please call your people off. I'm voting with you, okay?\" said one exasperated congressman to Fonda just before the House voted on the provision.\n\nThe president's request for more military aid was defeated in the House in April by a 177-154 vote. The Senate would do the same the following month. It was the first time that Congress had opposed a request for military aid in Vietnam since 1964.\n\nDespite intense lobbying from the White House, Nixon's request for an additional $1.6 billion for South Vietnam was cut down to $700 million by the House on August 6, just days before he resigned. His successor, Gerald Ford, failed to convince Congress to support emergency aid for the collapsing government in Saigon, which eventually fell to the North on April 30, 1975.\n\nIt was an incredible victory for antiwar forces. As a part of an ideologically diverse liberal-left coalition, Hayden and Fonda helped expand the movement's influence in Washington. Aside from their star power, they also acted as a crucial link between the grassroots and friendly politicians who were reevaluating US foreign policy in the mid-1970s.\n\nThe events of 1974 would have astounded the Hayden of 1969. In his 1988 memoir Reunion , he wrote that the lobbying campaign was \"a turning point for me in working through the system.\" He recalled walking out on a \"starry Washington night\" after their first legislative victory in May and \"thanking the heavens for our trust in the process.\"\n\nWith the encouragement of a few allies on Capitol Hill, Hayden ran an insurgent campaign for the Senate in California in 1976. He challenged the Democratic incumbent, John Tunney, with a staff of former IPC organizers. Hayden lost the race but surprised many with a respectable showing of over a million votes (37 percent). Afterward, Hayden and Fonda founded the Campaign for Economic Democracy (CED), which became a significant force in California through the 1980s, electing dozens of progressives to local and state office and passing early environmental reforms.\n\nAs a new antiwar movement calls for a cease-fire in Gaza and mobilizes Americans to oppose a war funded and backed by the United States, activists should look to what IPC organizer Bill Zimmerman referred to as the last stage of the antiwar movement of the Vietnam era as a model. Organizers are already mounting campaigns to pressure both Congress and the White House to end unconditional support for Israel's bombing of the Palestinian people. The story of Hayden and Fonda's lobbying campaign should inspire today's protesters to take advantage of unexpected political openings. Hayden and Fonda helped channel widespread antiwar sentiment into meaningful political power through radical analysis and conventional tactics.\n\nThe Vietnam war's end solidified Hayden's belief that he and other activists should aim to find a balance between radical activism and effective organizing in the halls of power. A few months before North Vietnam took over Saigon, he outlined his thoughts on the movement in a thirty-page letter he composed between babysitting stints with his son in Leningrad.\n\nWhile Fonda was filming The Blue Bird , a Soviet-US film featuring Elizabeth Taylor, Hayden wrote that he believed that the IPC could significantly influence the issues, delegate selection, and even the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party in 1976: \"We may be able to launch a direction which would bring the left to political power over a longer period of, say, 25 years.\"\n\nHalfway through the letter, he announced that he was debating the merits of running for the Senate and encouraged IPC organizers to dream of future victories.\n\nIt sounds insane, egoistic, etc. But unless we normalize saying it, it can never happen. I think we should think even bigger, towards winning the presidency, itself in the future. . . . We have to ask how can the system be changed if not through expanding and using democratic rights to win power over key institutions. You can say it's impossible in our generation. . . . But what does the left have to say otherwise?\n\nMichael Koncewicz is the associate director of the Institute for Public Knowledge at New York University.

Congressman Clair Burgener (R-UT) was enraged: \"A course in 'American imperialism' taught by Miss Fonda and Mr Hayden for employees of this Congress is more than I can accept.\"\n\nBurgener delivered this statement on the House floor on March 18, soon after discovering that his colleagues' advisors were attending Hayden's 1974 lectures on the Vietnam War inside a subcommittee room at the Capitol. Dozens of mostly young staffers gathered in the Rayburn House Office Building for six classes over three weeks led by Hayden.\n\nA Freedom Rider who was one of the first Americans to visit Hanoi, Hayden was known to many as the principal author of the Port Huron Statement and as one of the defendants of the Chicago 7 trial in 1969. In 1974, he found a way to gain influence inside the Capitol with the help of one of the most famous actresses and activists in the world.\n\nJoining Burgener were several other representatives like Trent Lott (R-MS) and Richard Ichord (D-MO), the last chairman of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Lott called Hayden's seminars \"communist propaganda.\" Ichord condemned antiwar congressman Ron Dellums (D-CA) for giving Hayden the room to \"preach to impressionable young congressional aides.\"\n\nPolitical observers had previously deemed Hayden and Fonda far outside the mainstream. In 1974, with Watergate weakening President Richard Nixon, they were now lobbying inside the halls of Congress on behalf of their new antiwar organization, the Indochina Peace Campaign (IPC). Both had gone beyond enemy lines, with Hayden visiting North Vietnam three times between 1965 and 1972. Fonda's highly publicized solo trip in 1972 helped raise awareness of Nixon's plans to bomb the country's dikes. The trip also began a decades-long campaign from the Right to vilify Fonda, paying extra attention to images of her smiling while sitting on an anti-aircraft missile and going on Vietnamese radio.\n\nWhat has been forgotten by most is that politicians met and listened to Hayden and Fonda after their trips helped expose the devastation caused by US bombs. Senators were now willing to listen to their pitch to cut off funding to the anticommunist South Vietnam and pledge not to support any attempt to escalate US involvement. As the founders of IPC, they helped elevate the antiwar movement further into the mainstream. Decades later, a new generation of organizers trying to halt America's brutal warmaking abroad should study their lobbying work.\n\nHayden and Fonda's decision to take to the halls of Congress to try to stop the war came at a moment when the antiwar movement felt stuck. In 1973, the Paris Peace Accords brought home the last remaining US troops in Vietnam, and peace activists were adrift. After eight years of grassroots protests, ranging from teach-ins to massive single-day actions, many were prepared to move on to other issues. But the remnants of the antiwar movement were justifiably concerned that Nixon could break the peace as soon as fighting resumed between the North and South and authorize a new bombing campaign.\n\nHayden began the 1970s in court as one of the Chicago 7 , a group of primarily well-known New Left activists whom the federal government accused of conspiring to start a riot at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. After a shambolic set of proceedings that received regular coverage on the evening news, Hayden was one of the four who was convicted of crossing state lines with an intent to incite a riot. The US Court of Appeals eventually overturned the widely lampooned sentences in 1973.\n\nThe stress of the trial weighed heavily on Hayden. Facing a five-year prison sentence and constant FBI surveillance, he became even more convinced that he was living under fascism. At the time, Hayden lived in a radical collective in Berkeley known as the Red Family . Members practiced martial arts, went to target practice, and regularly debated the exact nature of the coming revolution. His time in Berkeley disrupted his pragmatism, a core part of Hayden's political identity that stretched back to the early days of the reform-minded Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) of the early 1960s. He embraced the confrontational tactics throughout the decade while also seeking out links to conventional politics.\n\nHayden met with administration officials in President Lyndon Johnson's administration, governors, and even presidential candidates while also traveling to Cuba and Vietnam. The tumultuous events of the late 1960s and Berkeley's radical political scene altered his worldview and made him question his almost innate sense of political practicality. By the decade's end, Hayden flirted with joining the underground and publicly called for the Left to create nebulously defined \"liberation zones\" across America.\n\nBy the summer of 1971, the Red Family kicked Hayden out for male chauvinism and other alleged manipulative behavior. Hayden was guilty of specific transgressions such as infidelity, but his dismissal was also part of a broader feminist wave against predominantly white male leaders that reshaped many movement spaces in the early 1970s. Women took control of these groups from male leaders who had long dominated leftist groups and were slow to respond to growing calls for gender equality. Other male leaders, including several of Hayden's fellow codefendants like Rennie Davis , faced similar charges.\n\nEventually, the Red Family dismissed other male members and collapsed shortly after they banished Hayden from Berkeley. Much like other splits within the broader movement, a well-deserved corrective devolved and eventually crippled the Red Family. The episode was extremely painful for Hayden, who, at age thirty-one, decided to live under a pseudonym in a shabby studio apartment in Venice, California, filled with books on Irish history. He practiced yoga and karate on the beach and reevaluated his place within the movement. He developed antiwar slideshows with students who took his class on Vietnam at Immaculate Heart College and worked with close friend and lawyer Leonard Weinglass on whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg's defense team.\n\nTeaching the history of Vietnam gave Hayden a new sense of direction, but his relationship with Fonda helped him develop a new antiwar campaign. Fonda was already a dedicated activist before meeting Hayden, as she was a vocal supporter of antiwar GIs in the early 1970s. A year after a brief encounter at an antiwar GI meeting, Hayden and Fonda met again at an antiwar event in downtown Los Angeles, where Fonda was a featured speaker. Like Hayden, Fonda had become weary of the sectarianism that had defined movement politics and sought more structure for her antiwar work. Soon, the two began collaborating on slideshows; not long after, in January 1973, they were married.\n\nIn the early months of their budding romance, the two worked with fellow organizers in southern California to form the IPC in the summer of 1972. The IPC began as an education campaign about the war and coordinated a national tour of midwestern states just weeks after Fonda's controversial visit to North Vietnam. Amid the initial backlash over the Hanoi trip, Hayden and Fonda successfully toured Middle America, showing the slides that brought them together. Joined by singer Holly Near and antiwar GI and POW George Smith, they began their voyage at the Ohio State Fair. It was one of many atypical venues for an antiwar rally.\n\nMonths after the successful tour, Hayden and Fonda set up an IPC headquarters in Santa Monica in January 1973. Both were determined to create a new organization to help unite peace groups nationwide. Hayden, a skilled strategist who was unafraid to lead, recognized that there was \"a lack of any day-to-day work or organization about Vietnam.\" He also added that there was a severe \"lack of non-rhetorical education about Vietnam since the \" teach-ins \" of 1965. IPC organizers were in search of a more proactive approach to antiwar politics. Shifting away from the mass demonstrations that had defined the movement, the IPC was more interested in mobilizing local communities outside the nation's antiwar hotspots. Soon, the IPC established dozens of chapters across the country.\n\nThe IPC's main link to Washington was Larry Levin, a friend from Venice who bonded with Hayden over their interest in the Northern Ireland civil rights movement. After helping Hayden and Fonda establish the IPC, he moved to the nation's capital to lobby on behalf of a new umbrella organization, the Coalition to Stop Funding the War, in January 1973.\n\nMade up of religious organizations, unions, and other longtime peace activists, the coalition explicitly sought to direct activists' attention toward Congress to prevent Nixon from violating the Paris Peace Accords. The antiwar movement had lobbied Congress before, but the coalition offered a steadier outlet for activists interested in working on Capitol Hill.\n\nLevin and others recall that Hayden was initially skeptical of the congressional strategy. Still bruised and battered by the events of the '60s, Hayden was wary of alliances with politicians. By the fall, the politics of Vietnam and Watergate pushed the IPC toward lobbying. Fighting between the North and South had resumed, and a war-weary public was beginning to learn more about the president's abuses of power. The IPC formalized their support of congressional lobbying at a Germantown, Ohio, conference in October . Hayden sought to capitalize on what he referred to as the \"Watergate Opportunity,\" as he and other IPC organizers agreed the time was right to pressure Congress to cut funding to South Vietnam and stop Nixon from taking drastic military action.\n\nWith established relationships on Capitol Hill through Levin and other coalition organizers, Tom, Jane, and their infant son went to Washington in January 1974. In their press releases, they highlighted the corruption of South Vietnam and the plight of the nation's hundred thousand political prisoners. They also announced their intention to have members of Congress sign on to their three-point pledge, which called for the prohibition of direct US involvement in Indochina, a settlement based on the Paris Peace Agreement, and an end to US aid for police and prison systems in South Vietnam.\n\nThe couple purposefully avoided courting media attention, but a few journalists reported on their arrival. Mary McGrory, the venerable liberal columnist for the Washington Star, described the couple as the \"most unexpected and most unnerving lobbying team on Capitol Hill.\" She echoed other observers who marveled at their interactions with members of Congress. \"People expected bandoliers and funny hats,\" said one congressional aide to McGrory. \"But they're not like that at all. She's very refined, and they're both practical and serious about what they're doing.\"\n\n\"Fonda and Hayden are Now Models of Establishment,\" declared another columnist who interviewed the latter about the IPC's shift in tactics. When asked by a reporter about the move from radical protest to lobbying, Hayden, in between Capitol Hill appointments, argued, \"The situation has changed.\" \"Now a majority of the people are on our side about Vietnam,\" he added, and insisted that it was now appropriate to engage with the mainstream.\n\nWith Levin's help, the two met with approximately fifty members of Congress to convince them to oppose the president's recent request for an additional $474 million in military aid. The new proposal tested the antiwar movement's influence versus Nixon's.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the vote, Hayden and Fonda detailed their mostly positive meetings with politicians in memos sent to other IPC organizers. Senator James Abourezk of South Dakota was one of the more enthusiastic supporters. He told them he was \"willing to introduce any Indochina amendments if no one else will\" to restrict funds. In their notes, the IPC identified Abourezk's then aide and future Democratic senator majority leader, Tom Daschle , as one of the more helpful figures on Capitol Hill. Marvin Esch, a moderate Republican congressman from Michigan, did not sign the IPC's pledge but added that he felt he could be pressured to sign if his constituents pressured him. Esch eventually became a reliable ally and voted to restrict aid to South Vietnam.\n\nHayden and Fonda's presence provided a jolt to the coalition's lobbying efforts in 1974. \"Everyone wanted to mentor Tom and Jane. They wanted them to be part of the system,\" said Levin. Bay Area congressman Ron Dellums, with the help of his then intern Barbara Lee, provided the space for Hayden's classes on the history of US imperialism and played an essential role in strengthening the IPC's ties with legislators and their staff.\n\nMany of the staff members were in their twenties, which meant they were very familiar with Hayden's work as both an activist and a New Left intellectual. They knew that antiwar sentiment had already spread on Capitol Hill and that the IPC could get their bosses on their side with enough pressure. After the Vietnam seminars, legislative aides began to give direct quotes and statistics from Hayden's classes to members of Congress for their speeches.\n\nDespite the warm welcome, some on Capitol Hill pressured the IPC to tone down its presentation to the American public. A Senator's office once called Levin for what they described as an urgent meeting. He rushed to the office, wearing shorts and his pair of Ho Chi Minh rubber sandals, the latter popular among certain antiwar activists as a symbol of anticolonial resistance.\n\nWhen he arrived, the senator's aide held up the latest cover of the IPC's newspaper, Focal Point , which featured an illustration of a North Vietnamese woman with a rifle. An American plane was in the background.\n\n\"Do you want to win votes? Is this what Tom Hayden and Jane Fonda represent?\" the staff member exclaimed. \"I thought you guys were beyond this.\" Before Levin departed, the aide made sure to add, \"Get rid of those goddamned Ho Chi Minh sandals. I don't want to see them in Washington again.\n\nThere was obvious tension between the IPC and liberal Democrats, but public opinion helped override the differences between liberals and the Left in 1974. With the help of the IPC's literature campaign and lobbying, the Coalition to Stop Funding the War reported that thousands of telegrams, petitions, and endless phone calls were arriving from Americans who wanted to end the war in Vietnam that spring. \"Please call your people off. I'm voting with you, okay?\" said one exasperated congressman to Fonda just before the House voted on the provision.\n\nThe president's request for more military aid was defeated in the House in April by a 177-154 vote. The Senate would do the same the following month. It was the first time that Congress had opposed a request for military aid in Vietnam since 1964.\n\nDespite intense lobbying from the White House, Nixon's request for an additional $1.6 billion for South Vietnam was cut down to $700 million by the House on August 6, just days before he resigned. His successor, Gerald Ford, failed to convince Congress to support emergency aid for the collapsing government in Saigon, which eventually fell to the North on April 30, 1975.\n\nIt was an incredible victory for antiwar forces.

Aside from their star power, they also acted as a crucial link between the grassroots and friendly politicians who were reevaluating US foreign policy in the mid-1970s.\n\nThe events of 1974 would have astounded the Hayden of 1969.

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nA new documentary goes inside the making of the classic labor-feminist movie 9 to 5 - and shows how many of the problems it lampooned still plague working women today.\n\nLily Tomlin, Dolly Parton, and Jane Fonda in 9 to 5 . (20th Century Fox)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWhen Dolly Parton first tapped out the beat to her iconic song 9 to 5 more than forty years ago, a movement of working women was taking off. 9 to 5 the movie catapulted those women's demands for rights and respect into the public debate, legitimizing the often-unspoken grievances of the growing women's workforce.\n\nWe've seen some progress. Women are no longer restricted to a handful of occupations, and sexual harassment is no longer a personal shame but a public scandal. But the sensible reforms mentioned in the film - equal pay, childcare, flexible hours - are still out of reach. As Dolly says in the new documentary, Still Working 9 to 5, \"It's forty years later, and it's still important.\"\n\nI know 9 to 5 well. I was friends with Jane Fonda from the antiwar movement, and my stories about organizing women office workers in our national association 9to5 and our union SEIU 925, inspired her to make the film, as she describes in the documentary made by Camille Hardman and Gary Lane. The documentary has delightful information about the film I didn't know, along with insights on the fight for women's equality.\n\nA few highlights: It turns out that Lily Tomlin backed out twice because she didn't think the script was funny; she eventually decided the opportunity to work with Fonda was too important to pass up. The studio was nervous because the film had three female leads and wanted a movie star as the boss; Bruce Gilbert, the producer and Fonda's business partner, prevailed in casting Dabney Coleman in that role.\n\nLilly Ledbetter, who sued Goodyear Tire for sex discrimination in 1998 and for whom the 2009 Fair Pay Act is named, saw 9 to 5 when it came out. When she became a supervisor, some men resented taking orders from a woman and made her job difficult. She even feared for her life at times on the dangerous factory floor. She took comfort in the film. \"I think back,\" she says, \"and Jane and Dolly and Lily encouraged me.\"\n\nAnd in a moment of bizarre self-awareness, Harvey Weinstein, an investor and producer of the 9 to 5 musical, explains why the production is a success: \"It's women's emancipation. Secondly, it's about women wanting to kill their boss. And third of all, I know that everyone in my company wants to kill me.\"\n\nWeinstein's screen time aside, Still Working 9 to 5 is fun, including when the stars of the film, TV show, and musical deliver the messages: \"Don't put up with shit,\" Allison Janney says. \"Stand up for yourselves,\" says Rita Moreno. \"I'm not going to take it anymore!\" Jane Fonda cries. Dolly summed it up: \"It touched a nerve. It resonated with enough people that right out of the box it kept getting bigger and bigger.\"\n\nWhy does it resonate today?\n\nFar fewer women are actually still working 9-to-5 these days. Secretaries and administrative assistants were the top occupation for women by a mile in 1980, and the occupation is still overwhelmingly women - 95 percent. But it now comes in fourth after teachers, nurses, and health aides as the top occupations for women, according to the US Department of Labor Women's Bureau. More women may be working 7 AM to 3 PM, the evening shift, or have no fixed hours at all, while many office workers and professionals are on call long after the work day ends. But while the jobs and hours may have changed, the issues haven't gone away.\n\nIn 2019, I met with about fifty working women in Milwaukee, Chicago, and Washington, DC, to get their thoughts on a possible sequel to 9 to 5 . \"We're working more like 24-7, but I had to stand up and shout ten minutes into this film,\" a woman named Brenda told me. \"I couldn't believe how many of the problems are still with us.\"\n\n\"Childcare center? I feel like I have to hide the fact that I have kids,\" said Sheila. One woman captured the anger of the Lily Tomlin character: \"I have to swallow all the fury and frustration in order to just show up to the bullshit at work, because the bullshit pays the bills.\"\n\nSocial scientists confirm that the agenda is unfinished. The Harvard Business Review reports that, since the 1990s, the move toward workplace gender equality has slowed:\n\nSociologist Paula England has called this phenomenon an uneven and stalled gender revolution, and there have been dozens of studies showing how the progress in gender equality experienced during and immediately after the feminist movement of the 1970s has not been sustained.\n\nWith the pandemic, the problem is not just a stalled agenda but a major setback . And with a supermajority of conservative judges on the Supreme Court, we'll see the end of abortion rights and a likely erosion of workplace and civil rights for women and people of color.\n\nThis isn't the first time American women have had to start over. Louis Menand, in his book The Free World: Art and Thought in the Cold World , writes, \"By many measures, American women were worse off in 1963 than they had been in 1945 or even in 1920. In 1920, 20 percent of PhDs were awarded to women; in 1963, it was 11 percent. Forty-seven percent of college students were women in 1920; in 1963, 38 percent.\" Women were largely absent in professions and public life. And even the gender pay gap was greater in 1963 than it had been in 1951.\n\nIt took social movements in the 1960s and 70s to restore progress to women who had lost so much ground and leap forward. The success of 9 to 5 in 1980 captured that momentum and promised a future of positive change - a promise that, as Still Working 9 to 5 will remind you, still hasn't been fulfilled.\n\nKaren Nussbaum was a cofounder of the women's labor organization 9to5 and the founding director of Working America.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nFifty years ago, New Leftist Tom Hayden and actress and activist Jane Fonda infiltrated the Capitol. Congressman Clair Burgener (R-UT) was enraged: \"A course in 'American imperialism' taught by Miss Fonda and Mr Hayden for employees of this Congress is more than I can accept.\"\n\nBurgener delivered this statement on the House floor on March 18, soon after discovering that his colleagues' advisors were attending Hayden's 1974 lectures on the Vietnam War inside a subcommittee room at the Capitol. Dozens of mostly young staffers gathered in the Rayburn House Office Building for six classes over three weeks led by Hayden.\n\nA Freedom Rider who was one of the first Americans to visit Hanoi, Hayden was known to many as the principal author of the Port Huron Statement and as one of the defendants of the Chicago 7 trial in 1969. In 1974, he found a way to gain influence inside the Capitol with the help of one of the most famous actresses and activists in the world.\n\nJoining Burgener were several other representatives like Trent Lott (R-MS) and Richard Ichord (D-MO), the last chairman of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Lott called Hayden's seminars \"communist propaganda.\" Ichord condemned antiwar congressman Ron Dellums (D-CA) for giving Hayden the room to \"preach to impressionable young congressional aides.\"\n\nPolitical observers had previously deemed Hayden and Fonda far outside the mainstream. In 1974, with Watergate weakening President Richard Nixon, they were now lobbying inside the halls of Congress on behalf of their new antiwar organization, the Indochina Peace Campaign (IPC). Both had gone beyond enemy lines, with Hayden visiting North Vietnam three times between 1965 and 1972. Fonda's highly publicized solo trip in 1972 helped raise awareness of Nixon's plans to bomb the country's dikes. The trip also began a decades-long campaign from the Right to vilify Fonda, paying extra attention to images of her smiling while sitting on an anti-aircraft missile and going on Vietnamese radio.\n\nWhat has been forgotten by most is that politicians met and listened to Hayden and Fonda after their trips helped expose the devastation caused by US bombs. Senators were now willing to listen to their pitch to cut off funding to the anticommunist South Vietnam and pledge not to support any attempt to escalate US involvement. As the founders of IPC, they helped elevate the antiwar movement further into the mainstream. Decades later, a new generation of organizers trying to halt America's brutal warmaking abroad should study their lobbying work.\n\nHayden and Fonda's decision to take to the halls of Congress to try to stop the war came at a moment when the antiwar movement felt stuck. In 1973, the Paris Peace Accords brought home the last remaining US troops in Vietnam, and peace activists were adrift. After eight years of grassroots protests, ranging from teach-ins to massive single-day actions, many were prepared to move on to other issues. But the remnants of the antiwar movement were justifiably concerned that Nixon could break the peace as soon as fighting resumed between the North and South and authorize a new bombing campaign.\n\nHayden began the 1970s in court as one of the Chicago 7 , a group of primarily well-known New Left activists whom the federal government accused of conspiring to start a riot at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. After a shambolic set of proceedings that received regular coverage on the evening news, Hayden was one of the four who was convicted of crossing state lines with an intent to incite a riot. The US Court of Appeals eventually overturned the widely lampooned sentences in 1973.\n\nThe stress of the trial weighed heavily on Hayden. Facing a five-year prison sentence and constant FBI surveillance, he became even more convinced that he was living under fascism. At the time, Hayden lived in a radical collective in Berkeley known as the Red Family . Members practiced martial arts, went to target practice, and regularly debated the exact nature of the coming revolution. His time in Berkeley disrupted his pragmatism, a core part of Hayden's political identity that stretched back to the early days of the reform-minded Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) of the early 1960s. He embraced the confrontational tactics throughout the decade while also seeking out links to conventional politics.\n\nHayden met with administration officials in President Lyndon Johnson's administration, governors, and even presidential candidates while also traveling to Cuba and Vietnam. The tumultuous events of the late 1960s and Berkeley's radical political scene altered his worldview and made him question his almost innate sense of political practicality. By the decade's end, Hayden flirted with joining the underground and publicly called for the Left to create nebulously defined \"liberation zones\" across America.\n\nBy the summer of 1971, the Red Family kicked Hayden out for male chauvinism and other alleged manipulative behavior. Hayden was guilty of specific transgressions such as infidelity, but his dismissal was also part of a broader feminist wave against predominantly white male leaders that reshaped many movement spaces in the early 1970s. Women took control of these groups from male leaders who had long dominated leftist groups and were slow to respond to growing calls for gender equality. Other male leaders, including several of Hayden's fellow codefendants like Rennie Davis , faced similar charges.\n\nEventually, the Red Family dismissed other male members and collapsed shortly after they banished Hayden from Berkeley. Much like other splits within the broader movement, a well-deserved corrective devolved and eventually crippled the Red Family. The episode was extremely painful for Hayden, who, at age thirty-one, decided to live under a pseudonym in a shabby studio apartment in Venice, California, filled with books on Irish history. He practiced yoga and karate on the beach and reevaluated his place within the movement. He developed antiwar slideshows with students who took his class on Vietnam at Immaculate Heart College and worked with close friend and lawyer Leonard Weinglass on whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg's defense team.\n\nTeaching the history of Vietnam gave Hayden a new sense of direction, but his relationship with Fonda helped him develop a new antiwar campaign. Fonda was already a dedicated activist before meeting Hayden, as she was a vocal supporter of antiwar GIs in the early 1970s. A year after a brief encounter at an antiwar GI meeting, Hayden and Fonda met again at an antiwar event in downtown Los Angeles, where Fonda was a featured speaker. Like Hayden, Fonda had become weary of the sectarianism that had defined movement politics and sought more structure for her antiwar work. Soon, the two began collaborating on slideshows; not long after, in January 1973, they were married.\n\nIn the early months of their budding romance, the two worked with fellow organizers in southern California to form the IPC in the summer of 1972. The IPC began as an education campaign about the war and coordinated a national tour of midwestern states just weeks after Fonda's controversial visit to North Vietnam. Amid the initial backlash over the Hanoi trip, Hayden and Fonda successfully toured Middle America, showing the slides that brought them together. Joined by singer Holly Near and antiwar GI and POW George Smith, they began their voyage at the Ohio State Fair. It was one of many atypical venues for an antiwar rally.\n\nMonths after the successful tour, Hayden and Fonda set up an IPC headquarters in Santa Monica in January 1973. Both were determined to create a new organization to help unite peace groups nationwide. Hayden, a skilled strategist who was unafraid to lead, recognized that there was \"a lack of any day-to-day work or organization about Vietnam.\" He also added that there was a severe \"lack of non-rhetorical education about Vietnam since the \" teach-ins \" of 1965. IPC organizers were in search of a more proactive approach to antiwar politics. Shifting away from the mass demonstrations that had defined the movement, the IPC was more interested in mobilizing local communities outside the nation's antiwar hotspots. Soon, the IPC established dozens of chapters across the country.\n\nThe IPC's main link to Washington was Larry Levin, a friend from Venice who bonded with Hayden over their interest in the Northern Ireland civil rights movement. After helping Hayden and Fonda establish the IPC, he moved to the nation's capital to lobby on behalf of a new umbrella organization, the Coalition to Stop Funding the War, in January 1973.\n\nMade up of religious organizations, unions, and other longtime peace activists, the coalition explicitly sought to direct activists' attention toward Congress to prevent Nixon from violating the Paris Peace Accords. The antiwar movement had lobbied Congress before, but the coalition offered a steadier outlet for activists interested in working on Capitol Hill.\n\nLevin and others recall that Hayden was initially skeptical of the congressional strategy. Still bruised and battered by the events of the '60s, Hayden was wary of alliances with politicians. By the fall, the politics of Vietnam and Watergate pushed the IPC toward lobbying. Fighting between the North and South had resumed, and a war-weary public was beginning to learn more about the president's abuses of power. The IPC formalized their support of congressional lobbying at a Germantown, Ohio, conference in October . Hayden sought to capitalize on what he referred to as the \"Watergate Opportunity,\" as he and other IPC organizers agreed the time was right to pressure Congress to cut funding to South Vietnam and stop Nixon from taking drastic military action.\n\nWith established relationships on Capitol Hill through Levin and other coalition organizers, Tom, Jane, and their infant son went to Washington in January 1974. In their press releases, they highlighted the corruption of South Vietnam and the plight of the nation's hundred thousand political prisoners. They also announced their intention to have members of Congress sign on to their three-point pledge, which called for the prohibition of direct US involvement in Indochina, a settlement based on the Paris Peace Agreement, and an end to US aid for police and prison systems in South Vietnam.\n\nThe couple purposefully avoided courting media attention, but a few journalists reported on their arrival. Mary McGrory, the venerable liberal columnist for the Washington Star, described the couple as the \"most unexpected and most unnerving lobbying team on Capitol Hill.\" She echoed other observers who marveled at their interactions with members of Congress. \"People expected bandoliers and funny hats,\" said one congressional aide to McGrory. \"But they're not like that at all. She's very refined, and they're both practical and serious about what they're doing.\"\n\n\"Fonda and Hayden are Now Models of Establishment,\" declared another columnist who interviewed the latter about the IPC's shift in tactics. When asked by a reporter about the move from radical protest to lobbying, Hayden, in between Capitol Hill appointments, argued, \"The situation has changed.\" \"Now a majority of the people are on our side about Vietnam,\" he added, and insisted that it was now appropriate to engage with the mainstream.\n\nWith Levin's help, the two met with approximately fifty members of Congress to convince them to oppose the president's recent request for an additional $474 million in military aid. The new proposal tested the antiwar movement's influence versus Nixon's.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the vote, Hayden and Fonda detailed their mostly positive meetings with politicians in memos sent to other IPC organizers. Senator James Abourezk of South Dakota was one of the more enthusiastic supporters. He told them he was \"willing to introduce any Indochina amendments if no one else will\" to restrict funds. In their notes, the IPC identified Abourezk's then aide and future Democratic senator majority leader, Tom Daschle , as one of the more helpful figures on Capitol Hill. Marvin Esch, a moderate Republican congressman from Michigan, did not sign the IPC's pledge but added that he felt he could be pressured to sign if his constituents pressured him. Esch eventually became a reliable ally and voted to restrict aid to South Vietnam.\n\nHayden and Fonda's presence provided a jolt to the coalition's lobbying efforts in 1974. \"Everyone wanted to mentor Tom and Jane. They wanted them to be part of the system,\" said Levin. Bay Area congressman Ron Dellums, with the help of his then intern Barbara Lee, provided the space for Hayden's classes on the history of US imperialism and played an essential role in strengthening the IPC's ties with legislators and their staff.\n\nMany of the staff members were in their twenties, which meant they were very familiar with Hayden's work as both an activist and a New Left intellectual. They knew that antiwar sentiment had already spread on Capitol Hill and that the IPC could get their bosses on their side with enough pressure. After the Vietnam seminars, legislative aides began to give direct quotes and statistics from Hayden's classes to members of Congress for their speeches.\n\nDespite the warm welcome, some on Capitol Hill pressured the IPC to tone down its presentation to the American public. A Senator's office once called Levin for what they described as an urgent meeting. He rushed to the office, wearing shorts and his pair of Ho Chi Minh rubber sandals, the latter popular among certain antiwar activists as a symbol of anticolonial resistance.\n\nWhen he arrived, the senator's aide held up the latest cover of the IPC's newspaper, Focal Point , which featured an illustration of a North Vietnamese woman with a rifle. An American plane was in the background.\n\n\"Do you want to win votes? Is this what Tom Hayden and Jane Fonda represent?\" the staff member exclaimed. \"I thought you guys were beyond this.\" Before Levin departed, the aide made sure to add, \"Get rid of those goddamned Ho Chi Minh sandals. I don't want to see them in Washington again.\n\nThere was obvious tension between the IPC and liberal Democrats, but public opinion helped override the differences between liberals and the Left in 1974. With the help of the IPC's literature campaign and lobbying, the Coalition to Stop Funding the War reported that thousands of telegrams, petitions, and endless phone calls were arriving from Americans who wanted to end the war in Vietnam that spring. \"Please call your people off. I'm voting with you, okay?\" said one exasperated congressman to Fonda just before the House voted on the provision.\n\nThe president's request for more military aid was defeated in the House in April by a 177-154 vote. The Senate would do the same the following month. It was the first time that Congress had opposed a request for military aid in Vietnam since 1964.\n\nDespite intense lobbying from the White House, Nixon's request for an additional $1.6 billion for South Vietnam was cut down to $700 million by the House on August 6, just days before he resigned. His successor, Gerald Ford, failed to convince Congress to support emergency aid for the collapsing government in Saigon, which eventually fell to the North on April 30, 1975.\n\nIt was an incredible victory for antiwar forces. As a part of an ideologically diverse liberal-left coalition, Hayden and Fonda helped expand the movement's influence in Washington. Aside from their star power, they also acted as a crucial link between the grassroots and friendly politicians who were reevaluating US foreign policy in the mid-1970s.\n\nThe events of 1974 would have astounded the Hayden of 1969. In his 1988 memoir Reunion , he wrote that the lobbying campaign was \"a turning point for me in working through the system.\" He recalled walking out on a \"starry Washington night\" after their first legislative victory in May and \"thanking the heavens for our trust in the process.\"\n\nWith the encouragement of a few allies on Capitol Hill, Hayden ran an insurgent campaign for the Senate in California in 1976. He challenged the Democratic incumbent, John Tunney, with a staff of former IPC organizers. Hayden lost the race but surprised many with a respectable showing of over a million votes (37 percent). Afterward, Hayden and Fonda founded the Campaign for Economic Democracy (CED), which became a significant force in California through the 1980s, electing dozens of progressives to local and state office and passing early environmental reforms.\n\nAs a new antiwar movement calls for a cease-fire in Gaza and mobilizes Americans to oppose a war funded and backed by the United States, activists should look to what IPC organizer Bill Zimmerman referred to as the last stage of the antiwar movement of the Vietnam era as a model. Organizers are already mounting campaigns to pressure both Congress and the White House to end unconditional support for Israel's bombing of the Palestinian people. The story of Hayden and Fonda's lobbying campaign should inspire today's protesters to take advantage of unexpected political openings. Hayden and Fonda helped channel widespread antiwar sentiment into meaningful political power through radical analysis and conventional tactics.\n\nThe Vietnam war's end solidified Hayden's belief that he and other activists should aim to find a balance between radical activism and effective organizing in the halls of power. A few months before North Vietnam took over Saigon, he outlined his thoughts on the movement in a thirty-page letter he composed between babysitting stints with his son in Leningrad.\n\nWhile Fonda was filming The Blue Bird , a Soviet-US film featuring Elizabeth Taylor, Hayden wrote that he believed that the IPC could significantly influence the issues, delegate selection, and even the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party in 1976: \"We may be able to launch a direction which would bring the left to political power over a longer period of, say, 25 years.\"\n\nHalfway through the letter, he announced that he was debating the merits of running for the Senate and encouraged IPC organizers to dream of future victories.\n\nIt sounds insane, egoistic, etc. But unless we normalize saying it, it can never happen. I think we should think even bigger, towards winning the presidency, itself in the future. . . . We have to ask how can the system be changed if not through expanding and using democratic rights to win power over key institutions. You can say it's impossible in our generation. . . . But what does the left have to say otherwise?\n\nMichael Koncewicz is the associate director of the Institute for Public Knowledge at New York University.

Is this what Tom Hayden and Jane Fonda represent?\" the staff member exclaimed. \"I thought you guys were beyond this.\" Before Levin departed, the aide made sure to add, \"Get rid of those goddamned Ho Chi Minh sandals. I don't want to see them in Washington again.\n\nThere was obvious tension between the IPC and liberal Democrats, but public opinion helped override the differences between liberals and the Left in 1974. With the help of the IPC's literature campaign and lobbying, the Coalition to Stop Funding the War reported that thousands of telegrams, petitions, and endless phone calls were arriving from Americans who wanted to end the war in Vietnam that spring. \"Please call your people off. I'm voting with you, okay?\" said one exasperated congressman to Fonda just before the House voted on the provision.\n\nThe president's request for more military aid was defeated in the House in April by a 177-154 vote. The Senate would do the same the following month. It was the first time that Congress had opposed a request for military aid in Vietnam since 1964.\n\nDespite intense lobbying from the White House, Nixon's request for an additional $1.6 billion for South Vietnam was cut down to $700 million by the House on August 6, just days before he resigned. His successor, Gerald Ford, failed to convince Congress to support emergency aid for the collapsing government in Saigon, which eventually fell to the North on April 30, 1975.\n\nIt was an incredible victory for antiwar forces. As a part of an ideologically diverse liberal-left coalition, Hayden and Fonda helped expand the movement's influence in Washington. Aside from their star power, they also acted as a crucial link between the grassroots and friendly politicians who were reevaluating US foreign policy in the mid-1970s.\n\nThe events of 1974 would have astounded the Hayden of 1969. In his 1988 memoir Reunion , he wrote that the lobbying campaign was \"a turning point for me in working through the system.\" He recalled walking out on a \"starry Washington night\" after their first legislative victory in May and \"thanking the heavens for our trust in the process.\"\n\nWith the encouragement of a few allies on Capitol Hill, Hayden ran an insurgent campaign for the Senate in California in 1976. He challenged the Democratic incumbent, John Tunney, with a staff of former IPC organizers. Hayden lost the race but surprised many with a respectable showing of over a million votes (37 percent). Afterward, Hayden and Fonda founded the Campaign for Economic Democracy (CED), which became a significant force in California through the 1980s, electing dozens of progressives to local and state office and passing early environmental reforms.\n\nAs a new antiwar movement calls for a cease-fire in Gaza and mobilizes Americans to oppose a war funded and backed by the United States, activists should look to what IPC organizer Bill Zimmerman referred to as the last stage of the antiwar movement of the Vietnam era as a model. Organizers are already mounting campaigns to pressure both Congress and the White House to end unconditional support for Israel's bombing of the Palestinian people. The story of Hayden and Fonda's lobbying campaign should inspire today's protesters to take advantage of unexpected political openings. Hayden and Fonda helped channel widespread antiwar sentiment into meaningful political power through radical analysis and conventional tactics.\n\nThe Vietnam war's end solidified Hayden's belief that he and other activists should aim to find a balance between radical activism and effective organizing in the halls of power. A few months before North Vietnam took over Saigon, he outlined his thoughts on the movement in a thirty-page letter he composed between babysitting stints with his son in Leningrad.\n\nWhile Fonda was filming The Blue Bird , a Soviet-US film featuring Elizabeth Taylor, Hayden wrote that he believed that the IPC could significantly influence the issues, delegate selection, and even the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party in 1976: \"We may be able to launch a direction which would bring the left to political power over a longer period of, say, 25 years.\"\n\nHalfway through the letter, he announced that he was debating the merits of running for the Senate and encouraged IPC organizers to dream of future victories.\n\nIt sounds insane, egoistic, etc. But unless we normalize saying it, it can never happen. I think we should think even bigger, towards winning the presidency, itself in the future. . . . We have to ask how can the system be changed if not through expanding and using democratic rights to win power over key institutions. You can say it's impossible in our generation. . . . But what does the left have to say otherwise?\n\nMichael Koncewicz is the associate director of the Institute for Public Knowledge at New York University.

(20th Century Fox)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWhen Dolly Parton first tapped out the beat to her iconic song 9 to 5 more than forty years ago, a movement of working women was taking off. 9 to 5 the movie catapulted those women's demands for rights and respect into the public debate, legitimizing the often-unspoken grievances of the growing women's workforce.\n\nWe've seen some progress. Women are no longer restricted to a handful of occupations, and sexual harassment is no longer a personal shame but a public scandal. But the sensible reforms mentioned in the film - equal pay, childcare, flexible hours - are still out of reach. As Dolly says in the new documentary, Still Working 9 to 5, \"It's forty years later, and it's still important.\"\n\nI know 9 to 5 well. I was friends with Jane Fonda from the antiwar movement, and my stories about organizing women office workers in our national association 9to5 and our union SEIU 925, inspired her to make the film, as she describes in the documentary made by Camille Hardman and Gary Lane. The documentary has delightful information about the film I didn't know, along with insights on the fight for women's equality.\n\nA few highlights: It turns out that Lily Tomlin backed out twice because she didn't think the script was funny; she eventually decided the opportunity to work with Fonda was too important to pass up. The studio was nervous because the film had three female leads and wanted a movie star as the boss; Bruce Gilbert, the producer and Fonda's business partner, prevailed in casting Dabney Coleman in that role.\n\nLilly Ledbetter, who sued Goodyear Tire for sex discrimination in 1998 and for whom the 2009 Fair Pay Act is named, saw 9 to 5 when it came out. When she became a supervisor, some men resented taking orders from a woman and made her job difficult. She even feared for her life at times on the dangerous factory floor. She took comfort in the film. \"I think back,\" she says, \"and Jane and Dolly and Lily encouraged me.\"\n\nAnd in a moment of bizarre self-awareness, Harvey Weinstein, an investor and producer of the 9 to 5 musical, explains why the production is a success: \"It's women's emancipation. Secondly, it's about women wanting to kill their boss. And third of all, I know that everyone in my company wants to kill me.\"\n\nWeinstein's screen time aside, Still Working 9 to 5 is fun, including when the stars of the film, TV show, and musical deliver the messages: \"Don't put up with shit,\" Allison Janney says. \"Stand up for yourselves,\" says Rita Moreno. \"I'm not going to take it anymore!\" Jane Fonda cries. Dolly summed it up: \"It touched a nerve. It resonated with enough people that right out of the box it kept getting bigger and bigger.\"\n\nWhy does it resonate today?\n\nFar fewer women are actually still working 9-to-5 these days. Secretaries and administrative assistants were the top occupation for women by a mile in 1980, and the occupation is still overwhelmingly women - 95 percent. But it now comes in fourth after teachers, nurses, and health aides as the top occupations for women, according to the US Department of Labor Women's Bureau. More women may be working 7 AM to 3 PM, the evening shift, or have no fixed hours at all, while many office workers and professionals are on call long after the work day ends. But while the jobs and hours may have changed, the issues haven't gone away.\n\nIn 2019, I met with about fifty working women in Milwaukee, Chicago, and Washington, DC, to get their thoughts on a possible sequel to 9 to 5 . \"We're working more like 24-7, but I had to stand up and shout ten minutes into this film,\" a woman named Brenda told me. \"I couldn't believe how many of the problems are still with us.\"\n\n\"Childcare center? I feel like I have to hide the fact that I have kids,\" said Sheila. One woman captured the anger of the Lily Tomlin character: \"I have to swallow all the fury and frustration in order to just show up to the bullshit at work, because the bullshit pays the bills.\"\n\nSocial scientists confirm that the agenda is unfinished. The Harvard Business Review reports that, since the 1990s, the move toward workplace gender equality has slowed:\n\nSociologist Paula England has called this phenomenon an uneven and stalled gender revolution, and there have been dozens of studies showing how the progress in gender equality experienced during and immediately after the feminist movement of the 1970s has not been sustained.\n\nWith the pandemic, the problem is not just a stalled agenda but a major setback . And with a supermajority of conservative judges on the Supreme Court, we'll see the end of abortion rights and a likely erosion of workplace and civil rights for women and people of color.\n\nThis isn't the first time American women have had to start over. Louis Menand, in his book The Free World: Art and Thought in the Cold World , writes, \"By many measures, American women were worse off in 1963 than they had been in 1945 or even in 1920. In 1920, 20 percent of PhDs were awarded to women; in 1963, it was 11 percent. Forty-seven percent of college students were women in 1920; in 1963, 38 percent.\" Women were largely absent in professions and public life. And even the gender pay gap was greater in 1963 than it had been in 1951.\n\nIt took social movements in the 1960s and 70s to restore progress to women who had lost so much ground and leap forward. The success of 9 to 5 in 1980 captured that momentum and promised a future of positive change - a promise that, as Still Working 9 to 5 will remind you, still hasn't been fulfilled.\n\nKaren Nussbaum was a cofounder of the women's labor organization 9to5 and the founding director of Working America.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nFor today's feminists, labor militants, and socialists, the vision of feminist labor organizing that guided the women's white-collar organizing project 9to5 - and immortalized in the classic comedy 9 to 5 starring Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, and Dolly Parton - should still be our north star.\n\nArchival footage of women from the 9to5 Movement striking in the 1970s from the documentary 9to5: The Story of a Movement .\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIt's hard to imagine, but the zany 1980 fantasy-comedy film 9 to 5 , starring Dolly Parton, Jane Fonda, and Lily Tomlin, was initially going to be a drama. When Fonda took on the project of making a movie about the exploitation, harassment, abuse, and mistreatment women suffered in the workplace, she approached it with all the seriousness she thought the topic called for.\n\nFonda had been friends with Boston clerical worker and labor leader Karen Nussbaum for years, having met in the anti-Vietnam War movement, and Nussbaum kept her abreast of the state of things for women workers. It was dire: women faced rampant sexism in the office, were regularly passed over for job opportunities in favor of less-qualified male counterparts, often made half of men's salaries, and had little to no protections at work.\n\nIn response, Nussbaum, along with fellow Harvard office worker Ellen Cassedy, founded a Boston-based organization called 9to5 in 1972. Growing out of a local newsletter titled 9to5: Newsletter for Boston Area Office Workers , 9to5 brought women office workers together to organize for better conditions at work. They built a new model of organizing, somewhere between the labor and women's movements, harnessing the energy behind rising feminist struggles while also recognizing that women organizing as workers was essential and powerful.\n\n\"On the one hand, we were building a wing of the women's movement that was for working women, who didn't otherwise identify with the women's movement,\" Nussbaum told me in an interview. (You can read the interview in full here .) \"This was a way to expand the women's movement to a new group of women who otherwise weren't getting there. And we were bringing the women's movement into the labor movement. So we were trying to create a home for working women in the women's movement, and for women in the labor movement.\"\n\nTo accomplish this, 9to5 appealed to women workers through tactics full of humor and personal connection. They held mock contests, such as one for the \"pettiest office task,\" once awarded to a secretary who had to sew up the crotch of her boss's pants while he was still wearing them. They made up songs and funny slogans; one flyer featured an illustration of a stick of dynamite struck in a high-heel shoe and read \"women in insurance: an explosive situation.\" They \"pilloried these bosses by name,\" as Nussbaum puts it. \"We would take the press with us to go announce who the bad boss was that year.\"\n\n\"We did things that were fun because we wanted to have fun,\" Nussbaum says. \"It wasn't a tactic so much as we wanted to build the kind of organization we would want to join.\"\n\nThe tongue-in-cheek-ness lowered the barrier of entry for the white-collar workers 9to5 was organizing and made their message easier to deliver. Upon seeing this and understanding its appeal, Fonda quickly changed course: she would make an over-the-top comedy instead, a kind of movie-length narrative that channeled the spirit of the hilarious-yet-deadly-serious gags 9to5 was staging in the streets.\n\nFor the last four decades, that Hollywood film has been the principal cultural production tying us back to that lost labor history. Now, a new documentary, 9to5: The Story of a Movement , directed by Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar (directors of American Factory ), brings 9to5's history to us in full detail. The documentary offers a history of the kind of class-rooted feminist struggle that socialists should take up today.\n\n9to5 started by pressuring the state to enforce affirmative action and set new regulations against gender discrimination. Eventually, they began taking direct action against companies: in 1975, after discovering through a survey issued by 9to5 that Boston publishing companies were paying women significantly less than men, they issued a class-action lawsuit for gender and racial discrimination.\n\nIn Knocking on Labor's Door , labor historian Lane Windham , who provides historical commentary in the documentary, writes that \"companies were shocked by the lawsuits, which seemed to come out of the blue in an industry that was not unionized and was not used to any sort of worker collective action.\"\n\nEventually, the association affiliated with SEIU to form sister union Local 925 and later grew into a national association called 9to5: National Association of Working Women. By 1981, organizers had also formed SEIU District 925, representing office and clerical workers nationally. This dual-organization model allowed 9to5 to recruit women potentially wary of joining a union in a male-dominated labor movement.\n\nWindham posits, and Nussbaum agrees, that while 9to5 did not achieve their original goal of \"seeding\" the labor movement with militant women workers, they did transform women's treatment in the workplace. Years of organizing for better benefits, equal wages, and \"raises not roses\" (a reference to the office custom of giving roses to secretaries on their work anniversary), resulted not only in material wins for women workers, but also in a significant cultural shift in women's expectations for how they deserved to be treated at work.\n\nThe documentary cleverly juxtaposes 9to5's victories with scenes from television shows from the era, including one that shows a disgustingly lecherous male boss chasing his terrified secretary around a desk as a supposedly humorous gag.\n\nThose cultural shifts - basic respect for women workers on the job, ending scrutiny of women's bodies in the workplace, curbing the scourge of casual sexual harassment - were able to endure, Nussbaum told me, even though many of 9to5's economic wins were beaten back.\n\nCultural changes \"couldn't be resisted, because there was a lot of organizing behind them, but the economic changes were smashed, and economic power was gone after in a very serious way. The '70s saw the rise of the working women's movement and the rise of the union busting movement at the same time.\"\n\nThe Hollywood movie played a huge role in effecting this cultural shift. 9 to 5 follows the story of three office workers - Judy Bernly (a dowdy Jane Fonda in her Sunday best), Doralee Rhodes (Dolly Parton, in her big-screen debut), and Violet Newstead (Lily Tomlin, tough and pissed off as ever) - who kidnap their boss and take over the management of their office after a series of mishaps leads them to believe Violet is responsible for their boss's near-death.\n\nThe movie holds up, both because we're still suffering so much of the same bullshit at work, and because it's an absolute trip. It captures the common, horrendous sexist indignities of work, like how everyone in the office thinks Doralee is sleeping with the boss, at the same time that it shows the quick solidarity built when people decide to team up against their common enemy. In the scene that unleashes the real rising action of the film, Violet gets a joint from her son and invites Judy and Doralee to an \"old fashioned ladies' pot party.\"\n\nHigh off their asses, they each fantasize about what they'd do to Hart. Violet, dressed as Snow White and with the help of some little blue cartoon birds, puts poison in Hart's coffee, then pushes an incapacitated Hart out the office window. Wearing a shiny '80s cowgirl get-up, her hair a fluffy white pouf on top of her head, Doralee sits behind Hart's desk and flips the script on him: she tells him to turn around so she can \"check out his bod,\" orders him to \"take it off\" (\"it\" being his necktie), and then walks around the desk, right up to Hart, puts her hand behind his head, and presses it into her cleavage.\n\nWhen he tries to run away, she lassos him as an off-screen voice narrates the scene as though it were a real, live rodeo: \"Let's see how long it takes you to hog-tie this sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot.\" For her part, Judy catches Hart in his darkened office. Holding a rifle, ammo strips crossing her chest, her voice a cool, cooing octave lower than in the rest of the movie, she tells Hart: \"You're a wart on the nose of humanity, and I'm going to blast it off.\" She does.\n\nThe fantasy ends up coming true. When, after ending up in the hospital, Hart finds out (through office manager and class traitor Roz) that Violet had accidentally put rat poison in his coffee, our three heroines have no choice but to kidnap him to shut him up. Doralee hog-ties him in his office with a phone cord. When he tries to get away, Judy shoots him with a small pistol she finds in Doralee's purse.\n\nThe three get a taste of revenge - and they want more. When they learn Hart has been committing fraud, they set out to find hard documents to prove it, and buy themselves time by setting up a complex contraption to keep Hart in his room that involves a motorized garage door opener and a leather dog collar. It's a BDSM fantasy with all of the sadism and none of the sex.\n\nIn Hart's absence (during which no one misses him; in fact, no one seems to know what he had done all day), the trio takes over the workplace. Of course, they know the ins and outs of the office, know exactly what each worker needs and how to make it happen. They institute flexible schedules and job-sharing, which allow women with children to work and be able to spend time with their kids. They repaint the office lockers from a drab gray to a cheery yellow and give everyone raises.\n\nEventually, the boss comes back and tries to take credit for the changes but cannot. After years of getting passed over in favor of men she trained herself, Violet is finally promoted.\n\nWe're meant to see that as a victory, and in 1980, when the film came out, it was. Few women could have dreamed of such professional success before. But the opportunities for ascension by women in the workplace since second-wave feminism lay bare the progress made by the feminist movement and its limitations: now we are liberated to be exploited by women bosses.\n\nOf course, feminist and labor organizers in the 1970s and '80s faced giant obstacles in the face of a newly vicious attack on workers by the rich, and anti-communism amid the Cold War. They made a wager: go for what's winnable, bring in as many people as possible, build the movements, and make change.\n\nMeanwhile, the bosses made wagers, too: if they let enough educated women into the higher echelons of the workforce, gave them access to good jobs and better pay, that they could take enough steam out of the organizing women were doing in the labor movement to neutralize it.\n\n\"There was all this pressure on employers, as well as lawsuits and demands for unionization,\" Nussbaum tells me.\n\nBy 1980, employers decided they would use a safety valve. They decide to give on the issues of promotions and letting women in on the good jobs. So women, particularly white, middle-class and upper-middle-class women, over the next decade or two become managers and professionals. They split the workforce. They split the college-educated women, give them opportunities and shut them up, and downgrade work for the rest, for working-class women.\n\nThis split remains today. The break-through-the-glass-ceiling feminism of the 80s and 90s that got Violet her promotion made wins for some women and left others in the same, or worse, shape than before. The vestiges of this remain with us today in the form of boss-bitch feminism: the exaltation of women CEOs, the calls to \"lean in\" to get ahead at work, the insistence that you can \"do it all,\" on your own, without a man, without anyone, in fact. It's a feminism that's both gender-essentialist, in its reinforcing of men and women as two competing and intractable categories, and anti-solidaristic.\n\nWhile working-class women got stuck with low wages, bad benefits, and less collective power, the women who were able to break through to the better jobs became, as Nussbaum puts it, \"individually self-reliant but collectively powerless.\"\n\nStill, 9to5 was able to make huge gains for women in the workplace. The Reichert and Bognar documentary makes that clear, showing how women who had never organized before were able to find their voice and power through collective action. Verna Barksdale, a 9to5 organizer in Atlanta, describes the tasks of the organization as \"not only fighting for employee rights, but having women develop themselves.\"\n\nThrough this investment, and through their fight for material improvements in the workplace, 9to5 was able to bring an end to the humiliating and degrading conditions that had marked women's working lives for decades. No longer did they have to simultaneously be doting mother, caring daughter, and sexualized plaything for their bosses just to eke out a living. Those changes have lasted until today. But their work remains incomplete. When Cassedy and Nussbaum started 9to5, they had a vision for a \"big, national mass-based organization\" that would bridge racial differences and espouse the values of the feminist movement while flexing the power of organized labor. For today's new generation of feminists, labor militants, and socialists, that vision should still be our north star.\n\nMarianela D'Aprile is a writer in Chicago.

But she should've been a major star when she was a young woman. Hollywood's misogyny in the 1960s and '70s made that impossible.\n\nJessica Walter on September 9, 2017 in Los Angeles, California. (Jason LaVeris / FilmMagic)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWith the announcement of Jessica Walter's death at age eighty, I cursed aloud with an angry sense of being cheated. Walter got to be a star very late in a long career, with her definitive roles as Lucille Bluth in the late, lamented Arrested Development and Malory Archer in the still-running animated favorite Archer. It seemed like just another egregious act of a douchebag god that she couldn't live to be a hundred, acting the hell out of incorrigible characters for another twenty years.\n\nPerhaps it's my own tendency toward resentment of authority, but I find it odd to read celebrations of how great it is that Walter got to have a career spanning decades, as if it sure was nice of showbiz bosses to keep handing her roles that long.\n\nIn fact, Walter was robbed. She should've been a major star when she was a young woman - she was gorgeous, she was insanely talented and charismatic, she had everything. Stardom was predicted for her early when she made a big impression in film - first in The Group (1966) and then more definitely in Play Misty for Me (1971). But it didn't happen.\n\nShe worked consistently, combining theater, movies, and television. But it was a tough time to try to become a female star, a time of second-wave feminist advancement that led to a spike of ugly misogyny in Hollywood movies.\n\nThere were a limited number of good roles that went to a few top women stars like Jane Fonda, Vanessa Redgrave, Diane Keaton, Julie Christie, and Faye Dunaway. That left a lot of vacuous girlfriend parts for the rest, a lot of getting alternately slapped and screwed by righteous macho guys in the new action film genre on the rise, a lot of favoring of far more numerous male stars such as Clint Eastwood, Burt Reynolds, Warren Beatty, Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Sidney Poitier, Donald Sutherland, Harrison Ford, Charles Bronson, Jack Nicholson, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Lee Marvin, Dustin Hoffman, Woody Allen, Richard Pryor, and Walter Matthau, in film vehicles built to showcase them.\n\nWalter didn't even get the \"girlfriend\" parts she tried for, as she remembered with justifiable pride :\n\n\". . . even my 'leading ladies' - you know, in air quotes - were characters ,\" she says. \"They were not Miss Vanilla Ice Cream. They weren't holding the horse while John Wayne galloped into the sunset.\" She adds: \"I was actually up for a John Wayne movie once. This was way, way back. And the feedback was, 'We really like Jessica, but we just don't see her holding the horse.'\"\n\nBeautiful though Walter was, she was going to have a hard time getting ahead then, with her gimlet eyes and sardonic mouth. But those same qualities made her perfect for our time. And luckily, too, she relished playing what are blandly called \"unsympathetic characters\":\n\n\"I love watching movies with people that I hate. I love those old movies with Bette Davis where she's the evil one,\" she told IndieWire in 2013.\n\n\"Because we all have that in us, and we can't really act on it as the audience, but we can watch the actor act on it and it sort of releases those feelings in us.\"\n\nOur love for her has been expressed in a million quotes circulating endlessly online, all of them expressing the most inventively vicious sentiments of two self-centered, upper-class, right-wing mothers from Hell. Here are a few of my particular favorites:\n\nMALORY ARCHER (to a limo driver who's too slow driving off): \"If I wanted to sit around all day going nowhere, I'd be a teacher!\"\n\nLUCILLE BLUTH (regarding a boatload of gay protesters): \"Everything they do is so dramatic and flamboyant, it just makes me want to SET MYSELF ON FIRE!\"\n\nMALORY ARCHER: \"Immigrants! That's how they do, you know - just drive around listening to raps and shooting all the jobs.\"\n\nLUCILLE BLUTH (regarding her daughter): \"She thinks I'm too critical. That's another fault of hers.\"\n\nMALORY ARCHER (on the personal life of her spy son Sterling): \"My third biggest fear: he brings home a whore and says, 'We're married!' Oh, and the whore has bangs.\"\n\nGreat as she was - and I defy anyone to find a bolder, better comic actor than Walter in Arrested Development and Archer - public love for her went beyond just admiring her whiplash timing, incisive line delivery, and willingness to go for the laugh with her whole mobile face, her whole melodic voice, her whole still-lithe body. She's one of us, we thought, and we don't think that about many stars.\n\nI read a comment in the outpouring of emotion that followed her death that stated firmly, \"She's a comrade,\" and I went off on a hunt to discover her literal politics, which turned out to be hard to verify. Somewhere to the left, clearly, but her mensch qualities shone off her regardless. She displayed such sane, good-natured humor in interviews, and she never pranced about her impressive background.\n\nReading up on her, you discover she's the Brooklyn-born daughter of David Warshawsky, whose parents emigrated from Russia. He changed his name to Walter and became \"a world-class musician who played with the renowned composer Arturo Toscanini and alongside cellist Pablo Casals,\" while earning his living playing double bass for the NBC Symphony .\n\nWalter's mother Esther Groisser\n\narrived from the USSR shortly before the enactment of a 1924 law that set immigration quotas that largely curtailed the arrival of Jewish immigrants. \"So you can imagine all the stuff going on with immigration now has a great impact on me,\" says Walter.\n\nYoung Jessica Walter had early acting ambitions, attending New York's High School of Performing Arts and Sanford Meisner's Neighborhood Playhouse School of Theater. She was one of those real-deal performers, highly trained, vastly experienced in and philosophical about the only-in-showbiz lunacy of acting professionally.\n\nGiven her overall lovability, it came as a huge shock to the public to find, in a lengthy 2018 New York Times interview with the Arrested Development cast, that she'd been treated badly by her castmates.\n\nJeffrey Tambor, already accused of sexual misconduct on the set of Transparent and fired because of it, denied the allegations.\n\nBut he acknowledged a history of tirades at directors, assistants, and fellow cast and crew members, including the time that he \"blew up\" at Jessica Walter to such a vitriolic extent on the set of Arrested Development , she wept recalling it:\n\n\"I have to let go of being angry at him,\" Ms. Walter said through tears, as Mr. Tambor sat a few feet away. In \"almost 60 years of working, I've never had anybody yell at me like that on a set and it's hard to deal with, but I'm over it now.\"\n\nWhen [costar Jason Bateman] painted Mr. Tambor's behavior as typical of certain performers, [costar Alia Shawkat] interjected: \"But that doesn't mean it's acceptable.\"\n\nIt seemed notable that while Tambor insisted he'd already apologized profusely and \"had reckoned with this,\" the other male costars including Bateman, Will Arnett, Tony Hale, and David Cross attempted to smooth over any disharmony and express support for Tambor. Only Shawkat - and the general public - wasn't having it, and the online fury in response to the interview led Bateman and Cross to apologize for their failure to defend her.\n\nHow did they not all rise as one and kick Tambor's ass clear to the curb? I don't get it. But it's telling that we all wished we'd been there - so we could have defended Jessica Walter properly.\n\nEileen Jones is a film critic at Jacobin and author of Filmsuck, USA .

We plan for everything. We insure our cars, our homes. We even insure our lives. But we don't give a thought to our final years.\"\n\n-Jeanne, a character in the French film, All Together\n\nDepending on who you ask or what you read, aging and retirement are the best things that could ever happen to you (considering the alternatives) or an over-hyped stage of life that's actually filled with social isolation, economic insecurity, and mounting health problems. These bipolar depictions are both reflected in the burgeoning popular literature about how to navigate the \"new old age\" - that period of life 78 million US Baby Boomers just began to enter, with varying degrees of enthusiasm or trepidation.\n\nGiven this huge demographic, it's not surprising that more movies now focus on the tribulations of the old. They include the moving, but terminally grim, Amour , its more uplifting French cousin, All Together , and a charming UK import (by way of India), The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel . Although none of these films are set in the US, they explore, very accurately, many of the same social, economic, and health care dilemmas facing millions of people in our country, due to increased longevity.\n\nWhen the Oscar-nominated Amour opened near Berkeley, we joined a privileged slice of our generational cohort to find out what might be in store for us, several decades down the road. Statistically speaking, of course, not everyone currently in their sixties will still be collecting Social Security checks twenty years from now, even if they're white, affluent, and feeling rather chipper today. For anyone counting on being alive and kicking in their seventies, eighties, or beyond, director Michael Haneke's film is quite the reality check. In fact, it's what used to be called, in the Sixties',  \"a real bummer.\"\n\nAmour is the twilight tale of a long-married French couple, Georges and Anne, a retired teacher of concert pianists. He is played by 82-year old Jean-Louis Trintignant and she by 85-year old Emmanuelle Riva. (Riva is the oldest Academy Award nominee for best actress in a leading role and deserves to win on February 24.)\n\nGeorges and Anne are \"aging in place,\" but not gracefully. They haven't moved into a retirement community or long-term care facility, of the US or even French type. They have a distant relationship with their off-spring, who live or work much of the time abroad. They seem to have no close friends. So their social contact is limited to the concierge in their building, his helpful wife, and infrequent visitors, like their self-absorbed daughter or a successful former student of Anne's. As Anne becomes disabled by a series of strokes, their gloomy, high-ceilinged apartment becomes their own private geriatric ghetto.\n\nTheir life first takes this turn for the worse in a fashion familiar to many people over-65, who have the misfortune of being hospitalized and then discharged in worse shape than before. Failed surgery on a blocked carotid artery leaves Anne partially paralyzed. She is unable to walk, take a shower, get out of bed, or go to the bathroom by herself. After suffering a further stroke at home, she becomes totally bed-ridden, incoherent, incontinent, and dependent on the use of adult diapers. In one of her remaining moments of lucidity, Anne makes it clear to Georges that she does not wish to be hospitalized again, under any circumstances. Even after she has lost the ability to speak, she tries to communicate her \"end of life\" decision-making by refusing food and water.\n\nLike many real-life spousal caregivers, Georges struggles with the physical and emotional burdens of round-the-clock care. Money for home health aides, who eventually become necessary, appears to be no object; but \"good help\" in that field can be hard to find. As played by Trintignant, the exhausted Georges is both tender and impatient, loving and uncomprehending. Faced with the prospect of even greater loneliness as a widower, he has trouble coming to grips with Anne's desire to die in peace, rather than live disabled, disoriented, and in physical pain. How he resolves that matter is less than ideal.\n\nDirected by Stephane Robelin, All Together affects the light-hearted air of a French farce, a far cry from Amour . This apparently irked New York Times critic Stephen Holden when the film opened briefly in New York last fall, so he proclaimed it to be less \"truthful about those final years\" than Haneke's \"heartbreaking masterpiece.\"\n\nAll Together can now be found on Netflix but, in truth, it has no shortage of its own age-related disability, disease, and death. These afflictions take their toll in a livelier set of French seniors, who are cher amis . The main characters include two married couples - Annie and Jean, Albert and Jeanne - plus their longtime bachelor friend, Claude. All have socialized together for years as part of the same comfortably bourgeois circle, with a shared interest in food, wine, politics, and ideas.\n\nIn one of the film's early scenes, the police break up a Paris street protest led by an over-wrought Jean, still wielding a bullhorn like a young left-wing agitator. We learn that he and his fellow retirees are all veterans of campus activism long ago. Fittingly enough for a film with characters so inspired and a smooth French-speaking performance by Jane Fonda, a real-life Sixties' radical, All Together conveys an important message: namely, that a sad, hermetic existence is not the only option for the old. Instead, these Gallic soixante-huitards set out to prove (not for the first time) that \"another world is possible.\"\n\nWhat triggers their late-in-life social experimentation is the hospitalization of 75-year old Claude.  He is an aging lothario once linked romantically to both Annie and Jeanne, unbeknownst to each other or their current spouses. Stricken with a heart attack, he lands in a French rehab facility that looks pretty nice by US standards. Yet, when his friends come to see Claude, they share his dismay at the condition of other elderly patients. \"This place is full of fossils,\" one visitor says. \"I'm not letting an old friend croak in this hole,\" another declares.\n\nOn the spot, they decide to liberate Claude from the company of the palsied, demented, and wheelchair bound. They spirit him out of his chateau-like nursing home and move in together, at Annie and Jean's many-roomed house, with a big garden in back. \"Going hippy,\" as Annie calls it, is not without inter-personal problems and tensions. Jeanne, the retired philosophy professor played by Fonda, has terminal cancer, a condition she attempts to conceal from her husband.  Albert's worsening memory loss (and resulting absentmindedness around running water) leads to a damaging flood. To help them all cope, the communards hire younger live-in help, including a German graduate student who is studying the treatment of the elderly in different societies and becomes their in-house ethnographer.\n\nThe backyard is soon dug up and a pool installed, a move long resisted by the politically puritanical Jean. The expanded household is rewarded with the laughter and play of visiting grandchildren. When Jeanne dies in her new home, with her friends around her, Albert soon forgets that she has expired. He panics at the thought that she may have just become lost and tries to search for her. The now multi-generational intentional community rallies around him, in a touching display of solidarity. Aging in place, in collective fashion, looks a lot better than the institutionalized care that Claude narrowly escaped from or the lonely fate of Anne and Georges in Amour .\n\nThe British expatriates thrown together more randomly in Best Exotic Marigold Hotel are played by an ensemble cast better-known to American audiences than Fonda's fellow actors in All Together .  Directed by John Madden, the film features Dames Judi Dench and Maggie Smith (both age 78), Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, and Dev Patel, the 23-year old Anglo-Indian actor who played Jamal, the upwardly mobile prize-show contestant in Slumdog Millionaire . Like Holden in the Times criticizing All Together , Boston reviewer Allen Stone dismissed Madden's work as \"a fairy tale for old people - an anodyne against the cruel reality.\"\n\nIn fact, the film unfolds against a very realistic backdrop of economic crisis, the fiscal squeeze on pensions, dwindling personal retirement savings, and what Patel's character, Sonny, calls the \"out sourcing of aging,\" a trend that has sent more than a million Americans abroad, to places where their fixed incomes can go further.\n\nThe disparate retirees who land in Jaipur have, with one exception, never set foot in India before, so the culture shock is extreme. They include a quarrelsome married couple just fleeced out of their retirement nest egg. (Nighy plays the harried husband who decides to stay behind when his spouse evacuates to England). Other Marigold guests are divorced, never-married, or recently widowed singles with their own personal and financial baggage or romantic agendas. Among them is a closeted gay judge, now retired from the bench (played by Wilkinson), a middle-class widow (Dench), whose recently deceased husband left her unexpectedly penniless, and a newly laid off household servant for the rich (Smith), who has been unhappily dispatched to India for an outsourced hip replacement, to avoid waiting in line at the National Health Service.\n\nAll are unsettled to discover that the retirement paradise advertised, on-line, by Marigold's hyper-kinetic young manager (Patel) is more of a shambles than a jewel of the Raj. Fortunately, their humid, dumpy quarters are right in the middle of Jaipur's teeming, colorful street life, to which the new residents react in varying ways. Wilkinson's character is briefly re-united with his one-time Indian lover, now a middle-aged married man; he soon expires, peacefully and happily, of heart failure in a Marigold Hotel easy chair.\n\nSmith's bitter and distrustful former maid overcomes her racism, bonds unexpectedly with a family of Dalit \"untouchables,\" and rebounds from surgery to become Sonny's much-needed bookkeeper. Like millions of real-life seniors also forced back to work to support themselves, Dench's character snags a part-time job in a local call center. There, she coaches young Indian telemarketers on how to communicate better with cranky old UK-based customers like the one she used to be.\n\nOut of their individual and collective struggle to find a place for themselves as strangers in a strange land, the guests of the Marigold - or those who don't die or defect - manage to forge a new sense of community. They work together to rescue their residential hotel from impending bankruptcy.  The down-market Marigold gets a big makeover and becomes, in the words of their host, Sonny, \"a home for the elderly so wonderful they will refuse to die.\"\n\nNow, cynical reviewers may continue to object that the happier endings of All Together and The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel are simply not \"real,\" (a legitimate point since neither is a documentary). Yet both films do accurately reflect the aspirations of many older Americans - particularly those influenced by the politics and counter-culture of the Sixties. They are wary of traditional long-term care arrangements, at home or in an institutional setting. And they sure don't want their own life to become a sad, impoverished replay of Amour , if that can be avoided.\n\nSo, instead, many US Baby Boomers, at all income levels, are engaged today in an urgent quest for alternative forms of old age living. These range from cross-generational cohousing projects to natural occurring retirement communities (or NORCs), where neighbors help each other out, to \"life care\" facilities located on or near college campuses to new retirement villages organized around shared politics, musical tastes, or sexual identity. And then, of course, there's the Marigold Hotel option in the form of lively, multi-cultural retiree colonies like San Miguel de Allende in Mexico and its counterparts in Costa Rica, Belize, and elsewhere.\n\nDespite its rich and very relevant social content, the current crop of international films on aging may prove to be a mixed blessing. Given the copycat instincts of Hollywood, more Americanized remakes of Marigold or Amour may soon be slated for production. And if The Bucket List or Stand Up Guys - the new buddy film about the last hurrah of three old gangsters - is any indication, they are likely to be pretty awful. Meanwhile, the humor, pathos, and communitarian striving so well captured in All Together and Best Exotic Marigold Hotel will continue to play out in real life, here and abroad, where it really counts after all.\n\nSteve Early is a longtime union activist and author of four books about labor or politics.

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nKaren Nussbaum was a cofounder of the pioneering labor-feminist organization 9to5. In an interview with Jacobin , she discusses why working women in the 1970s needed to organize as workers, 9to5's hilarious tactics, and why \"individually self-reliant but collectively powerless\" women workers today still need to organize on the job.\n\nArchival footage of women workers organizing in the '70s from the documentary 9to5: The Story of a Movement .\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nAmid the fevered political upsurges of the late 1960s and early '70s, a group of women office workers in Boston founded an organization called 9to5. One of these women was Karen Nussbaum. A self-described political radical, Nussbaum, along with coworker Ellen Cassedy, saw an opportunity to harness the energy of the growing women's movement and combine it with the power of organized labor to create something new, an organization that would make homes for working women in the women's movement and women in the labor movement.\n\nFor almost four decades, the comedy starring Dolly Parton, Jane Fonda, and Lily Tomlin has served as the primary cultural artifact tying us to this history. A new documentary, directed by Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar, changes that. 9to5: The Story of a Movement features footage from the peak of 9to5's activities combined with contemporary interviews with 9to5 organizers and captures the hopeful and militant energy that drove their labor activism.\n\nJacobin contributor Marianela D'Aprile spoke with Nussbaum about the documentary, the 9to5 Movement , and the state of organized labor today.\n\nI was struck by something you said in the documentary: \"I was not interested in going to college at all; I just wanted to be a political activist - that was more interesting to me.\" Was that a product of the political moment at the time, when everything was so volatile and political activity was in the air? That was not the case when I was eighteen - at eighteen, I would've never dreamed of thinking or saying something like that. What was it like to be in such a politicized moment and make that kind of a decision at such a young age?\n\nI turned eighteen in 1968. Revolution was in the air. I entered college in 1968, and I remember seeing a study that said that one million college students thought of themselves as revolutionaries. To me, college was the opportunity to find my way into political relevance. That year, you had assassinations; you had the Paris uprising ; you had the Black uprising in our country. Everything was on fire. There were paths for everybody.\n\nSo there was this political moment, but then there were also the economic conditions. It was possible to have four roommates, and find an apartment to live in, and only two of you needed to be working at paying jobs. It was financially possible to be independent. And I didn't think it was necessary to have a college education. I dropped out of school, but I audited classes; I was interested in thought, but I didn't think you necessarily had to do that through college. In terms of getting the credentials, because it was such a fevered and fulsome time, you didn't worry that much about your future. It was a very different time. I consider myself really lucky to have come of age right at that moment.\n\nWere you one of those one million college students? Did you think of yourself as a revolutionary?\n\nNot at eighteen, but by nineteen I did.\n\nWhat caused that change?\n\nFor one thing, I went to Cuba with the Venceremos Brigade. When I was nineteen, I went on the second Venceremos Brigade. It was a fantastic experience to be a part of this new socialist country, to be removed from my own country and see things in a different light. So it was a process of becoming a full-time activist, having this remarkable experience, and coming to the understanding of what it meant to be a radical. I learned that I didn't have to only think about how to deal with the consequences of our problems, which was exhausting, but instead to think about the cause of our problems, which was exhilarating.\n\nDid other people around you share that same sense of exhilaration and being able to name and identify the causes of the problems?\n\nYes and no. When I was in high school, I was very attuned to injustice, and the only path I could see [to confronting it] was becoming a social worker. But then I thought, how do you spend enough hours in the day to solve all the problems that are out there? By the time I understood you could deal with root problems instead of consequences, that almost gave me a sense of relief. It was a feeling that your energy could be directed in a way that would have a profound effect, as opposed to a palliative effect. That was an overarching perspective which I shared with friends who were also political radicals.\n\nBut I also believed from an early stage that you needed mass-based institutions to make change. You could do that through churches - those are mass-based institutions - but I wasn't religious, so that wasn't a path for me. Or you could do it through politics, but the party structure wasn't very appealing to me, either. Or you could do it through unions, which was the other mass-based institution.\n\nBut to do that work effectively, you have to have a very open approach to people who aren't the least bit like you, who don't share your perspective at all, who wouldn't know a radical from a reformer. That's the key to building a strong, democratic organization: not having that litmus test for entry, and instead being able to build organizations that people want to join, and through that experience, change.\n\n9to5 famously used humor to bring people in. In the documentary, I saw a clip of a TV show, where the boss himself, who had been named the worst boss in the city, was participating in his own roast! How did you all pull that off?\n\nWe did things that were fun because we wanted to have fun. It wasn't a tactic so much as we wanted to build the kind of organization we would want to join. For us that meant making up funny songs, doing skits about bad bosses, having the bad boss contest every year. It wasn't a strategy so much as it was building a culture that reflected who we were and that would be appealing to other working women.\n\nWe pilloried these bosses by name. We would take the press with us to go announce who the bad boss was that year. Partly it was because we didn't have a lawyer, and we didn't have any assets! We didn't know that we shouldn't be doing it or that we should be worried. I later tried to do that through the AFL-CIO, and simply couldn't.\n\nThe best part of this is that the times were so different then that the employers were not ashamed of what they were doing. They were not ashamed that they had had a free ride.\n\nIn the documentary, you see this boss who sends his secretary to the bar and tells her to page him when she finds a woman who meets his specifications. They are on television, and he's not worried about that, he owns up to it right here on TV! And he puts his arm around the woman! It was a sense of entitlement that they had. It was the bad boss contest and other actions like that that over time made it unacceptable to, if not behave that way, at least admit that you were behaving that way. It was those kinds of actions that changed the notion of what was acceptable behavior.\n\nLabor militancy and feminism in 9to5 were so organically tied to each other - it seems like you were inventing a new kind of labor feminism. Is that how you all thought about it?\n\nWe thought about how we could succeed in bringing women into our organization and our movement. That meant you didn't talk about it as being \"feminist,\" because most women didn't identify as feminists. Women would say \"I'm no women's libber, but... I don't like the way I am being treated by the boss.\"\n\nWe never made that an entry hurdle; we never called ourselves a feminist organization. We didn't use the word \"organize,\" even, for the first few years, because women didn't know what we were talking about! \"You mean, organize your closet?\" There was a language that didn't compute with most working women. I always thought you shouldn't make words the enemy of your ideas. So we always started with the ideas and made those available and brought people into action, and it was action which then changed how people thought of themselves and who they could identify with.\n\nWe made those decisions because it was the best way to organize successfully. But we were also clear about what we were trying to do as a strategy. On the one hand, we were building a wing of the women's movement that was for working women, who didn't otherwise identify with the women's movement. This was a way to expand the women's movement to a new group of women who otherwise weren't getting there.\n\nOn the other hand, we were bringing the women's movement into the labor movement. So we were operating to create a home for working women in the women's movement, and for women in the labor movement. We wanted to build up a power base and a project that would meet the needs of these new constituencies in these different movements.\n\nHow did you all come up with that vision?\n\nWe first started organizing 9to5 because we were working as clerical workers. I was a radical and an activist in the antiwar movement and in the women's movement, and I came to realize that I could bring this organizing into my job, and then I started to think more about the potential for the labor movement.\n\nIn 1971 for May Day, I was in DC, and there was a side demonstration chanting: \"What are the unions for?! General strike to end the war!\" I thought, \"huh, that's a good idea.\" That showed how cut off I was from labor history and knowledge of labor unions, but that's what was going on at the time: unions were not where a lot of the political fervor was taking place.\n\nBut this notion that the power of labor unions as democratic, mass-based organizations that bridged racial and class differences became important to me and others. That, combined with the momentum of the women's movement and how it was bypassing lots of working women, presented the opportunity to bring the ideas to the women's movement and make them accessible and actionable to working women.\n\nWhat were you all reading at the time?\n\nWe were reading Monthly Review, Harry Braverman, Paul Sweezy. We were more interested in the labor theory side than the feminist theory side, to tell you the truth, just from my perspective. But it was all out there. There was also this huge underground newspaper culture, stuff being written all over the place, and you could consume it endlessly. There was a culture of thousands of small orgs popping up for anything. I lived in Boston at the time, and there were a thousand orgs, and I was in half a dozen of them.\n\nThere was this idea at the time that if you had a problem or interest, you could find five other people and start a group about it. Responding to things as a group was so much more available in the '60s and' 70s, and got driven out of our culture in the decades after.\n\nNow, after forty or fifty years, we have women who are individually self-reliant, in a way that we would've never seen in the '70s, but collectively powerless. Over the years, I would ask women: \"What do you do if you've got a problem on the job?\" In the '70s women would say, \"I could call 9to5, or the National Organization for Women, or the mayor's office.\" There were institutional responses. Over the decades, the response got narrower and narrower: \"I could talk to a coworker.\" After that it became, \"I could talk to my mother.\" By the 2000s, women were saying, \"I don't talk to anybody. I pray to God or rely on myself.\"\n\nWomen now can \"do it all,\" as individuals, and have much worse working conditions. Certainly working families have been pushed way back economically. And the prospects look even more grim than they did in the 1970s.\n\nWomen today have been fed a completely erroneous idea about what being independent means, that we have to shoulder every burden on our own. That's not how I want to live. So the idea that we are \"individually self-reliant but collectively powerless\" is very resonant for me.\n\nI just rewatched the Dolly Parton/Jane Fonda movie , and it was shocking to me how relevant it still is. We still have all of the same problems that they were dealing with, except the culture has really changed. Sexual harassment is certainly taken more seriously, and almost no one would dare call a woman office worker a \"girl.\"\n\nThose changes happened because groups like 9to5 were waging these labor fights. The culture wouldn't have changed on its own.\n\nIn the '70s, there was huge organizing going on among working women. There was 9to5, and there was also Stewardesses for Women's Rights, coal mining women in an organization called the Coal Employment Project, Women of Steel, and even an organization for sex workers called COYOTE (Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics).\n\nAll of this going on, responding to the characteristics of each industry, where women are building the organizations themselves with their own expression of their demands for women's quality. There is all this pressure on employers, as well as lawsuits and demands for unionization.\n\nBy 1980, employers decided they would use a safety valve. They decide to give on the issues of promotions and letting women in on the good jobs. So women, particularly white, middle-class and upper-middle-class women, over the next decade or two become managers and professionals. They split the workforce. They split the college-educated women, gave them opportunities and shut them up, and downgraded work for the rest of us, for working-class women.\n\nAll of that was part of the strategy to compete globally not on the high road but on the low road - not with a highly educated, highly productive workforce, but with a low-wage workforce. So big corporations restructured the workforce between 1975 and 1990. Part of that was destroying the unions, which started in 1981 with PATCO. The week of the PATCO lockout was the week we announced the union [SEIU District 925] was going national. It was the worst timing imaginable.\n\nThe '70s were a period of huge momentum, which smacked right up against a reversal on the part of big corporations. They changed their strategy, and they were serious about taking away worker power. That's why I think what you see are the cultural changes. Those couldn't be resisted, because so much organizing was behind it. But workers' economic power was smashed. The '70s saw the rise of the working women's movement and the rise of the union-busting movement at the same time.\n\nIf you wanted to make changes on a broad scale, change laws, change standards, learn new skills, you joined 9to5, but if you wanted to change your workplace, you joined the union.\n\n9to5 started as a local association and then a local union, and then the local organization went national and so did the union. What motivated the preservation of the two distinct organizations at the local and the national level? It seems like a way to make it as inclusive as possible and able to capture as many women who were working and interested in organizing.\n\nThat was the motivation! We understood that 9to5 the association had this very broad appeal, and any woman who was even just irritated could find a way to understand her role in society in a new way. But to consolidate change, you needed the power of a union. By having sister organizations, we were just being very up-front about it.\n\nIf you wanted to make changes on a broad scale, change laws, change standards, learn new skills, you joined 9to5, but if you wanted to change your workplace, you joined the union. It made complete sense, and it really worked that way, too. Women who came into 9to5 the association understood their own power in a new way and became interested in organizing in their workplaces, so they did move down that path in many cases.\n\nI am curious to know about the later years of the organization and the union, how things evolved through the '90s in this new, bleaker terrain for workers. What do you make of our current political moment, specifically as it relates to the labor movement?\n\nBoth organizations still exist today, but neither fulfilled the ambitions that we had in the 1970s of being big, national mass-based organizations that could operate on that kind of scale. The association over time became an organization that doesn't focus on office workers but low-wage women workers overall. It continues to do wonderful work in leadership development and working on issues like paid family leave and equal pay. The union, which once operated nationally, now operates as SEIU Local 925 in Seattle as a local with thirty thousand members.\n\nThere was this momentum in the '70s where we didn't understand what we were running into, which was both the consolidation of corporate control over the economy and politics on the one hand, and the consolidation of a new right wing that had started with Nixon. The right-wing backlash changed America, and we're still seeing the consequences of it today.\n\nI think the 2020s are very similar to the 1970s, in that it's a period of rupture. In both the '70s and the '20s, you have political upheaval, economic upheaval, and social upheaval. The task is to not repeat the 1980s, to make this decade one where we push through, consolidate the public opinion that we need. I think we're in a much better position for that, to make this a period of profound change, not just a respite.\n\nWho do you think has to be on the front lines of that?\n\nWe're already seeing a lot of action: BLM, the #MeToo movement, youth organizing around climate, and the growing understanding of climate as an important issue throughout society. It's not a middle-class issue anymore; it's an issue that working-class people feel affects them deeply. All of that is going on, but to build a significant counter to corporate power, you need worker power. You have to have mass-based, democratic, self-sufficient organizations.\n\nThe workers' revolution won't be funded by Jeff Bezos. We have to have self-sufficient, democratic organizations of working people in order to really change the economy and make it an economic democracy. That means unions. It's a wonderful time to be organizing unions. It's a really exciting moment. If you aren't doing union organizing right now, then jump right in.\n\nKaren Nussbaum was a cofounder of the women's labor organization 9to5 and the founding director of Working America.\n\nMarianela D'Aprile is a writer in Chicago.

Activate your online access\n\nElecting Kamala Harris and then pushing her to deliver is the only chance for climate survival, says the Hollywood actress and activist.\n\nJane Fonda speaks at the CCNow Newsmaker Interview.\n\nYoung people's understandable unhappiness with the Biden administration's record on oil and gas drilling and the war in Gaza should not deter them from voting to block Donald Trump from again becoming president of the United States, the Hollywood actress and activist Jane Fonda has warned.\n\n\"I understand why young people are really angry, and really hurting,\" Fonda said. \"What I want to say to them is, 'Do not sit this election out, no matter how angry you are. Do not vote for a third party, no matter how angry you are. Because that will elect somebody who will deny you any voice in the future of the United States.... If you really care about Gaza, vote to have a voice, so you can do something about it. And then, be ready to turn out into the streets, in the millions, and fight for it.'\"\n\nFonda's remarks came in a wide-ranging interview organized by the global media collaborative Covering Climate Now and conducted by The Guardian , CBS News, and Rolling Stone magazine.\n\nMaking major social change requires massive, nonviolent street protests as well as shrewd electoral organizing, Fonda argued. Drawing on more than 50 years of activism, from her anti-Vietnam War and anti-nuclear protests in the 1970s to later agitating for economic democracy, women's rights, and, today, for climate action , Fonda said that \"History shows us that...you need millions of people in the streets, but you [also] need people in the halls of power with ears and a heart to hear the protests, to hear the demands.\"\n\nDuring the Great Depression, she said, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt agreed with helping the masses of unemployed. But FDR said the public had to \"make him do it,\" or he could not overcome resistance from the status quo. \"There is a chance for us to make them do it if it's Kamala Harris and Tim Walz [in the White House],\" she said. \"There is no chance if Trump and Vance win this election.\"\n\nScientists have repeatedly warned that greenhouse gas emissions must be cut by half by the next decade , Fonda noted, so a President Harris would have to be pushed \"to stop drilling, and fracking, and mining. No new development of fossil fuels.\" Trump, on the other hand, has promised to \"'drill, baby, drill.' For once, let's believe him. The choice is very clear: Do we vote for the future, or do we vote for burning up the planet?\"\n\nFonda launched the Jane Fonda Climate political action committee three years ago to elect \"climate champions\" at all levels of government-national, state, and local. \"The PAC focuses downballot-on mayors, state legislators, county councils,\" she said. \"It's incredible how much effect people in these positions can have on climate issues.\"\n\nForty-two of the 60 candidates the PAC endorsed in 2022 won their races. In 2024, the PAC is providing money, voter outreach, and publicity to more than 100 candidates in key battleground states and in Fonda's home state of California. California is \"the fifth-biggest economy in the world, and an oil-producing state,\" she explained, \"so what happens here has an impact far broader than California.\"\n\nFonda is also, for the first time in her life, \"very involved\" in a presidential campaign this year, \"because of the climate emergency.\" She will visit each battleground state. \"And when I'm there, we give our schedule to the Harris campaign. Then they fold in Harris campaign [get-out-the-vote], volunteer recruitment, things like that, that I do for the Harris campaign and then I do them for our PAC candidates\" as well.\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nJeet Heer\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nHer PAC has a strict rule: It endorses only candidates who do not accept money from the fossil fuel industry. The industry's \"stranglehold over our government\" explains a crucial disconnect, Fonda said:  Polls show that most Americans want climate action , yet their elected officials often don't deliver it. In California, she said, \"we've had so many moderate Democrats that blocked the climate solutions we need because they take money from the fossil fuel industry.... It's very hard to stand up to the people that are supporting your candidacy.\"\n\nFonda also faulted the mainstream news media for not doing a better job of informing the public about the climate emergency and the abundance of solutions. Watching the Harris-Trump debate, she thought that \"Kamala did very well.\" But she \"was very disturbed that the number-one crisis facing humanity right now took an hour and a half to come up and was not really addressed. People don't understand what we are facing! The news media has to be more vigilant about tying extreme weather events to climate change. It's starting to happen, but not enough.\"\n\nGiven her years of anti-nuclear activism-including producing and starring in a hit Hollywood movie, The China Syndrome , released days before the Three Mile Island reactor accident in 1979-it's perhaps no surprise that Fonda rejects the increasingly fashionable idea that nuclear power is a climate solution.\n\n\"Every time I speak [in public], someone asks me if these small modular reactors are a solution,\" she said. \"So I've spent time researching it, and there's one unavoidable problem.

Do not vote for a third party, no matter how angry you are. Because that will elect somebody who will deny you any voice in the future of the United States.... If you really care about Gaza, vote to have a voice, so you can do something about it. And then, be ready to turn out into the streets, in the millions, and fight for it.'\"\n\nFonda's remarks came in a wide-ranging interview organized by the global media collaborative Covering Climate Now and conducted by The Guardian , CBS News, and Rolling Stone magazine.\n\nMaking major social change requires massive, nonviolent street protests as well as shrewd electoral organizing, Fonda argued. Drawing on more than 50 years of activism, from her anti-Vietnam War and anti-nuclear protests in the 1970s to later agitating for economic democracy, women's rights, and, today, for climate action , Fonda said that \"History shows us that...you need millions of people in the streets, but you [also] need people in the halls of power with ears and a heart to hear the protests, to hear the demands.\"\n\nDuring the Great Depression, she said, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt agreed with helping the masses of unemployed. But FDR said the public had to \"make him do it,\" or he could not overcome resistance from the status quo. \"There is a chance for us to make them do it if it's Kamala Harris and Tim Walz [in the White House],\" she said. \"There is no chance if Trump and Vance win this election.\"\n\nScientists have repeatedly warned that greenhouse gas emissions must be cut by half by the next decade , Fonda noted, so a President Harris would have to be pushed \"to stop drilling, and fracking, and mining. No new development of fossil fuels.\" Trump, on the other hand, has promised to \"'drill, baby, drill.' For once, let's believe him. The choice is very clear: Do we vote for the future, or do we vote for burning up the planet?\"\n\nFonda launched the Jane Fonda Climate political action committee three years ago to elect \"climate champions\" at all levels of government-national, state, and local. \"The PAC focuses downballot-on mayors, state legislators, county councils,\" she said. \"It's incredible how much effect people in these positions can have on climate issues.\"\n\nForty-two of the 60 candidates the PAC endorsed in 2022 won their races. In 2024, the PAC is providing money, voter outreach, and publicity to more than 100 candidates in key battleground states and in Fonda's home state of California. California is \"the fifth-biggest economy in the world, and an oil-producing state,\" she explained, \"so what happens here has an impact far broader than California.\"\n\nFonda is also, for the first time in her life, \"very involved\" in a presidential campaign this year, \"because of the climate emergency.\" She will visit each battleground state. \"And when I'm there, we give our schedule to the Harris campaign. Then they fold in Harris campaign [get-out-the-vote], volunteer recruitment, things like that, that I do for the Harris campaign and then I do them for our PAC candidates\" as well.\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nJeet Heer\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nHer PAC has a strict rule: It endorses only candidates who do not accept money from the fossil fuel industry. The industry's \"stranglehold over our government\" explains a crucial disconnect, Fonda said:  Polls show that most Americans want climate action , yet their elected officials often don't deliver it. In California, she said, \"we've had so many moderate Democrats that blocked the climate solutions we need because they take money from the fossil fuel industry.... It's very hard to stand up to the people that are supporting your candidacy.\"\n\nFonda also faulted the mainstream news media for not doing a better job of informing the public about the climate emergency and the abundance of solutions. Watching the Harris-Trump debate, she thought that \"Kamala did very well.\" But she \"was very disturbed that the number-one crisis facing humanity right now took an hour and a half to come up and was not really addressed. People don't understand what we are facing! The news media has to be more vigilant about tying extreme weather events to climate change. It's starting to happen, but not enough.\"\n\nGiven her years of anti-nuclear activism-including producing and starring in a hit Hollywood movie, The China Syndrome , released days before the Three Mile Island reactor accident in 1979-it's perhaps no surprise that Fonda rejects the increasingly fashionable idea that nuclear power is a climate solution.\n\n\"Every time I speak [in public], someone asks me if these small modular reactors are a solution,\" she said. \"So I've spent time researching it, and there's one unavoidable problem. No nuclear reactor of any kind-the traditional or the smaller or the modular , none of them-has been built in less than 10 to 20 years. We don't have that kind of time.

Activate your online access\n\nThe activist and Hollywood legend is \"having a ball\" electing climate champions across the US.\n\nActress Jane Fonda is arrested during the \"Fire Drill Friday\" Climate Change Protest on October 25, 2019, in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe chemo sometimes fogs her brain, but not her mind. Addressing a roomful of women in the book-lined annex of a midtown hotel during last month's Climate Week NYC, Jane Fonda suddenly forgot what question the moderator asked her. \"I had cancer,\" she confided.\n\nRecovering in true movie-star style, Fonda leaned toward the crowd and said, \"Here's a good joke that has nothing to do with what we're talking about.\" She then told a risqué story about one of her famous ex-husbands that somehow rebounds to his credit even as it provoked gasps and guffaws of knowing laughter from the women who'd been hanging on her every word for the last 20 minutes.\n\nFonda, 85, was raising money for what she said is the last mission of her life as an activist, the cause that she said she will be working on for as many years as she has left: the climate emergency. \"It's fun,\" she said. \"I'm having a ball!\"\n\nThe women loved her, admired her, called her their \"shero.\" They were women of wealth, brought together by Nia Impact Capital, one of the very few asset management firms in the United States led by women. Kristin Hull, the firm's founder and CEO, explained while introducing Fonda that only 0.7 percent of the $80 trillion in private wealth in the US seeking investment opportunities is managed by women-led firms.\n\n\"We get the economy we invest in, and we get the political leadership we invest in,\" said Hull, who along with half a dozen Nia colleagues in New York had joined the March to End Fossil Fuels a few days earlier. \"Let's all just imagine how different our world would be with women at the decision-making tables.\"\n\nFrom its inception in 2007, Nia ruled out investing its clients' money in fossil fuels. Nia claims to be the first US asset management firm to \"invest at the intersection of environmental sustainability and social justice.\" One goal of the event with Fonda was to convince more women of wealth to do likewise.\n\nThe women Fonda and Hull addressed ranged in age from their 20s to their 70s. Virtually all were white. Many were mothers who dread the climate future their children are inheriting.\n\nBut are these women ready to have the fights that likely will be necessary to shift their wealth away from the oil, gas, and coal that are roasting the planet?\n\n\"A lot of women want to align their investments with their values,\" Hull ventured, \"but when they go to their investment adviser, oftentimes it's a man....\"\n\n\"Divorce!\" Fonda blurted out before Hull completed the question. The crowd erupted in laughter. \"Fossil fuels are worth getting divorced over,\" Fonda added. \"I wouldn't want to stay married with someone invested in fossil fuels.\" She paused, then added: \"I wouldn't sleep with anyone invested in fossil fuels.\"\n\nThe laughter built, and Fonda went further.\n\n\"We should do what they did during the Vietnam War,\" she said. \"Joan Baez started it, I think. Let's not sleep with anybody who has money invested in fossil fuels.\"\n\nShouts, applause, and whoops filled the room.\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nJeet Heer\n\nJohn Nichols\n\n\"You'll be attacked\" if you speak out, Fonda told the women. \"So what! Women have such a tendency to want to be loved by everybody. I spent 60 years of my life wanting to be popular. It's not good.\"\n\n\"We have to make fossil fuels as bad as tobacco,\" she continued, \"the kind of thing you'd never put money into, never want anybody to know you have money in. But we still have all these political leaders taking money from fossil fuel interests.\"\n\nTo tackle that problem, Fonda and Annie Leonard, the former CEO of Greenpeace USA, recently established the Jane Fonda Climate PAC , a political action committee dedicated to electing \"climate warriors\" to public office across the United States. One iron-clad requirement: The PAC only assists candidates who refuse to accept money from fossil fuel companies and their allies. Fonda's PAC says that fossil fuel interests poured $139 million into the 2020 elections and that this money deterred Congress from passing such climate solutions as the Green New Deal and ending billions in annual subsidies to Big Oil.\n\nTo date, Fonda's PAC has focused on down-ballot races: state legislatures, city county commissioners, mayors. In these less-costly races, she said, \"every dollar really matters.... [These candidates] don't get a lot of volunteers or media coverage. But we come along, and we can triple [the money] they're raising and bring in the media and get volunteers and really make a difference.\"\n\nOf the 60 candidates the Jane Fonda Climate PAC has supported over the past year, 42 won their general elections-a better than two-out-of-three success rate. All of those candidates were Democrats, \"because Republicans can't be moved,\" Fonda explained.\n\nMost of the endorsed candidates were women, and many were women of color. Lina Hildago, for example, became chief executive of Harris County, Tex., which contains the oil-and-gas industry hub of Houston and is the third-most- populous county in the country. Fonda's PAC also supported Brandon Johnson, a former public-school teacher and union organizer, in his successful campaign to become mayor of Chicago.\n\nThe Jane Fonda Climate PAC raised $1,897,427 for the 2022 election cycle, according to Open Secrets , a nonprofit that documents the role of money in US politics. Fonda told the crowd that she's aiming much higher: \"We're going to become a $100 million PAC, I swear it.\"\n\nReflecting on her five decades of political activism, dating back to the anti-Vietnam War, women's liberation, and anti-nuclear movements of the 1960s and '70s, Fonda said that \"two things are necessary\" for such movements to succeed. One is \"unprecedented numbers of people in the streets. Many, many, many millions of people in the streets [and] getting arrested, but nonviolently. This is what changes history.\" Second, \"we have to change the people on the inside. That's what my PAC does.... We want to electoralize people's climate angst.\"\n\nWorking with Black and Indigenous leaders in the wake of George Floyd's murder by Minneapolis police made Fonda realize that \"if there was no racism, if there was no patriarchy, there would be no climate crisis.\" The climate crisis, she argued, stems from \"a mindset that creates hierarchies of people who are worth more than other people. And Nature is at the very bottom.\"\n\nHull's final question to her shero was to \"talk about building power,\" especially the importance of women building power.\n\n\"Women are far more concerned about the climate crisis than men are,\" Fonda replied. \"Women tend to be afraid of power. But if what we do isn't moving us close to power, then we're doing the wrong thing.\"\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Do not vote for a third party, no matter how angry you are. Because that will elect somebody who will deny you any voice in the future of the United States.... If you really care about Gaza, vote to have a voice, so you can do something about it. And then, be ready to turn out into the streets, in the millions, and fight for it.'\"\n\nFonda's remarks came in a wide-ranging interview organized by the global media collaborative Covering Climate Now and conducted by The Guardian , CBS News, and Rolling Stone magazine.\n\nMaking major social change requires massive, nonviolent street protests as well as shrewd electoral organizing, Fonda argued. Drawing on more than 50 years of activism, from her anti-Vietnam War and anti-nuclear protests in the 1970s to later agitating for economic democracy, women's rights, and, today, for climate action , Fonda said that \"History shows us that...you need millions of people in the streets, but you [also] need people in the halls of power with ears and a heart to hear the protests, to hear the demands.\"\n\nDuring the Great Depression, she said, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt agreed with helping the masses of unemployed. But FDR said the public had to \"make him do it,\" or he could not overcome resistance from the status quo. \"There is a chance for us to make them do it if it's Kamala Harris and Tim Walz [in the White House],\" she said. \"There is no chance if Trump and Vance win this election.\"\n\nScientists have repeatedly warned that greenhouse gas emissions must be cut by half by the next decade , Fonda noted, so a President Harris would have to be pushed \"to stop drilling, and fracking, and mining. No new development of fossil fuels.\" Trump, on the other hand, has promised to \"'drill, baby, drill.' For once, let's believe him. The choice is very clear: Do we vote for the future, or do we vote for burning up the planet?\"\n\nFonda launched the Jane Fonda Climate political action committee three years ago to elect \"climate champions\" at all levels of government-national, state, and local. \"The PAC focuses downballot-on mayors, state legislators, county councils,\" she said. \"It's incredible how much effect people in these positions can have on climate issues.\"\n\nForty-two of the 60 candidates the PAC endorsed in 2022 won their races. In 2024, the PAC is providing money, voter outreach, and publicity to more than 100 candidates in key battleground states and in Fonda's home state of California. California is \"the fifth-biggest economy in the world, and an oil-producing state,\" she explained, \"so what happens here has an impact far broader than California.\"\n\nFonda is also, for the first time in her life, \"very involved\" in a presidential campaign this year, \"because of the climate emergency.\" She will visit each battleground state. \"And when I'm there, we give our schedule to the Harris campaign. Then they fold in Harris campaign [get-out-the-vote], volunteer recruitment, things like that, that I do for the Harris campaign and then I do them for our PAC candidates\" as well.\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nJeet Heer\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nHer PAC has a strict rule: It endorses only candidates who do not accept money from the fossil fuel industry. The industry's \"stranglehold over our government\" explains a crucial disconnect, Fonda said:  Polls show that most Americans want climate action , yet their elected officials often don't deliver it. In California, she said, \"we've had so many moderate Democrats that blocked the climate solutions we need because they take money from the fossil fuel industry.... It's very hard to stand up to the people that are supporting your candidacy.\"\n\nFonda also faulted the mainstream news media for not doing a better job of informing the public about the climate emergency and the abundance of solutions. Watching the Harris-Trump debate, she thought that \"Kamala did very well.\" But she \"was very disturbed that the number-one crisis facing humanity right now took an hour and a half to come up and was not really addressed. People don't understand what we are facing! The news media has to be more vigilant about tying extreme weather events to climate change. It's starting to happen, but not enough.\"\n\nGiven her years of anti-nuclear activism-including producing and starring in a hit Hollywood movie, The China Syndrome , released days before the Three Mile Island reactor accident in 1979-it's perhaps no surprise that Fonda rejects the increasingly fashionable idea that nuclear power is a climate solution.\n\n\"Every time I speak [in public], someone asks me if these small modular reactors are a solution,\" she said. \"So I've spent time researching it, and there's one unavoidable problem. No nuclear reactor of any kind-the traditional or the smaller or the modular , none of them-has been built in less than 10 to 20 years. We don't have that kind of time. We have to deal with the climate crisis by the 2030s. So just on the timeline, nuclear is not a solution.\" By contrast, \" solar takes about four years to develop, and pretty soon it's going to be 30 percent of the electricity in the world.\"\n\nThe reason that solar-and wind and geothermal-are not prioritized over fossil fuels and nuclear, she argued, is that \"big companies don't make as much money on it.\" Noting that air pollution from  fossil fuels kills 9 million people a year globally , she added, \"We're being poisoned to death because of petrochemicals and the fossil fuel industry. And we [taxpayers] pay for it! We pay $20 billion a year [in government subsidies] to the fossil fuel industry, and we're dying.... We need that industry out of our lives, off of our planet, but they run the world.\"\n\nThe two-time Academy Award winner's decades as one of the world's biggest movie stars has given her an appreciation of the power of celebrity, and she applauds Taylor Swift for exercising that power with her endorsement of the Harris-Walz ticket.\n\n\"I think she's awesome, amazing, and very smart,\" Fonda said of Swift. \"I'm very grateful and excited that she did it, and...I think it's going to have a big impact.\"\n\n\"My metaphor for myself, and other celebrities, is a repeater,\" Fonda added. \"When you look at a big, tall mountain, and you see these antennas on the top, those are repeaters. They pick up the signals from the valley that are weak and distribute them so that they have a larger audience.... When I'm doing the work I'm doing, I'm picking up the signals from the people who live in Wilmington and the Central Valley and Kern County and are really suffering, and the animals that can't speak, and trying to lift them up and send them out to a broader audience. We're repeaters. It's a very valid thing to do.\"\n\nClimate activism is also \"so much fun,\" she said, and it does wonders for her mental health.\n\n\"I don't get depressed anymore. You know, Greta Thunberg said something really great: 'Everybody goes looking for hope. Hope is where there's action, so look for action and hope will come.'\" Hope, Fonda added, is \"very different than optimism. Optimism is: 'Everything's gonna be fine,' but you don't do anything to make sure that that's true. Hope is: 'I'm hopeful, and I'm gonna work like hell to make it true.'\"\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

Activate your online access\n\nThe activist and Hollywood legend is \"having a ball\" electing climate champions across the US.\n\nActress Jane Fonda is arrested during the \"Fire Drill Friday\" Climate Change Protest on October 25, 2019, in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe chemo sometimes fogs her brain, but not her mind. Addressing a roomful of women in the book-lined annex of a midtown hotel during last month's Climate Week NYC, Jane Fonda suddenly forgot what question the moderator asked her. \"I had cancer,\" she confided.\n\nRecovering in true movie-star style, Fonda leaned toward the crowd and said, \"Here's a good joke that has nothing to do with what we're talking about.\" She then told a risqué story about one of her famous ex-husbands that somehow rebounds to his credit even as it provoked gasps and guffaws of knowing laughter from the women who'd been hanging on her every word for the last 20 minutes.\n\nFonda, 85, was raising money for what she said is the last mission of her life as an activist, the cause that she said she will be working on for as many years as she has left: the climate emergency. \"It's fun,\" she said. \"I'm having a ball!\"\n\nThe women loved her, admired her, called her their \"shero.\" They were women of wealth, brought together by Nia Impact Capital, one of the very few asset management firms in the United States led by women. Kristin Hull, the firm's founder and CEO, explained while introducing Fonda that only 0.7 percent of the $80 trillion in private wealth in the US seeking investment opportunities is managed by women-led firms.\n\n\"We get the economy we invest in, and we get the political leadership we invest in,\" said Hull, who along with half a dozen Nia colleagues in New York had joined the March to End Fossil Fuels a few days earlier. \"Let's all just imagine how different our world would be with women at the decision-making tables.\"\n\nFrom its inception in 2007, Nia ruled out investing its clients' money in fossil fuels. Nia claims to be the first US asset management firm to \"invest at the intersection of environmental sustainability and social justice.\" One goal of the event with Fonda was to convince more women of wealth to do likewise.\n\nThe women Fonda and Hull addressed ranged in age from their 20s to their 70s. Virtually all were white. Many were mothers who dread the climate future their children are inheriting.\n\nBut are these women ready to have the fights that likely will be necessary to shift their wealth away from the oil, gas, and coal that are roasting the planet?\n\n\"A lot of women want to align their investments with their values,\" Hull ventured, \"but when they go to their investment adviser, oftentimes it's a man....\"\n\n\"Divorce!\" Fonda blurted out before Hull completed the question. The crowd erupted in laughter. \"Fossil fuels are worth getting divorced over,\" Fonda added. \"I wouldn't want to stay married with someone invested in fossil fuels.\" She paused, then added: \"I wouldn't sleep with anyone invested in fossil fuels.\"\n\nThe laughter built, and Fonda went further.\n\n\"We should do what they did during the Vietnam War,\" she said. \"Joan Baez started it, I think. Let's not sleep with anybody who has money invested in fossil fuels.\"\n\nShouts, applause, and whoops filled the room.\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nJeet Heer\n\nJohn Nichols\n\n\"You'll be attacked\" if you speak out, Fonda told the women. \"So what! Women have such a tendency to want to be loved by everybody. I spent 60 years of my life wanting to be popular. It's not good.\"\n\n\"We have to make fossil fuels as bad as tobacco,\" she continued, \"the kind of thing you'd never put money into, never want anybody to know you have money in. But we still have all these political leaders taking money from fossil fuel interests.\"\n\nTo tackle that problem, Fonda and Annie Leonard, the former CEO of Greenpeace USA, recently established the Jane Fonda Climate PAC , a political action committee dedicated to electing \"climate warriors\" to public office across the United States. One iron-clad requirement: The PAC only assists candidates who refuse to accept money from fossil fuel companies and their allies. Fonda's PAC says that fossil fuel interests poured $139 million into the 2020 elections and that this money deterred Congress from passing such climate solutions as the Green New Deal and ending billions in annual subsidies to Big Oil.\n\nTo date, Fonda's PAC has focused on down-ballot races: state legislatures, city county commissioners, mayors. In these less-costly races, she said, \"every dollar really matters.... [These candidates] don't get a lot of volunteers or media coverage. But we come along, and we can triple [the money] they're raising and bring in the media and get volunteers and really make a difference.\"\n\nOf the 60 candidates the Jane Fonda Climate PAC has supported over the past year, 42 won their general elections-a better than two-out-of-three success rate. All of those candidates were Democrats, \"because Republicans can't be moved,\" Fonda explained.\n\nMost of the endorsed candidates were women, and many were women of color. Lina Hildago, for example, became chief executive of Harris County, Tex., which contains the oil-and-gas industry hub of Houston and is the third-most- populous county in the country. Fonda's PAC also supported Brandon Johnson, a former public-school teacher and union organizer, in his successful campaign to become mayor of Chicago.\n\nThe Jane Fonda Climate PAC raised $1,897,427 for the 2022 election cycle, according to Open Secrets , a nonprofit that documents the role of money in US politics. Fonda told the crowd that she's aiming much higher: \"We're going to become a $100 million PAC, I swear it.\"\n\nReflecting on her five decades of political activism, dating back to the anti-Vietnam War, women's liberation, and anti-nuclear movements of the 1960s and '70s, Fonda said that \"two things are necessary\" for such movements to succeed. One is \"unprecedented numbers of people in the streets. Many, many, many millions of people in the streets [and] getting arrested, but nonviolently. This is what changes history.\" Second, \"we have to change the people on the inside. That's what my PAC does.... We want to electoralize people's climate angst.\"\n\nWorking with Black and Indigenous leaders in the wake of George Floyd's murder by Minneapolis police made Fonda realize that \"if there was no racism, if there was no patriarchy, there would be no climate crisis.\" The climate crisis, she argued, stems from \"a mindset that creates hierarchies of people who are worth more than other people. And Nature is at the very bottom.\"\n\nHull's final question to her shero was to \"talk about building power,\" especially the importance of women building power.\n\n\"Women are far more concerned about the climate crisis than men are,\" Fonda replied. \"Women tend to be afraid of power.

Activate your online access\n\nElecting Kamala Harris and then pushing her to deliver is the only chance for climate survival, says the Hollywood actress and activist.\n\nJane Fonda speaks at the CCNow Newsmaker Interview.\n\nYoung people's understandable unhappiness with the Biden administration's record on oil and gas drilling and the war in Gaza should not deter them from voting to block Donald Trump from again becoming president of the United States, the Hollywood actress and activist Jane Fonda has warned.\n\n\"I understand why young people are really angry, and really hurting,\" Fonda said. \"What I want to say to them is, 'Do not sit this election out, no matter how angry you are. Do not vote for a third party, no matter how angry you are. Because that will elect somebody who will deny you any voice in the future of the United States.... If you really care about Gaza, vote to have a voice, so you can do something about it. And then, be ready to turn out into the streets, in the millions, and fight for it.'\"\n\nFonda's remarks came in a wide-ranging interview organized by the global media collaborative Covering Climate Now and conducted by The Guardian , CBS News, and Rolling Stone magazine.\n\nMaking major social change requires massive, nonviolent street protests as well as shrewd electoral organizing, Fonda argued. Drawing on more than 50 years of activism, from her anti-Vietnam War and anti-nuclear protests in the 1970s to later agitating for economic democracy, women's rights, and, today, for climate action , Fonda said that \"History shows us that...you need millions of people in the streets, but you [also] need people in the halls of power with ears and a heart to hear the protests, to hear the demands.\"\n\nDuring the Great Depression, she said, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt agreed with helping the masses of unemployed. But FDR said the public had to \"make him do it,\" or he could not overcome resistance from the status quo. \"There is a chance for us to make them do it if it's Kamala Harris and Tim Walz [in the White House],\" she said. \"There is no chance if Trump and Vance win this election.\"\n\nScientists have repeatedly warned that greenhouse gas emissions must be cut by half by the next decade , Fonda noted, so a President Harris would have to be pushed \"to stop drilling, and fracking, and mining. No new development of fossil fuels.\" Trump, on the other hand, has promised to \"'drill, baby, drill.' For once, let's believe him. The choice is very clear: Do we vote for the future, or do we vote for burning up the planet?\"\n\nFonda launched the Jane Fonda Climate political action committee three years ago to elect \"climate champions\" at all levels of government-national, state, and local. \"The PAC focuses downballot-on mayors, state legislators, county councils,\" she said. \"It's incredible how much effect people in these positions can have on climate issues.\"\n\nForty-two of the 60 candidates the PAC endorsed in 2022 won their races. In 2024, the PAC is providing money, voter outreach, and publicity to more than 100 candidates in key battleground states and in Fonda's home state of California. California is \"the fifth-biggest economy in the world, and an oil-producing state,\" she explained, \"so what happens here has an impact far broader than California.\"\n\nFonda is also, for the first time in her life, \"very involved\" in a presidential campaign this year, \"because of the climate emergency.\" She will visit each battleground state. \"And when I'm there, we give our schedule to the Harris campaign. Then they fold in Harris campaign [get-out-the-vote], volunteer recruitment, things like that, that I do for the Harris campaign and then I do them for our PAC candidates\" as well.\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nJeet Heer\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nHer PAC has a strict rule: It endorses only candidates who do not accept money from the fossil fuel industry. The industry's \"stranglehold over our government\" explains a crucial disconnect, Fonda said:  Polls show that most Americans want climate action , yet their elected officials often don't deliver it. In California, she said, \"we've had so many moderate Democrats that blocked the climate solutions we need because they take money from the fossil fuel industry.... It's very hard to stand up to the people that are supporting your candidacy.\"\n\nFonda also faulted the mainstream news media for not doing a better job of informing the public about the climate emergency and the abundance of solutions. Watching the Harris-Trump debate, she thought that \"Kamala did very well.\" But she \"was very disturbed that the number-one crisis facing humanity right now took an hour and a half to come up and was not really addressed. People don't understand what we are facing! The news media has to be more vigilant about tying extreme weather events to climate change. It's starting to happen, but not enough.\"\n\nGiven her years of anti-nuclear activism-including producing and starring in a hit Hollywood movie, The China Syndrome , released days before the Three Mile Island reactor accident in 1979-it's perhaps no surprise that Fonda rejects the increasingly fashionable idea that nuclear power is a climate solution.\n\n\"Every time I speak [in public], someone asks me if these small modular reactors are a solution,\" she said. \"So I've spent time researching it, and there's one unavoidable problem. No nuclear reactor of any kind-the traditional or the smaller or the modular , none of them-has been built in less than 10 to 20 years. We don't have that kind of time. We have to deal with the climate crisis by the 2030s. So just on the timeline, nuclear is not a solution.\" By contrast, \" solar takes about four years to develop, and pretty soon it's going to be 30 percent of the electricity in the world.\"\n\nThe reason that solar-and wind and geothermal-are not prioritized over fossil fuels and nuclear, she argued, is that \"big companies don't make as much money on it.\" Noting that air pollution from  fossil fuels kills 9 million people a year globally , she added, \"We're being poisoned to death because of petrochemicals and the fossil fuel industry. And we [taxpayers] pay for it! We pay $20 billion a year [in government subsidies] to the fossil fuel industry, and we're dying.... We need that industry out of our lives, off of our planet, but they run the world.\"\n\nThe two-time Academy Award winner's decades as one of the world's biggest movie stars has given her an appreciation of the power of celebrity, and she applauds Taylor Swift for exercising that power with her endorsement of the Harris-Walz ticket.\n\n\"I think she's awesome, amazing, and very smart,\" Fonda said of Swift. \"I'm very grateful and excited that she did it, and...I think it's going to have a big impact.\"\n\n\"My metaphor for myself, and other celebrities, is a repeater,\" Fonda added. \"When you look at a big, tall mountain, and you see these antennas on the top, those are repeaters. They pick up the signals from the valley that are weak and distribute them so that they have a larger audience.... When I'm doing the work I'm doing, I'm picking up the signals from the people who live in Wilmington and the Central Valley and Kern County and are really suffering, and the animals that can't speak, and trying to lift them up and send them out to a broader audience. We're repeaters. It's a very valid thing to do.\"\n\nClimate activism is also \"so much fun,\" she said, and it does wonders for her mental health.\n\n\"I don't get depressed anymore. You know, Greta Thunberg said something really great: 'Everybody goes looking for hope. Hope is where there's action, so look for action and hope will come.'\" Hope, Fonda added, is \"very different than optimism. Optimism is: 'Everything's gonna be fine,' but you don't do anything to make sure that that's true. Hope is: 'I'm hopeful, and I'm gonna work like hell to make it true.'\"\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

Because we are going to need a big tent to resist successfully what is coming at us.\"\n\nFonda, a two-time Academy Award winner, has long been known for political activism, particularly her support for the civil rights movement and Indigenous rights and for her opposition to the Vietnam War. A 1972 visit to North Vietnam led some critics to call her \"Hanoi Jane\"; she has since apologized to soldiers and veterans for being photographed there on an antiaircraft gun. In more recent years, she has fought to draw attention to the climate crisis .\n\nIn her acceptance speech, she expressed her strong support for unions and noted that when she was starting out in the late 1950s, some leading Hollywood figures had been prominently resisting McCarthyism. She also said that she believes Americans are currently facing the same kinds of challenges that have been captured in historical documentaries about social movements, including apartheid , the civil rights movement and the Stonewall Rebellion.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

She did, after all, move to Washington, D.C., in 2019 specifically to draw attention to the climate crisis, getting arrested pretty much every Friday while staging sit-ins at the Capitol . Then she swore off buying new clothes, even for the red carpet.\n\nAll of which makes her an unlikely choice to front a new luxury sneaker campaign. But for Silvio Campara, the chief executive of Golden Goose, the brand known for its prescuffed sneakers with the sparkly star on the side, she was his only choice. As to why she agreed to do it ... well, that's a whole other story.\n\nThis interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nWere you surprised when Golden Goose got in touch?\n\nI don't do a lot of campaigns because I'm not friendly with a lot of brands. But my manager said: \"This is a cool company. They have responsible practices.\" And I said, \"Well, you know, I like their sneakers.\"\n\nSo you were already wearing the sneakers?\n\nTwo and a half years ago, I was making \"Book Club: The Next Chapter\" in Rome, and I would walk every day and look into stores, and there were so many cute sneakers with sequins and sparkles. That's when I found them. I like the combo of sneakers with glitter and a very structured suit. I think that's cool.\n\nHow many sneakers do you have?\n\nQuite a lot because I don't throw them away. I don't want them to end up in the ocean. I have many, many dozens of all kinds of sneakers, starting with the old colored Reebok high-tops.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

And she has been awarded many times along the way, winning two best actress Oscars (for \" Klute ,\" in 1971, and \"Coming Home,\" in 1978) and eight Golden Globes, her first in 1960 for \" Tall Story .\" She is the 16th woman to receive the award, the association's highest honor for film professional, which has been presented since 1952.\n\nAnd in that time, Fonda has carved a distinct path not only as an actress, but also as a producer, documentarian and activist passionate about global peace, human rights and climate change (a cause for which she was arrested multiple times in 2019). On Sunday, she took time to address the diversity issues hanging over the awards show. \"There's a story we've been afraid to see and hear about ourselves in this industry,\" she said. \"A story about which voices we respect and elevate and which we tune out, a story about who's offered a seat at the table and who is kept out of the rooms where decisions are made.\"\n\nHere's Fonda's acceptance speech, in its entirety:\n\nOh my gosh, thank you. Thank you, all the members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, I'm so moved to receive this honor, thank you. You know - hi, Amy - we are a community of storytellers, aren't we? And in turbulent, crisis-torn times like these, storytelling has always been essential. You see, stories have a way - they can change our hearts and our minds, they can help us see each other in a new light, to have empathy. To recognize that for all our diversity, we are humans first, right? You know, I've seen a lot of diversity in my long life, and at times I've been challenged to understand some of the people I've met, but inevitably, if my heart is open and I look beneath the surface, I feel kinship.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

And she has been awarded many times along the way, winning two best actress Oscars (for \" Klute ,\" in 1971, and \"Coming Home,\" in 1978) and eight Golden Globes, her first in 1960 for \" Tall Story .\" She is the 16th woman to receive the award, the association's highest honor for film professional, which has been presented since 1952.\n\nAnd in that time, Fonda has carved a distinct path not only as an actress, but also as a producer, documentarian and activist passionate about global peace, human rights and climate change (a cause for which she was arrested multiple times in 2019). On Sunday, she took time to address the diversity issues hanging over the awards show. \"There's a story we've been afraid to see and hear about ourselves in this industry,\" she said. \"A story about which voices we respect and elevate and which we tune out, a story about who's offered a seat at the table and who is kept out of the rooms where decisions are made.\"\n\nHere's Fonda's acceptance speech, in its entirety:\n\nOh my gosh, thank you. Thank you, all the members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, I'm so moved to receive this honor, thank you. You know - hi, Amy - we are a community of storytellers, aren't we? And in turbulent, crisis-torn times like these, storytelling has always been essential. You see, stories have a way - they can change our hearts and our minds, they can help us see each other in a new light, to have empathy. To recognize that for all our diversity, we are humans first, right? You know, I've seen a lot of diversity in my long life, and at times I've been challenged to understand some of the people I've met, but inevitably, if my heart is open and I look beneath the surface, I feel kinship.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Jane Fonda: The Reluctant Fashionista\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nBy Bronwyn Cosgrave\n\nWhen the model Grace Hartzel opened Tom Ford's spring 2017 show in a striking shag haircut, the inspiration was unmistakable - at least to those over 40 who watched Mr. Ford's extravaganza. The hairdo paid homage to the one Jane Fonda made supercool as the Times Square hooker Bree Daniels in the 1971 movie \"Klute.\"\n\nAlexander McQueen also cited Ms. Fonda as a motivating force of \"Deliverance,\" his spring 2004 collection, which has gone down in fashion history for its dance presentation inspired by Ms. Fonda's performance in the 1969 drama \"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?\"\n\nIn her late '60s heyday, Ms. Fonda played her fair share of down-on-her-luck roles. Off screen, she was the ultrachic Paris wife of the director Roger Vadim, and was a front-row fixture at shows staged by his friends Coco Chanel, Hubert de Givenchy and Yves Saint Laurent.\n\nRecently, speaking by phone from a film location in Colorado, Ms. Fonda, 78, firmly denied her style pedigree. \"I am not a fashionista,\" she said.\n\nMs. Fonda's political activism often overshadowed her status as a sartorial influencer. Highlighting it, however, is her collection of couture, Italian ready-to-wear and lavish screen costumes that will be auctioned on Friday at Julien's Auctions in Los Angeles. About five of the items are museum-worthy. But when asked if she had considered donating an Atelier Versace gown, a Valentino something, even her stripy workout leotard to, perhaps, the Met Costume Institute, she offered an unyielding \"No.\"\n\nMs. Fonda is auctioning her possessions (698 items in all, mostly clothing) in a housecleaning exercise. \"I had to do jobs to pay for my storage,\" she said of the units she had maintained since her 2001 divorce from the media mogul Ted Turner. \"Because Ted did not like to carry a lot of luggage on his jet - it was too burdensome - I would have to buy things in bulk\" for their travels to his many properties.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

It's not just that those releasing their first album, book or movie, or having their first gallery exhibit or Broadway show, are usually young; it's that they embody that most delicious and evanescent of qualities: promise. Any painter could be the next Rothko or Basquiat; any singer could be the next Joni or Aretha. There the new artist sits, poised between our expectations and their unwritten reality. Becoming emotionally invested in an untested creative life is like becoming financially invested in an exciting new company - should they (or it) work, the reward is not just theirs but ours. \"See?\" we tell ourselves. \"We knew it all along.\"\n\nBut the real test of being an artist isn't the first album, book, movie or Broadway show, as significant as those accomplishments are. It's what happens after. All artists know that living a true creative life means facing an endless series of beginnings: It's starting over after setbacks; it's pushing forward through doubt and despair; it's trying again when someone tells you no; it's slogging ahead when no one seems to like or care about what you make; it's ignoring the voice inside you that tells you to stop; it's striving and failing, again and again and again. There is no point of complete security, no award or recognition that bestows total confidence - a life in art means that, to some degree, you're starting anew every day. As the novelist Andrew Holleran tells T, \"Writing is basically unconscious, and you don't get any smarter about it. Imagine a brain surgeon who didn't learn from each operation? We'd be horrified. But when you sit down to write, you're always wondering how to do it.\"\n\nOn the covers, clockwise from top left: ICE SPICE wears a Burberry dress, $2,290, burberry.com ; Graff necklace, price on request, graff.com ; and her own earrings and ring.

Makeup by Jamal Scott for YSL Beauty.\n\nIn this issue, we look at what it means for an artist to begin, from actual debuts (such as Sky Lakota-Lynch, one of our cover stars, who's appearing this spring in \"The Outsiders,\" his first original Broadway role) to do-overs (such as Jon Bon Jovi, about to embark on tour after throat surgery and a 40-year career, or the cabaret performer turned visual artist Justin Vivian Bond). And though the artists who appear in these pages are all different, they share a spirit of generosity: It's no easy thing to give voice to your dreams and insecurities, much less to do so publicly. Their collective perseverance - a mix of dogged determination and wild hope - is a reminder for all of us that a creative life, that all life, takes nerve. It takes humility. It takes a kind of arrogance that sees you through the most barren periods.\n\nAnd by the way: You don't need to be young to lead a creative life. All you have to do is start. Start - and then never stop.\n\nOn March 12, as we were readying this issue to go to press, one of our colleagues, Carter Love, T's senior photography editor, died. He was 41.\n\nBeing a good photo editor demands taste and a sense of coordination. For a fashion or celebrity shoot, they, along with the creative director and style director, assemble teams: the photographer, of course, but also the stylist, models, hair and makeup artists and set designers. For a travel story, the photo editor selects and hires the fixer, the photographer, the location scout, the translator and the transportation. Once on set, a photo editor stays until the very end of the shoot, even if the shoot goes all day. Carter worked on these - and many other - kinds of stories, often simultaneously; in this issue alone, he produced a dozen images, from the portrait of the longtime collaborators Cindy Sherman and Marc Jacobs to the picture of the fashion designer turned photographer Miguel Adrover.\n\nAlong with his native senses of taste and coordination, Carter was - crucially - able to laugh at the absurdities, the unexpected little (and not-so-little) disasters that inevitably arise during a shoot, no matter how thorough the planning: rain on a day when sun was predicted; equipment stuck in customs; a subject's last-minute cancellation. He had a big laugh, resonant and full, which everyone in the office could hear; at work parties, he sometimes broke into song. In addition to his big laugh, he had a big voice. He was tall and wiry and quick moving, with magnificent red hair - I'd often look up from my desk and see his head and torso streaking across the top of the cubicle walls, hurrying off somewhere.\n\nOne of Carter's most used phrases was \"absolutely.\" Could I see more options from this shoot? \"Absolutely.\" Could I have a list of the talent that had already confirmed? \"Absolutely.\" Thanks, Carter, for this new information. \"Absolutely.\"\n\nBarely a week after his death, that word keeps beating in my head. Will we always ask ourselves why he had to die? Absolutely. Were we lucky to work with him? Absolutely. Will we miss him? Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely.\n\nDigital production and design: Danny DeBelius, Amy Fang, Chris Littlewood, Coco Romack, Carla Valdivia Nakatani and Jamie Sims.\n\nBy Aatish Taseer\n\nWhy, even as they progress in their practices, all artists remain perpetual beginners.\n\nONE EVENING 17 years ago, V.S. Naipaul came to dinner at my flat in Delhi. The writer, who had become something of a mentor to me, was transfixed by a painting I had bought a few years before. It was a self-portrait, over 7 feet tall and 5 feet wide. \"I find it hypnotic,\" Naipaul said, filing away spoonfuls of yellow dal. Observing the beauty of the hand clasped (as if in horror) over the mouth, the thumb livid against the dark hollows of the eyes, he added of the artist, \"This is someone who has really seen, who has gone back again and again to see.\"\n\nI was at the beginning of my writing career, using my first advances to collect a few works of art. It was thrilling to have someone with as discerning an eye as Naipaul's - \"the brilliant noticer,\" in the words of the literary critic James Wood - approve of \"How Did You Sleep?\" (2002), but it also made me sad. Its creator, Zack, who'd been a close friend at Amherst College in Massachusetts in the late 1990s, had recently given up painting, and \"How Did You Sleep?\" had become a symbol to me of the precarity of what it means to get started as an artist.\n\nThe Italian artist Artemisia Gentileschi was 17 in 1610 when she painted \"Susanna and the Elders\" (above). She went on to be the 17th century's most accomplished female painter.\n\nZack, now 43, was of a mixed-race background from Topeka, Kan. After struggling with feelings of inferiority in our first year related to his public school education, he taught himself to paint from scratch. I would visit him and watch as he, dressed in paint-stained khakis and New Balance sneakers, toiled away at the self-portraits that were his trademark. He was a model to me of artistic labor and discipline, even if those early paintings were painfully amateurish.\n\nThen, in our last semester, having been abroad a while, I entered Fayerweather Hall for the art department's end-of-year show and saw \"How Did You Sleep?\" I was dumbstruck. I'm not sure I would've even been able to recognize it as Zack's work - so prodigious had been his development as a painter - if it hadn't been a self-portrait. Painted in the wake of 9/11, it showed the artist in a blue shirt with an expression of prophetic terror, as if watching a disaster foretold. I remember wanting to own it because it was proof, like none I had ever had before, that there really did exist such a thing in the world as raw talent. I persuaded Zack to sell it to me. The painting followed me from Amherst to my first job in New York, and on to London and Delhi.\n\nBy the time Naipaul saw it, Zack was working in strategic and financial communications in New York and no longer painting - \"Every notary bears within him the debris of a poet,\" Gustave Flaubert tells us. \"My new job is intense,\" Zack had written to say. \"It'll be good for a few years, but it's not a career.\" But neither was art; and Zack, who works as a researcher at Google now, was my first fearful example of how that mythical thing we call talent is real, and how talent alone isn't enough.\n\nIT WASN'T MY intention to start an essay about artistic beginnings with a story of artistic death. I love those romantic tales of creative daring and breakthrough: the English travel writer and novelist Bruce Chatwin quitting his job at The Sunday Times of London's magazine with a simple telegram that read, \"Have gone to Patagonia\"; or, more dramatically, Paul Gauguin abandoning his wife, kids and job as a salesman to pursue his dream of being a painter. I love the improbability of the lives that could not have been: Salman Rushdie, the adman; W. Somerset Maugham, the doctor; the director Kathryn Bigelow, renovating dilapidated apartments in New York with the then-obscure composer Philip Glass. I remember Arundhati Roy teaching my mother and aunt aerobics in the basement of the Taj Palace Hotel in New Delhi before going on to win the Booker Prize for her debut novel, \"The God of Small Things\" (1997). It's exhilarating to see destiny pick those who could but only have been artists out of the mundanity of their lives and light the way to a life of vocation.\n\nI'm especially moved by those first moments of validation by which an artist comes out to himself, as it were. Consider Joseph Conrad in his mid-30s, working aboard the ship Torrens, with the manuscript of his first novel, \"Almayer's Folly\" (1895). It had acquired, he writes in \"A Personal Record\" (1912), \"a faded look and an ancient, yellowish complexion.\" At sea, Conrad met his first reader, Jacques, a \"young Cambridge man.\" \"Well, what do you say?\" Conrad, brimming with anxiety, asked his new friend. \"Is it worth finishing?\" \" 'Distinctly,' he answered, in his sedate, veiled voice,\" Conrad recalls years later, \"and then coughed a little.\" With that one word, Jacques, who was soon to be carried away by a fatal cold, had given a seafaring Polish exile a vital nod of encouragement. \"The purpose instilled into me by his simple and final 'Distinctly,'\" writes Conrad, one of literature's late bloomers (he was 38 when he published his first novel), \"remained dormant, yet alive to await its opportunity.\"\n\nThis quiet admission to oneself, as sacred as the vows of priesthood, of wanting to undertake the creative life is a necessary step; but like talent, it's not enough. To be an artist is not a private act but a public one. No artist is born into a vacuum, or later speaks into one. They are as much a product of the society they emerge from as a response to it. Nor is artistic expression all spirit, all feeling. As Naipaul has frequently noted, writers require a complex edifice of interlocking parts - an infrastructure, if you will - to thrive. More broadly speaking, all successful artists rely on a network of critics, journals and newspapers, a discerning audience, bookshops and concert halls and galleries - which is generations in the making, presupposing certain values, certain economic and political realities. The Ukrainian-born novelist Clarice Lispector came of age in the Brazil of the 1920s. At 13, she \"consciously claimed the desire to write,\" as her biographer Benjamin Moser quotes her in \"Why This World\" (2009), but no sooner had she claimed her destiny than she felt herself in a void. The idea of vocation had been instilled in her, but that didn't mean she knew how to proceed. \"Writing was always difficult for me,\" Lispector once wrote, \"even though I had begun with what is known as vocation. Vocation is different from talent. One can have vocation and not talent; one can be called and not know how to go.\"\n\nLispector had both vocation and talent, but what makes any artist's first steps so tentative is that the path forward is narrower than we imagine. We come into the world believing we can be a great many things (and for a great many this is true) but, for those destined to be artists, the creative choices they make are almost as limited as the choice of being an artist itself. Maugham wanted to demystify the impulse that had him give up medicine to answer his calling as a novelist. \"I am a writer as I might have been a doctor or a lawyer,\" he writes in \"The Summing Up,\" his 1938 literary memoir, but, soon after that, despite himself, Maugham stumbles on that aspect of the artistic life that eludes banalization, for it's truly mysterious - namely, the bond between the artist and his subject. \"Though the whole world,\" writes Maugham, \"with everyone in it and all its sights and events, is your material, you yourself can only deal with what corresponds to some secret spring in your own nature.\"\n\n\"Vanitas Still Life\" (circa 1665-70) by Jan van Kessel the Elder, who was from a long line of celebrated Flemish painters - Pieter Bruegel the Elder was his great-grandfather - and was perhaps destined to be an artist.\n\nIt's this, the inexorability of the correspondence between an artist and the world, that gives those first steps their magical quality. It represents a rebirth so profound that it can often entail the killing off of a former self. One of my literary heroes, the writer Rebecca West - the author of that magisterial work of travel, inquiry and sympathy \"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon: A Journey Through Yugoslavia\" (1940) - was abandoned (as I was) by her father as a child. In late Victorian England, it left her with an exaggerated regard for what were seen as male qualities, as well as the need to compensate for their absence. \"Men, she felt,\" writes J.R. Hammond in \"H.G. Wells and Rebecca West\" (1991), his biography of their romantic and literary relationship, \"should be strong and dependable; deep inside herself she sensed they were not to be trusted.\" These gendered dynamics were surely at work as West, first making her way in the world at age 20, sloughed off the softer given name of Cissie Fairfield to adopt, as a pseudonym, the name of the spirited protagonist of Henrik Ibsen's play \"Rosmersholm\" (1886).\n\nNo artist is without this set of special circumstances. They are the ground from which the need for expression arises. The path forward comes upon the artist-in-waiting with the power of certain mathematical proofs, elegant, inevitable, at once simple and inscrutable. \"Falling in love for the first time and getting started as a writer,\" my friend the writer Karan Mahajan, 39, the author of the novels \"Family Planning\" (2008) and \"The Association of Small Bombs\" (2016), replied by email when I asked him what it had been like for him, \"both things happened at once for me. Suddenly, I had my material, and it encompassed all aspects of my life: my childhood in Delhi; immigration to the United States as a student; a future decided by plane journeys. I could love myself as the other loved me.\"\n\nFor the Pakistani-born American painter Salman Toor, 40, the moment when, he says, \"something vital clicked into place\" meant that he suddenly found himself in \"a direct relationship\" between the things he was thinking and talking about every day and the paintings he was at work on. \"In 2016,\" he says, \"I did a few paintings out of a need to be completely honest with myself. I wanted to illustrate the stories I was bursting to tell. A lot of these stories were about coming out and showing the excitement, anxieties and challenges of belonging to multiple cultures and living a cute little life in the East Village.\"\n\nThe date surprised me. I had been aware of Toor's work for almost a decade before this moment. To me, he was the painter of a certain kind of South Asian disquiet. No one captured the massive cultural and economic disparities of my life in Delhi (and his in Lahore) like Toor. Upon scenes of revelry and privilege - a party, a picnic, a rich westernized couple frolicking out of doors with a glass of wine and an iPhone - he would, in the form of servants in the background looking on, introduce an element of unease that hinted at the fragility of the societies we lived in. But quite unbeknown to me, Toor's life in New York had opened up a new vein of material. To put it another way, he had begun again. And this is what we tend to forget: In the careers of certain artists, those who make big, varied bodies of work in which different strands of their experience are subsumed, the business of beginning, and beginning again, never ceases. Each new beginning brings with it all the uncertainty and blankness of the first. Experience might protect such an artist from forcing what's clearly not working, but that core anxiety of not knowing if one will create again always remains. \"Do not worry,\" Hemingway would console himself, \"you have always written before and you will write now.\"\n\nWHAT CONSTITUTES A beginning? In the common conception, it's the first book, the first album, the first show at a major gallery. Yet an artist has myriad private ways in which they mark moments of true breakthrough. My childhood friend the sitarist and composer Anoushka Shankar, 42, regards her fourth album as her first. She had grown up under the influence of her mighty father, Ravi Shankar, the man credited with having introduced Indian classical music to the West. Every artist struggles with what the literary critic Harold Bloom has called the anxiety of influence but, in Anoushka's case, it was even more pronounced. As she told me, Ravi Shankar was \"my guru, my teacher, my father.\" It was he who had composed her first three albums.\n\nRavi, before he went on to become the greatest sitarist of his generation, had been part of a dance troupe led by his brother Uday, which caused a sensation in the Europe and America of the 1930s. \"Hindu thought, alive, authentic, in flesh and bone, in sound, gesture and spirit,\" is how the French mystic René Daumal describes the Shankar troupe in his book \"Rasa\" (1982), but Ravi was conflicted. He eventually broke with the troupe and dedicated himself entirely to the sitar. \"He had a real directional shift that I didn't have,\" Anoushka says. Her beginnings, though she was six decades younger than her father, were in a sense more traditional. They entailed the surprise of finding newness within tradition. \"I think my journey,\" she says, \"was more progressively finding how the thing that was in front of me - the sitar, namely - the thing that had been given to me, could be my outlet, could be my voice.\"\n\nA coda to this intergenerational tale of artistic beginnings is the story of Anoushka's half sister, Norah Jones, who spent years of her childhood estranged from her father and grew up in Texas with her American mother. At a time when both Anoushka and I were discovering our half siblings, I remember going to see Norah play at little-known clubs on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. She was staking claim to what felt like a genetic destiny in music, though in a tradition entirely different from that of her father and sister. I don't know if I've ever witnessed beginnings as meager and transformational as these for, not long after, Norah's debut album, \"Come Away With Me\" (2002), was released; it went on to win five Grammys, sell 30 million copies and all but save the piracy-shattered music industry.\n\nWe live in a society that prizes the individual above all else but, in the art of premodern Europe and classical India, to begin as an artist didn't necessarily entail breaking with tradition, nor was it given to every artist to be original. \"Raphael was adept at this,\" writes Rachel Cusk in her travel memoir \"The Last Supper: A Summer in Italy\" (2009), in which she describes the Italian Renaissance painter's relationship to his first guru, Perugino. Raphael had become so good at imitating Perugino, Cusk tells us, that the copies of his master's work were indistinguishable from the originals. The art of pastiche, of inhaling the influence of an older admired artist so completely that it enters your soul, exists today, too. The South African writer J.M. Coetzee's early works owe a huge debt to Samuel Beckett, as Rushdie's do to Gabriel García Márquez and Thomas Pynchon's to James Joyce. The difference in the modern era is that influence is something we must shrug off in order to become our own people, yet not everyone can. Cusk deals very movingly with Raphael's quest (and ultimate failure) to be his own man. In a field crowded with giants such as Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, he \"retreated behind the mask of humility, never to come out again.\" But far from this being his downfall as an artist, it, too, was a kind of beginning. \"In the end,\" writes Cusk, \"his borrowing of such greatness amounted to greatness itself. Not everyone who sees a Michelangelo can go off and paint a Michelangelo.\"\n\nTHERE ARE SO many ways to begin. I said it wasn't my intention to open with a story of artistic death, but I never explained why I did. The reason is that after six books, and 20 years after writing my first publishable sentences, stamina, endurance and the ability to stay the course have come to mean at least as much to me as that first raw efflorescence of talent. If Zack's story acquired the force of parable for me, it was because it showed me the vanity of our preoccupation with talent. Many with fewer gifts who are yet more steadfast go on to have brilliant careers as artists. There's an undeniable mystery in why some among us become artists, but there's a greater mystery to me still in those who survive the vicissitudes of creative life, leaving behind bodies of work through which there runs an arc of growth as sublime as the vaulting of a Gothic cathedral.\n\nA true artist always brings something new into the world. A new color, a new complexion, a new way of looking - a \"new kind of beauty,\" to use Marcel Proust's phrase for the special distinctiveness he felt that Fyodor Dostoyevsky had brought to literature. We make the mistake of thinking of that newness as an externality, a scaffolding, a mere matter of style. But in fact, the originality we detect on the surface is an emanation from the birth of a new idea. It's something far more radical, far more unnerving, than we are prepared to accept. Real artists bring about real rupture. We want to domesticate the discomfort that makes us feel but, deep down, we know the old rules no longer apply; and for one fleeting moment, our world, with us in it, is laid bare, transfigured by the imagination of someone who has dared to see it anew.\n\nRead by Neil Shah.

I wasn't doing anything meaningful. Writing fiction allowed me, through subterfuge, to access emotional realms that I hadn't explored before. When you write your first novel, you tend to include a lot of autobiographical elements. \"The Joy Luck Club\" [about the lives of four Chinese immigrant women and their American-born daughters] became deeply personal without my knowing it. I wasn't consciously writing about racism or generational divides, even though that's exactly what I was writing about. At that time [Tan was 37 when the book came out], I was just trying to find a story.\n\nCourtesy of Putnam © 1989 Gretchen Schields. Photo by Joshua Scott\n\nPeople got all kinds of things out of it. They said it saved their marriage or helped their relationships. I felt wonderful about that, but I couldn't take credit. I didn't intend to write a book that was going to improve people's lives. That would've been a noble pursuit but, to do that, I'd have had to come up with a book that was very different - less spontaneous and honest. Without a doubt, what made me proudest was that my mother read it. She wasn't proficient in English, but she understood it more than anybody else. - L.G.\n\nLavigne at a recording studio in Cologne, Germany, in 2002. The musician's new tour, \"Avril Lavigne: The Greatest Hits,\" begins next month.\n\nFryderyk Gabowicz/Picture Alliance/Getty Images\n\nI remember going into the studio and people trying to tell me what to do or how my music should be, but I knew what I wanted to create. \"Let Go\" reflects how I felt as a young girl coming into the music industry. I was 15 when I got signed and 16 when I made that album. I had all this angst and rebellion, and I wanted to be expressive in that tone. But the adults around me kept delivering cheesy song ideas, and I wasn't feeling the way people were playing the guitar. It was all too light and fluffy; that's the stuff that made me run.\n\nCourtesy of Sony Music Entertainment and Avril Lavigne\n\nWhen I went to Los Angeles and connected with [the album's co-writers Lauren Christy, Graham Edwards and Scott Spock of] the Matrix and Clif Magness, they were way cooler and more open-minded. Lauren and I spent a lot of time together. I sat with her in the backyard on a picnic blanket writing \"Complicated\"; we really connected. I was finally understood. The production was a little poppy for me. If I had to redo the album today, I'd tweak some things here and there production-wise and apply some of my experience from the past 20 years. Still, the important songs like \"Sk8er Boi\" and \"Complicated\" rocked enough - they had the live guitar and drums - and \"I'm With You\" wasn't too polished. On songs like \"Unwanted\" and \"Losing Grip,\" we really went all the way - no holding back. - L.G.\n\nSevigny at the Jersey Shore in 1995.

The actress, who has appeared in over 50 features, recently shot \"Bonjour Tristesse,\" an upcoming adaptation of the 1954 Françoise Sagan novel.\n\nFrom left: Lila Lee-Morrison; © Shining Excalibur Pictures/courtesy of Everett Collection\n\nI still find the marketing around \"Kids\" [about a day in the life of some wayward New York City teenagers] a little outrageous: \"The most shocking film of the year!\" \"A must-see!\" But it worked. A lot of us making it thought of it as a cautionary tale, but so many kids have come up to me and said, \"That's why I moved to New York. I wanted to live that life.\" I was an amateur [at 19, when I made the film]. I knew the cinematographer, Eric Alan Edwards. He'd shot [Gus Van Sant's 1991 movie] \"My Own Private Idaho,\" and I thought the acting in that was impeccable. I trusted that if something [in my performance] was false, he'd say something. I don't know why, but I just gave myself over to [Edwards and the director, Larry Clark]; I trusted that they wanted to get to the truth of things.\n\nThe hardest scene for me to shoot was when [my character, 15-year-old Jennie] is at the clinic receiving information that she'd contracted H.I.V. I thought, \"How does one even begin to try to act that?\" I was very tentative. If I were to approach that scene now, I think I'd have the confidence to try more things - one take crying, others doing this and that. At the time, I was trying to be as real as I thought I could be on camera with a crew around me.\n\nI'm surprised that \"Kids\" is still making such an impact, but I'm also not. Afterward, I thought, \"OK, this set a bar. These are the kinds of people I want to work with.\" - N.A.\n\nKing, the author of over 70 books, with his wife, Tabitha, and their children (from left) Joe, Owen and Naomi at their house in Orrington, Maine, in 1979. His next book, a short-story collection titled \"You Like It Darker,\" will be published in May.\n\nJames Leonard\n\nOne of my rules about writing is similar to a rule in [the card game] Hearts: If it's laid, it's played. I have a tendency not to go back and reread things, particularly with \"Carrie\" [a horror novel about a bullied high school student capable of telekinesis]. I'm afraid of how naïve it may be, how much it might be the work of a very young writer. It's like when you're a kid and you don't know how to behave. You look back on certain things and say, \"I shouldn't have grabbed that,\" or, \"That wasn't polite.\" I don't want to go back and see that my shirttail was untucked or my fly was unzipped.\n\nCourtesy of Doubleday. Photo by Joshua Scott\n\nI'd change a lot. It would have a little more depth when it came to the characters. Remember, it started as a short story. I had this idea about a girl with paranormal powers who was going to get revenge on the girls who made fun of her. It was too long for the markets that I had in mind, and I didn't know very much about girls anyway, particularly girls' gym classes and locker rooms, so I threw the story away. My wife fished it out of the trash, uncrumpled the pages, looked at it and said, \"This is pretty good. I'll help you.\" It's a very short book, way under 300 pages. Also, there are pejoratives that were common then that I wouldn't use now, even though they're realistic and come out of the mouths of characters we don't like. On the whole, I must've done a fairly good job because the book was published [when I was 26] and [in 1976] they made a movie out of it.\n\nOne of the things I think about a lot was that my mother got to read it. She had cancer at that point and died before any of my other books were published. Because of \"Carrie,\" I had a chance to take care of her and get her in a hospice. By then we had the money, otherwise we would've been out of luck. - L.G.\n\nHolleran in Florida in the 1980s.

Three of the author's five novels, including \"Dancer From the Dance,\" were republished in paperback this past December.\n\nFrom left: Lee Calvin Yeomans, courtesy of Andrew Holleran; Ian Dickson/Shutterstock\n\n\"Dancer\" has had a life of its own, which I could've never predicted. I wrote the book at my parents' house in Florida one winter [when I was 33]. It was going to be the last book I ever wrote, because I'd been writing for 10 years after graduating from an M.F.A. program and had only had one story published in a magazine. I said to myself, \"You have to stop now and go to law school.\" Luckily, the book came out of me very quickly and, in retrospect, became a description of six years I'd spent in New York. It was very easy because I'd obviously touched something that mattered to me.\n\nI've never reread \"Dancer\" [about gay life in 1970s New York] so, while I'm sure that if I did, I'd revise, revise, revise, I can't imagine changing any of it. The campy style of the letters that frame the book is probably outdated, which is a shame since I love camp.\n\nI've learned since then that writing is basically unconscious, and you don't get any smarter about it. Imagine a brain surgeon who didn't learn from each operation? We'd be horrified. But when you sit down to write, you're always wondering how to do it. - L.G.\n\nHarry and Stein, of the rock band Blondie, in the U.K. in 1977.

It was a different era. I think the fact that the album wasn't overproduced gives it a kind of timelessness. We still perform some of those songs. Every once in a while, we drag up \"X Offender\" and \"Rip Her to Shreds.\"\n\nOur music wasn't just about one style or sound; we had songs that expressed different feelings and attitudes in music. A lot of things, like \"Man Overboard\" [a danceable heartbreak track], we really didn't pull off the way I think Chris wanted to, but it's there.\n\nChris Stein: That song would've worked fantastic with a dembow beat [but I wasn't introduced to reggaeton until years later]. If I were to change anything about the album, it'd have more to do with the production than what we were slapping on the tape. Generally, we'd just go in and do a bunch of takes, pick the best one, throw some stuff on it and that was pretty much it. There was hardly any overdubbing. We learned so much from the producer Mike Chapman a couple of years later - the difference between \"Blondie\" and our later albums was like night and day.\n\nStill, I like \"Blondie.\" It represents how we felt at the time and what was happening to us. When I look back on it, I think of the whole downtown milieu and a period in New York that I don't know if anyone thought we'd be talking about 50 years later. - L.G.\n\nSmith at her mother's home in northwest London in 2000. The author's sixth novel, \"The Fraud,\" was published last year.\n\nCourtesy of William Morrow. Photo by Joshua Scott\n\nI love the joy in my novel \"White Teeth\" [a multigenerational story of race and identity among the residents of London's Willesden neighborhood], even though I haven't picked it up in 25 years. Back then [Smith was 24 when the book came out], I was trying to write about people; I was interested in the interpersonal above all else. The people in the neighborhood I came from were always described in a manner of pathology, and I was trying to explain that we weren't pathological. I was always writing around this kind of elephant in the room, which is what you know people have already assumed about your characters. As I've gotten older, I've had to do less of that because I've got company. There are so many writers from so many countries, particularly in West Africa, [that] I wanted to see as a child.\n\nCourtesy of Penguin Random House\n\nI've become more interested in power lately. I'm very aware of being like the Ancient Mariner, that the structures I'm talking about that made life not always pathological have vanished. The conditions of the characters in \"White Teeth\" - their decent health care, their reasonable housing, their free university education - are gone. I'm still on the side of joy, but the question is, what kind of structures allow people to experience it. As I've gotten older, I write about them not out of nostalgia but out of political urgency. - L.G.\n\nLeft: a mock-up of Lin's 493-foot Vietnam Veterans Memorial.

I was moved by World War I memorials built by the French and British. They offered a much more realistic and sobering look at the high price of war, which is human life. When I went to the site [of what would become the monument] on Thanksgiving break [in 1980, when I was 20 and in my junior year at Yale], I felt a need to cut the earth and open it up. The structure isn't so much an object inserted into the earth; it's the earth itself being polished like a geode. I considered everything, even the walkway, which was put in to intentionally separate the wall from the ground. If you put the granite sidewalk all the way up against the wall, it would no longer be a polished geode - it'd be a curb. I put grass there. But no one could have predicted how popular it would be, so people trampled the grass and it died.\n\nA year or two after the memorial was built, unbeknown to me, the architects of record worked with [the National] Park Service to put in [Belgian blocks on either side of the granite path]. That needs to be rethought because it's an ugly detail. They're out of scale. It drives me crazy every time I see it. - L.G.\n\nChapman with the producer David Kershenbaum at a Los Angeles recording studio in 1987.

The musician's debut album will be reissued on vinyl this summer to mark its 35th anniversary.\n\nFrom left: Lester Cohen/Getty Images; courtesy of Elektra Records\n\nI had this notion when I first started writing songs that to respect the muse - or whatever source of inspiration brought me to put pen to paper - I shouldn't do any editing. The first thing that came to me was meant to be. \"Talkin' Bout a Revolution,\" which I wrote when I was 16, emerged from that mind-set. It was one of those songs that came out in one sitting. It's a very forceful declaration.\n\nA song like \"Fast Car,\" which I wrote when I was maybe 22, wasn't a very long process, but it reflected a different strategy about songwriting. It was more about revelation, sharing a story about a person and the changes happening in their life. I made edits to \"Fast Car.\" I definitely changed words and lines. I'm too embarrassed to tell you exactly what, but it was the verse that starts \"See, my old man's got a problem.\" Let's just say that there was something else there.\n\nIn some ways, writing a song is about asking and answering questions: \"Who is this character, why are they doing this and where is the story going?\" When I was young, I thought all these questions could be answered with the first iteration of the song. I'm not as enamored with this idea that the very first thing that comes to mind is what I have to remain committed to. - L.G.\n\nJewel at the musician Neil Young's private studio in Northern California in 1994.

I liked [the writers] Charles Bukowski and Anaïs Nin because they told the truth about themselves, and it wasn't always pretty. With my work, my goal was to be just as honest. \"Pieces of You\" wasn't more developed than I was - I didn't know how to play with a band, and I didn't choose a producer who'd make me sound slicker or lend their experience to make me sound more polished. I wanted it to be a snapshot of who I was [between 16 and 19]: inexperienced, emotionally charged and trying to figure life out.\n\nCourtesy of Craft Recordings and Jewel\n\nWriting was medicine for me. I had extreme anxiety, panic attacks and agoraphobia. I wrote songs to calm myself down and to help me fall asleep at night. I never wrote them thinking I'd have a career. There wasn't really a craft - it was more about what comforted me, what suited me, what interested me to think and write about. I was an avid reader, and a lot of my writing took after Flannery O'Connor, [John] Steinbeck and [Anton] Chekhov, like short stories put to music.\n\nI remember writing at that age that I didn't want my music to be my best work of art - I wanted my life to be my best work of art. I take music seriously, but I take that promise to myself more seriously. - L.G.\n\nThese interviews have been edited and condensed.\n\nInterviews by Ella Riley-Adams, Nick Haramis, Nicole Acheampong, Julia Halperin and Coco Romack\n\nLove, spats, splits and enduring affinity: creative partnerships that have stood the test of time.\n\nVideo by Kurt Collins\n\nVideo by Kurt Collins\n\nJANE FONDA: It was 1978, and I heard that Lily Tomlin was performing in a [one-woman] show called \"Appearing Nitely\" in Los Angeles. I don't know how many characters she played, but she embodied them all so fully. I was smitten. I went backstage to meet her. At the time, I was in the process of developing \"9 to 5\" [the 1980 comedy about a trio of female office workers who overthrow the company's sexist boss] and, as I was driving home, I thought, \"I don't want to be in a movie about secretaries unless Lily Tomlin is in it.\"\n\nLILY TOMLIN: She swept in backstage with a big cape on. We couldn't believe it - this was Jane Fonda! For a couple of years, I'd worn a hairdo from \"Klute\" [the 1971 thriller for which Fonda won an Oscar], but I didn't have it when she showed up that day. I was like, \"Why did I drop my 'Klute' hairdo at this propitious time?\"\n\nJ.F.: It took a good year to convince Lily and Dolly [Parton, the film's other lead] to do the movie. It's not that they weren't interested, but it was very difficult. Why was it so difficult, Lily?\n\nL.T.: I think I was that way about everything.\n\nFrom left: Fonda, 86, and Tomlin, 84, photographed at Hubble Studio in Boyle Heights, Los Angeles, on Jan. 29, 2024.\n\nKanya Iwana\n\nJ.F.: You are that way about everything: \"I don't know if I can do this. I'm not right for the part.\" You do that every time. But it was your idea to get Colin Higgins to direct and to cast Dabney Coleman [as the boss]. You should've been the one producing it! My only decision was to make the movie, because one of my close friends, [the former director of the U.S. Department of Labor Women's Bureau] Karen Nussbaum, would tell me stories about organizing women office workers and what they had to go through.\n\nL.T.: I thought I had some lines that were hitting you over the head with the joke. Yet when the movie was released, those lines got the biggest response from the audience.\n\nJ.F.: Both of us got a kick out of Dolly's innocence. When she showed up the first day, she'd memorized the entire script. And then the day that Dolly sang -\n\nL.T.: Oh, that was a glorious moment.\n\nJ.F.: She used her long nails like a washboard and started to sing, \"Working 9 to 5. ...\" Lily and I looked at each other and we knew: \"This is it - we've got an anthem.\" But I think my favorite shooting experiences were when we had the dead body in the back of the car. We went to the Apple Pan [a diner in Los Angeles] because Dolly wanted to get a cheeseburger, remember?\n\nL.T.: Everybody would tell stories about their life, and we just fell in love with each other.\n\nJ.F.: Our worlds are so different. Our backgrounds are so different. Our senses of comedy - I mean, I don't really have one.\n\nL.T.: Jane was so earnest. She felt so passionate about every activist problem that she was trying to solve. It was inspiring and endearing.\n\nJ.F.: Since then, we've done seven seasons of [the Netflix TV series] \"Grace and Frankie\" [which ran from 2015 to 2022]. Ten days after we wrapped, we started a movie that we both like a lot called \"Moving On.\" When that came out [in 2023], I was interested in the reviews - almost every one of them talked about our chemistry. And it was like, \"Well, maybe we should always work together.\" - E.R.A.\n\nFonda: Hair: Jonathan Hanousek at Exclusive Artists Management. Makeup: David Deleon at Allyson Spiegelman Management.

I knew your work very well, and I knew that you'd done an ad in 1984 for [the French fashion brand] Dorothée Bis. That made me think, \"Maybe she'd do this with us.\" I was a little intimidated about asking.\n\nCINDY SHERMAN: I was so intimidated that you'd asked. I remember thinking, \"I'm going to bring a bunch of wigs and makeup.\" It was just me for a few shots, but then [the German photographer] Juergen [Teller] got playful and started putting himself in the pictures. He gradually shaved parts of his face and head. He'd started the shoot with a full head of hair and beard; by the end, he was completely bald with no facial hair at all.\n\nM.J.: I wasn't there, but I got calls from Juergen saying, \"It's [expletive] excellent, it's [expletive] excellent.\" He says that when he's really excited. You created some hilarious characters. There was one where you were both older, sitting on a bench.\n\nC.S.: Rifling through a big bag.\n\nM.J.: That image became a billboard on Melrose [Avenue in Los Angeles]. It was great because fashion campaigns like that didn't exist back then. Nobody would've ever said, \" That's our ad,\" because it wasn't exactly selling clothes or bags. But it was exciting.\n\nC.S.: What's funny is that you'd asked me, a year or two ago during Covid, to do something - I don't even remember what it was. I'd gained a bit of weight, so I was self-conscious and kept turning you down. [For the 2024 campaign I ended up doing] some of the outfits were a little tight. The people assisting me said, \"We can fix that.\" And I said, \"No, no, it's [perfect for] the character.\" I guess I could've thought of someone who was trying to hide, but I decided, \"No, she seems like she could just let it all hang out in her leather pants.\" How do you feel when you see different types of women wearing your pieces or putting them together in unusual ways?\n\nM.J.: It's the ultimate validation. Of all the stuff that exists out there, they're spending their money on something I've made. How about you with collectors?\n\nC.S.: Sometimes it's a little weird. I remember an early series of horizontal pictures that I called \"The Centerfolds\" (1981) - I thought they were kind of disturbing, but some collector said, \"I have that one hanging over my bed because it's so sexy.\" And I'm thinking, \"Ugh, I don't want to know that.\" But you can't control what happens to a piece.\n\nM.J.: Or what other people see in it. Feedback is part of the equation. It's like, \"I'm not just doing this for me. I need you.\" - E.R.A.\n\nProduction: Prodn. Hair: Tsuki at Streeters. Makeup assistant: Nanase.

Like Truman Capote's swans, we had salads and talked about water and weight loss.\n\nCARLOS NAZARIO: It wasn't like we were meeting to discuss a project. That sort of evolved organically.\n\nW.C.: I was terrified to ask you to work with me. I remember texting to [see] if you'd style my [fall 2023] show. Do you know what you said? \"I thought you'd never ask.\"\n\nC.N.: Willy's work spoke to me in such a profound way. There was such a similarity - if not in aesthetic, definitely in intention. A lot of brands lack depth and a soul. I'm Afro-Latino. I grew up in New York with a certain relationship to how one presents themselves to the world, what glamour means and looks like and how it's communicated. I was always intrigued by how Willy's designs encompassed all those things.\n\nW.C.: [The way we collaborate] is so natural and unpretentious. We end up telling a story that we feel good about.\n\nC.N.: Every relationship between a stylist and designer is unique. Some designers require a lot more - from research to manufacturing and the show. Others want you to come in right at the end and say, \"Let's put that on this model.\" With Willy, our conversations prior to my first day were conceptual. We talked about what he wanted it to feel like, rather than what he wanted it to look like.\n\nW.C.: For that first show together, we wanted the cast - all people of color, many of them queer and trans - to feel elevated and empowered. Marlon [Taylor-Wiles, the show's movement director] was going to have the models look down at the guests.\n\nC.N.: At the rehearsal, we were like, \"Maybe it's a bit creepy.\" I wasn't uncomfortable [giving my opinion] because Willy's such an easy person to talk to. But anytime you're coming into a space where everyone has clearly defined roles, you feel like a stepparent. You're a bit like, \"Do I discipline the daughter? Do I tell her the skirt's too short?\" I didn't want to overstep, but I also wanted to make my presence worth it. As we got more comfortable [with each other], we got more comfortable trying things.\n\nW.C.: The next season, we took more risks. We wanted it to feel refined and elegant, but we also wanted to inject a youthfulness.\n\nC.N.: At a lot of [brands], it's like, \"This season, everything's a miniskirt. If your thighs aren't great, see you in the fall!\" Willy's casting allows for a very broad vision in terms of what the styling can do: You'll have someone like me, who's 5-foot-4 [Nazario walked in the fall 2024 show], and then you'll have someone who's 6-foot-4.\n\nW.C.: You'll have a woman in her late 50s and a 17-year-old boy.\n\nC.N.: Everyone from twinks to daddies. If you tried to dress everyone the same, it'd be a disaster.\n\nW.C.: I can suggest something that you don't like, and you'll say, \"Let's go with it. Let's see.\" And I'll do the same. I've worked with stylists who will deliberate over the positioning of a hat for hours. The stress level is so intense, it kills the moment. Having the freedom [to experiment reflects] a levity we want the brand to have. You know, we address serious subjects, like human rights, inclusion ...\n\nC.N.: Self-identity. But if we're stressed, everyone's stressed. We try to keep it light, but we also understand the weight of the responsibility. It's rare that you work with people who understand what you're feeling and what you want to convey. And I think our trust lies in that. - N.H.\n\nPhoto assistants: Eamon Colbert, Jordan Zuppa\n\nVideo by Melody Melamed\n\nVideo by Melody Melamed\n\nMINK STOLE: John, I've just been told your conference line is charging me a penny a minute.\n\nJOHN WATERS: Oh, c'mon.

My memory's that we met in Provincetown, Mass., right before doing my second movie [the 1967 short] \"Roman Candles\" [in which Stole plays a party guest who gets spanked]. She was looking to go bad and found the right crowd. Prescott Townsend, one of the first gay radicals, allowed us to live in a tree fort he'd made.\n\nM.S.: That was the summer I got introduced to homosexuality.\n\nJ.W.: Did we take acid that summer?\n\nM.S.: I kind of think we did, yeah.\n\nJ.W.: And then we took it again 50 years later. My mother always used to say, \"Don't tell young people to take drugs.\" But I'm not - I'm telling old people to. Anyway, we shot \"Roman Candles\" partly at my parents' house and, oddly enough, a decade later, you filmed a big scene at that same house, in my parents' bedroom, when you played [the delusional housewife] Peggy Gravel in \"Desperate Living\" [1977].\n\nFrom left: Stole, 76, and Waters, 77, photographed, respectively, at Edge Studios in Mid-Wilshire, Los Angeles, on Feb. 4, 2024, and at Waters's home in Tuscany-Canterbury, Baltimore, on March 7, 2024.\n\nMelody Melamed\n\nM.S.: We threw a baseball through a window and kind of trashed the place. Your mom was a sport.\n\nJ.W.: So was yours. Mink and I were arrested [along with three other members of the crew] for conspiracy to commit indecent exposure while making [the 1969 film] \"Mondo Trasho.\" It was in the paper. They printed your poor mother's address.\n\nM.S.: We were acquitted.\n\nJ.W.: We'd been filming a scene at Johns Hopkins University with [the actor and drag performer] Divine, in full makeup and a gold lamé top with matching toreador pants, in a 1959 red Cadillac convertible with the top down in November. I never asked permission [to shoot]. The police came and we all ran. The fact that we got caught and Divine escaped didn't say a lot for the Baltimore police. Mink played an escaped mental patient; she did a nude tap dance.\n\nM.S.: I'd get upset when the press would call us unprofessional because, although it was true that not one of us had ever taken an acting lesson, we were incredibly professional. And none of it was ad-libbed. John wouldn't have tolerated that. He knew every comma, every \"and,\" every \"but.\"\n\nJ.W.: What's that French term for people who go crazy when they're together?\n\nM.S.: \"Folie à something\"?\n\nJ.W.: \"Folie à famille.\" Everybody chipped in, and we just went for it.\n\nT: Mink, were there any scenes you refused to shoot?\n\nM.S.: Before we started filming \"Pink Flamingos\" [1972, in which Stole plays the proprietor of a black-market baby ring], John very casually said, \"Will you set your hair on fire?\" And I said, \"Yes, that'll look great on film.\" But then as the moment approached, I panicked.\n\nJ.W.: I was on pot when I thought of that.\n\nM.S.: It would've been great, except that I'd be bald today. I think that's the only thing I ever refused to do.\n\nT: What've you learned from each other?\n\nM.S.: In the early films, we all acted largely. We spoke in italics. In the later ones, when I'd start to behave that way, John would say, \"Take it down.\" I was shocked [the first time he said it].\n\nJ.W.: When we made those early movies, I was influenced by the theater of the ridiculous - by cruelty, shouting and craziness. It wasn't them overacting, it was me telling them to overact.\n\nM.S.: I have enormous respect for John, and John for me. Aside from the fact that I love him dearly, I don't know where I'd be if I hadn't met him.\n\nJ.W.: And we've never had the same boyfriend.\n\nM.S.: Or wanted the same boyfriend.\n\nJ.W.: Mink and I have been through a lot together. We've fought, we've made up. I don't trust people who don't have old friends. For me, they outlast family. Mink and I are even going to be buried together in the same graveyard. We call it Disgraceland. - N.H.\n\nWaters: Makeup: Cheryl Pickles Kinion.

It was the summer of 1992.\n\nHANK WILLIS THOMAS: I'd been recruited to work with Coby to renovate the darkroom at Howard University [in Washington, D.C.], where his father [Winston Kennedy] was the chair of the art program. We were in high school. Building a darkroom when you don't really know how - that's kind of the way we've always worked. Back then, Coby was a street writer.\n\nC.K.: A graffiti writer, in the parlance of our times. My graffiti and school crews melded into this conglomerate [called] the Earthbound Homies.\n\nH.W.T.: This was [during the] peak '90s hip-hop days. The group was [made up of] all these young, primarily Black artists. I wasn't one of them, I was a documenter.\n\nC.K.: Hank was in museum studies, while the rest of us were in visual arts. He was very quiet and observant. It felt like he was always regarding you.\n\nH.W.T.: The core of our relationship has been fostering opportunities for others to interlace their practices. The Wide Awakes [their most recent art collective, named after a progressive group that supported Abraham Lincoln during the 1860 presidential election] took off in my old studio in December 2019.\n\nC.K.: We were trying to plug into society and see how we could influence it. When 2020 happened - the pandemic, the lockdown, the insurrection - we really hit the accelerator with it.\n\nH.W.T.: I'd call the Wide Awakes our first public collaboration. But then again, 2016 is when \"Reach\" [their sculpture at Chicago's O'Hare airport] first started. We're excited to have it be one of the largest public acknowledgments of something we've been doing for 30 years.\n\nC.K.: In our collaborations, we kind of fill in each other's gaps.\n\nH.W.T.: As a conceptual artist, I have great ideas - a lot of them. Coby, who has a history as an industrial designer and animator, is the bridge between the proposal and how it happens. With virtually every one of my public sculptures, he's done all the initial concepting. He's always had this ability to see what others are thinking. We also have different tastes.\n\nC.K.: And they're sometimes at odds with each other, which is one of the best parts [of our working relationship], because I'd hate for both of us to be middle ground.\n\nH.W.T.: Coby has a very clear, singular vision, while I create art through consensus. I want to make a statement [so I'm often asking others], \"What do you think about it?\" I envy Coby's talent. But I also think not having his talent gives me a reliance on other people, which is helpful in the context of making public art.\n\nC.K.: I know that he'll tell me the truth about anything I come up with, and he knows that if I have to talk trash about one of his ideas, I'll talk trash about it.\n\nH.W.T.: As much as I'd like Coby to think like me, then he wouldn't be him and I wouldn't be me. We allow each other to be who we are. - N.A.\n\nFrom left: Dragset, 54, and Elmgreen, 62, photographed at their studio in Neukölln, Berlin, on Feb. 7, 2024.\n\nJulia Sellmann\n\nINGAR DRAGSET: We met at After Dark, the only gay club at the time in Copenhagen, in 1994. I was 24 and Michael was 32. I thought he looked amazing - he had this Dennis Rodman-style hair that was bleached with baroque black patterns on it. We both had big Dr. Martens boots and were much grungier than the rest of the crowd.\n\nMICHAEL ELMGREEN: The club was a classic disco - a lot of blown-out hair and Gloria Gaynor. It wasn't difficult to spot each other.\n\nI.D.: We got more than a little tipsy. When we both started to walk home, we realized that we lived not only in the same neighborhood but in the same building. That was the beginning of our 10-year romantic relationship. The artistic collaboration started eight months later, a little bit by accident. I was doing theater at the time.\n\nM.E.: I was writing poetry and experimenting with texts that would morph in front of people's eyes on IBM computers. To my surprise, I was considered a visual artist.\n\nI.D.: Michael got invited to do an exhibition in Stockholm. He had the idea of creating abstract pets that people could cuddle, but he didn't know how to make them. And I said, \"Well, I'm good at knitting.\" So that's how the collaboration started.\n\nM.E.: The Swedes are, as we know, a bit stiff; they were terrified about interacting with the artwork. So we were sitting in [opposite] corners with these knitted pets, cuddling them, and people thought it was a performance.\n\nI.D.: That accidental performance inspired us to do more. The next one was a piece where I was furiously knitting at one end of a very long white cloth while Michael was unraveling everything from the other end. That should tell you a bit about our partnership.\n\nM.E.: When we were coupled, we were almost the same size in clothes, so we even shared socks, we shared bank accounts, all our friends.\n\nI.D.: We had one email account, one cellphone.\n\nM.E.: Starting a new chapter after we split up was like meeting again, workwise. We had separate lives for some hours of the day. Suddenly, you could bring in exciting things that the other hadn't experienced.\n\nI.D.: It was a very difficult time. We put most things on hold, but we had one exhibition that would've been hard to cancel: a solo show at Tate Modern [in London]. In a big room with a window overlooking the Thames, we added another windowpane and, in between the panes, we had an animatronic but very realistic-looking sparrow that seemed to be gasping for life and flapping its wings, and nobody could help it.\n\nM.E.: I think the beauty of it all was that we dared to stop being boyfriends because we knew we wouldn't lose each other. Today, it'd be impossible to say who came up with what idea. It's not two half authorships. It's like this imaginary third persona in between us that we feed - an invisible genius kid who's much, much younger, brighter and more charming than either of us. He's creating the artworks. - J.H.\n\nFrom left: Menuez, 30, and Bailey-Gates, 30, photographed at Smashbox Studios in Culver City, Calif., on Feb. 1, 2024.\n\nJoyce Kim\n\nBOBBI SALVÖR MENUEZ: I curated a 2014 show at [the Brooklyn exhibition space] Muddguts that was part of a series in which I invited people who didn't always make performance work to create something in a performance context. We'd been in a group show together before and had mutual friends, and I was excited about the work I was seeing Michael make.\n\nMICHAEL BAILEY-GATES: It was me, Bobbi and maybe two or three other people. I had this party trick of being able to talk really fast, like an auctioneer. When I said certain phrases, one of them would stand up, and another would scream at the top of their lungs or throw an object at someone.\n\nB.S.M.: It felt like the beginning of us making things together on the fly. We both had this down-to-get-into-it energy that was well matched.\n\nM.B.G.: We shared an urgency to make work come to life. Sometimes it's as simple as being a body for another person. I've been the lead in Bobbi's performances, and I've been in the background, lying on a floor covered in red paint. Performance art in New York at the time was about executing an idea without a lot of money. These days, I don't go into a shoot thinking we're performing, but it's very much that: The camera is the audience looking back at us.\n\nB.S.M.: Michael has this ability to see the kaleidoscopic possibility of someone's self- expression. Around 2018, I was out as nonbinary to my close friends and finding my new name. I took a break from auditions and started working part-time as a substitute teacher. When a film I'd shot the year before got into [the 2019] Sundance [Film Festival], it was an invitation to step back into the spotlight. I'd shaved my head and was nervous about that formal, public coming- out moment. It just felt so cringe. I went to Los Angeles before going to Sundance and made some pictures with Michael that were only for us. Those were the first images of Bobbi that entered the world.\n\nM.B.G.: I never want to make a picture of somebody that's not reflective of them. I've chosen in my practice to always focus on a small group of friends, and those collaborations are the grounding force of my work. Without them, what would my pictures be? They'd be something less precious. - C.R.\n\nMakeup: Zenia Jaeger at Streeters using Submission Beauty. Hair assistant: Drew Martin. Production: Resin Projects.

Miller and Emily Lordi\n\nWhat it's like to make new art after many years or amid new challenges - or to change careers completely.\n\nLeon, 48, photographed at his restaurant Chifa in Los Angeles on Dec. 14, 2023.\n\nRyan James Caruthers\n\nThen: The co-founder, with Carol Lim, of Opening Ceremony, the influential New York clothing store established in 2002; the co-creative director of the French fashion house Kenzo between 2011 and 2019.\n\nNow: Co-runs three restaurants in Los Angeles - Chifa, Monarch and Arroz & Fun.\n\nIn 1975, the year I was born, my mom opened a restaurant in Lima - my mom's from Hong Kong, my dad from Peru - and so I've always thought of a meal as a way to learn and to meet new people. In 2020, I'd recently quit Kenzo and sold Opening Ceremony. My sisters and brother-in-law were in the midst of changes of their own, and we'd always wanted to tell my mom's story. So we decided to open a restaurant together in Eagle Rock, the Los Angeles neighborhood where my family first lived when we immigrated to the United States in the late '70s. We named it Chifa, after my mom's place in Lima, and based the menu on a similar mix of classic Peruvian dishes like lomo saltado (beef stir fry) and anticucho (meat skewers) and Chinese home cooking - though my brother-in-law, the chef John Liu, has added some of his Taiwanese family's culinary staples, too.\n\nStarting anything new is scary, and I didn't have the confidence to do so until the pandemic, which gave me time to try new ideas. (I also wrote a screenplay and a script for a TV show.) I tried to channel the intuition [I'd brought to Opening Ceremony] into other fields. I realized that what I'd done with the store was ultimately about the fond memories people had of the place rather than any specific product. Food does something similar: It creates conversations and memories.\n\nI had the same feeling when I opened the store: \"Will anyone show up?\" We'd built Opening Ceremony from the ground up - no ads, only word of mouth - and that experience lent itself to launching Chifa, as well as Monarch and Arroz & Fun [our second and third restaurants, which opened last year in the Arcadia and Lincoln Heights neighborhoods, respectively]. In many ways, I'm bringing the same sensibility to the restaurants that I brought to Opening Ceremony: They're places where you can discover new things. We aren't aiming for formality or perfection. If anything, part of the experience is dropping your fork and noticing the cool terrazzo floor or really looking at the flatware, which we made with the designer Izabel Lam. As a person who shops and eats a lot, I want to be excited, to feel that nervousness of trying something new. - M.S.\n\nCave, 66, photographed at his studio near his home in Brighton, England, on Jan. 29, 2024.\n\nSiân Davey\n\nThen: Rose to prominence with his post-punk band the Bad Seeds, formed in Melbourne, Australia, in 1983; became one of rock's most celebrated lyricists and performers.\n\nNow: Makes ceramics at a studio close to his home on the south coast of England, and his first major solo show, \" The Devil - A Life ,\" is on view now through May 11 at Xavier Hufkens gallery in Brussels. Will release a new record with the Bad Seeds later this year.\n\nI learned early on that the grand designs you have in life don't always pan out. Starting in secondary school, I wanted to be a painter. I went to art school [for university in 1976] and, to my horror, failed my second year. At the same time, my first band [the Boys Next Door, which eventually became the Birthday Party] was starting to do well in the underground scene in Melbourne. I was much more interested in painting - I did figurative work that often referenced myself - but I'd failed, so I carried on with the band.\n\nI started making ceramics during the pandemic. I collect Victorian Staffordshire-style figurines, the sort of thing an English grandmother might have on her mantelpiece, and one day I thought, \"I could make these.\" I found I was really swept up by clay. I struggle hugely with writing songs - not the music, but the lyrics. They never feel good enough. Mostly it's all doubt and despair. But I don't think I've felt more pleasure than I have when pulling a piece out of the kiln and looking at something I've made with my hands.\n\nAt some point, I had an idea to make a devil, mostly because I wanted to paint a figure in a fiery red glaze. I made one devil and then others, and eventually they began to tell a story. In the beginning, there's a sort of lightheartedness about this wicked little guy: In his youth, he's embedded in the world and in love with it. But then he kills his child, and [the figures] get dark and desperate. Later, he becomes remorseful and dies a terrible death. And in the end he's forgiven by his child.\n\nThe death of a child is obviously very important to me because two of my own children have died. [Cave's son Arthur died in 2015 at age 15. His oldest son, Jethro, died in 2022 at age 31.] And the works were saying something very powerful to me about my unfolding situation in life, something that my songs didn't really talk about. I found that I could look at this poor devil in a pool of tears, with his lost child extending his hand to him, as a kind of meditation on my own place in the world and find a way that I - or we or whoever - may live a life. - M.H.M.\n\nRoca, 45, photographed at Rocambolesc Gelateria in Girona, Spain, on March 13, 2024.\n\nAnna Bosch Miralpeix\n\nThen: Joined the restaurant El Celler de Can Roca - founded in 1986 by his brothers, Joan and Josep, in Girona, Spain - in 1997, becoming head pastry chef in 2000.\n\nNow: After starting his own gelateria chain, Rocambolesc, in Girona with his wife, Alejandra Rivas, in 2012, and being diagnosed with a rare neurological disorder four years later, opened an outpost of the gelateria in Houston in 2022 with a neurodiverse team.\n\nWhen I first started to lose my voice, it didn't have much of an effect on my creative process in the kitchen. I had to learn to interact more through gesture, but I could still speak during quieter moments. That was around 2016, when I was giving a lot of interviews. It was a period in my career when I needed to speak but, instead, was a time of introspection. Once I got the diagnosis - I have an unusual expression of spasmodic dysphonia [a neurological disorder that causes spasms in the voice box] - it meant I could finally move forward. Now I think of this as just part of who I am.\n\nThe idea to open a U.S. branch of Rocambolesc, the gelateria, which has five locations in Spain, came a year or so before this. In 2015, when we were [hosting] cooking events around the world for Celler de Can Roca, we met our business partner Ignacio Torres in Houston. He has family members with autism, and having a place that would hire people with autism and Down syndrome was part of his idea from the beginning. By the time we opened Rocambolesc in Houston in 2022, we'd already had experiences in Celler de Can Roca with team members who had neurological differences. But staffing a project with a neurodiverse team was a huge personal gamble taken by Ignacio and his wife, Isabel, to transform the stigmas around neurodivergence in the United States. The project's really been embraced in Houston. We have staff who've been with us right from the beginning. Of course, my own difficulties have given me a deeper empathy with people who can't always express themselves in the way they might like. But what I've learned - especially through this project - is that we all live in the same world. There're just many ways to see it. - M.S.\n\nNamoda, 35, photographed with paintings in progress at her studio in Biella, Italy, on Feb. 25, 2024.\n\nClaudia Gori\n\nThen: A visual artist known for her spare yet color-rich depictions of contemporary African people and landscapes who was last based in the Berkshires region of Massachusetts.\n\nNow: Living in Biella, in the Piedmont region of northern Italy, where she's working in a new studio and preparing to become a mother.\n\nBiella has a beautiful, fantastical landscape - you have a backdrop of the snowcapped Alps, but there are also palm trees, beeches, pines and cypresses. It's an easier flight to my family in Mozambique [than from the United States]. And we're a 10-minute drive away from my husband's family.\n\nI found an incredible studio where I can visualize having my child and making magnificent work. The commercial art world is a masculine environment. But this is my own world. There's a large kitchen with big windows and an amazing chef's oven, so there can be lunches. I'll put in a daybed because I know I need naps. There'll be a baby corner, with a crib and maybe some safe paints. I'm really into self-preservation and embracing femininity.\n\nMy life before was very utilitarian. Some days, I'd get to the studio early and be there until 3 or 4 a.m., eating popcorn and puffing on a cigarette. The child has already forced me to have a healthier balance with work. But I have these dreams about me before [there was] this new spirit in me. It's not a somber or sad thing, like, \"Oh, I wish I was Cassi in Tambacounda, Senegal, plein-air painting in the field.\" But I'm remembering that person.\n\nI finally got into the Italian health care system, which has been a nightmare. It's not superfriendly to foreigners. Meanwhile, I'm preparing for a solo exhibition in September and a museum show opening in December. In my head I'm like, \"The baby's coming really soon, I don't really have a doctor, I'm still setting up my studio and I have a 53-foot-long cargo container with all of my belongings arriving on Monday!\"\n\nThere are large works to start but, with this heavy belly, I can't balance on a ladder. I might bring the canvases down to the floor and rest them on bricks. I'm visiting a softer, more romantic side. The world's in a dark place; why not make something beautiful? I'm seeing flamingo pink and yellow and sandy tones. It's soft and rosy. I don't think it's because I'm having a girl - the sex of the baby is a surprise - but that's how I'm feeling right now. - E.L.\n\nBon Jovi, 62, photographed at his restaurant JBJ Soul Kitchen in Red Bank, N.J., on March 1, 2024.\n\nSebastian Sabal-Bruce\n\nThen: Co-founded the rock band Bon Jovi in Sayreville, N.J., in 1983. Began experiencing vocal difficulties in 2014.\n\nNow: Is recovering from throat surgery, a process depicted, among other things, in the docuseries \"Thank You, Goodnight: The Bon Jovi Story,\" out this month. Will release a new album, \"Forever,\" with the band in June.\n\nMy problems started about a decade ago. In 2013, we had the number one tour in the world, and I was great for 100-plus shows. But in 2014, I wasn't really making any music, which was hard psychologically. Then some of the recordings and shows we did, especially after 2017, were challenging - my range seemed to have narrowed and it was becoming difficult to sing consistently. But none of the professionals I saw could figure it out.\n\nIn March 2022, a doctor in Philadelphia explained that one of my vocal cords was atrophying. I thought I could get my voice back in shape if I just did enough shows, so I went back on the road. But it was a struggle. Finally, that June, I had an implant put [inside the cartilage of my larynx] to bring my [vocal folds] together. There was no singing at all for the first six weeks. Then I started speech therapy. I have rehab four times a week. But I'm still not sure what to expect. Yesterday when I was rehearsing with the band, I had a rough go with the song \"Limitless\" from the album \"2020\" [released by the group that same year]. I said, \"Guys, I only ever sang this song when I was broken. I don't know how to sing it not broken.\" If I had the word \"lay,\" I'd put an \"E\" on the end of it to try to push it up to pitch: \"layeee.\" But right after that, I popped the high notes on [our 1986 hit] \"Livin' on a Prayer.\"\n\nThis new album's much more of a collaborative record than the ones I've made in the past. It's a celebration of my accepting any and all input and acts of kindness. It's not been a good decade. It's not been easy to not be the best guy in the band; it's not easy to be the worst. It's humbling but I don't mind the humility. I just want my tools back. Yesterday, I pressed the point-of-no-return button and said yes, in theory, to a handful of possible shows abroad for the summer, the first ones since the spring of 2022. I'm not an applause junkie. I do it because I love to write a song and play it for people. If I have all my tools, it'll be a joy. - E.L.\n\nGrooming: Loraine Abeles\n\nKaphar, 47, photographed at his studio in New Haven, Conn., on Feb. 22, 2024.\n\nArtwork, from left: Titus Kaphar, \"I Knew,\" 2023 © Titus Kaphar; Titus Kaphar, \"Do You Want It Back?\" 2023 © Titus Kaphar; Titus Kaphar, \"Some Things Can't Be Worked Out on Canvas,\" 2023 © Titus Kaphar\n\nThen: An artist whose works, which often confront family history and the experience of being Black in America, are in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art, among other institutions.\n\nNow: Wrote and directed his first feature-length film, \"Exhibiting Forgiveness,\" which premiered at Sundance in January. Paintings Kaphar made for the film (pictured above) will be shown at Gagosian in Beverly Hills in September.\n\n\"Exhibiting Forgiveness\" started as a series of paintings - in particular, with one of a burning lawn mower. It didn't take long to realize that what I was doing wasn't best processed with paintings alone. [The film focuses on a successful artist, Tarrell, played by André Holland, who struggles to deal with the reappearance of his estranged, abusive father, La'Ron, played by John Earl Jelks, who'd force Tarrell to perform grueling manual labor as a child.] The power of painting's often the absences: what's not there, what's implicit. You don't know what happened before and you don't know what will happen after. In film, you have an opportunity for elaboration.\n\nI've tried hard not to read reviews of the film, though a friend sent me one. It was positive but what [the critic] wrote at the end, I'll never forget. He said, \"But I can't say this film is entertaining.\" [ Laughs. ] With film, some of us expect entertainment, to have a great time. And that response does frame the way we distinguish film from painting. As a painter, I don't stand in front of [Pablo Picasso's] \"Guernica\" and go, \"This isn't entertaining!\" I didn't approach filmmaking as anything different from painting. I wanted the film to be a painting in motion. The way I make decisions in the studio, about how to follow my intuition or instincts, or how to lay out a composition, was the same process I used on set. The difference is I had an extraordinary cinematographer and cast of actors to help me realize the paintings in my head.\n\nAt its essence, \"Exhibiting Forgiveness\" is about generational healing. I took on this project because I wanted to have a conversation with my children about the world I grew up in, which is so different from the world they've grown up in. And I think making the film helped resolve something within me. The revelation I had is that I can't make my father out as the villain in my mind. He's a victim of violence himself. And even though [he] created challenges for me, I've never wondered whether or not he loved me. - M.H.M.\n\nSánchez-Kane, 36, photographed at his studio (the artist uses she/her and he/him pronouns interchangeably) in Mexico City on Jan. 22, 2024.\n\nAna Topoleanu.

The curators invited me to present a collection from my fashion line that I'd shown in New York, and I said, \"No, but maybe I can do a performance.\" There's a kind of freedom in making wearable sculptures because, in the end, clothing has to be ergonomic: The jacket I made with boxing gloves has an opening for your hands so you can eat a burger. But for the ICA show, I created a pair of transparent plastic pants with a metal frame that made them almost impossible to walk in. And last year, for my first New York solo exhibition, at Kurimanzutto gallery, I made a piece from 1,170 black plastic belts that was so big and heavy, I had to break it into parts to show it. I remember reading an article by the queer theorist Jack Halberstam on the work of the artist Gordon Matta-Clark, who would [create] windows in structures where they shouldn't be. For me, the work is like that: opening windows that give you a different way of seeing what's in front of you.\n\nI started as an industrial engineer first and then became a fashion designer, but I've come to realize that it doesn't matter what you've studied or haven't. When I feel like the worst sculptor, I think, \"Well, at least I'm a good designer.\" And when I feel like a great sculptor, I might look at [the clothes in my studio] and think, \"Those terrible [expletive] trousers!\" Expanding into other fields is a way to embrace yourself. All we have is our imagination, which allows us to create things: objects, garments, skins that we wear when we go out into the world. I'm not saying they'll save us, but maybe they can help us navigate the transition to another universe. - M.S.\n\nThese interviews have been edited and condensed.\n\nBy John Wogan and M.H.

In 2012, I [returned] to present one runway show, which I called Out of My Mind. It was made up of personal garments I'd repurposed. I was 46.\n\nI'd been trying to find a way out of this unsustainable industry, this imaginary fantasy that fashion creates. My collections dealt with social justice, environmental consciousness and diversity before those topics became mainstream, and some seasons I didn't sell anything. I never had a sugar daddy, and I invested everything I made back into the company.\n\nI miss New York a lot. I'm homesick for it, but it isn't the same city, and fashion is very different, too - it feels inauthentic and disconnected from reality. When I was doing consulting and research for Alexander McQueen [in the mid-90s], we had no money. But the energy was amazing. When you don't have money, that's when you're most creative. Now all of these big companies have so much money that it feels like a different world. [Still] I'd love to have the chance to put on one last presentation, one last show to express how I feel today and how I see the world right now.\n\nWhen I left New York, I decided to come to Majorca, where my parents have a farm. I started doing photography accidentally; I had no knowledge of cameras, every day was a process of me learning something totally on my own. There was a 300-year-old well on the property with no water inside, and I realized it could be my studio. It's kind of like a basement; light comes from a little window high above. It reminds me of my apartment in New York. It's where I develop my [projects]. I use things that surround me: tulips and rose bushes, fruit trees, a tropical garden, chickens.\n\nWhen I got here, I didn't have a team [as I did in fashion], and one of the challenges was being surrounded by people who don't care about what I did or what I'm doing. Photography was the ideal thing to do because I don't need anybody, I can do it on my own. I don't have any models; I started working with mannequins and, for many years, I collected them on eBay or from secondhand stores on the island. [I decided] I'd rather not use models - when you photograph human beings, they're pretending or acting, and I was running away from that.\n\nIt's been nine years since I found photography, and I'm really happy. I have a monograph coming out later this year. The photographs are like my biography. I've developed my style in photography and I have a creative language. Fashion was the platform I once used, but the soul inside me is the same. - interview by J.W.\n\nRalph Ellison, the author of the 1952 novel \"Invisible Man,\" in June 1957 during his fellowship at the American Academy in Rome.\n\nJames Whitmore/The Life Picture Collection/Shutterstock\n\nRalph Ellison spent seven years writing his only completed novel, \"Invisible Man,\" and its publication in 1952, when he was in his late 30s, not only catapulted him to literary fame but made him nothing less than a spokesperson for postwar America. His contemporary Norman Mailer would write of him that at his best, \"He writes so perfectly that one can never forget the experience of reading him.\" \"Invisible Man,\" a surreal picaresque that follows an unnamed Black protagonist - \"a man of substance, of flesh and bone,\" Ellison writes - as he travels through a country full of people who \"refuse to see me,\" is a book of such remarkable confidence that Ellison's career, in later years, became mired in questions of what next? Ellison, a prolific writer of essays, reviews and criticism, worked for years on a follow-up, suffering one setback when a 1967 house fire destroyed portions of his manuscript. When he died in 1994, he left behind thousands of pages of drafts, fragments and unfinished tangents. Ellison's literary executor and longtime friend, John F. Callahan, tried to edit the material down into a \"single, coherent narrative,\" as he put it, and published the result, called \"Juneteenth,\" in 1999; the New York Times critic Michiko Kakutani called it \"disappointingly provisional and incomplete.\" Ellison often struggled with writing. He once likened his second novel to a \"bad case of constipation\" and, in a 1958 letter to his friend the author Saul Bellow, Ellison wrote, \"I've got a natural writer's block as big as the Ritz and as stubborn as a grease spot on a gabardine suit.\" - M.H.M.\n\nThe actor turned director Charles Laughton with the actress Sally Jane Bruce on the set of \"The Night of the Hunter\" (1955).\n\nEverett Collection\n\nBorn in the last year of the 19th century, Charles Laughton left his family's successful hotel business at the age of 26 to study acting at the Royal Academy of Arts in London. What he lacked in movie star looks - the critic J. Hoberman described him as \"coarse-featured, overweight and slovenly\" - he made up for in talent. Following a successful stage career in London's West End, he turned to film, making a name for himself as a versatile character actor in the 1930s and '40s. In 1955, at the age of 55, he made his most indelible contribution to his craft, directing \"The Night of the Hunter,\" a film noir so dark it easily passes today as horror. (William Friedkin, the director of 1973's \"The Exorcist,\" described it as \"one of the scariest films ever made.\") Robert Mitchum plays a terrifying ex-convict posing as a preacher and stalking the children of his former cellmate in order to find a hidden fortune. While casting Lillian Gish in the role of the children's caretaker, Laughton told the actress about his disappointment in audiences' lack of attention for movies, how they \"slump down with their heads back, or eat candy and popcorn. I want them to sit up straight again,\" he said. Though now often ranked among the greatest American movies, \"The Night of the Hunter\" - released just a few years before Alfred Hitchcock's \"Psycho\" (1960) made the psychological thriller into a marketable genre - was a commercial flop. Reviews were mixed; The New York Times's Bosley Crowther called it \"a weird and intriguing endeavor.\" Years later, Terry Sanders, a second-unit director of the film, wrote that \"the rejection by critics and the indifference of audiences hit [Laughton] hard and crushed his spirit. It wasn't just disappointment he felt, it was utter and deeply debilitating devastation.\" He never directed a second movie. - M.H.M.\n\nThe singer-songwriter Willis Alan Ramsey, photographed at Sam's Town Point bar in Austin, Texas, on March 14, 2024.\n\nCaleb Santiago Alvarado\n\nThe singer-songwriter Willis Alan Ramsey, originally from Alabama, released his self-titled debut album in 1972, becoming a forebear of the alt-country genre. Jimmy Buffett and Lyle Lovett became devoted fans. More than 50 years later, Ramsey still hasn't completed his second album.\n\nI started trying to write songs around 1968. My first song was just awful, but I got better over time. I dropped out of college twice, the second time in 1970, from the University of Texas [at Austin], after discovering a folk club where I became an opening act for $5 a night. Those were golden, halcyon days in Austin filled with sunshine and margaritas and very little traffic. That fall, I left to begin performing at colleges around the country. I was briefly back in Austin to play at U.T. and, somehow, during two days there, I'd managed to play for Gregg Allman and Leon Russell, two of the most influential musicians of that decade. They both gave me their cards and said to look them up if I ever made it their way. [I went to Los Angeles] and recorded a demo at Skyhill, Leon's personal home studio, and he basically offered me the moon to sign with his new label, Shelter Records [which folded in 1981]. I'd just turned 20. Over the next year, I recorded my first and only album to ever be released [\"Willis Alan Ramsey,\" often known as the Green Album for its green cover].\n\nI finished the record when I was 21. I was just a kid. Leon gave me my career, to the extent that I've had one [but the reason I never released another record was also] Leon's fault. He told me that if I signed with Shelter, he'd show me the studio and how it worked, and he did. I immediately wanted to learn everything I could about the recording process. I used seven studios and three rhythm sections [to make the record]. I was given carte blanche. The budget was 85 grand. I could do it for 200 grand [now], but I can't do it any cheaper. I'd need to rehearse every musician. And my songs are all over the place. I get bored doing one particular style.\n\nI'm the most frustrated recording artist you've probably ever met in your life. But I still feel I'll figure something out. I've always been optimistic. I've got at least three more records of material. I'm pretty tough on myself in terms of writing, and I'm very attached to what I've written. I just haven't been able to get a deal that'd work for me. I mean, the world works, you know? I think the key is just to work with the world. - interview by M.H.M.\n\nPhoto assistant: Sergio Flores\n\nThe writer Harper Lee in her hometown, Monroeville, Ala., in 1961, the same year that her debut novel, \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" won the Pulitzer Prize.\n\nDonald Uhrbrock/Getty Images\n\n\"I sort of hoped someone would like it well enough to give me encouragement,\" Harper Lee said in a 1964 radio interview, describing her low expectations for her 1960 debut, \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\" Instead, her novel, about a lawyer in the fictional town of Maycomb, Ala. (a stand-in for the writer's hometown, Monroeville), who defends a Black man from a false accusation of rape by a white woman, became one of the biggest literary sensations of its era. Lee, who worked as an airline reservations agent in New York for a few years before quitting (with friends' financial support) to work on her writing, won the Pulitzer Prize in 1961; two years later, a film adaptation starring Gregory Peck won three Academy Awards. \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" would go on to sell tens of millions of copies and become a fixture of high school English classes.\n\nLee had a hard time with her sudden fame. After that radio interview in 1964, she mostly avoided the press and, as the years and decades passed without a second novel, Lee continued to guard her privacy, albeit regularly attending the Methodist Church in Monroeville and occasionally visiting the local high school during lessons about her work. The year before she died at age 89 in 2016, a previously unknown novel, \"Go Set a Watchman,\" which had been written before \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" appeared to tepid reviews and claims that Lee, by then largely deaf and blind following a stroke, had been manipulated into releasing subpar work. Controversy aside, even just the announcement of a lost novel reignited interest in Lee's lone masterpiece; at that point, sales of \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" in trade paperback nearly tripled. - M.H.M.\n\nThese interviews have been edited and condensed.\n\nInterviews by Julia Halperin, Kate Guadagnino and Juan A. Ramírez\n\nWhat artists see when they look back at work they made in their youth.\n\nLuc Tuymans, \"Mijn Grote Vakantie\" (1967).\n\nCourtesy of the artist and David Zwirner. Photo: Alex Salinas\n\nWhen I was 7 or 8, we had to make drawings for school about our summer holidays. I was completely intrigued by the people gathering the garbage outside of our house in Antwerp [Belgium] - their truck, their dress code. During a summer day, I took out my colored pencils. I wrote underneath the drawing, \"My Big Vacation.\"\n\nIt came across as fairly cynical: My big vacation was garbage. It wasn't meant that way. I really was intrigued by this operation. [Looking at it now] I'm amazed that there's this perspective already in it. The teacher didn't believe I made the drawing and took me by the ear to the blackboard to do it again in front of the class.\n\nI'd been bullied a lot as a kid. I was extremely shy. Drawing was a way out, in a sense. I'd draw people who came to visit my parents and, at the end of the year, when exams were done, I'd make drawings for the whole class - whatever they wanted. I always had a ballpoint pen and a piece of paper with me, and people would gather around me while I was drawing, sometimes 20 to 30 of them. The kids were happy to have a drawing, but it didn't really change the bullying pattern.\n\nI saved most of my [childhood] drawings and gave them to my nephew. Unluckily, he lost them. This is virtually the only one that survived, and I gave it to my wife as a present.\n\nIt's quite interesting to see the size of things - the difference between the houses and the people - and most of all, the idea of space that was already in the drawing. [If I were to redraw this today] it'd be a bit more meticulous, more worked out. But it's an indication of things that would come later. My skepticism is embedded in this drawing without my doing that consciously - this quite specific, sardonic sense of humor. When I found it again, I had to laugh very, very hard. - J.H.\n\nDo Ho Suh, \"Tiger Mask\" (1971).\n\nCourtesy of the artist © Do Ho Suh\n\nThis drawing is based on a Japanese anime character, Tiger Mask, that was really popular in the '70s. Back in those days, Korean TV broadcast Japanese anime in black and white. Everybody at school watched. The character is a pro wrestler who puts on a tiger mask to disguise his identity. I drew the mask directly from the anime. I was probably 9.\n\nOnce my friends saw it, they all wanted one. Demand for tiger masks became much greater than supply. Some of the rich kids wanted to trade their Japanese pencils - which had graphics or custom characters on the surface - and colorful erasers for a drawing. My parents couldn't afford those things, and they weren't available in Korea. The kids' parents must have traveled to Japan, which was quite rare back then, and brought them back. [Eventually] I had a box full of those pencils, but I didn't have the guts to actually use them. The pencils are untouched; the erasers are dried out. For some reason, my mom kept them all these years. - J.H.\n\nTonkatsu is a Japanese home-style staple. It's a breaded, deep-fried pork cutlet - \"ton\" means \"pork\" and \"katsu\" is a sort of translation of \"cutlet\" - and it was my absolute favorite food when I was a kid. When my mom made tonkatsu, she'd have my sister and me do the breading, and we really bonded over that. It helped me understand family. We'd set up in the dining room and dredge the cutlets in flour, dip them into the egg wash, cover them with dried breadcrumbs and stack them high on paper plates that we'd bring in to my mother to fry up. Our kitchen had high countertops, and I can remember her standing at the stove in these three-inch platform clogs she'd wear to be a little taller.\n\nI loved seeing how something became something else - it felt like unraveling magic. One day when I was about 9, I came home from school and got the brilliant idea to make my own [but with chicken]. I grabbed some drumsticks from the freezer, did the breading and, while standing on a stool, dipped them in hot oil. (I never admitted this to my mom.) When they turned the color they were supposed to, I was so proud. I bit into one and it was still frozen. That was my first shock of \"I can't believe I didn't make [this thing] the way I imagined it would be.\"\n\nAnytime I was in Japan, especially in my 20s, my friends there would ask what subarashii gochiso, or \"the best thing one could possibly eat,\" was for me. I'd say tonkatsu, and they'd be like, \"What?!,\" because it's such a simple dish - it was like asking for a sandwich. It isn't the sort of thing I specialize in at my restaurant [N/Naka in Los Angeles], and I don't have it often anymore because, as I age, I'm trying to eat lighter, but I still associate it with deliciousness and with happiness. Ever since childhood, I've thought of food as being about coming together and cooking as an expression of care and love. Having been on the receiving end of that, I do the work that I do to try to make people happy. - K.G.\n\nMarina Abramović, \"Truck Accident (I)\" (1963).\n\n© Marina Abramović/Courtesy of the Marina Abramović Archives/ARS, 2024\n\nWhen I was a teenager in Communist Yugoslavia, there were these ugly green trucks that weighed so much, they often fell over. I started taking photographs of them and trying to paint them at home. But that wasn't enough for me, so I bought some toy cars and left them on the highway to see if the real trucks would smash them; they were always untouched. I was fascinated by car crashes. Then when I was 17 or 18 years old, I painted the big car smashed and the little car protected - the idea that innocence survives everything.\n\nMy mother studied art history, and I was always going to museums. When I was a baby, my first words weren't \"mama\" or \"papa\"; they were \"El Greco.\" I had my first exhibition at a youth center when I was 14. They mostly had group shows, but I made so much work that I had my own show. I always say I was jealous of Mozart because he started at 5.\n\nI didn't know then that painting wasn't my ultimate goal. It takes a long time to realize who you are. I remember the incredible joy of going into my studio - an extra space in my family's apartment - with my little cup of Turkish coffee. I would be so much in the dream of painting that I'd accidentally drink turpentine instead of the coffee.\n\nThough I wasn't aware of it [until recently], this crash represents the energy that I'd create in my early performances: two bodies running toward each other, crashing into each other and making this blurry image. My research today is about the body and how to create a field in which you aren't afraid of pain, of dying, of limits. When you're young, you don't see the straight line but, [looking back] it all seems so logical. - J.H.\n\nDeborah Roberts, \"James\" (1982).\n\nCourtesy of the artist\n\nI used to do a lot of drawings of people at church or kids in the neighborhood. I made this when I was 19, of this boy who came by to play with my brothers. My mother threw most of my drawings away. She had eight children; she couldn't have all that stuff piling up.\n\n[With that many siblings] you only get attention when you're sick. But I got a lot of attention for drawing. I was the best artist in my school. The teacher would ask me, \"What grade would you want?\" I'd say, \"I want an A+.\" I had a big head. Then I went to the gifted and talented program with high school art students from all over Austin, Texas. I wasn't the best anymore, but it just made me work harder. That's where I was first introduced to the work of Henry Ossawa Tanner [one of the first African American painters to achieve international fame, in the early 20th century]. I didn't even know there were Black artists. We didn't have the internet or access to museums. We were poor.\n\nI'd ride a small yellow bus to a community college to meet in a special room for the three-hour art class. Eventually, I became the best student in that class, at least in my head. They didn't ask me what grade I wanted, but I still got an A.\n\nIf I were doing it now, I'd blend that hair into the wood better. I wouldn't have light sources coming from two different areas. But if you look at my collages today, my whole idea's about seeing people as humans, as children, as vulnerable. I think this is a very vulnerable piece. - J.H.\n\nDavid Henry Hwang, manuscript of \"Only Three Generations\" (1968).\n\nCourtesy of David Henry Hwang. Photo: Lance Brewer\n\nI was about 10 years old, and my maternal grandmother got sick and it looked like she might be close to the end. I remember feeling that that'd be quite tragic - not only would I lose my grandmother but she also happened to be the family historian. I was one of those kids who, for whatever reason, was always really interested in hearing about family history.\n\nI was born and raised in Los Angeles, but my mom grew up in the Philippines, where my maternal grandparents still lived, so I asked my parents if I could spend a summer there. I went and collected what we'd now call oral histories from my grandmother on cassette tapes, then came back and compiled them into a 60-page family history, \"Only Three Generations,\" which was [photocopied] and distributed to my family members. Then in the early aughts, someone - my uncle, I think - went and printed two or three dozen copies as a bound version.\n\nI wasn't someone who felt [that] writing was my calling. I didn't do another major writing project until I got to college and started writing plays, so I find it interesting that the one time I took on [something] like this was to contextualize myself in a historical framework. That's consistent with what I've done as an adult: sometimes being at sea about who I am and looking at history to gain a sense of self.\n\nThe [history] starts with my great-great-grandfather, then the second [part]'s about my great-grandfather and then the third section's about my grandmother's generation. I [used] their real names. I think I was trying to be fairly accurate, as opposed to when it later became the basis of my [1996] play \"Golden Child.\" There's a lot more liberty taken there. When we did the play on Broadway, my grandmother was still alive and came to see the show. She was supportive of it, but I feel like she liked this version better. - J.A.R.\n\nThese interviews have been edited and condensed.\n\nInterviews by Juan A.

Everything is falling apart around her, but she's like, 'Aren't the old ways better?' There are a lot of possibilities in that - without getting too metaphorical about the state of Russia, politically and socially.\"\n\nWhat she's nervous about: \"There's always going to be that common nervousness of 'I'm going to mess up,' but somebody brought to my attention that NAATCO [the National Asian American Theatre Company, which was founded in 1989] has done quite a lot of Chekhov; I didn't even realize it, and I chose all of them. What I find fabulous about Chekhov is that there are sad situations but also human comedy. You have to find the funny if you're in dire straits, otherwise you'll slit your wrists.\"\n\nHow she feels about having her Broadway debut after five decades on the New York stage: \"You live long enough, [expletive] happens. I'd kind of figured, 'Maybe I'm not Broadway material.' Usually, when Asians get cast, it's a musical, and I'm not a singer-dancer, so it was never necessarily going to be a goal. I'm a little bit more realistic: I recently got a text [with a photo of the 'Uncle Vanya' ad] from a colleague who said, 'Look at Miss Fancy Pants,' and I'm like, 'I'm just a working stiff.'\"\n\nHow she reinterprets classics: \"From the get-go, the point of NAATCO was to ask people to open their vistas in terms of 'how, what, by whom, for whom' in theater. We tackled the Western classics first - William Shakespeare's 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' (1600) and Thornton Wilder's 'Our Town' (1938) - and my only caveat was not to change them to Asian settings. I remember the first couple of years, maybe decades, people always used to ask, 'Oh, you're doing Shakespeare! Are you going to set it in Japan?' Which isn't bad, but it's not the only way to do it. Reception was mixed; there was criticism from both Asian and non-Asian audiences. When we started to do new work - with Michael Golamco's 'Cowboy Versus Samurai' in 2005 - it became a redefinition of what immigrant stories were. Most of the time, the work's thought of as only one thing, so that was something to figure out. But you can say that about all good theater: It's asking you to receive something in a different way.\" - J.A.R.\n\nSmith, photographed at Rambert School of Ballet and Contemporary Dance in the London suburb of Twickenham on Feb. 14, 2024.\n\nAndrea Urbez\n\nDebuting in: A reimagined \"Carmen,\" based on the French writer Prosper Mérimée's 1845 novella about a Roma woman in southern Spain, which Smith has set instead in Cuba for the version (of the same name) she's choreographing that premieres at San Francisco Ballet this month.\n\nWhat she's excited about: \"As a performer, I trained in classical ballet but then went into contemporary dance - the reason I fell out of love with ballet was that the female roles didn't feel empowering. Not that I needed to be empowered all the time, but every story was dictated by the relationship a woman has to a man. So when Tamara [Rojo, the company's artistic director] approached me, my first thought was, 'How could we justify another \"Carmen\"?' I wondered how the story would change if one of her lovers was a woman. Musically it's also not the same - we've got a new score from the Mexican Cuban composer Arturo O'Farrill [departing from the French composer Georges Bizet's 1875 opera], so it's quite a leap from where it was birthed.\"\n\nWhat she's nervous about: \"I don't see the point in telling a story again the same way, so that's one element I'm not nervous about ... but I'm about everything else. The challenge is trying to tell an intimate story in a big space. To make this piece well, it has to move people in some way, and that's what I'm anxious to get across - for people to feel something.\"\n\nHow she's translating the Spanish-set story to Cuba: \"Bizet wasn't Spanish, [so] I thought it'd be more interesting to mainly hear Cuban sounds. I'm Cuban; Tamara's Spanish; and [the Uruguayan fashion designer] Gabriela Hearst is our costume designer. It's a full Latinx team, but we're all different. And this is a universal story that's not driven by geography. It's not set on a certain road in Havana but in the soul of these people. I'm not trying to overly examine Cuba. It's about who I am, as a person who happens to be Cuban, and what my voice contributes.\" - J.A.R.\n\nPhoto assistant: Callum Su\n\nPidgeon, photographed at Playwrights Horizons in Manhattan on March 10, 2024.\n\nSean Donnola\n\nDebuting in: \"Stereophonic,\" a new play by David Adjmi with music by Will Butler (formerly of the indie-rock band Arcade Fire), which transfers to Broadway this month following a run at Playwrights Horizons, where it premiered last fall - that production was Pidgeon's New York stage debut.\n\nWhat she's excited about: \"This story [about a fictional band's interpersonal struggles while recording an album in the 1970s] talks about relationships and what one has to sacrifice to make art. New York's full of artists, and I'm excited to hear what types of conversations people have after seeing the show.\"\n\nWhat she's nervous about: \"The transition to the Golden Theatre. Singing's so vulnerable. It's one thing to mess up in front of 200 people, another to mess up in front of four times that many. Off Broadway, we'd have instruments [accidentally] break down halfway through a scene, and we'd have to figure out how to make it feel authentic.\"\n\nHow she created her character, Diana, one of the band's lead singers: \"Diana's not looking to other people to give her an example - she's not following some blueprint. Her band's waiting for her to make that next great song, and she gets commodified really fast. I can't say the same for myself, but I'm [also not dealing with being] a woman in [rock in] the 1970s.\"\n\nHow she settled into the three-hour play's slowed-down, naturalistic rhythms: \"Our director, Daniel Aukin, kept talking about a documentary feel. I think the design of the play - of hearing overlapping conversations - is [very] fly-on-the-wall. Because of its realism, it can evoke the feeling of a film. There's this sense that it's not necessarily a performance when we're doing these shows; it's not showy. It's this thrill of being able to keep things private while also recognizing there're people in the audience two feet away from you. As an actor, you really feel the tension.\" - J.A.R.\n\nHair: Tsuki at Streeters.

I'm excited to bring that to life - and have it be people's introduction to me.\"\n\nWhat she's nervous about: \"Making a play that feels current - in the sense that I started writing it in 2018, did the first reading in 2019 and now we're in 2024. The play addresses the idea of bringing people of color into a [professional] situation as a trend, not out of any genuine interest in them. It has to do with quote-unquote diversity in the workplace, and it feels like we've gone through three different cycles of that conversation since I started writing it. I'm trying to synthesize everything that we've been through in the past six years but not feel like I'm shaping the play to respond to these fluctuations.\"\n\nHow she found her way to playwriting: \"I was in the Public's Emerging Writers Group in 2018, which was my introduction to theater. I was never a theater kid; film was my first love - I'd done my thesis in screenwriting. After I graduated [from New York University], I'd written a play, and I used that to get into the [playwriting] group. The idea for 'Jordans' came partly from my own experience post-grad of being fired three times in a row and being like, 'What's going on?' I was also trying to express something about being the only Black person entering all these professional spaces.\"\n\nHow the play's surrealist tone came to be: \"The main character gets coffee poured on her face in the first scene. For me, that was a big breaking open of the play: 'This is the kind of world that she's living in. What else can happen in this world?' It has what we might call surreal elements, but I don't always think about it that way because, within this play, everything is real. It's not a dream.\" - J.A.R.\n\nPhoto assistant: Serena Nappa.

Even three-star sous-chefs changed careers: They've stopped working in restaurants; they're selling truffles or doing kitchen shows or TikToks. There was a gap, and I thought if I played up my Asian heritage and my French cooking background, someone would be looking for that. Then I met [the restaurant's] owners, and they offered me this space in a Koreatown subway station.\"\n\nWhat he's nervous about: \"With restaurants, you prove yourself every day. There's no tomorrow, no next week. I knew I had to have a tasting menu: I have a personal goal - I'm not telling anyone what it is - and, to reach that level, I think it can only be a tasting menu. I'm not enjoying cooking that much; it's not a passion. This is my career. I don't cook at home but, if I think about that goal, it makes me come to the restaurant.\"\n\nWhat he took from working at the New York restaurants Per Se and Silver Apricot: \"I really thought, 'What kind of person am I? What kind of cook? What's my individualism?' Working in fine dining is such an honor, but it's their food. It's not me. I started focusing on food that would represent who I was.\"\n\nHow he's handling everyone's dietary restrictions: \"Right now, we don't accommodate, because we're a small kitchen. But sometimes they can push you: If a guest can't eat dairy, how do you make that sauce creamy without using milk? It requires more work, more thought, more team effort. It's happened a couple of times, and we just freestyle.\" - J.A.R.\n\nTyla wears an Alexander McQueen jacket $5,990, and shorts, $1,690, alexandermcqueen.com; and Prada shoes, $1,120, prada.com.

It's the product of more than two years of collaboration with writers and producers from around the world - and her first time traveling outside of South Africa (she grew up in Johannesburg). Together, they refined her sound, which she describes as \"music that people can dance to: Afrobeats, pop, R&B and amapiano,\" the last of which is syncopated electronic music that originated in South Africa in the 2010s.\n\nWhat she's excited about: \"My first tour. My creative director, Thato Nzimande, and I have been speaking about this forever. I have Coachella coming up and, after sitting for so long with this music and all these ideas, I'm excited to see people's reactions.\"\n\nWhat she's nervous about: \"I used to be very nervous about performing because all of this is very new and, once something's on the internet, it's saved forever. I don't want to look at it years from now and be cringing . I'm a perfectionist but, as an artist, you're never going to be happy with everything all the time. That's something I had to learn - how to let go.\"\n\nHow she synthesizes South African and American influences: \"I love the sound of amapiano production, with the log drum and the shakers and the drops. But I've also always wanted to be a chart-topper like Michael Jackson and Britney Spears and now SZA, except I wanted to do it with my sound [her first hit, \"Water,\" debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 in October]. Obviously, people believe, 'Oh, I have to make just pop.' But that's boring to me. I want to sell what I know and love.\"\n\nWhy South African music has global appeal: \"People say they can feel it, and that's cool because we feel it. It's very spiritual to us; it's a genre we feel in our bodies. All these amapiano dance moves that everyone does, it's not even dancers that come up with these moves - it's just random people, drunk uncles in the corners of clubs. It's organic, and I think people are looking for that genuine vibe.\" - E.L.\n\nProduction: Shay Johnson Studio. Hair: Christina \"Tina\" Trammell.

Based on the singer-songwriter Sufjan Stevens's 2005 indie-folk album, \"Illinois,\" the show was also conceived and choreographed by Peck, who collaborated on its narrative with the playwright Jackie Sibblies Drury.\n\nWhat he's excited about: \"The 'Illinois' song cycle [in which every track relates to the Midwestern state] is one of the great albums of the last 20 years: [Sufjan] didn't have a recording studio; he'd find a musician up in [New York's] Washington Heights and record a violin part without realizing what it was going to be part of - he'd run all over, assembling [bits]. I've had a long collaboration with him [Peck has based six ballets on Stevens's music, beginning with \"Year of the Rabbit\" for New York City Ballet in 2012], so it feels full circle, having discovered that album as a teenager.\"\n\nWhat he's nervous about: \"It's not a conventional musical; it lives between genres. It's framed as a gathering around a campfire, being intoxicated by the heat ... a campfire beckons storytelling. We enter into the worlds of these people sharing stories on an evening in the wilderness. That's a difficult thing for managing audience expectations. One of the most challenging parts is trying to tell a full story without words. There are lyrics, but even the lyrics have a sense of poetry to them. They're not literal.\"\n\nHow he brought on board his collaborator Jackie Sibblies Drury: \"Sufjan was involved early in developing the musical arrangements but has been relatively hands-off [since being diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome, an autoimmune disorder, last year] and wasn't in a place where he wanted to go back to that time in his life. I needed a storytelling partner. Jackie told me how much she loved the album; when she moved to Chicago, she and her then boyfriend listened to it on the road there. A lot of these songs resonated with both of us at a coming-of-age time in our lives, and that's part of our approach: intimate and personal.\" - J.A.R.\n\nProduction: Shay Johnson Studio.

In theaters this August, it's Stella's first movie - and her first acting project since spending much of the past decade on the TV series \"Nashville\" (2012-18), in which she played a country star's singer daughter.\n\nWhat she's excited about: \"Being reintroduced in a way that feels true to me. I was a baby when 'Nashville' started; it's hard to have people see you as a character for so many years. You have to be careful with the next thing you do, especially after you take a break [to finish high school], and I wanted to be represented in a way that felt genuine and pushed me in the direction I wanted to go. I thought a project like this would come 10 years down the line, if ever.\"\n\nWhat she's nervous about: \"I think I confuse anticipation with anxiety. I just feel general anticipation all the time, whether it's about a date this weekend or this movie coming out; it's that feeling that something's about to happen. In my body, I might confuse it with nerves, but there are happy and cozy feelings, as well, so it levels out.\"\n\nHow she collaborated with the writer-director Megan Park on her dialogue: \"I watch a lot of young adult shows and think, 'Oh my God, we sound so dumb. We don't talk like that.' Not everything's abbreviated and slang. Megan [who's 37] knows how to write for Gen Z because she includes us in her process. She doesn't have an ego and molds her characters to who's playing them. We'd do scripted takes and then 'fun runs,' where we got to improv, and she'd add lines in the moment.\"\n\nWhat was it like creating the template for Plaza's character: \"You'd think Aubrey would've come first, but I was the first one attached to the film. In any other situation, it'd be me matching her, but I feel like Elliott is very similar to me so, when Aubrey and I met, I could feel her filming me with her eyes, trying to get a scope.\" - J.A.R.\n\nHair and makeup: Laura Godwin\n\nLakota-Lynch (bottom row, in a white T-shirt), photographed at Open Jar Studios in Manhattan on Feb. 26, 2024, along with (top row, from left) the \"Outsiders\" composer Zach Chance, the choreographers Rick and Jeff Kuperman and the writer and composer Justin Levine; (middle row, from left) the actors Brent Comer, Jason Schmidt, Joshua Boone, Kevin William Paul and Dan Berry; (bottom row, from left) the actors Emma Pittman and Brody Grant, the director Danya Taymor, the writer Adam Rapp and the actor Daryl Tofa.\n\nJustin French\n\nDebuting in: \"The Outsiders,\" a new musical that opened this month and is based on S.E.

He appeared in \"Dear Evan Hansen\" in 2018, but this is his first time originating a role on Broadway.\n\nWhat he's excited about: \"I've been with the show for six years, and it finally feels fully baked. People are going to be expecting us to come out tap-dancing, but you have [the writer] Adam Rapp and [the director] Danya Taymor, and those people have never done a musical. It's the ultimate place for an actor-singer. It's truly a play with music [by Zach Chance and Jonathan Clay of the folk duo Jamestown Revival, and the songwriter Justin Levine], and I think it's going to shock people.\"\n\nWhat he's nervous about: \"It's going to be sad to eventually let Johnny go. I'm doing this on Broadway, but it's like the period at the end of the sentence.\"\n\nThe actor sings a snippet of James Taylor's 1970 song \"Fire and Rain.\"\n\nVideo by Jordan Taylor Fuller\n\nHow he's approaching playing a beloved character: \"Johnny doesn't have a lot of lines: He's like an Edward Scissorhands [type] - I have to fill the space with energy. The cool thing about playing the character is that I got to imbue him with myself. I'm Native American and Black, and the story is set in Tulsa, Okla., where that's [not uncommon]. My costume has Native American embroidery; my version of Johnny feels fully fleshed out. Of course, I stole things from Ralph [Macchio, who played the role in the 1983 Francis Ford Coppola film] and from the novel - it's that fine line between tough and tender, but it's tailored to me.\" - J.A.R.\n\nProduction: Shay Johnson Studio.

Styled by Delphine Danhier\n\nThe comedian and actress Meg Stalter, 33, started gaining attention on social media during the 2020 Covid-19 lockdowns when she posted absurd short-form videos playing different personae, like a Disney World team leader conducting an employee orientation. The following year, she had her TV debut on HBO's \"Hacks\" as Kayla, a less than helpful assistant to a talent agent. Now she's filming her first lead role on the new Netflix series \"Too Much,\" written and directed by Lena Dunham (and loosely based on Dunham's life), in which she plays the workaholic Jessica, who responds to a breakup by moving to London.\n\nI took so many improv classes when I first [was] doing comedy. It's the starting point for me when I develop characters. During the pandemic, I'd do improv on Instagram Live every night. The theme would be \"We're going to Paris\" or \"We're doing a women's exercise class.\" It was just me doing improv online by myself for hours. When I take on a role, I study the script and imagine if I had to improv a scene. \"What would I add or take away? How's this person different from me? What could I give to the character of my own personality?\"\n\nWhen I read the part of Kayla, I'd already met Paul [W. Downs, a co-creator of \"Hacks\"] at a stand-up show. [I found out later that] he had me in mind when he wrote the script. That was almost more nerve-racking: It was strange to think, \"What if I lose this part to someone else but they were thinking of me in the first place?\"\n\nKayla started as the assistant who comes in and says a crazy line. But in the third season of \"Hacks,\" she has more emotional scenes, which add another layer: When a character experiences a range of emotions, it makes the crazy stuff even funnier.\n\nThe comedian and actress tells a knock-knock joke.\n\nVideo by Kurt Collins\n\nAt first when you get a script, you picture yourself in it and think, \"Oh, well, she probably looks like me.\" That changes the more you get to know the character. Lena [Dunham]'s been so open to talking through Jessica. She'll say, \"Tell me what you think about the hair,\" and, \"Tell me if there're any outfits you don't like.\" She even made a playlist Jessica would listen to. There's Avril Lavigne, Girlpool, Sabrina Carpenter. When I'm studying the script, I'll play that in the background. Jessica's into the dreamy side of London and Jane Austen. She's a little girlie and wears a lot of pink. She wears [nightgowns] as actual dresses and things that're a little bit too cute for work. I sent [the costume designer] Arielle [Cooper-Lethem] some dresses from Fashion Brand Company. They look like [they could be in an Austen adaptation] but modern and sexier. Like shirts with ribbons all over or matching sets made of lace. Everything's kind of funny but also hot. It's stuff I would've worn when I thought I was straight. I feel like Jessica's the straight version of me.\n\nIt's interesting to be playing a version of someone whose work I've admired for so long. I've rewatched [Dunham's 2012-17 HBO series] \"Girls\" so many times. To have everything she's written in my head but be told, \"Just do it the way that you would do,\" or, \"This is all yours now,\" it feels freeing. There're some directors and writers who want you to say exactly what's on paper.\n\nWhen you're in character in front of a camera, there're certain things you can't prepare for. I can research so much for a part - create memories for the character, talk through costume - but if it comes out differently [than what I imagined], that's OK. It's important to be able to let go and let the scene be what it is. Some people torture themselves after performing. They're like, \"I should've said this or that.\" I really don't do that. Once it's out there, that's what it's supposed to be.\n\nStalter wears, from start: Versace dress, $1,990, versace.com ; and Alexander McQueen ring, $690, alexandermcqueen.com .

He was born in Guadalajara but moved as a teenager to Los Angeles, where he was active in the Chicano art movement. It wasn't until he took part in the 2020 show \"Siembra\" at the gallery Kurimanzutto in Mexico City, though, that the art world took notice of his dreamlike Surrealist works. Next year, Gil de Montes will be the subject of a career survey at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.\n\nI live in a place where there're no museums or galleries. I'm inspired by my surroundings - by the jungle, by the ocean. I often say there's no better background than the ocean for painting. I have two studios: one at home, where I work on paper, and a painting studio in town near the ocean. Usually, I start at home on paper. I either sketch or use watercolor wash. If I'm going to do an oil painting, I go to the studio in town. Before I work, I might just sit around and look at books - I like [monographs about Henri] Matisse, [Paul] Cezanne, [Edouard] Manet. It's sort of a meditation. A lot of times, an idea surges when I'm working on something already; other times, it might be a memory. Or a dream. The other day, I had a dream that I was taking a photo with my phone of a house on fire - but I was conscious that the house was a drawing. [When I woke up] I thought, \"Well, I should do a painting of that.\"\n\nI'm very intrigued by how memory works and how the memory of something can trigger [a new idea]. [While putting together the career survey] I've revisited all of these old works of mine. Some I remember painting. Others I don't remember at all. I'm 73 years old. I forget things, and then I start thinking, \"Wow, this is interesting because if I'm working from memory and forgetting things, how's that going to affect the work that I do? How can I explore that?\" For instance, somebody sent me a painting they said was mine. I said, \"No, I didn't do that painting. I'm sorry,\" only to find out that I'd signed the back. A lot of the ideas I've been working on come from the past. In the [2022] Venice Biennale, I had a painting [\"Up,\" 2021] of somebody hanging upside down or falling through the sky. That came [about] when I walked into the studio and noticed I had inadvertently put a painting upside down. I said, \"Actually, that'll make a good painting upside down.\" I don't know how other artists work. I'm very open to ideas.\n\nThe conceptual artist Jenny Holzer, photographed at her studio in upstate New York on Feb. 6, 2024, with LED text from her series \"Survival\" (1983-85), which will be on view at her exhibition at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum from May through September.\n\nPhotographs by Nicholas Calcott\n\nIn 1989, the conceptual artist Jenny Holzer installed an LED scroll of aphorisms - \"Abuse of power comes as no surprise\" is among the most famous - on three of the six internal ramps of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York. It was part of her retrospective \"Untitled (Selections From Truisms, Inflammatory Essays, the Living Series, the Survival Series, Under a Rock, Laments and Child Text).\" Next month, Holzer, 73, will restage the work there as part of her show \"Jenny Holzer: Light Line\" (which will also include other pieces from her 50-plus-year career). But this time, the LED installation - which will display the original \"Truisms\" and other text series - will go all the way to the top.\n\nI'm a self-loathing, slow study so [ahead of the 1989 retrospective at the Guggenheim] I had to walk and walk around and around and around the museum. It finally occurred to me, \"Oh, around and around is the answer [to how the piece should be displayed].\" I'm relieved I attended to what Frank Lloyd Wright did: The building is magnificently, utterly self-sufficient. It doesn't necessarily need art, and it's inclined to shrug it off at times.\n\nAs I was developing the new exhibition, I started walking the museum again - and not just the ramps. I went up and down the stairs a few thousand times. I went in the elevator, in assorted bathrooms, in nooks and crannies. And in those places, I put everything from the first diagrams I made in the '70s on up to icky paintings made by A.I.\n\nThe conceptual artist discusses a sculpture by the artist Louise Bourgeois.\n\nVideo by Joshua Charow\n\nIf I have a specialty, and I'm not certain that I do, it's installation. I like hunting and seeing. The first step is to go blank, with no preconceptions. And then, since it is visual art, using my eyes to see. Then that mysterious thing happens: Ideas come - when you're lucky. Otherwise, you try again.\n\nWhen I'm just trying to make a new artwork for anywhere, it's adequate to lie on the couch with my eyes closed and wait for that pizza to arrive - the \"art\" pizza. But when I'm [fortunate enough] to be in a building like Wright's Guggenheim, it's - surprise, surprise - necessary for the body to be in the space. Alert, alive, all tentacles reaching out, all senses going. And on some level, being hopeful.\n\nPhoto assistant: Ece Yavuz\n\nFor the second time, the playwright Amy Herzog, 45, has adapted a work by Henrik Ibsen. The first was \"A Doll's House\" (1879), starring Jessica Chastain. Herzog's latest staging, \"An Enemy of the People\" (1882), stars Jeremy Strong as Dr. Thomas Stockmann, a physician who is shunned for warning his town that its lucrative public baths are contaminated. Michael Imperioli plays his brother, Peter Stockmann, the mayor, who seeks to suppress Thomas's findings.\n\nWhen I begin an adaptation, I first read a few different translations of the play. Then I try to get those out of my head. For \"A Doll's House\" and now \"An Enemy of the People,\" I've worked with a translator named Charlotte Barslund. She does a literal translation in English, which stays as close to the feeling and meaning of the original Norwegian as possible. I go through that line by line, translating it into my own words without making any big decisions. Once I have my first version, I start the bigger work of cutting. For \"An Enemy of the People,\" we cut three characters. I decided to cut the character of Katherine, Thomas Stockmann's wife, after a lot of conversations with Sam [Gold, the play's director and Herzog's husband]. Her sections weren't working; they were feeling really turgid. There're sections that his daughter, Petra [played by Victoria Pedretti], could pick up if Katherine was gone.\n\nWhat was remarkable about cutting Katherine was realizing how little had to change. The fact that you didn't have to do major surgery on the play was one tell that cutting Katherine was a good idea. It gives Stockmann this recent terrible grief. It's a particular grief when you're a doctor, I think, to lose a spouse - to be the doctor who can't save your loved ones. That spring loads the play as it begins: He's reaching a place where he can have happiness again - [only] to be completely betrayed by his community and to lose everything he's finally gained.\n\nIbsen wrote domestic psychological plays and social plays. \"A Doll's House\" is the former and \"An Enemy of the People\" the latter. [When adapting \"A Doll's House\"] I learned some pretty basic things about the mechanics of making it feel leaner and more modern. But other than that, it was shockingly different to translate them and humbling that he had plays that were so totally different inside of him. This play is bigger and rangier and even more relevant than \"A Doll's House.\" It's very timely - there're a few headlines it brings up. One is climate change. I was reading a lot about scientists who weren't listened to when they tried to sound the alarm years ago. I was also reading Naomi Klein's [2023 memoir] \"Doppelganger\" and thinking about the way the body politic becomes sick. I try to do a lot of research before writing - I read a fair amount of Ibsen biographies - so there's no single influence that's too loud while I'm working. When I'm really doing the translation, I need quiet and cloistering. So there'd be gaps in my communication with [Jeremy] and everyone else. Then there'd be the moments, after reading a draft, when it was time to talk and become porous again.\n\nJeremy was the reason for the production. From the moment I began to work on \"An Enemy of the People,\" I knew who was playing Thomas Stockmann. I've known Jeremy since 1997, and I've seen a ton of his work, so his voice was influencing the way I adapted that character.\n\n[Jeremy and Dr. Stockmann] are similar in that they both have a total commitment to what they believe in. Having someone in my life with that kind of devotion to his craft and to his storytelling means that I'm coming to [the character] with the texture of a real, contemporary person. Every few days, he sends me a poem or an article or something that's meant something to him related to the play. He sent me the William Butler Yeats poem \"A Coat.\" The first three lines are \"I made my song a coat / Covered with embroideries / Out of old mythologies.\" There's this incidental line in Ibsen's original [script] that people often cut - but I didn't, I love it - when Captain Horster [Dr. Stockmann's loyal friend] makes his first entrance before you even see Dr. Stockmann, who says, \"Hang your coat on that peg. Oh, you don't wear an overcoat?\" Captain Horster is this character who has no pretense and is an uncorrupted type of human. And Ibsen has him coatless at the beginning. So the idea of a coat and what it is to cover yourself has become an interesting thematic touch point for us.\n\nSince graduating from the Rhode Island School of Design in 1999, the visual artist Joe Bradley, 49, has made a habit of reinvention. His style continuously shifts, from mixed-media sculptures to line drawings to highly saturated large-scale canvases. His most recent exhibition of paintings opens this month at David Zwirner gallery in New York.\n\nI tend to arrive at my studio [in Long Island City, Queens] around nine, turn the lights on, make a pot of coffee. Then, depending on what sort of stage the paintings are at, I'll just start working. If it's early on [in the piece], I'm much more active. When the paintings [begin] to come together, it's a lot more about just looking and making little decisions to resolve things. I don't have a real ritual. I don't even have to be in any particular state of mind. If I'm distracted or depressed or happy or whatever, I just come in and see what happens.\n\nI do begin with some practical decisions. I know how big the painting is going to be and what sort of surface I'm going to be working on. I know what the contour of [a show] will look like. I don't make any sort of preparatory sketches - the paintings reveal themselves to me through the process of working on them. But the deadline [for the show] ends up being this organizing force. It's the day your entire year revolves around, the time [by which] you know the paintings will have to be presentable and cohesive. It's helpful to have that because, otherwise, you could keep things up in the air indefinitely.\n\nWhen I paint today, I might be responding to a mark on the canvas that I made six weeks or six months ago. What I'm doing early in the process isn't going to be available visually by the end - most of it'll be painted out or it'll disappear in the process. I lay traps or create little problems for myself to encounter. It's almost like the uglier it gets in the early stages, the better the painting will be.\n\nThe artist Suzanne Jackson, photographed at her Savannah, Ga., studio on Feb. 1, 2024, works on a piece that will eventually be installed on a terrace at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.\n\nKendrick Brinson\n\nThe Savannah, Ga.-based artist Suzanne Jackson, 80, has worked as a dancer, a set and costume designer, a professor and a poet - but most notably as a painter. Jackson describes her ethereal compositions as \"anti-canvases,\" which she creates by building up layers of acrylic paint and at times found materials, including netting and produce bags. In 2025, she'll display a selection of work from her six-decade career, along with a new site-specific installation, as part of a retrospective at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.\n\nI'm working on a commission for the fourth-floor terrace of [SFMoMA]. It's an installation that'll climb the walls of the terrace and partially fill the open space. My approach is quite different than if I were working on a painting in my studio: I have to think of it in an architectural or sculptural sense. There're technical aspects, so I've been doing a lot of research in airports and from airplane windows, looking at large-scale structures that don't fall down - things on the rooftops of buildings like windsocks or poles. This piece will be built from the ground up, unlike my other work that hangs from the walls or ceiling.\n\nI don't go looking for ideas. I just go into the studio and start painting. Now that I'm older and not teaching, I don't have to do anything except paint. In the morning, I roam around the house. I do the laundry. I feed the cats. I look out the window and stare at nature. I have a big window at the end of my kitchen and can see tall trees and birds and animals and insects. I go through the studio to get to the kitchen from my bedroom, so sometimes I end up stopping and looking at work I've already done. There's a lot of sitting and thinking and looking. Sometimes, I'll turn on music - Charles Mingus and Eric Dolphy or Yo-Yo Ma. On Mondays and Fridays, it's [the Savannah radio D.J. and jazz historian] Ike Carter's show \"Impressions.\"\n\nAs the music flows, so does the paint - that's a spiritual environment to be in. Other times, I'll work in absolute silence. At the beginning, I explore. I'm never quite sure what's going to happen. Usually, it comes spontaneously. One brushstroke leads to the next, and then it becomes another idea. I might think I have one idea when I start, but it often changes along the way to be something completely opposite. I'm just having a good time being a painter. That's how I started, and it's how I'm going to end.\n\nPhoto assistant: Dayna Anderson\n\nThese interviews have been edited and condensed.\n\nBy Jason Chen\n\nSix people who found a new creative calling later in life - or for whom recognition was long overdue.\n\nThe multidisciplinary artist and critic, whose solo show at Mariane Ibrahim gallery in Chicago opens this month.\n\nLorraine O'Grady's \"Announcement Card 2 (Spike With Sword, Fighting)\" (2020).\n\n© Lorraine O'Grady/Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York, courtesy of Mariane Ibrahim, Chicago, Paris, Mexico City\n\nI thought I was going to be a writer. My family tells me that I made my first poem when I was a year and a half old: \"I like mice because they're nice.\" [In my early 30s, after working for five years] as an intelligence analyst, I went to the Iowa Writers' Workshop for fiction. I hadn't really been reading fiction, though, so I wasn't very good at writing it. I spent most of my second year there translating short stories written by my instructor [the Chilean novelist] José Donoso.\n\nGrowing up, I had all these exposures to beauty. I'd gone to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston as a child and seen [Paul] Gauguin's \"Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?,\" a painting that continues to influence me. And my mother was a dress designer. She redid our house every six months. By the time I was 10, I basically had everything that I'm now working with in place, but I didn't have the language. I didn't get that language until the early 1970s, when I read [the critic and curator] Lucy Lippard's \"Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object From 1966 to 1972.\" [Then] I was ready. The ideas for my visual art already existed within my experience. I just hadn't known they were art before.\n\nA few years later, when I was in my early 40s, I had to have a biopsy of my breast. After - thank God, it was negative for cancer - I was thinking about what I could give my doctor as a thank-you present. Reading my copy of the Sunday New York Times, I saw a line in the sports pages about Julius Erving that said, \"The doctor is operating again.\" I said, \"OK, this could be the start of something,\" and I made a really good poem for my doctor [out of words clipped from the newspaper]. But when I finished the poem, I said, \"This is too good to give to him.\" Then I immediately started making newspaper poems for a project called \"Cutting Out The New York Times.\" I made one every week for 26 weeks. When I finished, I realized that I'd become a visual artist - or revealed that I was a visual artist. - interview by J.C.\n\nThe author of 11 novels, including \"Beloved,\" \"Sula\" and \"Song of Solomon.\"\n\nBy the time Toni Morrison wrote \"Beloved\" (1987), her best-known novel, she'd worked for nearly two decades as a book editor. Her debut, \"The Bluest Eye\" (1970), was published when she was 39 and, while not a commercial success, was critically praised. She published three more books between 1973 and 1981 - including \"Song of Solomon\" - while still at her editing job.\n\nPrior to going into publishing, Morrison - who had a master's degree in American literature from Cornell University - spent nearly a decade teaching college English. After her divorce, she worked for a textbook division of Random House before joining Random House proper as its first Black female editor; there, she championed and published Black authors such as Angela Davis, June Jordan, Gayl Jones and Toni Cade Bambara. \"I didn't go to anything. I didn't join anything,\" she once said about the civil rights movement. \"But I could make sure there was a published record of those who did march and did put themselves on the line.\" All the while, Morrison was waking by dawn to write before heading into the office. She'd later describe those sessions as a form of liberation: \"The writing was the real freedom because nobody told me what to do there. That was my world and my imagination. And all my life it's been that way.\"\n\nFor many years, Morrison considered her day job essential to her art. \"I thrive on the urgency that doing more than one thing provides,\" she once said. But the industry had its difficulties - the overwhelming whiteness, the increasing commercial demands - and she left her position in 1983. Four years later, at age 56, she published \"Beloved.\" In a preface to the 2004 edition of the book, she looks back on the rush of feelings she experienced following her last day at the job. \"I was happy, free in a way I had never been, ever. It was the oddest sensation. Not ecstasy, not satisfaction, not a surfeit of pleasure or accomplishment. It was a purer delight, a rogue anticipation with certainty. Enter 'Beloved.'\"\n\nThe multidisciplinary artist and former drag performer, whose paintings are currently on view at the Dallas Contemporary art space and the MassArt Art Museum in Boston.\n\nA 2023 acrylic on canvas by Tabboo! titled \"Lavender Garden.\"\n\nCourtesy of the artist, Karma and Gordon Robichaux\n\nMy mother put me into an art class when I was 15 at the Worcester Art Museum, and then I went on to art school [at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design], where I majored in painting and fine art. I remember my first sale, to my aunt Julie. She wanted me to copy [Jean-François] Millet's \"The Gleaners.\" I didn't want to copy someone else's stuff - I think one of the reasons I'm popular is that I'm very original - but I still did the painting, of course. It was a commission and I was being paid!\n\nI started performing drag in nightclubs when I moved to New York in 1982, but I've always been painting, too. This isn't something I just came up with, like, \"Oh, I can't get on 'RuPaul's Drag Race,' I better start painting.\" I had one-man shows and gallery exhibitions right after graduating from art school. Elton John and Gianni Versace bought my paintings. I don't want anyone to have the impression - which certain people seem to - that I took up painting just because I stopped doing drag. I might be getting a bit more attention for it now, but I've always been doing it.\n\nI usually get up at four in the morning. I feed my cat and then start painting. A lot of my paintings are sunrises. And I do sunsets and cityscapes. Or if it rains in a weird way, I'll do a rain painting. It's a very spiritual, meditative, private thing. There isn't a day that goes by that I haven't done something, and so my work gets better and better and better. And I must say, I'm a master of my craft now.\n\nSometimes a collector will ask, \"Can we come over to the studio and watch you paint?\" I tell them no. I usually do it naked. - interview by J.C.\n\nThe performer and multidisciplinary artist, whose work has been exhibited at Participant Inc. and the New Museum in New York City, and will be on view at Bill Arning Exhibitions in Kinderhook, N.Y., in May.\n\nJustin Vivian Bond's watercolor \"Witch Eyes, by Viv, to Protect You From Evil Chodes: Lois\" (2024).\n\nCourtesy of the artist\n\nWhen I was in high school, I was interested in visual art as well as music and acting, but I decided to major in theater in college because I thought it was a career that could get me out of Maryland and allow me to move to New York. I became a performer, and I've been doing cabaret for many years. In 2008, when I broke up my cabaret act Kiki and Herb, my rent was so cheap that I didn't have to work as much. I started painting again, and it flows very naturally for me.\n\nMy watercolors are primarily portraits of people I know. I'll ask them to pose for a photograph and then paint from that. I also make pseudo fan art, like my \"Witch Eyes\" series, which is based on iconic photographs of celebrities' eyes. The wonderful thing about painting is that you have total control over it, if you're lucky. Onstage, there're so many variables. And with painting, you don't have to be there [when people see your work]. I love being in front of an audience, but I don't really love being among people. The pleasure for me is singing but, when the show's over, I have to talk to a lot of people. I like all of them, but there're too many, so it can be a little overwhelming. You don't ever get to connect on a deeper level. The most satisfying times in my life have been when my shows have been installed and it's the night before the opening. All of it's exactly how I want it - the room, the lighting - and I just sit there and look and have this sense of utter satisfaction. - interview by J.C.\n\nThe poet, whose best known works include \"The Emperor of Ice-Cream,\" \"The Snow Man\" and \"Anecdote of the Jar.\"\n\nWallace Stevens never quit his day job. Though he had literary ambitions as a young man, serving as the editor of the Harvard Advocate as an undergraduate, he earned his degree from New York Law School and in 1916 joined the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company, where he remained, specializing in surety and fidelity claims, until his death, in 1955. Yet he was writing all the time: on his daily walk to work, at home in the evenings and sometimes in the office.\n\nIt wasn't until 1914, when Stevens was 34, that his first post-college poems appeared in literary journals. He went on to publish seven volumes of poetry over the course of his lifetime. The first, \"Harmonium,\" released in 1923, sold fewer than 100 copies; the last, 1954's \"The Collected Poems of Wallace Stevens,\" won the Pulitzer Prize.\n\nThe themes of Stevens's work - the affirming power of art and beauty, the sublime contained within the mundane - suggest one reason why he stuck with insurance law even as his artistic acclaim grew. His steady paycheck would have allowed writing to remain a purely creative act. In his essay \"Surety and Fidelity Claims,\" Stevens says of his insurance work, \"You sign a lot of drafts. You see surprisingly few people. ... You don't even see the country; you see law offices and hotel rooms.\" Poetry, on the other hand - as he characterizes it in 1923's \"Of Modern Poetry\" - \"must be the finding of a satisfaction.\" It was his livelihood, in the most artistic sense of the word.\n\nThe University of Chicago professor and multidisciplinary artist, whose solo shows at the Gagosian gallery in Le Bourget, France, and the Mori Art Museum in Tokyo open this month.\n\nTheaster Gates's sculptural work \"Sweet Sanctuary, Your Embrace\" (2023).\n\n© Theaster Gates. Photo: © On White Wall for White Cube\n\nIn 2000, I took a job as the arts planner at the Chicago Transit Authority. There was so much new construction happening there, and my role was to appeal to the Federal Transit Administration for a portion of the transit money to be set aside for public art. In a way, it was like an M.B.A.: I managed $26 million over four or five years. My negotiating skills went through the roof.\n\nI'd graduated from Iowa State [in 1995] with a degree in community and regional planning and then did a [post-baccalaureate] in religious studies and fine art at the University of Cape Town. After that, I spent time in Japan studying ceramics. So when I came to the C.T.A., my background incorporated both art and community and, every day, I was leaving there and going to my ceramics studio.\n\nIn 2005, I left the C.T.A. because I outgrew the position, and I stopped making pots because I couldn't afford my studio. I started using more recycled materials in my work [such as wood pallets]. It was during this period that I was starting to combine my knowledge of minimalism and conceptual practices with my background in building and working with my dad, who was a roofer. Now buildings have kind of become my primary monuments, and the project management and team building that I learned at the C.T.A. are really evident in the way that I create.\n\nI did a project at the New Museum [that opened in late 2022 and] was essentially an exhibition about mourning and loss. My father had died six months prior to the opening, and I didn't have time to mourn his death or the deaths of dear friends like [the fashion designer] Virgil Abloh, my mentor [the Nigerian curator and art critic] Okwui Enwezor, [the author] bell hooks and [the film scholar] Robert Bird. The show grew out of a desire to grapple with my feelings and honor these people. The museum didn't necessarily have the budget to do all of the things that I wanted to, so I had to figure out, \"Are there poetic ways to articulate loss that don't require substantial build-out, or big, fancy gestures or expensive audio equipment?\"\n\nUltimately, I included Bird's 9,500-volume library, and Virgil Abloh's widow loaned me his yellow diamond-studded necklace. Those were moments when limitations built new friendships and more nuanced opportunities, and I feel like having been a planner's what made me willing to pick up the phone and say, \"Hey, would you be willing to collaborate with me?\" - interview by J.C.\n\nThese interviews have been edited and condensed.\n\nInterviews by Kate Guadagnino\n\nTen creative minds on how to start, pivot and productively procrastinate.\n\nAs actors, we feel like we have to be ready, but I'd say you're never ready. You're not prepared for something you've never done before, so let go of that. This past year I did some symphony gigs for the first time, and it was incredible. It was better than being ready, because I just had to be new. - Ali Stroker, 36, actress and singer\n\nMyha'la in season one of \"Industry,\" 2020.\n\nAmanda Searle/HBO\n\nI have the curse of perfectionism, and there've been so many projects where I've said, \"I'm not right for that, so I'm not going to audition.\" But that's kind of lazy, so I've rewired my thinking: If something's targeting some insecurity in me, why not take the opportunity to work on that thing? I used to avoid anything with an accent but now, if I got the call for \"Bridgerton,\" I'd feel confident enough to go for it. Definitely do your homework, though. With almost every trading scene in \"Industry,\" I've thought, \"Nope, I'm not going to be able to get the words out.\" I don't sleep the night before, and I'm wrecked the next morning. Then everything pours out because I've come in prepared. Filming the first season of \"Industry\" in 2019 was the first time I'd been on a job longer than five days, the first time I'd worked out of the country, the first everything, and I was so nervous. Go toward things that scare you. - Myha'la, 28, actor\n\nDeciding what's a good idea is an ongoing battle. But you can only think about something for so long before you just have to try it. Someone once told me that when he makes a painting he likes, he'll make another one with the same idea to see if it holds up and then another, which I thought was pretty good advice. Sometimes I force myself to go to my studio and start painting [Gordon initially set out to be a visual artist and started focusing more on her art practice about 25 years ago], even if I don't have an idea. I like conceptual thinking, but I also like the physicality of painting. Usually that leads me to something and, even if it doesn't - what am I going to do, sit around and watch movies all day? - Kim Gordon, 70, musician and visual artist\n\nSometimes painting can feel like this dream I have where I'm in the back of a moving car and I'm reaching over to the front seat to try to get control. That's a nervous system in panic. There's a grounding exercise I like to do where I jump and really feel my feet smack the floor - trying to get yourself back into your body's part of the trick. And then I go, \"Well, who's dreaming?\" If you can get there, you're lucid in the dream, and that's a good place to be. Still, feelings will come up that you don't want. When I was working on this satyr painting, suddenly the satyr was my old friend Chris, who betrayed me when I was 18 to a group of guys who beat me up. I thought, \"Why am I painting Chris? I don't want to paint Chris.\" I was in flow for a while but, when I hit this painting, I experienced self-doubt and thought, \"People are going to think these paintings are awful.\" Then I went on Instagram and liked one of his pictures. It felt like a weird, brave task. And he wrote to me and asked if he could call me, 26 years after ghosting me, and he apologized for 20 minutes. I cried and I think he probably cried, and I felt it all melt away. And then I went back to the painting. - TM Davy, 43, artist\n\nKim Gordon in 1990.\n\nLaura Levine/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nIf things are too hard, something's wrong, but you also have to embrace the awkward feelings. See if you can fool yourself - I used to get self-conscious about drawing when I was a teenager in an art class with a model, and the teacher said, \"Don't think of it as drawing. Think of it as designing the page.\" That really loosened things up for me. It's amazing what you can do if you pretend. - Kim Gordon\n\nWhen people say they're self-taught, it means they asked somebody else how they did it. When I began in folk music, I went to the clubs and I begged and borrowed and asked. [More recently, having taken up painting acrylics a little over a decade ago,] I was painting [Anthony] Fauci and couldn't figure out how to do his glasses. I called an artist friend and she had all these tricks - \"Don't try to copy the photograph,\" she told me, \"just use dabs of paint here and there to give the impression of glass.\" It didn't take more than 45 minutes to learn how to put glasses on Fauci. Without her, I would've struggled for weeks trying to get it right. - Joan Baez, 83, singer-songwriter, activist, painter and author\n\nRemember that the maker almost never knows exactly what they're making in advance. The great works often appear when we're aiming toward something completely different. Start as soon as you see a way in. I [also] find it helpful to work on multiple things at the same time. Not in the same moment but during the same general time period. The beauty is that different projects are at different stages, so you can avoid getting burned out on any one [thing]. We can step away, work on something else and come back with new eyes, as if we're seeing it for the first time. Tunnel vision's easy to fall into when working on a single project for a long period. We can end up getting lost in details nobody else will ever notice, while losing touch with the grand gesture of the work. - Rick Rubin, 61, music producer and author of \"The Creative Act: A Way of Being\"\n\nMurray Hill in 1996.\n\nCatherine McGann/Getty Images\n\nThere were certain things I couldn't do during the [SAG-AFTRA] strike, but I did get a book deal. It's called \"Showbiz! My Unexpected Life as a Middle-Aged Man,\" and I've got to get that done - by June 1st! I'm used to being onstage. When I'm sitting at my desk in my studio apartment, I procrastinate quite a bit, and I'm always asking myself, \"Is this part of the creative process for me, or am I just making my life harder?\" But I also procrastinate in productive ways. I go for a walk - in rehab, they taught us, \"Move a muscle, change a thought.\" Then I come back and put on jazz music. Doing that removes the blocks, probably because jazz is so much about improvisation and I'm at my core an improviser. Another thing I'll do to light the match is turn to others' work. I'll watch Dean Martin videos or a documentary or old game shows. For this memoir, I've been reading memoirs by other people - Gary Gulman, Viola Davis, Maria Bamford, Leslie Jones, Aparna Nancherla - and not only does that awaken my creative senses, it triggers memories. - Murray Hill, 52, comedian, actor and writer\n\nThere was a time when [my] body was always ready, and when I had so many axes to grind and windmills to chase [that] something would come out. Now I can't just depend on my body being there - that I'm going to bust a move and seduce - so I have to be a little more strategic: \"What's the idea? Does it serve anyone other than you?\" I'm trying to reaffirm for myself that what I have left in me to say is worth saying. Doubt is always with us, and it burns like fire. But if I refuse to give up the mantle of being a creative artist, I've got to do something. [You might say] \"Well, why don't you just love a child? Why don't you go work at a soup kitchen down the street?\" Because I'm a self-involved son of a bitch. Procrastination says, \"I don't dare,\" but can you live with yourself if you don't? So how do you start? Terror. Guilt. Fear. All negatives to this generation of young people who don't ever want to be uncomfortable, but the generation that formed me and my own generation had that feeling that you're being pushed against and you've got to push back, because you're not like them. As Martha Graham said to Agnes de Mille, \"There is only a queer divine dissatisfaction, a blessed unrest that keeps us marching and makes us more alive than the others.\" I've got to believe that about myself, and the evidence is what I dare to do. - Bill T. Jones, 72, choreographer, director and dancer\n\nOne thing that eases the prospect of getting started is remembering that not everything you make needs to be for consumption or even to count as art. I recently spent nine months quietly making these works - mineral paint on cement slabs - and ended up throwing them all away because I decided they were too conventional. You're not married to your old self, either. In 2013, there was an electrical fire at the studio I'd just moved into, and the building burned to the ground. I lost cartons of negatives and proof sheets that were over six feet tall, as well as photographs - stuff I'd made five, seven, 10, 15 years prior. Of course, it was traumatic and terrifying, but it was also freeing. Eventually I realized it was an opportunity for me to draw a line and stop making a certain kind of work. As artists, we think, \"I got known for this type of thing,\" or, \"This is what everybody seems to like of mine.\" A part of me felt, \"I have to rebuild this person,\" and then I thought, \"Well, I don't,\" and I started something else. It was actually one of the most fruitful periods of my creative life. - Anthony Pearson, 55, painter, sculptor and photographer\n\nJoan Baez in 1974.\n\nDavid Redfern/Redferns via Getty Images\n\nWhen I was working on \"Diamonds & Rust\" (1975), I was at a low point of my career and I made a decision that I was going to concentrate on music and quit globe-trotting for different issues. I realized that the music needed my time and attention if it was going to be any good. Learning to live with the state of the world's a daily practice. Everything we do, we do against the backdrop of global warming and fascism. I never dreamed I'd live in a world this chaotic and discouraging, and I'm overwhelmed but I'm also a great believer in denial - I think that's where you have to be in order to create, or have fun or dance - providing that we set aside a certain amount of time to come out of denial and actually do something to help. - Joan Baez\n\nLast year, I went through what medical professionals would call a flop era. I'd had three years of the kind of lovely, psychotic busyness that has you hopping from job to job, just following green lights, but then everything went poof - the show I was working on got canceled; the financing for the film adaptation of my novel fell through. I'd been working on such personal things regarding sex and disability and, when those things ended or weren't [well] received, I began to doubt myself. But then, you're combating panic, and I started thinking really awful thoughts like, \"Do I need to write a pilot where there's a dead body?\" Fear is the most poisonous thing to creativity. You can't force it, and you have to listen to the work - it'll tell you what it needs to be. Look at me getting all woo-woo, but it's true. When you make a living off of writing, not every single project's going to be from the depths of your soul, but I think there should always be some level of enjoyment. Starting over is really humbling, by the way. Knowing when to stop and when to start over requires giving your ego an Ambien. Real failure is letting your ego drive the bus of your life right off the cliff. - Ryan O'Connell, 37, writer and actor\n\nThese interviews have been edited and condensed.\n\nInterviews by Kate Guadagnino\n\nWe asked 80 artists and other creative people to tell us what they're starting right now or hope to start very soon.\n\nAlice McDermott, 70, writer\n\nThere are three kinds of novels I've never taken to heart: science fiction, murder mysteries and novels about novelists.

Painting [with oil] is as frustrating and exhilarating as I remember it being when I was in art school 43 years ago, and my paintings look alarmingly not unlike the ones I did at 19.\n\nPiero Lissoni, 67, architect and designer\n\nI've started the design for several new buildings that will become government offices in Budapest. I'd like to start designing chairs, lights, skyscrapers, spacecraft. In truth, I'd like to start doing everything again.\n\nPeter Paul Rubens's \"The Massacre of the Innocents\" (circa 1610), Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto\n\nRobert Longo, 71, visual artist\n\nI've been struggling to figure out how best to make sense of the overwhelming images in the news, so I'm turning to the past. I'm working on two monumental charcoal drawings based on paintings [about war]: Peter Paul Rubens's \"The Massacre of the Innocents\" (circa 1610) and Francisco de Goya's \"The Third of May 1808\" (1814).\n\nGabriel Hendifar, 42, designer\n\nI'm moving into a new apartment by myself after a series of long relationships. I'm excited to challenge my own ideas about how I want to live and to see how that affects the work of my design studio [Apparatus] as we begin our next collection.\n\nDonna Huanca, 43, visual artist\n\nI am starting to experiment with some hair sculptures that will be worn for my final performance at my current show at Faurschou Foundation in Brooklyn. I have also been dreaming of growing mushroom colonies in my studio for as long as I can remember. (Updated April 25, 2024)\n\nSatoshi Kuwata, 40, fashion designer, Setchu\n\nWe're about to start offering shoes. I've thought of the design. Now I just have to go to the factory and see them in real life.\n\nAaron Aujla, 38, and Ben Bloomstein, 36, designers, Green River Project\n\nWe're starting a new collection of furniture based on offcuts from the studio that are finished with a modified piano lacquer. Hopefully, a suite of these pieces will be ready for exhibition by fall. We also have a commission we're excited to start - a large sculptural fireplace made from three unique logs of rare wood.\n\nAdrianne Lenker, 32, musician, Big Thief\n\nI want to start learning how to paint. The few times I've tried it, I loved it but also felt daunted by all I needed to learn. I often think of my songs in terms of paintings. My grandmother Diane Lee's an amazing watercolorist. Recently she gave me a lesson all about gray.\n\nMelissa Cody's \"Power Up\" (2023), courtesy of the artist and Garth Greenan Gallery, New York\n\nMelissa Cody, 41, textile artist\n\nI'm starting to create wall tapestries that incorporate my pre-existing designs, which were handwoven on a traditional Navajo/Diné loom, but these new works are highly detailed sampler compositions made on a digital Jacquard loom.\n\nJosh Kline, 44, multidisciplinary artist\n\nI'm working toward shooting my first feature film - a movie, not a project for the art world.\n\nSally Breer, 36, interior decorator\n\nMy husband and I have started building some structures on a property we own in upstate New York - he has a construction company in Los Angeles. We're using locally sourced wood and are 80 percent done with a studio-guesthouse, a simple 14-by-18-foot box set on foundation screws, tucked into a pine forest. This is the first time we're really working together as a design-build team. He's started referring to it as our \"art project.\"\n\nEddie Martinez, 47, visual artist\n\nI'm restarting a group of large-scale paintings for an exhibition at the Parrish Art Museum [in Water Mill, N.Y.] this summer. They're each 12 feet tall and based on a drawing of a butterfly. The series is called \"Bufly\" since that's how my son, Arthur, mispronounced \"butterfly\" when he was younger. I'd put the paintings aside while I finished my work for the Venice Biennale. Now I'm locked in the studio, painting like a nut!\n\nKarin Dreijer, a.k.a. Fever Ray, 49, singer-songwriter\n\nI've been thinking about learning to play the drums. They've always felt like a bit of a mystery to me.\n\nEric N. Mack, 36, visual artist\n\nI'm starting to recharge in order to begin my next body of work. I journal, read, explore the Criterion Channel and get deep-tissue massages. I keep wishing I'd organize the fabrics in my studio.\n\nJenni Kayne, 41, fashion designer\n\nWe're starting the next iteration of the Jenni Kayne Ranch [the brand's former property in Santa Ynez, Calif., where she'd invite guests for yoga, dining and spa experiences], only this time we're heading to upstate New York. We're calling it the Jenni Kayne Farmhouse, and it'll include a self-care sanctuary where slow living is a genuine ritual.\n\nChristine Sun Kim, 43, multidisciplinary artist\n\nI have a bit of an adverse reaction to people doing American Sign Language interpretations of popular songs on social media - they're usually based entirely on the lyrics in English, when rhyming works differently in ASL. So I've been wanting to make a fully native ASL \"music\" video. One day.\n\nEllia Park, 40, restaurateur\n\nI've started collaborating with the in-house designer at Atomix, one of the restaurants I run with my husband, Junghyun Park, on custom welcome cards for the guests that feature bespoke artwork.\n\nAwol Erizku, 35, visual artist\n\nAwol Erizku's \"Pharrell, SSENSE\" (2021), from \"Awol Erizku: Mystic Parallax\" (Aperture, 2023), courtesy of the artist\n\nI'm focused on my exhibition \"Mystic Parallax,\" opening in May in Bentonville, Ark. [which will include concerts and portraits of such people as Solange and Pharrell Williams]. What I never seem to get around to is archiving all of my negatives in the studio.\n\nJeremiah Brent, 39, interior designer\n\nAs I navigate the [effect of the] ever-so-saturated interior design algorithm, I'm challenging our team to expand the language we speak, diversifying design references by looking to the unexpected: playwrights, films, historians and science.\n\nVincent Van Duysen, 61, architect\n\nI'm focusing on the 90th anniversary of [the Italian furniture company] Molteni & C. I'm also excited about our recent addition to the family - a black-and-tan dachshund called Vesta after the virgin goddess of the hearth and home.\n\nKwame Onwuachi, 34, chef\n\nI'm working on launching a sparkling-water line - the proceeds of which will help bring clean water wells to African countries - and starting to write my third cookbook. I start everything I think of.\n\nLarissa FastHorse, 52, playwright and choreographer\n\nI'm adapting a beloved American musical - I can't say which - into a TV series. Which is scary because, even though I just adapted \"Peter Pan\" for the stage, the TV process is the opposite: Instead of cutting down a three-hour musical, I have to add hours and hours of content. So it feels like beginning over and over again.\n\nPeter Halley, 70, visual artist\n\nI've started to paint watercolors. Now that I've reached 70, I thought it was about time. The images are arranged in a grid like on a comic book page, but the narrative's asynchronous. They're based on images of one of my cells exploding, an obsession I've had going all the way back to the '80s.\n\nDarren Bader, 46, conceptual artist\n\nI want to start an art gallery called Post-Artist that regularly shows art but refuses to name who made it. No social media presence. I also want to do what Harmony Korine is doing, except with none of that content.\n\nJeff Tweedy, 56, musician, Wilco\n\nI'm about to record an album of new music with my solo band, which isn't really solo at all. I'm bringing my sons and the close friends and quasi family who've been playing with me live for the past 10 years or so into the studio. I've written songs that feel like they can be a vessel for all of our voices together: a miniature choir. There's really no experience that compares to singing with other people. I think it tells us something about how to be in the world.\n\nCharles Yu, 48, writer\n\nI'm about to start promoting the \"Interior Chinatown\" series [based on Yu's 2020 novel]. I'd like to get into music and service. My son's a drummer, and he's awakened some latent impulse in me. And my daughter and wife have been volunteering. I'm not exactly sure what's been keeping me from either. I could say work, but I suspect the actual answer is nothing.\n\nElyanna, 22, singer-songwriter\n\nI'd love to improve my Spanish. I visit my family in Chile at least once a year and, every time I fly back to L.A., I realize that I need to keep practicing.\n\nBoots Riley, 53, filmmaker and musician\n\nI'm getting ready to start filming a feature I wrote about a group of professional female shoplifters who find a device called a situational accelerator that heightens the conflict of anything they shoot it at. I also have a sci-fi adventure: a janky, lo-fi epic space funk opera. My dream is to use the same crew and shoot the two movies back to back in Oakland, Calif. [where I live]. That's one thing about being 53 - I want to be able to spend more time with my kids.\n\nDamien Maloney/The New York Times\n\nSable Elyse Smith, 37, visual artist\n\nI've recently embarked on an operatic project. Yikes! MoMA invited me to make a sound piece that'll open in July, and it'll be a kind of prelude to a larger version. It's titled \"If You Unfolded Us.\" It's a queer love story and a coming-of-age story about two Black women.\n\nSatoshi Kondo, 39, fashion designer, Issey Miyake\n\nMy latest experiment with washi , or traditional Japanese paper, is blending fibers extracted from the remaining fabrics of past clothing collections with the pulp mixture from which washi is made. It's a way of playing with color and texture.\n\nLaila Gohar, 35, chef and artist\n\nAlmost all of my work has used food as a medium and has therefore been ephemeral. Making work that isn't - namely, sculptures - is an idea I've been toying with for a while, but I haven't been able to jump into it yet. I once read something an artist said about how she thought male artists are more concerned with legacy than female artists, and that female artists are more comfortable creating ephemeral work. This rang true for me, but now I feel slightly more confident about making things that might outlive me.\n\nPatricia Urquiola, 62, architect and designer\n\nI was nominated [last year] as a member of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando in Madrid, so now I'm writing the acceptance thesis, or discurso de ingreso . It's an occasion to reflect on ideas - for example, I reread the philosopher Bruno Latour, who argues that design \"is never a process that begins from scratch: To design is always to redesign.\"\n\nLuke Meier, 48, and Lucie Meier, 42, fashion designers, Jil Sander\n\nWe've started making some objects - glass and ceramics. We aren't at all experienced in these fields, so it's invigorating to play again.\n\nKevin Baker/Courtesy of Number 9 Films.\n\nMarianne Elliott, 57, director\n\nI've always wanted to do a film, but it requires so much time and theater is a hungry beast, so it's eluded me until now: \"The Salt Path,\" starring Gillian Anderson, is based on a true story about a remarkable English couple [who embark on a 630-mile hike].\n\nSamuel D. Hunter, 42, playwright\n\nLast year, I was approached by Joe Mantello and Laurie Metcalf, who wanted someone to write a play for Joe to direct and Laurie to star in. I'd never met either of them but, if I had to pick one actor on earth to write a role for, it would be Laurie. \"Little Bear Ridge Road,\" a dark comedy about an estranged aunt and nephew who are forcibly reunited after the passing of a troubled family member, will go into rehearsals in May.\n\nThebe Magugu, 30, fashion designer\n\nWhen I was 16, I began writing a novel, taking place between the small South African towns of Kimberley and Kuruman, that I've contributed to every year since. It currently sits as a huge slab of a book - around 80,000 words - and I've been meaning to rewrite and polish the earlier chapters. I've given myself the next 10 years [to finish the project]. It'll be a gift I give to myself when I turn 40.\n\nMisha Kahn, 34, designer and sculptor\n\nI have an idea for this toothpaste project called Zaaams that's expanded, of its own volition, into an entire cinematic universe. Sometimes an idea can grow so big that it's unmanageable and nearly unstartable. Sometimes I'll really start working on it, but I get overwhelmed by the seismic rift in society it would cause and feel dizzy. Crest, if you're reading this, call me.\n\nNell Irvin Painter, 81, visual artist and writer\n\nI'm way too old to be a beginner. I'm 81 and have already written and published a million (OK, 10) books. But a very different kind of project's been tugging at me: something like an autobiographical Photoshop document with layers from different phases of my life in the 1960s and '70s - spent in France, Ghana, the American South. I'd have to be myself at different ages.\n\nCourtesy of Nell Irvin Painter\n\nSharon Van Etten, 43, singer-songwriter\n\nIn 2020, I became familiar with the work of Susan Burton, the founder of A New Way of Life, which provides formerly incarcerated women with the care and community they need to get their lives back on track, and was so moved by her story I asked my record label if it was OK to use money from my music video budget to produce a minidocumentary on the organization, \"Home to Me.\" I still have a lot to learn about filmmaking, but I think it's the beginning of something beautiful.\n\nPiet Oudolf, 79, garden designer\n\nI'm starting the planting design for Calder Gardens, a new center dedicated to the work of the artist Alexander Calder in Philadelphia. I'm working on it with Herzog & de Meuron architects, and it'll include a four-season garden that will evolve with the months. Early in the year, it's about ephemerals (bulbs). Spring is when woodland flowers are important. Summer will be the high point of the prairie-inspired areas, and in fall and winter there'll be seed heads and skeletons. I think a good, harmonious garden is like a piece of living art.\n\nRafael de Cárdenas, 49, designer\n\nAs a consummate shopper, I've always thought the best way to bring my interests together would be with a store - a lab for testing things out and creating a connoisseurship in the process. I'm thinking Over Our Heads (the second iteration of Edna's Edibles in [the 1979-88 sitcom] \"The Facts of Life\") meets Think Big! (a now-closed shop in SoHo) meets [the London gallery] Anthony d'Offay meets [the defunct clothing store] Charivari meets [the old nightclub] Palladium.\n\nGaetano Pesce, 84, architect and designer\n\nI'm working on a possible collaboration with a jewelry company from Italy. I can't say the name yet, but the pieces stand to be very innovative. Also, another collaboration with the perfume company Amouage inspired by time I spent in Oman's Wadi Dawkah and the beautiful frankincense trees there.\n\nJohn Cale, 82, musician and composer\n\nEver since I played viola in the National Youth Orchestra of Wales, I've been hypnotized by the thought of the discipline needed to conduct. My attention soon wandered - from John Cage to rock music. Now, 60 years on, it's finally time.\n\nNona Hendryx, 79, interdisciplinary artist and musician\n\nI'm working on the Dream Machine Experience, a magical 3-D environment that'll be filled with music, sound, images and gamelike features. It'll premiere at Lincoln Center this June. [My idea was] to create an imaginative world inspired by Afro-Futurism that encourages a wide, multigenerational audience to share.\n\nFaye Toogood, 47, designer and visual artist\n\nI'd like to develop a jewelry collection, but I haven't. Is it because no one's asked - no phone call from Tiffany! - or because I'm struggling to understand how adornment fits into our current world?\n\nFreddie Ross Jr., a.k.a. Big Freedia, 46, musician\n\nI'm recording a kids' album and publishing a picture book for early readers. Much of my art is about language and the unique colloquialisms that we have in bounce culture. Children respond to its snappy rhymes and phrases.\n\nDanzy Senna, 53, writer\n\nEvery time I write a novel, I think, \"This is the most masochistic experience I've ever had - I'm going to quit this racket.\" But I feel incomplete without this depressive object to feel beholden to. I just finished editing one book [\"Colored Television\"] and have the sinking feeling I'm about to start another.\n\nJackie Sibblies Drury, 42, playwright\n\nI'm starting, hopefully in earnest, to write a play in collaboration with the director Sarah Benson inspired by action movies. We were intrigued by the problem of trying to put chase scenes or action sequences onstage, where it's difficult to build momentum or suspense because in theater we have less control over the viewer's eye, among other things. But hopefully the play will be about what it means to see ourselves in these macho cis men who often get hurt pretending to almost die for our entertainment - or something like that?\n\nLindsey Adelman, 55, designer\n\nI'm putting together a digital archive of my work and ephemera - about 30 years' worth - revisiting everything from the sculpture I made as a student at RISD to the paper lights David Weeks and I sold for $25 to datebooks where I scribbled notes about things I wished would come true and then did. I hope it'll encourage others to start something. I want them to understand, \"Oh, this was the first step ... this beautiful, finished thing was inspired by a piece of garbage dangling from a streetlamp.\"\n\nElizabeth Diller, 69, architect, Diller Scofidio + Renfro\n\nDavid Wall/Getty Images\n\nSince 2012, when my studio was doing research for a contemporary staging of Benjamin Britten's chamber opera of Henry James's \"The Turn of the Screw,\" I've been meaning to start a book about ghosts. While ghosts are a well-trod literary device, their visual representation on stage and screen also has a rich history that can be told through the lens of an architect. Despite the fact that ghosts transcend the laws of physics, they're stubbornly site-specific - they live in walls, closets, attics and other marginal domestic settings, and they rarely stray from home.\n\nDavid Oyelowo, 48, actor\n\nSomething that three friends and I are in the process of building and developing is a streaming platform that we launched last year called Mansa. The idea - born out of growing frustration with making things that I love and then having to use some kind of distribution mechanism where the decision makers are almost always people who don't share my demographic - is Black culture for a global audience. Essentially, we started a tech company that intersects with our love of story and our need to create [pipelines] for people of color and beyond to be seen.\n\nFranklin Sirmans, 55, museum director, Pérez Art Museum Miami\n\nThere's a recurring exhibition that I've worked on with [the curator] Trevor Schoonmaker since 2006 called \"The Beautiful Game\" that consists of art about soccer. We do it every four years because of the World Cup, and I'm starting to get into the 2026 iteration. I've also been trying to finish a book of poems since I graduated college more than 30 years ago. But it's happening. It's not like you don't write a good sentence every now and then.\n\nJamie Nares, 70, multidisciplinary artist\n\nI've always loved this line of poetry [from the Irish poet John Anster's loose translation of Goethe's \"Faust\"] that goes, \"Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it.\" One thing I've begun recently is a revisiting of my 1977 performance \"Desirium Probe,\" for which I hooked myself up to a TV that the audience couldn't see, and relayed what was happening onscreen through re-enactment. Now I'm going to do it with YouTube videos chosen at random from the wealth of rubbish and interesting stuff on there. And as a video, because I'm not as agile as I once was.\n\nJoseph Dirand, 50, architect and designer\n\nCourtesy of Joseph Dirand Architecture\n\nMy firm has just started developing, with a French company called Zephalto, a prototype of the interiors for a hot-air balloon that will take travelers to the stratosphere, and the carbon footprint of the journey will be equivalent to that of the production of a pair of blue jeans. The balloon is transparent, so it'll be almost as if you're going up in a bubble of air - riders will see the curve of the earth. We're designing three private cabins: sexy, organic cocoons that reference the '60s and the dream of space, but are otherwise pretty minimal. The landscape is the star of the show.\n\nAmaarae, 29, singer-songwriter\n\nI'm working on the deluxe version of my 2023 album, \"Fountain Baby.\" The approach for the original album was very maximalist - I organized these camps all over the world and had a bunch of people come through to work on the music. Afterward, I felt underwhelmed - not by the project but by how I felt at the end of it all. [So] I stripped back everything so it's just me and my home setup, trying ideas. Before, I was really lofty, but now my feet are touching grass a little bit.\n\nJennifer Egan, 61, writer\n\nI'm starting a novel set in late 19th-century New York City. As always with my fiction, I have little idea of what will happen, which lends an element of peril to every project! Time and place are my portal into story, and I'm interested in a time when urban America was crowded and full of buildings we occupy today, yet the landscape beyond seemed almost infinite.\n\nCarla Sozzani, 76, gallerist and retailer\n\nJust as my partner, Kris Ruhs, and I revamped the then-unknown Corso Como area of Milan, we're now putting our energy into the construction of a new studio for him, as well as the expansion of the Fondazione Sozzani [cultural center], both of which are in Bovisa, another old industrial neighborhood. I wanted to be an architect when I was young, but my father said, \"No!\"\n\nStephanie Goto, 47, architect\n\nIf my clients allow me to peel one eye away from their commissions, I'd like to dive deeper into the renovation of my own property in Connecticut, which includes the circa 1770 former home of Marilyn Monroe and a tobacco-and-milk barn that will house my studio.\n\nAmalia Ulman, 35, visual artist and filmmaker\n\nI'm beginning to write the script for my third feature film - probably my favorite part of the process, when I just need to close my eyes and see the film in my head. It's the closest to a holiday because it feels like daydreaming.\n\nWim Wenders, 78, filmmaker\n\nSeveral years ago, I started a project about the Swiss architect Peter Zumthor, who, along with others, designed the new Los Angeles County Museum of Art that's being built now. The working title of the film is \"The Secret of Places,\" and it's done in 3-D. My dream is to make a comedy one day. [ Laughs .] Seriously. [ Laughs again .] I'm working on it.\n\nWendy Red Star's \"Beaver That Stretches\" (2023), © Wendy Red Star, courtesy of the artist and Sargents Daughters\n\nWendy Red Star, 43, visual artist\n\nI've started highlighting Crow and Plateau women's art history by making painted studies of parfleches, these 19th-century rawhide suitcases embellished with geometric designs. I'm learning so much about these women just by their mark making, but have only come across a few that have the name of the person who made it, so I'm titling my works by pulling women's and girls' names from the census records for the Crow tribe between 1885 and 1940.\n\nNick Ozemba, 32, and Felicia Hung, 33, designers, In Common With\n\nNext month, we're opening Quarters, a concept store and gathering space in TriBeCa that will feature our first furniture collection.\n\nBobbi Jene Smith, 40, dancer, choreographer and actress\n\nMy husband, Or Schraiber, and I are creating a work composed of solos for each dancer of L.A. Dance Project, where we've been residents for the past year and a half. We've had the unique opportunity to connect deeply with some of the dancers, and this - a gratitude poem for each of them - will be our culminating project. They'll each be a few minutes long and characterized by physicality set against silence.\n\nEditor's note: The architect and designer Gaetano Pesce, whose comments are included in this piece, died on April 4 at age 84.\n\nThese interviews have been edited and condensed.\n\nAdvertisement"

The two women have been a buddy act since the 1980 film \"9 to 5,\" and on Friday they teamed up for Fire Drill Friday.\n\nThe weekly protest against congressional inaction on climate change began 12 weeks ago, billed as something of an adult \"atta girl\" celebrity cheering section for the youth climate strikes of Greta Thunberg. Ms. Fonda was told that Congress is rarely in session on Friday afternoons, but she stuck to the schedule because throughout the world, youth climate actions are also on Fridays.\n\nAnd though Congress has almost never taken in one of Ms. Fonda's curtain calls, her Fire Drill Fridays have become something of a place to see and be seen in Washington, a challenge to the adage that the nation's capital is \"Hollywood for ugly people.\" Ms. Fonda, in fact, has been bringing Hollywood to Washington. One week it's Ted Danson and the next brings Catherine Keener. I'll see your Diane Lane and raise you a Sam Waterston. Oh, look, there's Sally Field.\n\nThere are teach-ins, and birthday parties, and lunches at fashionable Washington restaurants for the climate activists and celebrity friends drawn into Ms. Fonda's orbit, all of whom have the routine down pat: rally, get arrested, get released, and repeat.\n\nThe focus of Friday's fire drill - \"The Way Climate Change Affects Our Forests, the 'Lungs of the World'\"- featured experts addressing the dire state of rainforests and the plight of indigenous people dying in clashes over their native lands.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Jane Fonda Is Paying Close Attention\n\nThe first four acts in Susan Lacy's new HBO documentary, \" Jane Fonda in Five Acts ,\" are named after men: Fonda's father, Henry; her first husband, the French auteur Roger Vadim, who directed her in \"Barbarella\"; her second husband, the antiwar activist and author Tom Hayden; and her third husband, the media mogul Ted Turner. The last act is called \"Jane Fonda.\" The story that the movie tells is largely about how Fonda, despite her outspokenness, took a lifetime to live on her own terms.\n\nLast Friday, Fonda, who turned eighty in December, was sitting in a publicity office, wearing mod-ish pants, a black turtleneck, and a chain necklace that she occasionally fondled. When I arrived, she was scrolling through her phone, reading breaking news . \"Did you just hear that Rod Rosenstein once proposed secretly taping President Trump and removing him via the Twenty-fifth Amendment?\" she said. \"That's not going to help.\" When I asked what we do if Trump fires Rosenstein or Robert Mueller , she said, \"We take to the streets. We pour into the streets and we protest like never before.\" The Jane Fonda Experience had begun.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\nYou've put so much of your life into the public arena-your mother dying by suicide when you were twelve, eating disorders, your marriages. Is there a psychic cost to making everything so public?\n\nThe only problem is the one that-\" Nanette .\" What is her name? That great standup comedian?\n\nHannah Gadsby?\n\nHannah Gadsby articulated it far better than I can: when you have developed a public narrative of your life that you keep repeating over and over again, it can become difficult, then, to go deeper for yourself. So I think that's the danger. Can that be called a psychic cost? I'm not sure.\n\nIs there a part of you, after all these years in the spotlight, that you keep for yourself? A private core?\n\nWell, I'm still trying to totally understand the private core. I mean, I'm a seeker. I'm really, really curious. What is real? What is true? Who am I? Like, I don't know if I'm a narcissist or not. I'd like to know!\n\nI'm sure people have accused you of being a narcissist.\n\nOh, yeah. My granddaughter. [ Laughs. ]\n\nThere was a surreal element to your childhood in Hollywood. Jimmy Stewart was your Santa Claus every Christmas, and you found out about your mother's suicide from a movie magazine . How did you navigate what was real and what wasn't?\n\nWell, I'm extremely resilient. Resilience is a really interesting thing. A therapist I had once said she can tell when someone walks in the room if they're resilient. It means that no matter what happens to you-short of really profound trauma-you're always scanning the horizon looking for a warm body that can take you in and love you and teach you. And some people can be right in front of a warm body that can do that, and they can't metabolize it. They can't let them in. But I am able.\n\nEvery time I'm talking, there's a half of my brain that's thinking, \"Why are you even saying this? You've had it so easy.\" I'm really aware of how, if the things that I've done had been done by a black woman, I'd probably be dead. I'm aware of that.\n\nYour father, Henry Fonda, was very critical of your body when you were young, and I'm sure that had a lot to do with your struggle with eating disorders . Did you ever get to talk to him about it?\n\nNo, no.\n\nWere you able to forgive him?\n\nTotally. If you go back and you really try to understand who your parents were, and their parents, you'll probably end up finding out that they had issues, that what they did was the behavior of someone that has wounds. And when you understand that you can't help but forgive them, and yourself. It wasn't that I didn't deserve their love-it's that they had been damaged and just weren't capable.\n\nYou say in the film, \"I always saw my mother as a victim. Woman equals victim.\" What was she a victim of?\n\n[ Sighs .] I can't-my brother doesn't want me talking about it, so I can't really answer it. I can only tell you that as a young girl she was traumatized. And I know this because I got her medical records, in which she wrote her little life history.\n\nRead Hilton Als's 2011 Profile of Jane Fonda.\n\nUntil I found that out, I didn't want anything to do with her. It's why I never went to her grave. But, once I found out what she had been through, all the pieces of the puzzle fell into place, and I gained agency over my life. I was a child when she died, so, even if I had known, I had no way of really being able to help her heal. All I knew was that she's not all there, and Dad doesn't really love her, and I don't want anything to do with her. He's the one that's going to survive. It was hard for me to then start to understand women, and love women, and make friends with women.\n\nThis reminds me of Christine Blasey Ford . I've seen a lot of women talk about how it's been triggering to see someone carry trauma for years and then be attacked in public. Has the story resonated with you in that way?\n\nOh, God, yes. I mean, when people say, \"Why did she wait so long?\"-because that's what people who've been traumatized do. A lot of it has to do with carrying guilt, and, the younger they are when it happens, the more guilt they carry. And sometimes it's so bad that they just bury it, or they think, \"This is just normal.\" The ability to trust, the ability to really be relational, is so severely wounded that it needs a certain kind of process to heal. I totally understand why women are triggered by Dr. Ford-and, starting with the Trump election, why women are triggered. Now, we have to understand, he's been traumatized, too.\n\nBrett Kavanaugh?\n\nNo, Trump! Trump is a man who was profoundly traumatized as a child by his father and not protected by his mother, and it must have been really bad. And we are reaping the results of that early trauma.\n\nYou've said that \"we have to love\" Donald Trump. But he's called you \" disgusting \" on Twitter. How do you manage that?\n\nWell, I don't like him. I'm making the distinction that Martin Luther King did: you don't have to like them, but you have to love them. Because, if we carry hate, we're the losers. We have to understand where the behavior comes from. Let's not enable her or him, but let's not hate him, because it steals something from your own soul.\n\nIn an interview you gave in 2006, you said that you didn't want to speak out about the Iraq War, because you thought you would be a distraction. Do you no longer feel that way?\n\nI'm speaking more about domestic issues now, and the climate, which is a global issue.\n\nWhat changed?\n\nWell, I've changed. I'm getting old, I'm going to die soon, and I have strong feelings, and I think that these things need to be said. And so I'm going to say them.\n\nWe live in a very polarized environment, where celebrities speaking out can be ostracized. And you're sort of Patient Zero for that. Do you feel like you've been here before, and you know what it's like?\n\nPeople came after me, but they didn't stop me. Now, I recognize that part of it has to do with who I am, and who my father is, and my race. But I'm still going. And what I'm interested in is helping people understand the importance of talking to people who don't agree with you. Empathy is radical in this kind of environment. We've got to understand why people voted the way they did.\n\nYes, there are some people-don't even bother. They are dyed-in-the-wool white supremacists. Who knows what their wounds were? I don't hate them for it, but I'm not going to waste my time. But there's a whole lot of people in the middle of this country who are so scared and in such pain, because they feel betrayed. As well they should! Nobody's been paying attention to them. That's when you begin to learn: you talk to them. That's why I've been spending so much time in Michigan. What do you really care about? What are the issues? Always, Fox is playing in the living room, so you know what they haven't heard. And sometimes it's, like, \"Really? Oh, my God, I didn't know that.\"\n\nDo you find that people come to you with this image of liberal Jane Fonda? Does it still alienate people?\n\nI'm sure. I haven't run into it when I canvass and knock on people's doors. No one has slammed the door in my face.\n\nWhat do they say when Jane Fonda knocks on their door?\n\nWell, they don't always know who I am. But you can learn a lot at the door. It's what the right wing has been doing for decades. It's why we lost the state legislatures and the gubernatorial races and the down-tickets. It's because they've been on the ground, because they know what's important.\n\nSpeaking of reaching out to people on the other side of the political divide: you made \"Coming Home\" with Jon Voight, a film that was passionately antiwar. What do you make of his politics these days?\n\nI don't know. I don't understand it. I have no idea.\n\nWhen was the last time you talked to him?\n\nYears ago.\n\nDo you think it would be possible to open up a dialogue with someone like him?\n\nI mean, Jon used to be my best friend in Hollywood. He used to help me and Tom Hayden get people to look at the slideshows about the war and the Pentagon Papers. He was right there in the trenches. He's not the only one. There are others-the writer Peter Collier, for example. Everybody has their own reasons. I'd rather talk to people in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan, those kind of places.\n\nBut some of those people share Jon Voight's views.\n\nYeah, but I would rather talk to them than try to persuade Jon Voight of changing his mind.\n\nAt the Emmys last year , you came out with Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton, and you and Lily joked about Trump being like the boss played by Dabney Coleman in your workplace-harassment movie \"9 to 5\"-\n\nAlthough I never said Trump's name.\n\nAnd Dolly seemed to be on a different page. Do you talk to her about politics?\n\nNo. Dolly is a person of heart and spirit. She's not a political person, but we need more like her. She is profound and she has a really, really huge heart, and she's really smart and deeply spiritual.\n\nWhen \" 9 to 5 \" came out, do you remember how men reacted to it, versus women?\n\nI don't. No! It's a good question. We're working on a sequel . And we've discovered that a lot of the young-women office workers haven't seen \"9 to 5.\" My colleagues who started the \"9 to 5\" movement, in D.C. and in Milwaukee, are going to have some groups watch it and then talk about what seems outdated, what resonates. I've been spending a lot of time working on One Fair Wage for restaurant workers in Michigan and elsewhere, and one of the things that I think we're going to have to get into this new movie-if it ever gets that far [ knocks on wood ]-is that a lot of people now who work full time live below the poverty line. They're not as well off as Judy Bernly and Doralee and Violet were back then. Partly, it's that they're subcontracted to companies. They don't even really work for the companies, so they don't have any place to go for wage theft or whatever. They don't get health care. It's really bad.\n\nYou studied early on with Lee Strasberg, who brought the Stanislavski method to America. Are there things that you learned in that class that you still use?\n\nMainly the importance of relaxing. I just finished Sally Field's book, which is really good-\" In Pieces ,\" it's called. She also studied with Lee, but much more in depth. I think he gave me the courage to go into it as a profession. I can't say that I knew how to apply what he said to my work, but I learned the hard way that relaxation is really important.\n\nDid you use things like emotional recall? Your movies have had some very personal moments: obviously, the scenes with your father in \"On Golden Pond,\" but also, I'd imagine, the suicidal despair in \"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?\" Do you pull things from your own life in a Method-acting sort of way?\n\nKind of, yeah. The goal is to try to understand the woman that you are portraying so granularly that you're looking at the world through her eyes. Can I say that that has happened a lot? No, it hasn't. Just a few times.\n\nWhich times?\n\nOftentimes during \" Klute ,\" for example, a few times in \" Coming Home \"-the two films that I've won an Oscar for. A few times in \" Book Club ,\" strangely enough. A few times in \" Our Souls at Night ,\" recently.\n\nYou've said that you noticed your voice dropped during \"Klute.\" Why do you think that was?\n\nBecause I was starting to be an embodied person. I spent a whole lot of my life disembodied, trying to please men. Because if a man-especially a fascinating man, who knows what he's doing and where he's going-oh, my God, if he loves me, it means I'm worth something. Which means that I wasn't really in my body. I wasn't in my skin. It was all about pleasing. Starting with \"Klute,\" I began to re-inhabit myself, and my voice began to drop. Carol Gilligan wrote a book called \" In a Different Voice ,\" and when I read that I went back and looked at all my movies, and I could see my voice, which used to be way up here , start to drop as I started to get agency over my life.\n\nTalking about #MeToo , you've said, \"I never thought I would live to see this happen.\" But why is that? Why didn't this happen during the height of the second-wave feminism of the seventies?\n\nI think Trump has something to do with it. We talked about triggering. Even before he was elected, when the tapes came out and we heard him saying what he said, I think it triggered a lot of women in a very traumatic way. They now had this back in their bodies. The memories were there. And then, because the women who came forward were white, and they were famous, and they were accusing men who were famous, it blew up. African-American women have been saying these things, most notably Anita Hill, for decades. But they weren't famous white women, and the accused wasn't a famous white man. And so that's why I think it just exploded. And it keeps going, because the behavior is so epidemic.\n\nYour three husbands were radically different from one another: the French auteur Roger Vadim, the crunchy radical activist Tom Hayden, the media mogul Ted Turner.\n\nBuccaneer!\n\nDo they have anything in common?\n\nOh, yes! The three of them and me, we're all challenged in the area of intimacy. I sometimes think, Did the perfect man for me come along and I ran away scared? Because he would have said [ bangs the couch ], \"Show up, Fonda. Come on, show up.\" But, if you are dealing with issues and addictions, you're not going to do that.\n\nBut your life also changed dramatically with each of these marriages.\n\nWell, all of them had a totally different narrative. I didn't realize what it meant to be an American until I lived in France [with Vadim], and I really lived in France. And, because I was immersed, I realized how different I was. I was acutely aware that, if you were born into a certain class in Europe, it was hard to get out. Whereas, back then, in the fifties and the early sixties in America, you could pull yourself up-Horatio Alger. It's not true anymore in America, but it was then.\n\nAnd then Tom-I needed someone far wiser and more knowledgeable than I was about movement-building and politics and all of that. And he had this depth of knowledge, and he gave me structure and guidance, and I learned so much from him that I am forever grateful for. I miss him so much.\n\nThere's this crazy part of your biography where you, Tom, and your kids were living in what your father called a shack, in Santa Monica, and you were sleeping on a mattress on the floor.\n\nYeah, I had no dishwasher. I had no washing machine. I wanted to prove, to Tom and to myself, that I could do that, that I didn't need to live with privilege. It was red-lined where we lived, it was thrift shops and bars and laundromats. My kids were never happier than they were there. But then he fell in love with somebody, and it really devastated me. And I'm glad that happened, too, because you think you're broken, but you're really broken open. That's what broke me open, was that nervous breakdown. And then along comes Ted Turner, and he swept me up, which he can do so well. And what a great ten years. Again, I learned so much: about the corporate world, about the media world, and about nature.\n\nWhen you started going out with Ted Turner, did your activist friends feel like it was a betrayal?\n\nNot the ones that I'm close to and that really knew me, because then they got to know Ted. And they realized, in his heart of hearts, Ted is not some billionaire mogul. He's a totally brilliant, visionary, hysterically funny, wounded child.\n\nDo you ever think about what would have happened if you hadn't split up?\n\nRead Ken Auletta's 2001 Profile of Ted Turner.\n\nOh, I do, all the time, yeah. He and I talk about it together. And it was really hard to leave-I was sixty-two years old and I had no career anymore. I didn't have to work, I was being looked after. And yet I knew that, if I stayed, I was never going to become who I'm meant to be as a whole person, as a really authentic person. And I tried to explain it to him, but he doesn't really understand.\n\nStill?\n\nNo. No, unfortunately.\n\nDoes he want to get back together?\n\nYou'd have to ask him. But can't you tell by looking at the movie?\n\nYou tell this story of your first date with Ted, how he bragged about how he went through the CNN archives and had a stack for you and for him.\n\nMine was this big, but his was that big!\n\nThat seems sort of Trumpian to me.\n\nThere's a certain-yeah. Ted was also traumatized as a young boy . When Ted first told me his story, I remember him looking at me and he said, \"Why are you crying?\" And I said, \"Why are you not crying?\" And, because I knew that about him, I could forgive so much. Alice Miller writes a lot about it in books like \" The Drama of the Gifted Child .\" And then another line, which is like a mantra of Ted's: \"It was for my own good. He was my best friend. It was for my own good.\" [ Sighs .] Father!\n\nI want to ask you about the workout tape. The Washington Post wrote about you, in 1985, \"She is a lightning rod for a generation whose rhetoric has evolved from Burn, Baby, Burn to Feel the Burn.\" Do you think that's a fair assessment?\n\nThe workout-first of all, because it funded a statewide organization for economic democracy in California-was well worth it. But also it changed a lot of women's lives for the better. One of my favorite letters, and I got thousands and thousands, was from a woman who said, \"I was brushing my teeth today, and I saw this muscle in my arm that I'd never had before.\" And she said, \"I was so excited, and when I walked into my office I stood up to my boss for the first time in my life.\" It's when you move back into your body, and you own your body: I'm here. Deal with it. Made a huge difference to women.\n\nTom hated it. Even though all money went to the organization. He thought it was all about vanity. It was so much more than that.\n\nWas there an issue around you being more famous and making more money than him?\n\nI think it's very hard for men in this patriarchal culture to be married to someone-I mean, Tom was a great writer. He wrote I don't know how many books. Then I go and write \" Jane Fonda's Workout Book ,\" and it's No. 1 on the New York Times for two years. But he framed it and gave it to me, signed it, \"Congratulations, baby.\" Which was really, really nice of him. I'm sure it must have been very hard for him.\n\nDo you think workout culture now has created an unrealistic standard for perfection?\n\nI don't like that part. I think it's great that people are working out. Especially now that I'm old. What a difference it makes. But when it becomes obsessive-and I can say this from experience, because it was with me-then it's not good.\n\nThe documentary includes an archival clip from a talk show from decades ago, where you say, \"Any healthy country, like any healthy individual, should be in perpetual revolution, perpetual change.\" Is that how you see yourself?\n\nI didn't even know what revolution meant when I said that. I wouldn't say that now. When Ted and I split up, I said to him, \"I've changed.\" And he said, \"You're not supposed to change after sixty.\" And I said, \"I think you're in trouble when you don't keep changing.\" I moved into my daughter's house, and it was pretty shocking going from twenty-three kingdom-sized properties and a jet plane to a really quiet, small house in a not-gentrified part of Atlanta. Me and my golden retriever. And I remember standing in the middle of the room, and I felt so sad. But then I realized, I'm O.K. I don't need a man to define me anymore. And I could feel myself moving back into myself. And I knew that that was God. Whatever God is, I knew, this is what is supposed to happen.\n\nWe're supposed to be whole. I used to be bothered by the fact that in the Bible, in the Book of Matthew, Jesus is quoted as saying to his disciples, \"You must be perfect, as our Father is perfect.\" But it's a mistranslation of the Aramaic. What he really said is, \"You must be whole, as our Father is whole.\" What does it mean? It means your oars are in the water. You're steering your craft, against the tide, trying to be what you were meant to be before you die. So when you get to the end, you know you did your best.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "Queen Jane, Approximately\n\nAugust. The dog days of 2007. The whole world seemed to be wilting. Jane Fonda-the actress, philanthropist, feminist, political activist, model, Christian, blogger, fitness advocate, licensing magnate, and memoirist-impeccable and straight-backed in a light-colored chiffon dress, was attending an outdoor wedding reception in Brooklyn. The groom was Fonda's son, the actor Troy Garity, who had married the actress Simone Bent earlier that day. Before the reception began, Fonda marched over to one of the bar tables, followed by a coterie of younger men. \"I'm the mother of the groom and I need a drink!\" she announced to the startled bartender. She took a sip of her vodka-and-orange-juice and looked around at the crowd, which included her eldest child, the documentary filmmaker Vanessa Vadim, and her youngest, Mary Luana Williams, a park ranger, the child of Black Panthers, whom Fonda had unofficially adopted in the seventies. Then she raised her glass and said, ruefully regarding the proceedings, \"More than my old man did for me.\"\n\nAs the evening progressed, the parents of both the bride and the groom made speeches. Speaking off the cuff, Garity's father, the political activist and politician Tom Hayden, who was Fonda's second husband (neither parent wanted Troy to bear the weight of a famous last name), said that he was especially happy about his son's union with Bent, who is black, because, among other things, it was \"another step in a long-term goal of mine: the peaceful, nonviolent disappearance of the white race.\" Hayden turned the floor over to his ex-wife this way: \"Now Jane wants to say a few words. The new mother-in-law. We know how Jane always becomes the part she's playing. Hopefully, that won't be the case in our son's marriage!\" There was a silence. Fonda had just played Viola Fields, the domineering title character in Robert Luketic's movie \"Monster-in-Law.\" Pulling a sheaf of papers from her purse, Fonda looked concerned, tense. She had written this script herself. She began by apologizing: \"Unlike Tom, who can speak extemporaneously, I have to write everything down.\" For Troy, she continued, Hayden had been \"the parent.\" \"I was usually off making a movie somewhere. Tom was the one who had dinner with Troy every single night.\" Then, referring to her notes, she talked about how Native Americans had once lived where we were now and how her ancestors had sailed from Holland to New York. When the speeches were over, Hayden hugged his son and his new in-laws and rejoined the party, while Fonda, the image of maternal responsibility, went to each of the hundred or so seated guests, shaking their hands and thanking them individually for coming.\n\nAnother role, a different stage. Spring, 2009. This time Fonda was appearing not as a version of herself but as Dr. Katherine Brandt, a musicologist suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease, who was gripped by one last question: why did Beethoven, toward the end of his life, devote so much time to composing thirty-three variations on an insignificant waltz written by Diabelli, a composer of no great distinction?\n\nFonda was starring in \"33 Variations,\" by Moisés Kaufman, her first Broadway performance since 1963. Standing motionless in a white spotlight that emphasized her dark hair and gardenia-white skin, she conveyed her character's drama largely through her voice. Her urgent, seductive, imploring tone was recognizable from her innumerable speeches and interviews and forty-odd film performances, which, over the course of half a century or so, set the template for countless actors, writers, and directors interested in depicting the ever-evolving life of the modern American woman. As she performed in Kaufman's play, Fonda didn't so much smash the stage's fourth wall as ignore it. What she communicated, above and beyond the words of the script, was her desire to inhabit her character's lonely imagination.\n\n\"She makes no distinction between the world in which she lives and the work she does on the stage,\" Kaufman said of Fonda. \"The things she learns in one realm help her in the other.\" Although Kaufman had considered other performers, by the time he met Fonda, in New York, in October, 2008, he told me, he knew that he wanted her for the part. \"There are actresses who do emotional wonders, and there are actresses who can do very intelligent roles but are very dry,\" he said. Fonda, he explained, could do both.\n\nBefore their meeting, Kaufman watched a video clip in which Barbara Walters talked about how Fonda got annoyed when people weren't punctual. He arrived an hour early for their seven-o'clock appointment at the Algonquin Hotel. \"At six-forty-five the elevator opens, and it's her,\" Kaufman said. \"And she shakes my hand and says, 'I knew you were going to be on time. Reading your play, I know you're that kind of person. You've done your research.' \" Kaufman went on, \"She ordered a Martini. And then we kept talking. Later, she says, 'You know, two Martinis ago, you said . . .' And I said, 'Jane, you have to do this play. Any woman who measures time by the number of Martinis consumed is somebody I must work with.' \"\n\nOnce \"33 Variations\" closed, after eighty-five performances (Fonda was nominated for a Best Actress Tony), the actress travelled to Los Angeles for knee-replacement surgery. While recuperating, she stayed at the house of a friend, the producer Paula Weinstein. Fonda (who has since moved to L.A.) was then based in Atlanta-in a loft whose entranceway was designed to resemble a vulva. (When Bill Maher talked to Fonda about this on his television program in 2005, he asked her if there was a back way into her home. She invited him over to find out.) Weinstein's house, on the other hand, was a fairly traditional New England-inspired affair, just off Sunset Boulevard, in Beverly Hills, amid split-level houses, dusty palm trees, and lonely, nondescript streets. Fonda's assistant ushered me into the house, and, as two small dogs ran barking toward me, I heard a familiar voice: \"I need you!\" Fonda's command silenced even the dogs, but when I entered the living room she hunched her shoulders and giggled: an actress in need of a director. Her costume for the day was a long-sleeved peach-colored top and a prairie skirt, and she was sitting, with her legs extended, in front of a computer screen. What she \"needed,\" she explained, was for me to help her figure out how to e-mail a document on her new computer. After the problem had been solved, Fonda stood, with the aid of a cane, to show me how her recovery was progressing. \"Isn't it amazing?\" she said, walking back and forth. \"I'm a little sore today, though. I wore high heels last night.\" When I asked why she'd worn heels so soon after her operation, she said, chastened, \"Vanity.\"\n\nFonda sat down. To test my tape recorder, I said, into the microphone, \"This is Hilton Als, observing Jane Fonda.\"\n\nFonda grabbed the mike, delighted to transform the moment into a performance, and said, \"And this is Jane Fonda, who loves being observed.\"\n\nI asked her something I had wanted to ask since her son's wedding: Why had she said that Hayden was \"the parent\"? Hadn't her role as provider for the family made her just as important? She shook her head and pounded her fist on her chest. \"I remember once reading 'Huckleberry Finn' to Troy, after I'd been away shooting a film,\" she said. \"And Troy looked up at me and asked, 'What's the point of having a mother?' \"\n\nLink copied\n\nIn her best work, Fonda has portrayed women who suffer a kind of spiritual orphanhood, emotionally abandoned by families that were never quite families. \"I felt alone, surrounded by lights\" is how she describes her early days of acting, but it could as easily apply to her childhood. Even her birth name sounds like that of a solitary princess in some dark fairy tale. Lady Jayne Seymour Fonda was the firstborn child of Frances Ford Seymour, a society beauty, and Henry Fonda, the Nebraska-born actor who, as the film historian David Thomson says, \"played some of the most important heroic figures in American film.\" Fonda père was famously critical, perpetually dissatisfied, and notoriously uneasy when it came to dealing with emotion on or off the stage. \"He hated people to cry,\" Jane said. \"I was told when he was rehearsing 'Two for the Seesaw,' with Anne Bancroft, and she had a scene where she would get very emotional, he was so angry that she was actually crying and being emotional he stormed offstage and came back with a mirror and said, 'Look at yourself-it's disgusting.' That kind of vulnerability terrified him.\"\n\nThe director Peter Bogdanovich said that Henry Fonda communicated \"insecurity in just being himself.\" Off-screen, he seems to have spent a substantial amount of time trying to shape his children in his image. In an even-tempered memoir, \"Don't Tell Dad\" (1998), Jane's younger brother, Peter, recalls his father's attempts to transform him. \"I was a skinny little boy,\" he writes. \"It embarrassed Dad, and . . . he did everything he could think of to help me put on weight\"-including feeding his son beer for lunch when he was seven. He sought to mold his daughter's body, too. In her best-selling 2005 memoir, \"My Life So Far,\" she writes, \"Once I hit adolescence, the only time my father ever referred to how I looked was when he thought I was too fat [or] wanted me to wear a different, less revealing bathing suit, a looser belt, or a longer dress.\" Henry also controlled his children by withholding attention and approval. When the thirteen-year-old Fonda fractured five vertebrae in a swimming accident, she didn't tell her father about it for nearly a week, and then he had her stepmother deal with it. When Henry Fonda died, he left nothing to Jane or to Peter. Patricia Bosworth, whose biography \"Becoming Jane Fonda: The Private Life of a Public Woman,\" will be published in August, told me his will made it clear that he didn't think they needed it.\n\nThe Fonda children wouldn't have felt their father's emotional distance so strongly if their mother had been entirely present. In 1948, when Jane was ten, the family left her childhood home in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles and moved to Greenwich, Connecticut, so that her father could do theatre work in New York. By then, Frances Fonda had been hospitalized several times for depression. When she wasn't in the hospital, she paced her darkened bedroom in an anxious, distracted manner. Fonda describes their home in those years as \"Charles Addamsy.\" To help relieve Frances's suburban malaise, a New York City friend gave her the keys to her apartment. One night, she woke to find Frances staring down at her neck. \"I was just curious where the jugular vein is,\" she said.\n\nIn the fall of 1949, Henry asked for a divorce. Soon afterward, Frances entered a psychiatric hospital, and by April, 1950, she was dead. Henry persuaded the children's schoolteachers, classmates, and maternal grandmother to tell them that Frances had died of a heart attack. In fact, she had slashed her own throat. Her daughter learned the truth from a movie magazine that one of her classmates slipped her several months after the fact. A former boyfriend remembers that Fonda was always \"puzzled why she didn't feel more about her mother and the fact that she killed herself. I remember her telling me that when she first found out about her mother she just laughed and tried to shut it out. She realized that this was not a normal reaction, that it was a kind of symptom of emotional dishonesty.\" Now, when Fonda discusses her mother, she does so either in a flat, matter-of-fact tone (in her memoir, she writes, \"Mother had killed herself ten months before a new house she'd been building for us was finished. It was April and I guess she couldn't wait\") or in a language that's baroque and unreal (\"My mother? She was a golden thread running through our lives\").\n\nA childhood friend of Fonda's once noted that the gloomier a situation is the more radiant the efficiency with which she responds. (Fonda says that she has a habit of trying to make things better for other people, of wanting to \"smooth out the Kleenex.\") There was something almost competitive about her resilience after Frances's death: My mother chose to die. I will choose the opposite. \"No matter what's going on in your life, there's a part of you that's like radar, that's constantly scanning the horizon,\" Fonda told me. \"And if it picks up any warm body, meaning someone who could give you nurture and direction and support, you glom.\" Fonda was drawn to the mothers of her girlfriends, who could \"tell you what was right and what was wrong and what mattered.\"\n\nAlthough she tended to romanticize the women she encountered, Fonda didn't really want to become one. \"For me, being a woman meant being a victim, being the loser, being the one that'll be destroyed,\" she told me. Bulimia helped her stave off womanhood, at least for a time. In 1952, Fonda was a sophomore at the all-female Emma Willard School, in Troy, New York, where a classmate taught her how to \"gorge and purge.\" (To dine with Fonda is still an interesting experience. She attacks meals with a kind of furious vengeance.) Fonda says that her illness continued for years, and was \"intensified under two conditions: when I was working and had to look good, and when I was in an inauthentic relationship, which I was in a lot.\"\n\nIn 1958, when she was twenty, a recent Vassar College dropout, struggling with depression and living with her father in Santa Monica, Fonda became friends with Susan Strasberg, the daughter of Lee Strasberg, a co-founder of the Actors Studio. Susan pressed Fonda to meet with her father. Although Fonda had performed in a few amateur productions as a student-she had once even shared a summer-stock stage with her father-she didn't feel driven to act until she was admitted to one of Strasberg's New York acting classes. With his encouragement, Fonda came alive. \"I was the most alienated, disembodied person, and I was just kind of going along,\" she said. \"Because it was him, as opposed to my father or someone in the family, I could take it in.\" In Thomas Kiernan's 1973 book, \"Jane: An Intimate Biography of Jane Fonda,\" a fellow-student recalls Fonda's first exercise on Strasberg's stage:\n\nThe class was particularly crowded that day. A lot of people from the other classes had heard about it and were there to see her fall on her face. But she didn't. In fact, she was terrific. You could see this change go through her. The first impression she gave was her nervousness. . . . Then you could see her start to relax and get caught up in it. Pretty soon she was letting it all hang out. Everybody was pretty impressed. Not only with the actor's talent she showed but with her guts. Now that I think back on it, it was inevitable that she be good . . . what with so many people secretly hoping she'd be bad.\n\nFrom the beginning, Fonda was dogged about her craft. \"I felt that I had to prove myself-that it was me and not my father's daughter,\" Fonda told me. \"Everybody would take one class, I'd take four. They'd work on one scene, I'd work on three.\" Her childhood friend the actress Brooke Hayward said, \"Acting gave her the kind of applause she never got as a human being. I've never seen ambition as naked as Jane's.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nIn Fonda's early performances, the tension between her drive and her desire to be seen as a conventional, unthreatening girl is clear. In her first film, \"Tall Story\" (1960), in which she plays a marriage-minded college cheerleader, she has a stridency that suggests a wildness of character which she herself doesn't want to acknowledge. Fonda was reluctant to admit that she was ambitious-especially not to a man. Good girls raised in the Eisenhower years didn't lift their skirts and reveal their balls. As Fonda began to make a name for herself onstage-in 1960, she was voted the \"most promising actress of the year\" by the New York Drama Critics' Circle for her performance as a rape victim in \"There Was a Little Girl\"-inevitably she attracted the attention of some important figures in the industry. One night, the critic Kenneth Tynan took her out to dinner. \"He asked me, 'What do you want to achieve?' \" Fonda told me. \"And I said, 'I want the audience to accept me.' And he laughed. That was, for him, a glimpse into the fact that I didn't feel like the person that he thought I was. I mean, what a lame answer!\" Around the same time, the director Elia Kazan asked to see Fonda for a film he was casting, \"Splendor in the Grass.\" The interview consisted of Kazan asking Fonda if she was ambitious. She couldn't say yes. Forty years later, still smarting at having lost the part to Natalie Wood, Fonda said, \"You know what I should have said to Kazan? 'Are you kidding? Of course I'm fucking ambitious!' \"\n\nIn \"Tall Story,\" Fonda was an attractive enough ingénue-the studio head, Jack Warner, had insisted that she wear falsies-but she didn't stand out. As Time reported, \"Nothing could possibly save the picture . . . not even a second-generation Fonda with a smile like her father's and legs like a chorus girl.\" Four more bland roles followed-in movies such as \"Period of Adjustment\" (1962) and \"In the Cool of the Day\" (1963)-as well as a searing documentary by D. A. Pennebaker, \"Jane\" (1962), about her experience in the doomed Broadway play \"The Fun Couple,\" which closed after only three performances. (The film shows Fonda at the mercy of her director and sometime lover Andréas Voutsinas, whose approval she clearly longs for, even as her need for self-expression is palpable. \"She wanted the world to know who she was, not the person she was playing,\" Pennebaker told me.)\n\nFonda decided to try her luck in France, where the New Wave movement was in full swing. But before boarding the plane she had a mission. \"I had a long weekend off,\" she recalled, \"and I was obsessed with meeting Henry Miller, so at a hundred and twenty miles an hour I drove to Big Sur to find him.\" She didn't find Miller, but in the Big Sur Hot Springs Lodge (later the site of the Esalen Institute) she got her first taste of the countercultural world that she would later come to represent. She stayed for three weeks and had an affair with the man who ran the lodge. \"I remember the first night I was there, I was in the dining room, and these girls waiting on me had hair under their arms and tie-dyed skirts. I'd never seen hippies. I was so straight. They were having babies in the woods, with goats wandering in and out of their houses, and throwing the I Ching. And I thought, I could stop right here. This is very appealing to me.\" Fonda was torn-as she would be for most of her life-between the reality of her ambition and the romance she found in circles far removed from the one she was born into. \"I had to make a major choice,\" she said. \"This could be my life, and I could stay here, or I could go.\" She went.\n\nWhat she went to was her first onscreen exploration of evil. As the conniving poor relative of a rich pampered woman in René Clément's \"Les Félins\" (1964), Fonda conveys a shimmering narcissism that cuts through the film's synthetic \"artiness.\" The movie tanked, but Fonda was taken up by the French press, which dubbed her \" la B.B. Américaine \"-the American Brigitte Bardot. Undoubtedly, this moniker caught the attention of the director Roger Vadim, who had made Bardot a star with his 1956 film \"And God Created Woman.\" Now Vadim-who was as famous for his amours with Bardot and Catherine Deneuve as for his titillating morality tales-led Fonda to her next incarnation: a mischievous icon who brought an American naïveté and sensibleness to sex in such movies as \"La Ronde\" (1964) and \"Barbarella\" (1968). A cult classic, \"Barbarella,\" with a screenplay co-written by Terry Southern, was based on a soft-core comic strip that had run in the hip, leftist Evergreen Review . Fonda played, as Vadim put it, \"a kind of sexual Alice in Wonderland of the future\" on an interplanetary mission. In the opening scene, she performs a striptease with her armored spacesuit in zero gravity, before landing naked on an orange shag rug. Fonda's wide-eyed incredulity in the role was derided by feminists at the time. Even Fonda now refers to herself at that point in her career as a \"female impersonator.\"\n\nWhile planning their first film together, Fonda and Vadim became involved, and by the time \"La Ronde\" wrapped, Fonda had decided to stay in France. She lived there for six years. Fonda told me, \"Working in French, it's a double mask. There's the mask of playing a character, but then also it's a different language, so I felt really safe.\" Despite her accomplishments, however, she felt disconnected from her public persona. \"What I felt I was and what other people saw were very different things,\" she said. \"I didn't know who I was or what I wanted or where I was going. I had absolutely no confidence in myself. Which is how come Vadim could kind of come along and make something of me.\"\n\nIn 1965, the couple married. \"I cried when we were pronounced man and wife,\" Fonda wrote in her memoir. \"I hadn't realized how much formalizing our relationship would mean to me.\" Fonda wanted to be the perfect wife. (She still says that her ideal woman \"has a child on her hip, and she's stirring pots and she's sipping her wine, and she's funny, and she can turn out a great meal for forty people without losing her sense of humor and without getting stressed.\") But the world kept encroaching. Much of the news of the day came to Fonda via the French actress Simone Signoret, who had become a friend. In 1968, Signoret took Fonda, who had paid scant attention to what was happening in Vietnam, to her first antiwar rally. \"It was all about how horrible America was, and I didn't like it,\" Fonda said. \"I really believed that if we were fighting, there was a reason for it.\" But later that year she read Jonathan Schell's book \"The Village of Ben Suc,\" a report of an attack on a Vietnamese village and its demolition. \"And, you know, it's like everything went flip,\" she said. \"And the world changed.\"\n\nIn the next couple of years, Fonda became a vocal opponent of the war, though she still wasn't convinced that she was smart enough to deal with politics: \"Simone would be talking to me in a very serious and intellectually challenging way, and I always wanted to say, 'Who is that you're talking to? You're not talking to me that way.' I felt that people saw something in me, and it scared me to death, because I didn't see it.\" Fonda's budding activism distanced her from Vadim. Plus, she told me, although being in love with your director can be \"very heady,\" Vadim, while filming \"Barbarella,\" was \"drunk by noon, and it was pretty horrible.\" By the time she returned to the United States, in 1969, with Vadim and their baby, Vanessa, who was born in 1968, Fonda was ready for a change.\n\nNineteen-sixty-nine, in movie theatres around the country: the feature begins. Jane Fonda's hardened, hopeless face fills the screen. A shock of disbelief and then recognition ripples through the audience. How did the actress whom Pauline Kael described as \"that naughty-innocent comedienne\" become so tragic and genuine? When did she put aside her white-girl upper-middle-class privilege and come to embody the reality of womanhood and its marginalization?\n\n\"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?\" is based on Horace McCoy's grim 1935 novel about Depression-era contestants in a marathon dance competition. Fonda's character, Gloria, an aspiring actress who enters the contest, with a chip on her shoulder, and is driven to suicide by the outcome, was described by the Times critic Vincent Canby as a \"Typhoid Mary of existential despair,\" a \"terrified and terrifying heroine.\" Fonda's performance heralded a new kind of acting: for the first time, she was willing to alienate viewers, rather than try to win them over. Pauline Kael, in her New Yorker review of the film, noted of Fonda:\n\n[She] has been a charming, witty nudie cutie in recent years and now gets a chance at an archetypal character. . . . Fonda goes all the way with it, as screen actresses rarely do once they become stars. She doesn't try to save some ladylike part of herself, the way even a good actress like Audrey Hepburn does, peeping at us from behind \"vulgar\" roles to assure us she's not really like that. . . . Fonda stands a good chance of personifying American tensions and dominating our movies in the seventies as Bette Davis did in the thirties.\n\nLink copied\n\nWith \"They Shoot Horses,\" Fonda began not only to infiltrate the mainstream as a serious artist but to speak more directly to the margins as well. Her ability to become Gloria was, no doubt, based in part on her jettisoning of another role: wife to Vadim. For the movie, Fonda had to cut the long dyed-blond coif she'd adopted, as she puts it, \"to compete with the wives\"-Vadim's exes. Her new shorn look was a declaration of sorts: personally and professionally, she was moving on.\n\nIn 1971, Fonda was at an antiwar rally at the Fort Lewis military base, alongside a woman who had brought her baby. The woman asked Fonda where her daughter was, and she had to admit that Vanessa was with a nanny in Bel Air. The discrepancy between her life and the lives of the people she was championing made her more and more uncomfortable. \"And I remember I was thinking, O.K., I'm not going to do movies anymore,\" she said. \"But I became friends with Ken Cockrel, who was a black revolutionary lawyer. And he said, 'The revolution needs movie stars. That's a responsibility.' And that's when I started thinking about my career differently: it's about how I do the work, what I choose to do, and, hopefully, taking charge of what I do.\"\n\nBy the time Jane Fonda, at thirty-two, began work on Alan J. Pakula's \"Klute\" (1971), she was becoming, like her character, the author of her own contradictions. Fonda's remarkable portrayal of the call girl and would-be actress Bree Daniels as the embodiment of the alienation of modern life is sociology-free. It's no classroom flick; you watch it, you live it, as people have for decades, largely because Fonda herself is invisible in it. It is Bree alone who allows us into the theatre of her bedroom. The dramatic speech with which she cajoles one of her clients is chillingly erotic:\n\nHas anybody . . . um talked to you about the financial arrangements? Well, it depends naturally on how long you want me for . . . And what you want to do. ( Laugh .) I know you. It will be very nice. Um, well, I'd like to spend the evening with you if it's-if you'd like that? Have you ever been with a woman before? Paying her? Do you like it? I mean, I have the feeling that that turns you on very particularly. . . . I have a good imagination, and I like pleasing. Do you mind if I take my sweater off? Well, I think in the confines of one's house, one should be . . . free of clothing and inhibitions. Oh, inhibitions are always nice because they're so nice to overcome. ( Laugh .) Don't be afraid. I'm not. As long as you don't, uh, hurt me more than I like to be hurt. I will do anything you ask. You should never be ashamed of things like that, I mean you mustn't be. . . . I think the only way that any of us can ever be happy is to, is to let it all hang out. You know, do it all, and, fuck it.\n\nFonda's Bree has no home but herself, and she doesn't even want to live there very much. Like Louise Brooks's Lulu, the brilliant, self-destructive anti-heroine of G. W. Pabst's \"Pandora's Box\" (1929), she is alone, manipulative, and wise to the nastiness of desire. In their performances, Brooks and Fonda gave a face and a narrative shape to the complex and developing questions of feminism. What does a woman want? Male approval or an identity of her own? Are these desires mutually exclusive? Notably, both Fonda and Brooks created a distinctive \"look\" that served as shorthand for their modernism and their difference: Brooks had the bob, Fonda the shag.\n\nIn the fall of 2009, a few months after \"33 Variations\" closed on Broadway, Fonda was heading from New York to Dallas to participate in a \"media salon\" and fund-raiser for the Women's Media Center, an organization that Fonda started with the feminist writers Robin Morgan and Gloria Steinem, in 2005. Fonda had invited me along for the trip.\n\nThe stated goal of the Women's Media Center is to encourage the telling of women's stories by women writers. The Dallas event was co-hosted by Trea Yip, an immigrant from China who had made considerable strides since coming to America, as was evident by the palatial size of her home and the fiscal well-being of her guests, who had each been asked to donate at least twenty-five hundred dollars. The dinner was held outside, under a portico, where women with substantial hair and jewels sat chatting at tables. It was a select bunch: well-dressed, well-mannered women, who had done well for themselves or helped their husbands do well, but were no less enthusiastic for that. (The Women's Media Center amusingly acknowledges, in one press release, the various stages that feminism has gone through over the years: \"Every decade, the feminist movement's obituary gets a rewrite, but gender inequality is alive and well!\") Fonda wore a green suit, leopard-skin sandals, and a brilliant blue ring on her right hand. After talking to me for a while, she excused herself, saying, \"I have to figure out who is the richest person here!\"\n\nLater, she circled an area of the living room where a lectern had been set up, testing the space, before the feminist theoretician Helen LaKelly Hunt took the floor. \"How do you introduce someone who's so beloved and so known?\" Hunt said. \"Jane and I bonded when she found out I loved the Scriptures, and that there was a place for us feminists in religion. What can I say except there's starch in her spine and belief in her eyes?\" Fonda embraced Hunt. Crickets chirped and bracelets clattered in the night. Fonda began with a reference to the conservatives in the state. Several sharp intakes of breath could be heard. She persevered. \"They want to get rid of all the gays, all the feminists, and make our country an old-boys' club. The question is, What are we going to do with our boys?\" She paused. Her voice gained momentum. \"We have a toxic masculinity!\"\n\nThe issue of \"toxic masculinity\" hounded Fonda for decades. For instance, when she appeared on \"The Dick Cavett Show\" in 1970, soon after the release of \"They Shoot Horses,\" Cavett introduced her in a characteristically condescending way: \"My next guest is the prettiest member of the flying Fonda family-sounds like a circus act, really, but they are. She's an outspoken lady, as you may know, if you've ever seen Jane Fonda. I remember when she was just a movie star, and now she's . . . lately she's been in the news pages, being arrested for things and all!\" Later in the program, after Fonda spoke passionately about veterans' groups that opposed the atrocities being committed in Vietnam, Cavett interjected, \"Jane is all het up, I see.\"\n\nIn July, 1972, during the height of Fonda's public opposition to the war, she spent two weeks in North Vietnam, as a guest of the Vietnam Committee of Solidarity with the American People. She was carrying more than a hundred letters for American P.O.W.s. She had also agreed to photograph the dikes that held back the waters of the Red River Delta, protecting more than fifteen million Vietnamese peasants from flooding-and which American forces had targeted for bombing. She delivered several broadcasts over Radio Hanoi, in which she addressed U.S. soldiers directly, urging them to \"remain human beings\" and to put an end to the war.\n\nLink copied\n\nDuring the trip, Fonda was photographed sitting on the seat of a Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun. The response to the image back home was virulent, earning her the nickname Hanoi Jane. After she returned, a man representing what he called the American Liberty League threatened to assassinate her as a \"traitor to the U.S.\" She was publicly denounced by a Maryland state legislator, William J. Burkhead, and in Colorado a state representative, Michael Strang, called her a \"foulmouthed, offensive little Vassar dropout.\" As Mary Hershberger observes, in her book \"Jane Fonda's War\" (2005), \"Almost all of the columnists and reporters who wrote contemptuous reports were male. They usually focused on what she looked like, and seldom on her ideas or the issues she raised. . . . She 'harangued,' she talked too fast . . . she didn't smile enough, she didn't have a sense of humor.\" Fonda attributes the vehemence of the response to both gender and class. \"I was Henry Fonda's daughter. I was privileged. I was Barbarella. They had my posters in their locker rooms. So I betrayed class, I betrayed gender, and I betrayed, you know-you're a pinup girl, you're not supposed to speak. It would have been less pungent if I had been a man.\" She paused, before conceding that having allowed that photograph to be taken \"was the biggest lapse of judgment in my life.\" She added, \"I don't regret going to North Vietnam. I'm glad I went. I'm glad I did everything I did, except that.\"\n\nTom Hayden, a radical from Detroit and one of the founders of the Students for a Democratic Society, was the kind of man Henry Fonda had played in movies-a man of principle, who never failed to fight the good fight-with the added attraction of being working class, which Fonda found sexy. They started seeing each other in 1972. \"I loved his playfulness, the Irish juiciness that brought welcomed moisture to what I felt was my arid, Protestant nature,\" Fonda wrote in her memoir. Plus, Hayden wasn't intimidated by his famous girlfriend; indeed, he pitied her for \"the image of superficial sexiness she once promoted and was now trying to shake,\" he recalled in his 1989 memoir \"Reunion.\" They married in January, 1973, and Troy was born six months later.\n\nIn the spring of 1975, when the Vietnam War ended, Fonda returned to work with a new sense of purpose. She wanted to make films that were \"stylistically mainstream,\" she said, \"but with a gender slant.\" Between 1975 and 1988, she starred in thirteen motion pictures, several of which she also co-produced. A partial list includes \"Fun with Dick and Jane\" (1977), \"Julia\" (1977), \"Coming Home\" (for which she was awarded the Best Actress Oscar in 1979), \"The China Syndrome\" (1979), \"Nine to Five\" (1980), \"On Golden Pond\" (1981), and the television movie \"The Dollmaker\" (1984), for which she won an Emmy. In those years, she and Hayden also joined forces to support various causes-the returning Vietnam veterans, Native American rights, women's rights. Fonda's activities made her more \"real\" to some fans, but others, including several of her male directors, wished that she would just shut up and act. Joseph Losey, who directed Fonda in a 1973 film version of Ibsen's \"A Doll's House,\" for example, complained that she had \"little sense of humor\" and \"was spending most of her time working on her political speeches, instead of learning her lines.\"\n\nHayden, for Fonda, represented a kind of pure ethics. \"I was both in love with and in awe of Tom,\" she wrote in her autobiography, which meant that she was doubly devastated when Hayden denigrated her work-as he did with \"Coming Home,\" a movie that Fonda both produced and starred in, about a woman torn between a wounded Vietnam vet and her marine husband, who is serving in Vietnam. Hayden felt that the politics in the film were watered down. The more he withheld his approval, the more Fonda tried to earn it. In 1976, he and Fonda founded the Campaign for Economic Democracy, in a close alliance with Governor Jerry Brown. The C.E.D. promoted solar energy, environmental protection, and renters' rights. To help support the endeavor, Fonda embarked on what remains one of her best-known projects: the Jane Fonda Workout.\n\nIt began with a fractured foot. Unable to take ballet-her preferred form of exercise for years-Fonda attended a class in Century City that was taught by Leni Cazden, who had developed an exercise technique that toned through repetitive movement, with popular music as an accompaniment. By 1982, Fonda was not only conducting classes on film sets and at her own studio; she had released the first of her workout videos, \"Workout Challenge.\" It was a smash. The tape sold seventeen million copies, making it the most successful how-to video in history. Between 1982 and 1995, Fonda put out twenty-two more videos, five workout books, and twelve audiobooks. \"If you want to trace the changes in American culture over the past twenty years, all you have to do is look at her,\" the Washington Post noted, in 1985. \"She is a lightning rod for a generation whose rhetoric has evolved from Burn, Baby, Burn to Feel the Burn.\"\n\nIn the New Biographical Dictionary of Film, David Thomson writes of Fonda's workout videos, \"Like so many of her films, the tapes were ardent, solemn, and modestly erotic-she was true to herself.\" But it was a self that Hayden no longer wanted to be identified with, even as he benefitted financially. In 1988, he told Fonda that he had fallen in love with another woman.\n\n\"Is it true?\" These were the first words that the media tycoon Ted Turner said to Fonda. Her divorce had just been announced in the press, and Turner wanted a date. Fonda asked him to call back in three months. Turner did-to the day. On their first date, he suggested that Fonda give up her acting career, and, strangely, once she had made the decision to be his wife the urge to perform fell away.\n\nA month after the wedding, Fonda found out that Turner was having an affair. She began a series of cosmetic transformations to win him back: smaller breasts, bigger hair, a wider smile. Although she continued her political work-in 1995, she founded the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention-her public persona during the decade of her marriage to Turner was that of malleable wife. The members of the women's movement who had rushed to embrace Fonda in the seventies and early eighties mostly distanced themselves from her in these years, criticizing her for having drifted away from her feminist principles. Fonda directs the same criticism at herself, calling her beliefs at that time \"theoretical feminism.\" She told me, \"I can look at Tom now, and Ted, and I can understand why I loved them, and also be totally amazed that I could spend as much time with them as I did. But I've always been in a relationship, and I have never been in a relationship where I could be myself.\" Fonda, however, gained popularity among black women in these years, many of whom found something to identify with both in her struggles with men and in her resilience. \"She's so gangsta,\" the black television host Wendy Williams recently said.\n\nIn preparation for her sixtieth birthday, in 1997, Fonda spent some time making a short film about herself. That process, she said, made clear to her for the first time that she was her own person and not \"just whatever someone wants me to be.\" \"The minute that happened, there were so many things about my marriage that I knew weren't right,\" she said. Two years later, she confronted Turner about his domination of her and told him that he needed to take her needs and feelings into account. \"It took me two years to say that, because I was so scared,\" she said. \"I didn't even know what to ask for before.\" Fonda and Turner were divorced in 2001, and it was around that time that Fonda turned to Christianity. \"After we split up, I could feel myself falling into place,\" she told me. \"I felt a calling. And then I made this discovery. I think it's in Matthew. Jesus is exhorting his disciples, saying to them, 'You must be perfect. You must be perfect.' But in Aramaic he was saying, 'You must be whole. You must be whole.' \" Fonda realized, she said, that she deserved to be treated with respect. \"And when you love someone, and you suddenly realize, Oh, my God, they don't really care, it's just the worst feeling in the whole world.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nIt was the same feeling she had come up against as a child. But, in the end, she made a kind of peace with her father, her first absent audience of one. While filming \"On Golden Pond,\" which she co-produced for her father (he won his only Oscar for his work in the film), and in which the Fondas played a father and daughter with a troubled relationship, she deliberately tried to elicit an emotional response from him. \"I saved my touching him for the very last closeup on him,\" she told me. \"I wanted to do something that he didn't expect, because I wanted to have some vulnerability there. And I . . . you can't really see it.\" She had to stop for a moment, choking up. \"I reached out and I said, 'I want to be your friend,' and I could see tears begin, and then he ducked his head and turned away. And that meant the world to me.\" I asked if her father had ever told her he was proud of her. \"He did at the end,\" she said. \"When I was in London promoting my book, I was on one of those shows, and the guy said, 'I'm going to play you something,' and he turned it on, and he had my father talking about me in 'Klute,' and saying how proud he was. He hadn't said it to me, so I heard it for the first time\"-she paused, both laughing and crying-\"while I was being interviewed on television.\"\n\nFonda has also made peace with Turner. In an unfinished \"American Masters\" documentary, directed by Anne Makepeace, for which they were filmed together in 2006, the couple joke:\n\nT URNER : Good God, woman. I was very generous to you. I never took anything from you.\n\nF ONDA : No, you didn't. Just my sanity.\n\nT URNER : But not your vanity.\n\nFonda offers to help Turner find a new girlfriend, \"because I know what you need.\" Turner tells her he'd \"swap a hundred horses for you again.\"\n\nRobin Morgan said of Fonda, \"Jane did power through men. When she became an actress, it was through Vadim. When she became a political figure, it was through Tom. And then she was a philanthropist through Ted. Now she's become the man she wanted to marry!\"\n\nIn 2005, Fonda ended a fifteen-year absence from the screen with her over-the-top performance in \"Monster-in-Law,\" which also starred Jennifer Lopez. \"Oddly enough, that was when I started feeling free,\" Fonda told me. \"It was like, Fuck it, man! And I think it was the ten years with Ted that gave me permission. I watched him and I saw how just letting it all hang out, if you really came from an authentic place-it was O.K. It was this stupid popcorn movie, but that was a liberating film for me.\" She said, laughing, \"Maybe one of the best things about being married to Ted was that I got to play him in a movie!\"\n\n\"Monster-in-Law\" and the lamentable 2007 comedy \"Georgia Rule,\" which co-starred Lindsey Lohan, allowed Fonda to think about acting again. She threw herself into \"33 Variations\" with the intensity of someone embarking on a love affair. \"My technical rehearsals are infamous for being long,\" Moisés Kaufman, who also directed the play, told me. \"I spend a lot of time lighting a show. Sometimes I would be working on a cue and I would see that she was getting tired standing up there in her four-inch heels waiting for me to light her. So I would go to her, 'Jane, you know what, go to your dressing room. I'm going to have somebody else stand there, and when we're done lighting this moment I'll call you back.' \" But she wouldn't go. She'd say, \"Oh, I'm going over my lines. If I need it, I'll tell you.\" Kaufman added, \"We teched that show for seven days. How many times do you think she went to her dressing room? None.\"\n\nFonda said that when she was younger her acting work \"was all primary colors.\" \"Now it's more nuanced,\" she added. \"Anger was always easy. Fear was harder. Nuanced emotions were harder.\" Fonda's ability to continue to develop her talent is what sets her apart from many other performers of her generation. \"There's a group of men she came up with-Beatty and Redford and so on,\" Thomson said. \"They're trailing away. But I believe Jane might do something really extraordinary and daring. And I think that there's going to be that moment at the Oscars where everybody sort of stands as one when they realize that she's such a part of American history.\"\n\nIn 2010, Fonda wrote a book, \"Prime Time: Love; Health; Fitness; Sex; Spirit; Friendship; Making the Most of All of Your Life,\" which will come out in September. She also wrapped two films to be released later this year-one in France, \"Et Si On Vivait Tous Ensemble?,\" directed by Stéphane Robelin, and one in the States, \"Peace, Love, & Misunderstanding,\" directed by Bruce Beresford, which stars Catherine Keener as a harried, controlling New York lawyer, whose freewheeling mother worships the moon and sells grass out of her home near Woodstock. Although the script is clotted with clichés, Fonda manages to get at something exceptional and true about the ravine that can separate mothers and daughters. The performance has a specificity and a compassion that elevates her character from stock figure to full-blooded living being.\n\nThe night that \"33 Variations\" closed in New York, Fonda, dressed in a checked page-boy cap, a brown-and-white turtleneck, a tightly belted metallic trenchcoat, and dark slacks, presided over the well-wishers who had gathered in her dressing area, including her son Troy and his wife, Simone, and Fonda's current partner, the music producer Richard Perry. She listened in as some young female fans chatted with enthusiasm about what their lives had been like in their twenties. As they talked, Fonda smoothed the front of her coat. Then she took off her glasses and wiped away a bit of perspiration under her left eye. Putting her glasses back on, she said, a trifle brusquely, \"You couldn't pay me to be twenty again.\"\n\nOnstage, the set had been struck. A work light stood near the middle of the stage, casting shadows and glare. Peering out at the empty house, Fonda looked very small. Kaufman put his arm around her shoulder and whispered something in her ear. Fonda looked up at the balcony. And then, with the classic gesture of the travelling actor saying goodbye to another temporary home, she blew a kiss and bowed in the direction of her now phantom audience.\n\nOutside, in the thick late-May air, an enormous crowd stood behind police barricades. A few patrol cars were lined up along the street in front of the theatre. When the crowd spotted Fonda, a great cheer went up, followed by applause. After posing for photographs and signing autographs, Fonda settled into her car, which sped off, escorted by two police cars, their sirens blaring. As the cavalcade crossed Eighth Avenue, it was almost hit by a car heading uptown, which stopped seconds short of disaster. Fonda's daughter-in-law, hearing horns, asked what all the commotion was about. \"Jane,\" her son said. ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Dennis Hopper's Quiet Vision of Nineteen-Sixties Hollywood\n\nDennis Hopper's photography archive-the Hopper Art Trust-resides in an office on the top floor of a squat building on the Sunset Strip, in Los Angeles. Its neighbors are insurance and mortgage offices, and for the most part it shares their appearance: filing cabinets here, a desk there, a wall of bookshelves with plastic binders. The binders are filled with contact sheets containing upward of eighteen thousand images that Hopper created with his Nikon F camera between 1961 and 1967, when he was just another actor with a stalled-out career, in the years leading up to \"Easy Rider,\" which he starred in and directed. That movie, released in 1969, would make him something more than a Hollywood star; for a time, he was a pop-culture deity. And, for whatever reason, it also turned him into a former photographer. With a few exceptions (including an ill-advised Hustler shoot, in the eighties), Hopper rarely picked up a camera again for the rest of his life.\n\nHopper died, of cancer, in 2010, at the age of seventy-four. Since then, his daughter Marin Hopper has been an energetic steward of his photographic legacy. She has helped to shepherd gallery shows, museum exhibitions, and the publication of a succession of compact monographs-\" The Lost Album ,\" \" Drugstore Camera ,\" \" Colors: The Polaroids .\" To be clear: Hopper was no mere celebrity shutterbug. He shot album covers, gallery announcements, and images for Vogue . In 1963, Artforum saluted his work with the headline \"Welcome brave new images!\" His photograph \" Double Standard \"-an L.A. streetscape seen through a car windshield-is in the Museum of Modern Art's permanent collection.\n\nWhatever the occasion or assignment, Hopper always seemed to be shooting for himself, satisfying an insatiable eye. A new collection, \" In Dreams \" (Damiani), edited by the photographer Michael Schmelling, to whom Marin Hopper granted unlimited access to the archive, zeroes in on the idea of Hopper as an idiosyncratic, compulsive collector of visual experience. Schmelling culled about ninety photographs from the Hopper Trust, most of which have never been published, and which have the spirited, unfussy feel of outtakes. In a brief essay, Schmelling writes that he made his selections around the notion of how Hopper lived \"day to day,\" compiling a diaristic sequence of images with the aim of \"integrating his roles as photographer, husband, and actor.\"\n\nHopper received the Nikon as a gift on his twenty-fifth birthday, in May, 1961, from the actress Brooke Hayward, who would become his first wife. Her father, the agent and producer Leland Hayward, was a camera nut, and Brooke, whose mother was the actress Margaret Sullavan, paid three hundred and fifty-one dollars for it. \"Dennis had the greatest eye of anyone I've ever known,\" Hayward told me for a story I wrote last year about her marriage to Hopper.  \"He wore the camera around his neck all day long.\"\n\nThe couple married that fall. In the spring of 1963, the two bought a house at 1712 North Crescent Heights Boulevard, in the Hollywood Hills, and went about filling it with Warhols, Lichtensteins, Rauschenbergs, and campy Art Nouveau goodies. The house became a gathering place for an indelible cultural moment, a way station for Andy Warhol, Terry Southern, Ike and Tina Turner, and Black Panthers.\n\nThere's an old adage that great subjects make a great photographer. Hopper, overstimulated by everything that the decade had to offer, enjoyed a certain ease of access. He shot Martin Luther King, Jr., Robert Rauschenberg, the Byrds, Allen Ginsberg, Claes Oldenburg, Timothy Leary, John Wayne, Paul Newman, Phil Spector, the Grateful Dead. He and his camera were at the March on Washington, the riots on the Sunset Strip, and the Human Be-In. The contact sheets at the Hopper Art Trust, where I spent a few days recently, suggest that the actor was supernaturally everywhere in the sixties, from Warhol's Factory to post-riot Watts to the studio where the Rolling Stones happened to be recording \"Paint It, Black.\"\n\nBut, in the pages of \"In Dreams,\" celebrity and history are incidental. Terry Southern is just a guy smoking a cigarette. The gentleman with his back turned, inspecting a wall of paintings, turns out to be Jasper Johns. The all-American bride hiking up her wedding dress to adjust her garter is Jane Fonda. And those whiplashing dancers having the time of their lives? Look really closely and you'll see the Byrds in the background, playing one of their landmark shows, in 1965, at Ciro's, on the Sunset Strip.\n\nMany of the photographs that Schmelling selected are encoded with Hopper's preoccupations. The picture of a plastic box containing a joint is a nice bit of stoner fun, but it also evokes the glass-cube sculptures of Larry Bell, another of the artists whose work Hopper and Hayward collected (and whom Hopper photographed). A neon Motel Alaska sign, with a glowing index finger illuminating a nocturnal streetscape, echoes a Duchampian credo that Hopper was fond of, that the artist of the future will \"point his finger at something and say it's art.\" Pointing fingers recur in the tender image of two hands-one an adult's, one a toddler's-hovering over a mud puddle, a moving study of Hayward and Marin.\n\nHopper was tight-lipped about his photographic inspirations, though he occasionally gave a shout out to Harry Callahan or Aaron Siskind. He befriended a few photographers who may have had a hands-on impact on his work: John Swope, William Claxton, Julian Wasser. The curator Walter Hopps saw Hopper as a kind of American-vernacular Cartier-Bresson, and Hopper did love, as he put it, \"the idea of the decisive moment\"-when subject, action, and composition coalesce in the viewfinder like lightning in a bottle. \"My lens is fast and my eye is keen,\" Hopper boasted to Terry Southern, in an article in Vogue , from 1965. The model and writer Leon Bing, who posed for Hopper, told me that Hopper backed it up: \"There is that instant when a photographer must take the picture-and not all do. He never missed.\"\n\nThe Hopper gaze is casual, offhand; if it's possible for photographs to be conversational, then Hopper's were. As the poet Michael McClure wrote of Hopper's work, \"the Hollywood here is not afraid of friendship, love, or sentiment.\" When I asked Jane Fonda about being photographed by Hopper, she said she loved that he \"knew how juxtapositions told a story and how to capture that.\" Hopper balked at the notion that there was anything overtly cinematic in his photography, but it's hard not to see a French New Wave jazziness in it.\n\nFor all their conviviality, Hopper's photographs were by-products of an anxious period in his life. \"I sat in a chair, and, uh, watched a fly dying on the wall,\" he recalled in an interview, in 1970. \"And I thought if I could just help that fly find an air current, that led to a window.\" In the mid-sixties, the fly was Hopper, a Hollywood player going nowhere. Photography was his air current, a creative updraft. He was desperate not to be a washed-up teen actor from the fifties. He was terrified of becoming Rick Dalton; he wanted to be Robert Frank.\n\nWim Wenders said of Hopper that if \"he'd only been a photographer, he'd be one of the great photographers of the twentieth century.\" As successive collections of Hopper's archived photographs become available, it becomes easier to say that Hopper was, at the least, a compelling, important, and weirdly omnipresent chronicler of his times. After \"Easy Rider\" and amid divorce, Hopper put away his Nikon and moved on. \"I was trying to forget,\" he later said. \"These photographs represented failure to me.\" The feeling you get from \"In Dreams\" is not of failure at all but of the dreamlike ecstasy Hopper found in image-making-the realization, as he put it, \"that art is everywhere, in every corner that you choose to frame and not just ignore.\"\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "DVD of the Week: Hurry Sundown\n\nJane Fonda may not have quite as many lines as does Michael Caine in Otto Preminger's 1967 drama \"Hurry Sundown\" (which I discuss in this clip), but she's the moral center of the story. She plays (with a gritty Southern accent) a small-town Georgia socialite whose sharp-dealing husband is putting together a land deal for a developer; her former nanny (whom she calls her \"mammy\"), an elderly black woman, owns a piece of land that's needed to complete the deal. (The film will be released on DVD on May 17th by Olive Films.) The drama (from a script by Horton Foote and Thomas C. Ryan) takes some time to get going-it's got a lot of moving parts, and Preminger doesn't so much push the action ahead as he watches it seethe. It's an angry movie, with race relations at the core; the worst racial epithets are flung with disgusting casualness, the self-loathing of the long-abased rises bitterly, and-with a few signal exceptions-nearly the entire white Southern milieu appears infected with the virus of racism, which (as seen in the clip) comes off as just one of its many endemic varieties of cavalier brutality. In particular, Preminger-the son of a prosecutor and himself a onetime law student-takes angry pleasure in exposing the way the judicial system, led by a self-righteous and glad-handing judge (Burgess Meredith), is silently and stealthily rigged against blacks, giving them their day in court and making sure it will end badly for them. And Fonda's performance, showing the socialite's coming-of-consciousness as much politically as domestically, foreshadows the activism that-as Hilton Als's splendid Profile of her in the magazine this week ( available to subscribers ) shows-has been central to her art and to her life.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The Lost Tycoon\n\nEarly last year, Ted Turner seemed invincible. He was the largest shareholder in AOL Time Warner, owning around four per cent of the soon-to-be-merged companies; his celebrated name was on the door of a major division, Turner Broadcasting System; and his dimpled chin, gap-toothed smile, and pencil-thin Gable-esque mustache were recognizable everywhere. His life is documented by the framed magazine covers that crowd the walls of his Atlanta office: Turner in 1976, launching the first \"Superstation,\" by transforming a weak local television signal into a robust cable network; Turner in 1977, skippering his boat, Courageous, to victory in the America's Cup; Turner pioneering the purchase of professional sports teams as cheap and reliable programming; Turner inventing the twenty-four-hour Cable News Network; Turner buying Hollywood film libraries to create new cable-television networks; Turner as Time's Man of the Year.\n\nTed Turner's business successes didn't end when, in 1996, Turner Broadcasting merged with Time Warner. His influence at the world's largest media company was pervasive; he played the role of crazy-uncle-in-the-basement whose large appetite for cost-cutting has to be appeased, and in the process he helped revive the company's stock. But when, in January of 2000, Time Warner and Turner agreed to join with the Internet company America Online, Turner was not invited to participate in the talks about how the merged company would function.\n\nLess than four months later, Ted Turner was fired. The news, Turner says, was delivered during a telephone call from Gerald Levin, the C.E.O. of Time Warner, who told Turner what Turner had often told others: the company was going to reorganize. Turner Broadcasting would no longer report to Turner but, rather, to Robert Pittman, the chief operating officer of AOL. \"You can't report to Pittman, so you have to have a more senior role,\" Levin remembers telling Turner. As Turner recalls, Levin went on to say, \"Sorry, Ted, but you lose your vice-chairman title as well.\" According to Levin, Turner offered to give up his vice-chairmanship in order to keep running the Turner Broadcasting division, which included CNN, TNT, Turner Classic Movies, the TBS Superstation, the Cartoon Network, the New Line Cinema studio, the Atlanta Braves baseball team, the Atlanta Hawks basketball team, the Atlanta Thrashers hockey team, and Time Warner's HBO. \"I didn't fire Ted,\" Levin insists today. \"I said, 'This is the way we need to run the company.'\"\n\nTurner protested, in a series of calls first to Levin, then to Steve Case, the C.E.O. of AOL, who was to be the chairman of the new company, demanding that he not be deprived of supervision of CNN and the other cable networks that he had started. He thought that he would prevail, and in early May-perhaps because he, like Levin, hates confrontation, or perhaps because making speeches has become his accustomed mode of communication and he had now spoken-Turner got on his plane and headed for New Mexico, where he owns a five-hundred-and-eighty-thousand-acre ranch, and where he had invited some friends to join him. Turner is America's largest individual landowner, with nearly two million acres, or the rough equivalent of the land area of Delaware and Rhode Island combined. He owns twenty-two properties, in nine states and Argentina, and he spends about half his time at one or another of them.\n\nTurner didn't see that his travels often slowed decision-making at Turner Broadcasting. Although he entrusted most matters to a deputy, Terence F. McGuirk, he expected to approve major projects himself. AOL and Time Warner executives, however, were impatient with the peripatetic Turner. He is sixty-two, and even his friends wanted him to slow down. Jane Fonda, his former wife, thinks that she knows why he is so restless: \"I say this with all the love in the world. . . . He has been severely, hauntingly traumatized. He always thinks something is about to be pulled out from him. He has no belief in permanency and stability. It's one reason why I'm not with him. Older age is about slowing down and growing vertically, not horizontally. That's not Ted.\"\n\nSomething was \"pulled out\" from Turner while he was in New Mexico, as he learned from a five-page fax that he received there. The fax, a press release issued by AOL Time Warner, announced a new management team for the company, awarding Turner one of two vice-chairmanships and \"the additional title of Senior Advisor.\" The fax did not say that he had lost much of his authority, or that his five-year contract to manage Turner Broadcasting had been abrogated a year early. John Malone, the chairman of Liberty Media and an old friend of Turner's, who was a guest at the ranch, recalls that when the fax arrived \"Ted went white. He was very upset. He thought it was extremely bad behavior for them to do it that way.\" Malone told Turner, \"You can sue, but you won't get your job back. You'll just get money.\"\n\nTurner's bosses tried to defuse the publicity with praise. At a press luncheon for CNN's twentieth anniversary, four weeks after the announcement, Case told reporters, \"Ted Turner has been a hero of mine for twenty-five years, and he and I are basically going to be joined at the hip.\" Turner can be seduced with kind words, with pleas to work for the good of the team, but he wasn't this time. \"'Vice-chairman' is usually a title you give to somebody you can't figure out what else to do with,\" he says. He likened himself to a monarch.\n\nTurner says that last year was one of the most miserable of his life. His marriage to Fonda ended, after eight years, and this, too, was announced in January. In addition, he smashed his foot in a skiing accident; his beloved black Labrador, Chief, contracted coonhound disease and was temporarily paralyzed; his back hurt and he thought that he needed surgery; and two of his grandchildren were diagnosed with Hurler's syndrome, a rare and sometimes lethal enzyme deficiency. Most adults have the support of a spouse and family, friends, and a job; Turner didn't have a spouse, had never had intimate friends, and no longer ran his own company. \"I felt like Job,\" Turner told me, adding, not for the first time, that he had felt \"suicidal.\"\n\nYet Turner has, in the past several years, been commanding more attention outside his company, making a new identity for himself as a philanthropist-\"I want to be Jiminy Cricket for America,\" he has said. In 1997, before it was fashionable for billionaires to make such gifts, he pledged a billion dollars to the United Nations. The Turner Foundation, which he controls, awarded fifty million dollars last year to environmental causes. (Turner is a devoted environmentalist-he can name every species of bird and animal on his ranches-and during the oil embargo of 1973 he sold his Cadillac and switched to more fuel-efficient cars; recently, he exchanged his Ford Taurus for a hybrid electric-and-gas Toyota Prius, which averages about fifty miles a gallon.) Last year, Turner started a foundation, the Nuclear Threat Initiative, whose goal is to curb the proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, and he has pledged two hundred and fifty million dollars over the next five years. In December, to solve a long-running dispute between what the United States owed the United Nations and what Congress was willing to pay, Turner joined Richard C. Holbrooke, then the Ambassador to the U.N., to shape an extraordinary compromise: Turner would contribute the thirty-four-million-dollar difference, and the U.N. would adjust its future dues formula.\n\nLink copied\n\nTurner calls himself \"a do-gooder.\" He says so in a loud voice, and it gets louder as he gets excited. Turner is uninhibited, and is usually blissfully unaware of others; for one thing, he is hard of hearing and is too vain to use a hearing aid. \"Half the people alive today are already living in what we would consider intolerable conditions,\" he declares. \"One-sixth don't have access to clean drinking water; one-fifth live on less than a dollar a day; half the women in the world don't have equal rights with men; the forests are shrinking; the temperature's rising, and the oceans are rising, because of the melting of the ice cap.\" He sounds like a billionaire Jeremiah. In a hundred years, he believes, New York will be under water and it will be \"so hot the trees are going to die.\" He continues, \"It will be the biggest catastrophe the world has ever seen-unless we have nuclear war.\" He is outraged that the United States and others don't do more to alleviate these horrors and to combat the defense and foreign policies of George W. Bush. \"The new Administration attempts to make enemies out of the Russians, the North Koreans, and the Chinese to justify the gigantic military buildup it wants to make in peacetime,\" he says. \"The economy of North Korea is smaller than the economy of Detroit!\" And he is disturbed by the world's exploding population; although he has five children, he once declared, \"If I was doing it over again, I wouldn't have had that many, but I can't shoot them now that they're here.\"\n\nTurner's contradictions are as clear as his views. He successfully opposed unionization at his company, yet he rails against élites. He has called himself \"a socialist at heart\" and a fiscal \"conservative.\" Turner speaks out on behalf of the rights of women but refuses to denounce Islamic states that suppress women's rights. He has compared Rupert Murdoch, who owns the Fox network, to Hitler, yet when he is asked if he thinks Saddam Hussein is evil he says, \"I'm not sure that I know enough to be able to answer that question.\" And though he preaches tolerance, he has uttered some intolerant words; for example, on Ash Wednesday, seeing the black smudge on the foreheads of some CNN staff members, he asked them whether they were \"Jesus freaks.\" As he frequently does when he says something unwise, Turner apologized, blithely assuming that the furor would pass. It did. A week later, Turner told me, \"That's the downside of speaking spontaneously.\"\n\nTurner has two offices, in New York and Atlanta, and they seem to capture the odd mixture of his views: in his New York office, which is nearly bare, a bust of Alexander the Great peers from a shelf, while the Atlanta office, which is vast and crammed with trophies and artifacts, features busts of Martin Luther King, Jr., and Gandhi. \"I've gone from a man of war to a man of peace,\" Turner explains. He offers the Turner principle of world diplomacy: \"Just about everybody will be friendly toward us if we are friendly with them.\"\n\nDespite Turner's success, people who meet him often think that he is peculiar. They hear his piercing laugh and the long \"Ahhhhhhhhh\"s he utters as he pauses between words or thoughts, which veer off in surprising directions, and they have no other explanation. A former director of Turner Broadcasting's board who counts himself a friend and a fan describes Turner as a fascinating amalgam of opposites: \"He's a mixture of a genius and a jackass. I think Ted could have run for President of the United States-if there were not the jackass side.\"\n\nThe \"jackass side\" of Turner appears because, he himself says, \"I don't have any idea what I'm going to say. I say what comes to my mind.\" Gerald Levin puts this in the best light: \"Ted is by far the most interesting person I've ever met-how he reacts to things. It's as if a child were speaking, without any social inhibitions. You don't say in business, 'I got fired.' He'll just speak out loud what may be going through someone's mind, and he'll say it to everybody. I think that's a beautiful characteristic. He's angelic. The whole world is socially constrained. I love and respect this about Ted, but for other people it may be very difficult.\"\n\nIn November of 1996, for instance, the Friars Foundation honored Turner at a lifetime-achievement black-tie dinner. After he received his award and made a short speech, the lights dimmed, and then, as various entertainers, including the comedian Alan King, prepared to roast him, Turner, who insists on getting to bed early, grabbed Fonda's arm and departed, leaving the crowd gasping and King bellowing, \"Rupert Murdoch was right-you are nuts.\"\n\nOn other occasions, humor redeems the situation. In January of 1999, Turner was invited to address the American Chamber of Commerce in Berlin. Eason Jordan, who oversaw international coverage for CNN, had briefed Turner on what he shouldn't say to his audience, made up largely of Germans. Nevertheless, Jordan recalls, the CNN staff was nervous, because Turner had said, \"I'll wing it.\" And he did.\n\n\"You know, you Germans had a bad century,\" Turner declared. \"You were on the wrong side of two wars. You were the losers.\" He continued, \"I know what that's like. When I bought the Atlanta Braves, we couldn't win, either. You guys can turn it around. You can start making the right choices. If the Atlanta Braves could do it, then Germany can do it.\" The audience laughed with Turner, not at him. He left the podium to a standing ovation.\n\nTurner likens himself to Zorba the Greek: \"I lose my self-restraint and . . . just get up and dance sometimes.\" Gail Evans, a senior executive at Turner Broadcasting, says that Turner is always \"winking,\" and she recalls the time he asked her to take the oceanographer Jacques Cousteau to lunch: \"Go buy Mr. Cousteau a tuna-fish sandwich!\" Today, associates are not laughing; they speak of Turner in the past tense, offering epitaphs. \"He's the last of the revolutionary and creative minds in our business,\" CNN's chief international correspondent, Christiane Amanpour, who joined the company in 1983, says. \"The idea of twenty-four-hour news and global news is his creation. That's changed the world. It's changed people's relations with their governments. It's meant that governments can no longer crack down with impunity on protests. And Ted's business also had a human face and a moral face and a social face. It wasn't just about making money and building an empire.\" She adds, sadly, \"He's been shunted aside.\"\n\nEven Turner talks about himself in a retrospective cadence: \"My business side is coming to a close. It's time for me to move on, anyway.\" Last May, after AOL and Time Warner announced the new management structure, Robert Pittman tried to debunk press speculation that Turner was unhappy, saying, \"I think Ted's going to have more influence than he had before.\" Now Pittman, who was born in Mississippi and has spent weekends hunting with Turner, says, \"For me, Ted has a very big role. I don't make major decisions about Turner Broadcasting without talking to Ted.\" This is not what Turner thinks. \"They tell me I have moral authority, and that's great,\" he says. He looks down at his tie, which is decorated with orange bison, and goes on to say, wistfully, \"I'm very busy. Over the last three to four years, I've created another life for myself, and even if they had offered me the chairmanship of the company I probably wouldn't have taken it. It would require all my time, and I'd have to move to New York and I don't want that. I've got this other stuff that I think is in many ways more important.\"\n\nIn March, Turner's business influence was further diminished when the parent company announced that his top lieutenants at Turner Broadcasting-Terence McGuirk, the chairman and C.E.O., and Steven J. Heyer, the president-would be replaced by Jamie Kellner, the chief executive and founder of the WB broadcast network. To achieve more of the company's much touted synergies, Turner Broadcasting would be folded into a combined broadcast-and-cable-television division, which would be run by Kellner; Kellner would move to Atlanta from Hollywood. In a press release, Turner applauded Kellner's promotion. He was pleased that the separate fiefdoms in his old company and Time Warner would be joined-he blames Levin for wanting \"to keep everybody weak, so he could be stronger\"-but sorry that AOL Time Warner was practicing what he thinks of as management by the numbers.\n\nSince Turner's dismissal, his offices, at the CNN Center, in Atlanta, and at Time Warner's headquarters, at 75 Rockefeller Plaza, have been largely idle. Friends notice that his shoulders slope more, that his hair has turned white, that his hearing is worse, that he complains about pain in his back and his foot, that he is self-conscious about his age. His energy level has decreased, along with his business authority. He is a member of the company's official executive committee, but it meets just once a month; the core corporate executive committee meets for lunch every Monday without him.\n\nLink copied\n\nStill, the needy side of Turner compels him to want to please. Before an Advertising Council dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria last November in honor of Turner and Levin, Turner stood awkwardly beside Levin in a receiving line. As they turned to enter the ballroom, Turner pointed to me and told Levin that I was writing about him. Levin said he knew, and that prompted Turner to reassure him: \"I checked first with corporate communications. I would not have done this unless I had approval.\" Such behavior does not surprise Jane Fonda. Turner is insecure, she says, noting that the man who thinks of himself as Rhett Butler is really the more vulnerable character in his favorite movie: \"He loves 'Gone with the Wind' for lots of reasons, and one of them is that he identifies with Scarlett O'Hara.\"\n\nRick Kaplan, who was fired as president of CNN/U.S. last September, recalls being taken to lunch by Turner at a Southern-kitchen restaurant, where \"you thought you were walking in with Babe Ruth to Yankee Stadium.\" For the first time, Kaplan noticed, Turner talked mostly about the past: \"Whenever I had spent any time with him, he'd always talk about the future. All of a sudden, gone from his conversation were dreams for the future. And he was supposed to be there to make me feel better. Instead, I left feeling worse for him. I spent more time telling him positive, uplifting things, telling him the truth-that people revere him and it doesn't matter what his title is and it doesn't matter what anyone says his responsibilities are. Ted could sell all his stock, divest himself of every nickel he's got, and if he walked into the CNN newsroom the place would stand at attention.\"\n\nPerhaps, but in the new world of AOL Time Warner it is probably not premature to write Ted Turner's business obituary.\n\nThe first word that Robert Edward Turner III uttered was not \"mama\" or \"dada\" but \"pretty.\" It was an odd choice, since he also remembers that, growing up in the shadow of the Second World War, he yearned first to be a fighter pilot with the R.A.F., and then to conquer the world, like his first hero, Alexander the Great. Turner was born in 1938 in Cincinnati; a sister, Mary Jane, was born three years later. His father, Robert Edward (Ed) Turner, Jr., ran a successful outdoor-advertising company. Ted's mother was a dutiful wife, who tried to obey her husband's wishes. Ed Turner was a charming, gifted salesman who was on the road or at work far more than he was at home. He was propelled by the memory of his own father, a cotton farmer in Mississippi, who lost his farm in the Depression and, refusing to declare bankruptcy, became a sharecropper instead. Often, Ed Turner would warn his son that Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman were Communists and that the Communists would take over America and execute anyone with more than fifty dollars in his pocket. For years, Ted never carried around more than forty-nine dollars.\n\nTed was obstreperous. He pulled ornaments off the Christmas tree, and smeared mud on a neighbor's sheets that were hanging out to dry. His father instructed him to read two books each week, and to eat every vegetable on his plate. Ed was often drunk, and would fly into a rage when Ted disobeyed; he frequently beat him, sometimes with a wire coat hanger. He would untwist it until it was straight, like a whip, and then hit his son, exclaiming, \"This hurts me more than it does you.\" When this didn't seem to tame Ted, he reversed the punishment, pulling down his pants, lying down, and ordering his son to administer the lashings. With tears streaming down his cheeks, Ted obeyed. \"It was the most painful thing I ever did in my entire life,\" he recalls, giving his father credit for understanding that \"that would be a more effective punishment than him beating me.\"\n\nApparently, it was not effective enough; when Ed Turner joined the Navy, during the Second World War, and was assigned to the Gulf Coast, the family joined him-except for young Ted, who stayed with his grandmother and was eventually sent to boarding school in Cincinnati. Ted was miserable; he was impossible to control, and was suspended. When he was about ten, the family moved to Savannah, Georgia. Intent on teaching his son obedience, Ed Turner became more formal, no longer hugging him but greeting him with a handshake. He sent Ted off to the Georgia Military Academy, outside Atlanta, and then to the military program at the McCallie School, in Chattanooga.\n\nTed read non-stop, committing poems and military history to memory, but he hated boarding school. \"I was hurt,\" he told me. \"I didn't want to go off so young. It was like a prison. You couldn't leave the campus. There was a bell when you got out of bed in the morning and a bell to go to meals, and a bell to go to bed at night.\" And, he added, \"there were no parents there-no mom, no dad.\" Yet Turner defends and even romanticizes his harsh father, saying that he deliberately instilled insecurity: \"He thought that people who were insecure worked harder, and I think that's probably true. I don't think I ever met a superachiever who wasn't insecure to some degree. A superachiever is somebody that's never satisfied.\"\n\nBy the time he was a teen-ager, Ted knew that he did not want to join his father's business. He was religious, and he decided that he was going to be a missionary. Then his sister became ill. He was fifteen when Mary Jane, who was twelve, contracted systemic lupus erythematosus, a disease in which the immune system attacks the body's tissue. She was racked with pain and constantly vomiting, and her screams filled the house. Ted regularly came home and held her hand, trying to comfort her. He prayed for her recovery; she prayed to die. After years of misery, she succumbed. Ted lost his faith. \"I was taught that God was love and God was powerful,\" he says, \"and I couldn't understand how someone so innocent should be made or allowed to suffer so.\"\n\nThe experience transformed Turner. \"I decided I wanted to be a success,\" he says. Though he wasn't much of an athlete, he became a good boxer; the same tenacity that enabled him to resist his father helped him in boxing, because, he recalls, \"I could take punishment.\" To impress his father, he took up debating and excelled at it; as a senior, he won the state high-school debating championship. He also became an accomplished sailor.\n\nEd Turner was constantly giving his son instructions: where he should work during the summers, whom he should date, how he had to save to pay his college tuition. When Ted was at home, his father even charged him room and board. Expecting his son to attend Harvard, he was displeased when a rejection letter arrived. Ted was accepted at Brown, and that mollified his father, but not for long. According to a detailed account of Ted's Brown years in Robert and Gerald Jay Goldberg's \"Citizen Turner,\" he wasn't much of a student. He gambled. He got into noisy arguments, defending the South, defending war as a means of ridding the planet of the weak, defending nationalism. He delighted in irritating liberal sensibilities. He kept a rifle in his room, and sometimes poked it out the dormitory window and fired off a round or two. He partied and drank too much. He talked about dates as if he were describing military conquests. But Ted could be charming and funny, and, as is still the case, he was hard to miss. He joined the Brown sailing team, and was named the best freshman sailor in New England.\n\nHis father, who had divorced Ted's mother in 1957 and was now remarried, tried, in his son's word, to \"micromanage\" his life, to treat college as preparation for a business career. When Ted chose to major in classics, his father wrote angrily:\n\nI am appalled, even horrified, that you have adopted Classics as a Major. As a matter of fact, I almost puked on the way home today. . . . I am a practical man, and for the life of me I cannot possibly understand why you should wish to speak Greek. With whom will you communicate in Greek? I have read, in recent years, the deliberations of Plato and Aristotle, and was interested to learn that the old bastards had minds which worked very similarly to the way our minds work today. I was amazed that they had so much time for deliberating and thinking and was interested in the kind of civilization that would permit such useless deliberation. . . . I suppose everybody has to be a snob of some sort, and I suppose you will feel that you are distinguishing yourself from the herd by becoming a Classical snob. I can see you drifting into a bar, belting down a few, turning around to a guy on the stool next to you-a contemporary billboard baron from Podunk, Iowa-and saying, \"Well, what do you think about old Leonidas?\" . . . It isn't really important what I think. It's important what you wish to do with the rest of your life. I just wish I could feel that the influence of those odd-ball professors and the ivory towers were developing you into the kind of man we can both be proud of. . . . I think you are rapidly becoming a jackass, and the sooner you get out of that filthy atmosphere, the better it will suit me.\n\nLink copied\n\nAgitated by the letter, Ted brought it to the Brown student newspaper, the Daily Herald , and, as Porter Bibb says in his biography \"Ted Turner: It Ain't As Easy As It Looks,\" the paper published it anonymously.\n\nIn his junior year, Ted was expelled for smuggling a coed into his room. In fact, it was just the last straw, and, if Ed Turner was unhappy with his son's behavior, he was glad to have him come home and enter the billboard business. Despite their feuds, Ted now rarely questioned that he would work for his father. \"I liked the advertising business,\" he said. Father and son were similar in many ways. Both were persuasive and headstrong. Both viewed seduction as a game of conquest. Both were self-centered. Both were political conservatives. Both liked whiskey. Both battled moments of depression. And both had unsuccessful marriages.\n\nIn 1960, after a brief stint in the Coast Guard, Ted married Julia (Judy) Gale Nye, the daughter of a prominent sailor from Chicago, and they moved to Macon. A year later, when she gave birth to Laura Lee, Ted, intent on winning the America's Cup, was off sailing. Marriage did not stop him from carousing, and he often returned home late at night, as if in a Playboy cartoon, with lipstick on his collar and alcohol on his breath. Two years after they were married, Judy filed for divorce. Then she discovered that she was pregnant again, and the couple reconciled. In May of 1963, Robert Edward Turner IV was born. Ted soon returned to his earlier habits, and finally, after a sailing competition in which he rammed his wife's boat in order to win, Judy decided that the marriage was finished.\n\nTurner was a Barry Goldwater supporter, and he met his second wife, Jane Smith, who was a stewardess based in Atlanta, at a campaign rally. They married in June of 1964, and had three children in short order-Rhett, Beauregard, and Jennie. In 1967, Ted also got custody of the two children from his first marriage. The Turners lived in Atlanta, and Ted was not much better as a father than he was as a husband. He was \"a dictator,\" Laura, who is now close to her father, recalls. Because of the sailing season, he was rarely home for Christmas, and because of work the family took few vacations together. In the summer, because Turner refused to install air-conditioning, the family baked. But, Ted says, recalling his own father, \"I treated my children entirely differently than he did. I let them make a lot of their decisions for themselves.\" Yet he had sudden mood changes, and his temper frightened the children. They were expected to be in bed by 8 P . M . and at breakfast before eight. Good manners were required at the table. Television was limited. If they wanted soda or candy on the weekend, they collected empty bottles to earn the money.\n\nWhile Ted Turner concentrated on mastering the outdoor-advertising business, his father was trying to escape depression; he drank, smoked three packs of cigarettes a day, and took a huge assortment of pills. In 1961, Ed Turner had sought treatment, and he spent a summer at the Silver Hill psychiatric hospital, in New Canaan, Connecticut. A year after he left Silver Hill, Ed Turner made the boldest business decision of his career, paying four million dollars for the Atlanta, Richmond, and Roanoke divisions of General Outdoor Advertising. Instantly, Turner Advertising was the foremost outdoor-advertising company in the South.\n\nTed was convinced that they had scored a coup. His father, though, was strangely morose, worrying that he lacked the resources to absorb such a large company. He returned to Silver Hill, and from there placed a panicky call to a friend in the outdoor-advertising business and pressed him to buy the new divisions for the amount they had cost him. The friend, not wanting to take advantage, threw in a fifty-thousand-dollar bonus. Ed Turner still could not shake his depression. \"I don't want to hurt anybody. I just feel like I've lost my guts,\" he wrote to his wife. On March 5, 1963, Ed Turner had breakfast with his wife, went upstairs, placed a .38-calibre silver pistol in his mouth, and pulled the trigger. He was fifty-three.\n\nHis son later told Christian Williams, who wrote an early biography of him, that he and his father \"had terrible, terrible fights. It was after one of those fights-we disagreed about how the business should be run-that he blew his brains out.\" The message was clear: Ed Turner abandoned his dreams of business glory because he felt inadequate, and because his son wasn't up to the task, either. The son, who was twenty-four, had to face another message: perhaps he was responsible. For all that, Ted Turner says that he lost his \"best friend.\"\n\nIn the weeks and months after his father's suicide, Turner was distraught yet surprisingly focussed. He told his father's advisers and bankers that Ed Turner had not known what he was doing when he resold the company divisions he had just bought; that he, Ted, would sue if necessary to reclaim them; and that, in any case, he was prepared to run the entire enterprise. His ferocity and his mastery of the numbers were impressive. The bankers came through with the loans, and his father's friend sold back the divisions he had bought.\n\nSoon after that, Turner began to dream of going beyond the billboard business, of building a media empire. His first venture came five years after his father's suicide, in 1968, when he bought a Chattanooga radio station, WAPO. Within a year, he had also acquired radio stations in Jacksonville and Charleston. In 1970, he acquired his first television property, Channel 17 in Atlanta, a money-losing UHF station. He borrowed heavily to make the purchase, and the consensus was that he had been outsmarted; although he changed the station's call letters from WJRJ to WTCG, it looked as if he would lose everything. \"Working in UHF television at that time was like being in the French Foreign Legion,\" recalls Terry McGuirk, who was hired by Turner the summer after his junior year at Middlebury College, and who became Turner's protégé. The staff consisted of about thirty employees; for many, the pay was thirty dollars a week and all you could eat. The finances became even more dire when Turner acquired a second TV station, in Charlotte. McGuirk, who was dispatched to sell ads, says that the new station was costing Turner fifty thousand dollars a month. And a good deal of the time Turner was away sailing, a hobby that commanded nearly as much of his attention as business did. But he managed to motivate his tiny staff, just as he did his sailing crew.\n\nTurner charmed and wheedled to get ads, and he introduced inexpensive programming. News was alien to the man who would become identified with CNN-too negative, Turner complained-and at first it was aired only in the early-morning hours. Turner programmed \"The Mickey Mouse Club\" and Three Stooges movies and every sports event he could find. Although profits were slim, he became obsessed with broadcasting. He wanted a national network, and, since he couldn't afford a broadcast network (there were none for sale, anyway), he discovered a way to get one on the cheap. In 1975, Gerald Levin, of Home Box Office, which was then a regional cable service, owned by Time Inc., that offered movies to subscribers, decided that he could transform HBO into a national pay-TV network by distributing it over the newly launched RCA satellite: all he had to do was get cable operators to invest a hundred thousand dollars in a thirty-foot dish. At the time, broadcast-TV stations like Turner's Channel 17 relied on microwave signals that bounced off transmission towers. Turner, however, had a tower that was twice the height of most other such towers, and his station already reached beyond its broadcast range, of forty miles, to five states. But a network of towers was expensive, and the signals were impeded by tall buildings and deteriorated over long distances.\n\nClockwise from top right: Turner with his first wife, Judy Nye; his second wife, Jane Smith; and his father.\n\nCable had other advantages: unlike broadcasting, which produced revenue solely from advertising, it had monthly subscription charges. But cable in those days had little programming of its own; it had started as a way to improve TV reception, and then became a way to extend television to rural communities that didn't get broadcast signals. Turner saw an opportunity. With satellites, as HBO had demonstrated, signals could be sent across the nation, and so Channel 17 could become a cable network. He renamed the new network TBS-Turner Broadcasting System.\n\nTurner was taking not only a huge business risk-he borrowed heavily-but a political risk, too, since he needed approval from the Federal Communications Commission. The broadcast networks and the local TV stations were implacably opposed. They were joined by the Hollywood studios, which complained that Turner would be paying a local price for their movies and exhibiting them nationally, and by professional sports teams, which said that Turner was stealing their product.\n\nTurner and others in the cable industry saw the broadcast networks and their allies as a cartel that had induced the government to impose regulations crippling cable's ability to compete. Cable conventions at that time were like revival meetings, with speaker after speaker fervently denouncing this satan. As a master salesman, Turner knew that Congress had long been concerned about the pervasive power of Hollywood and the three big New York-based broadcast networks, and he assured congressional leaders that he, a broadcaster, was trying to help the nascent cable industry provide consumers with more choices-and better choices, too, since his station would not, he vowed, program violent, sexually explicit movies, like Martin Scorsese's \"Taxi Driver.\" Of course, viewers would not be receiving first-class alternative fare, since Turner was offering movies and sports in the evening and \"Lassie,\" \"The Munsters,\" and \"The Flintstones,\" among other programs, during the day. Nevertheless, the F.C.C. allowed tiny Channel 17 to become the Superstation, an overnight rival to the networks.\n\nCable was starved for programming, and TBS and HBO became its building blocks. To insure continuous baseball coverage that could not be taken off his Superstation, Turner, in 1976, bought the Atlanta Braves; although he paid a bargain price of ten million dollars, he went into debt to do it. He attended most Braves home games: he ran out onto the field to lead the fans in \"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\"; sitting behind the Braves dugout, he'd spit Red Man tobacco juice into a cup and swill beer, in hot weather peeling off his shirt; when a Brave hit a home run, he'd jump over the railing and rush to the plate to greet him; he played cards with his players and insisted that they call him Ted. Ralph Roberts, the founder of Comcast Communications, which is now the nation's third-largest cable company, says of TBS, \"We thought it was the greatest thing in the world.\" Roberts was charmed by Turner; others were not. Turner would drop to the floor, histrionically, to beg for business; once, telling a roomful of Southern ladies how to woo advertisers, he explained, \"My daddy said, 'If advertisers want a blow job, you get down on your knees.' \"\n\nHe became Captain Outrageous. Celebrating his victory in the 1977 America's Cup, he swigged almost a whole bottle of aquavit that had been given to him by the Swedish team, and then, drinking champagne, pulled his shirt up to his neck and yelled at some nearby women, \"Show me your tits!\" Earlier that same year, his second as a team owner, the baseball commissioner, Bowie Kuhn, suspended him for the season, accusing him of tampering when he tried to sign a player who was under contract to another team.\n\nTurner tales became legendary. While racing in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1978, Turner coaxed the French-born Frédérique D'arragon-then, as now, a girlfriend-to wait until their boat came to the reviewing stand and then jump naked into the water. Jimmy Carter remembers that when he became President, in 1977, he invited his fellow-Georgian to state dinners. \"He was very raucous,\" Carter said. \"He was loud, and he interrupted sedate proceedings.\" Carter was amused by Turner. Dick Cavett, on the other hand, was not. During a taping of his television show, Cavett pressed him: \"You are a colorful, boisterous, sometimes inebriated playboy type. Maybe it's an act or it's created by the press, but that is your image. You wouldn't deny that, would you?\"\n\n\"I have heard that you are a little twinkle-toed TV announcer,\" Turner responded. \"Would you deny that?\"\n\nBy the late seventies, Turner was rich, and although he still behaved in unconventional ways, he had become more serious. He had great respect for Jimmy Carter, and no doubt Carter's more liberal views affected Turner's own politics. He began to liken himself to \"an ambassador for good will.\" He saw himself as a rabbit-\"a rabbit that's small and fast. All my big competitors were like a pack of wolves, and they were all chasing me, but I was fast enough to be out in front of them.\" The emblem of the rabbit was Turner's brand-new Cable News Network.\n\nReese Schonfeld, a creative and prickly executive, had discussed the cable-news-channel idea with Turner in 1978, and he served as CNN's first president. Turner, who was generous with his money but cheap in sharing credit with Schonfeld, told cable operators that CNN would do for the cable industry what Edward R. Murrow and Huntley-Brinkley had done for network news. CNN would make news the star, not overpaid anchors, and it would not be clotted with ads. Schonfeld travelled the country to sign up cable operators. And at most cable conventions there was Ted Turner, to make a speech and inspire his cable army.\n\nThe new cable network, based in Atlanta, made its official début on June 1, 1980, with three military bands striking up music and a nervous Ted Turner standing at a lectern in a blue blazer. Sporting Elvis sideburns, he began by reciting \"a little poem that was written by Ed Kessler,\" and that reflected CNN's mission: \"To act upon one's convictions while others wait, to create a positive force in a world where cynics abound, to provide information to people when it wasn't available before.\" A band played \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" and when it ended Turner whooped \"Awww-riiight!\" and CNN went live.\n\nCNN's production values were initially amateurish-\"video wallpaper,\" or \"talking heads,\" network news executives sneered-and ratings were poor. Most of the work of building a staff, imposing news values, and winning clearance from local cable operators was taken on by Schonfeld. But Turner was the galvanizer, the risk-taker. He practically lived in his office, hurrying through the newsroom and rarely spending more than thirty seconds with anyone. Nick Charles, a sports reporter who was one of the first people to be hired at CNN, recalls that most of the staff worked six or seven days a week and relied on portable toilets outside, and that employees would show up in the morning and see Ted, wearing a robe or wrapped in a towel, wandering out of his office, where he slept on a Murphy bed, to retrieve coffee from the newsroom. Once, Steve Heyer remembers, he walked into Turner's office and the great man was sitting at his desk stark naked. \"Don't get up!\" someone exclaimed. Nick Charles recalls, \"He was much more than a cheerleader. He was the kind of guy you'd want to run through a wall for.\"\n\nAt first, many CNN employees were dubious. Daniel Schorr, a former CBS correspondent, who was hired early on, was worried every time he heard Turner extoll the importance of good news, as if what he wanted were more happy news. Worry spread when, in 1982, Turner, frustrated by Schonfeld's close-to-the-vest management style and ownerlike ego, abruptly fired him. Lou Dobbs, another CNN pioneer, who was a business-news anchor, remembered Turner as a drunken sailor and thought that he might not be \"the right fellow to lead the effort.\" Dobbs was afraid that Turner was more an \"eccentric\" than a \"visionary\"-until he got to know him. \"He is a natural-born leader,\" Dobbs says. \"I once asked him his definition of a leader. He said, 'A leader has the ability to create infectious enthusiasm.' \"\n\nClockwise from top left: Turner with Jane Fonda; at his ranch; and with Frédérique D'arragon.\n\nCNN started as an all-day, mostly live, and mostly domestic news service. But it strayed to cover Cuba's 1981 May Day parade and a speech by Fidel Castro, and that led to an invitation for Turner to visit the island. Turner, who had never been to a Communist country, and whose politics continued to soften, was curious about it, and the next year he accepted the invitation. For the better part of four days, the Cuban Communist and the Southern conservative hung out, smoking cigars, attending a baseball game, duck hunting, visiting schools, discussing politics, and night-clubbing. To an associate, Turner said, \"Fidel ain't a Communist. He's a dictator, just like me.\" He learned that Castro watched CNN's signal from southern Florida; ever the salesman, he persuaded Castro to tape a promotional spot. Castro, in turn, urged Turner to take his news service worldwide. \"Ted came back fired up,\" Eason Jordan remembers. International news quickly expanded-CNN sent its first signal to Asia in late 1982 and to Europe in 1985. Jordan was twenty-eight when he started running CNN's foreign-news coverage.\n\nIn the beginning, the broadcast networks refused to include CNN in their pooled coverage of White House events. Turner filed a federal lawsuit in Atlanta against the \"cartel\" and the Reagan Administration, claiming violations of the antitrust laws and of CNN's rights under the First Amendment. To build support for CNN in Congress, Turner spent thirteen thousand dollars to install a satellite dish for the House and cabled the office of each member of Congress. Because CNN had twenty-four hours of news to fill, a congressman had a much better chance of being seen there. Ted Turner would win the battle for public support; more important, in a landmark ruling in the spring of 1982, the Atlanta court declared in CNN's favor, and by the mid-eighties CNN's triumph was apparent.\n\nOne reason for Turner's success-with CNN, with the Superstation, with buying sports teams to supply cable programming-is identified by Bob Wright, the president and C.E.O. of NBC. \"He sees the obvious before most people do,\" Wright says. \"We all look at the same picture, but Ted sees what you don't see. And after he sees it, it becomes obvious to everyone.\" As the networks shrank their overseas bureaus, CNN expanded. It invested in \"flyaway\" portable satellite dishes, costing about two hundred and fifty thousand dollars each, that could be carried in a suitcase and used anywhere in the world to \"uplink\" to a satellite. Turner wanted to grow bigger still. Although Turner Broadcasting had a mere two hundred and eighty-two million dollars in revenue in 1984, and the New York banks spurned his request for credit, in 1985 Turner got junk-bond financing that enabled him to make a $5.4-billion offer for a broadcast network: CBS.\n\nKnowing that he was an underdog, Turner sought political support from Senator Jesse Helms, of North Carolina. Helms had mounted a campaign against CBS's \"liberal bias,\" and he encouraged Turner to meet with a group called Fairness in Media, which had sent letters to a million conservatives begging them to buy CBS stock and \"become Dan Rather's boss.\" Up North, many in the media expressed horror at the prospect of Turner, whom they regarded as an unsophisticated Southerner-a redneck-owning \"the Tiffany network.\" Thomas Wyman, who was the C.E.O. of CBS, questioned Turner's moral fitness to run a network and accused him of being in bed with ideological groups, although he didn't name any. Wyman and CBS, hoping to block Turner, welcomed the \"white knight\" financing of Laurence Tisch, of the Loews Corporation, and Tisch stealthily gained control of CBS.\n\nBy the mid-eighties, however, Turner was not the provincial portrayed by CBS. As he sought to build CNN overseas, he became much more of an internationalist; he was more concerned with saving the environment, eradicating poverty, and ending the Cold War. He met and became friends with Jacques Cousteau, the primatologist Jane Goodall, the civil-rights leader Andrew Young, and the environmentalist Russell Peterson. \"I was hanging around with people who cared about the future of the planet, both of the human race and of the environment,\" he says. \"And they had an impact on me.\" Although he had once been a smoker, he now refused to hire anyone who smoked. \"I figured any young person who's dumb enough to smoke is too dumb to work at CNN or TBS,\" he says. In 1985, he established the Better World Society, whose purpose was to subsidize documentaries on the dangers of environmental pollution, nuclear weapons, and the population explosion. He also began to proselytize for an end to the Cold War. After the United States boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympics, following the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan, and the Soviet Union withdrew from the 1984 Los Angeles Games, Turner financed and launched the Goodwill Games to foster athletic competition between the United States and the U.S.S.R. During this time, Turner even thought of running for President.\n\nBut to those who didn't know him-and even to some members of his board, who did-Turner was still often seen as Captain Outrageous. They were tired of hearing that he was going to own a network or a Hollywood studio, that he was going to make movies like \"Gone with the Wind.\" So when, in August of 1985, Turner, without fully consulting his board, bought, for a billion and a half dollars, the M-G-M film studio, its Culver City lot, and its library of more than thirty-five hundred motion pictures the consensus was that he had overpaid. The financing for his impulsive decision was arranged by Drexel Burnham's junk-bond king, Michael Milken, who was representing both Turner and the owner of M-G-M, Kirk Kerkorian. Milken reduced the amount of cash Turner needed by persuading Kerkorian to accept stock in Turner Broadcasting. The difficulty was that Turner found himself with two billion dollars' worth of debt; within three months, he was forced to sell the studio and other parts of M-G-M back to Kerkorian, for three hundred million dollars.\n\nHe kept the film library, however, and he brilliantly exploited this asset. The movies became a source of cheap television programming, and Turner created new cable networks-such as TNT (Turner Network Television), launched in 1988, and TCM (Turner Classic Movies), in 1994-to showcase them. Looking back, he is pleased with himself for having done this \"right under the networks' noses\" and for having managed to grow \"from one-thousandth the size of the networks to two and a half times bigger.\" He says, \"They laughed at me when I started with CBS. They laughed at me when I started CNN. They laughed at me when I bought the Braves. They laughed at me when I bought the Hawks. They laughed at me when I bought M-G-M. I spent a lot of time thinking, and I did not fear, because of my classical background. When Alexander the Great took control when his dad died, he was twenty years old. He took the Macedonian Army, which was the best army in the world at the time, and conquered Greece, got the Greeks to all join with him, and then marched across the Hellespont and invaded Asia. They didn't even know where the world ended at that time. And he was dead at thirty-three, thirteen years later. He kept marching. He hardly ever stopped. And he never lost a battle.\"\n\nTurner did lose battles, even if they were within the company. Kerkorian, it was revealed, had a stipulation that if Turner did not reduce his debt within six months he would have to pay Kerkorian in TBS stock, and Turner worried that Kerkorian could soon gain control of his company. On top of this, companies like Rupert Murdoch's were turning a raptor's eye on the debt-ridden Turner empire. To avoid losing everything, Turner, in 1987, looked to a consortium of thirty-one cable companies-in particular, T.C.I. and Time Inc.'s cable subsidiary-for a bailout. In return for more than five hundred million dollars in cash, Turner ceded more than one-third ownership to them; he also granted the cable executives seven of fifteen board seats and an effective veto over any expenditure exceeding two million dollars. \"In hindsight, you could say that Ted lost his company,\" Terry McGuirk says. \"But, at the time, it was in many ways Nirvana, because Ted partnered with his best customers.\" Turner, however, wanted to expand, and his new partners did not. They wanted to protect Turner's programming assets for the cable industry and keep them away from broadcast rivals. Or they wanted the assets for themselves.\n\nLink copied\n\nTurner had watched as, in 1985 and 1986, Murdoch formed the Fox network, and CBS, NBC, and ABC got new owners. Increasingly frustrated, he began to spend even more time away from Atlanta. Whenever he wanted to do something bold-buy a studio or a network, for example-he confronted a veto from his board. Decisions about acquisitions were made by committee. One of the few acquisitions that the board approved, in 1991, and only after Turner wore board members down, was of Hanna-Barbera, whose animation library included more than a third of all the animated cartoons ever made in this country; with this library, Turner was able to create the now thriving Cartoon Network.\n\nWhen it came to programming decisions, Turner remained in charge. Brad Siegel, the president of Turner's Entertainment Networks, remembers that when, in 1993, he was hired to run TNT Turner involved himself in such questions as what programs provided the proper lead-ins for 8 P . M . adult dramas. \"One of the great things about Ted is that he watches everything,\" Siegel says. \"Everything we make on the entertainment side-the pilots, the movies, the specials-Ted watches everything on tape. You always got a call.\" And when the ratings were poor but the program was good-as when TNT aired a \"David Copperfield\" movie-Turner congratulated Siegel.\n\nTurner's most visible success came ten years after CNN went on the air-with its coverage of the Gulf War. Unlike the other networks, CNN made a financial commitment to cover any potential war from ground zero, Baghdad. Eason Jordan figured that the Iraqi communications system would be taken out in any allied air raid, so he recommended that CNN invest in a suitcase version of a satellite phone; this expenditure, of fifty-two thousand dollars, would be added to the extra millions that CNN was committed to spend to cover what might be the first live war. Tom Johnson, a former Los Angeles Times publisher, had taken over as president of CNN on August 1, 1990; the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait came on his second day at work. Johnson recalls going to Turner with various spending plans for war coverage. He asked Turner, \"What am I authorized to spend?\"\n\n\"You spend whatever you think it takes, pal,\" Turner said. Johnson was amazed, especially because, he recalls, \"I'm not even sure he remembered my name.\"\n\nJohnson posted people around the clock in Baghdad and Amman and Saudi Arabia and Israel and the White House and the Pentagon and the State Department. CNN, he says, spent twenty-two million dollars covering the war. CNN got permission from the Iraqi government to circumvent the Al Rashid Hotel switchboard and set up a four-wire telephone transmission from Baghdad to Amman, and then to Atlanta. When the United States destroyed the telephone system in Baghdad, only CNN had a telephone. When the Bush Administration urged the broadcast networks to pull their crews out of Iraq, they complied. Tom Johnson tells how he received calls from President Bush and other government officials, urging him to leave Baghdad, and how vexing this was. When he met with Turner and told him about these calls, and about two bureau chiefs who had been killed when he was at the Los Angeles Times , Turner was unmoved. He told Johnson, \"I will take on myself the responsibility for anybody who is killed. I'll take it off of you if it's on your conscience.\" Johnson adds, \"I, frankly, was about to order them back to Amman. I thought they'd all get killed.\"\n\nNo one got killed. And Turner was acclaimed as a different kind of businessman, one who thought about more than profit margins. When he commissioned a CNN documentary series, of more than twenty hours, on the Cold War, Rick Kaplan says, \"his attitude was, if we break even on 'The Cold War' it would still be an enormous success.\" Turner understood, in a way that many corporate leaders do not, that building a brand can be expensive.\n\nIn the late eighties, Turner's personal life became happier. Jimmy Carter remembers that he was hunting and fishing with Turner at Avalon, Turner's estate in Tallahassee, Florida, when Turner read that Jane Fonda was planning to divorce Tom Hayden, the sixties activist. Turner told Carter that he had always admired Fonda, as an actor and as an outspoken liberal. \"I think I'm going to ask her for a date,\" he said. When he called, Fonda put him off. She was not yet ready to date, she told Turner, although she was soon photographed at St. Bart's cavorting with an Italian soccer player.\n\nTurner's second marriage had ended in 1988, after twenty-four years, three children, and many dalliances. His dating patterns conformed to his travel schedule; he took up with, among others, a Playboy bunny and the female pilot of his private plane. Turner was persistent with Fonda, and finally, in late 1989, they had their first date. It was followed by many others, including an Academy Awards ceremony, a White House dinner, a Kremlin dinner with Mikhail Gorbachev. They went horseback riding at Turner's Montana ranches; later, Turner, with Fonda by his side, would point out a cabin to visitors and announce that this was where they first made love. Both were famous, opinionated, rich, and attractive. Both loved the outdoors. Both had endured difficult childhoods under severe fathers. Neither finished college. And both felt profound guilt after the suicide of a parent; Fonda's mother had slashed her own throat at the age of forty-two. \"She is fiercely focussed and full of idealism and, like all of us, full of insecurities, too. And so is he,\" the former Colorado senator Tim Wirth, who is a friend of both, says. \"She reinforced all the best qualities in him. And she said to me the sweetest thing. She said, 'You know, Ted is the only person who's apologized more than I have.' They are really good, vulnerable people.\"\n\nThe couple held hands on Larry King's CNN program. They kissed in public. Turner brought her to CNN executive meetings and they sent mash notes to each other. She got him to drink less and diet more, to spruce up his wardrobe and buy art for his houses. Turner's mood swings became less pronounced; he yelled less, and he stopped taking lithium, which he had been on for about three years because, he says, \"a quack\" psychiatrist misdiagnosed him as \"manic.\"\n\nTurner and Fonda married in December of 1991 at his Florida estate, where bride and groom wore white and were surrounded by their children; they dined on fresh quail that Fonda had shot herself, candied yams, collard greens, and corn bread. Turner hates being alone, so Fonda moved to Atlanta. For much of the next decade, she was at his side. In Montana, Turner announced that he was getting rid of his cattle and sheep and returning the land to bison, the animals that grazed there two centuries ago. Fonda became an enthusiastic hunter. Gerald Levin, who says that he is \"constitutionally opposed to killing animals,\" remembers how, on a visit to one of Turner's properties, he learned that Fonda had shot a deer and loaded it into a pickup truck. \"I was appalled,\" Levin says. \"It was Bambi in the back of the truck!\"\n\nIn Atlanta, Turner did not live in a grand style. He poked a hole in the roof of the CNN Center building and put in a spiral staircase to connect the office to what has been called a penthouse but is really a seven-hundred-square-foot efficiency apartment, with a cramped bedroom. (One wall of the bedroom is a two-hundred-gallon saltwater fish tank, on the other side of which is the living room.) The most striking features of the apartment are a terrace, largely unused, with sweeping views of downtown (for a long while, Turner says, he \"was the only downtown resident-except homeless people!\"), and a photograph-one of the few on display-of Ed Turner looking up adoringly at his son. Turner had slept in his old office for a decade; this apartment allowed him to walk to work and to order room service from the Omni Hotel. To accommodate Fonda, he converted the bedroom closet into a windowless office for her-\"a storage closet,\" Fonda called it.\n\nLink copied\n\n\"I learned a lot from Jane,\" Turner says. Laura Seydel, his eldest daughter, explains that her father only reluctantly celebrated Christmas and, until he married Fonda, did not invest time in planning family gatherings. Soon Fonda and Turner and his five children and their families had reunions twice a year, and swapped Christmas presents, and attended church christenings. Laura and her husband, Rutherford Seydel II, live in Atlanta with three young children and are active in charitable activities; Seydel works as a lawyer for Turner. He and Laura think of Turner as a great man, but he was not always a great family man. After he married Fonda, however, Grandpa Turner was around more.\n\nTurner was surprised but not displeased that Fonda attracted more attention than he did when they travelled. Fonda says that Turner was never jealous of the notice she received. \"He doesn't have that kind of ego,\" she says. \"He put me on a pedestal. He loved my successes.\" Although he is not an introspective or patient man, Turner probably opened up more to Fonda than he ever had to anyone else, male or female. By most accounts, the marriage was a good one, and Turner's friends and family came to adore Fonda. Laura says, \"She's grandma to our kids. She filmed our firstborn.\" Embraced by senior female executives at Turner Broadcasting, she went on three-day all-\"girls\" trips. \"Her influence was profound,\" Jimmy Carter told me. Carter smiled as he talked about Turner. \"Ted has always been very hyper, in that he's constantly having visions of grandiose things. He was very restless . . . always dreaming. Ted told us he was taking sedation to calm himself. . . . When he and Jane got together, Ted became much more relaxed.\"\n\nIn the early nineties, Turner began worrying once more that his company was too small. The networks had persuaded the government to relax the rules that prohibited them from owning and syndicating TV programs, which is where television fortunes are made. Turner didn't own a studio, and he feared that the studios would reserve their best programs for their networks, starving Turner Broadcasting. Nor could he match the resources of NBC, now owned by G.E., in bidding for world rights to televise the Olympics, or ABC, owned by Disney, in bidding for Monday Night Football. Turner Broadcasting got smaller compared with its competitors. The usual edge of an entrepreneur like Turner-the rabbit's advantage-seemed less vital than size.\n\n\"You need to control everything,\" Turner said one day recently in his New York office, his foot up against an empty coffee table. \"You need to be like Rockefeller with Standard Oil. He had the oil fields, and he had the filling stations, and he had the pipelines and the trucks and everything to get the gas to the stations. And they broke him up as a monopoly. You want to control everything. You want to have a hospital and a funeral home, so when the people die in the hospital you move them right over to the funeral home next door. When they're born, you got 'em. When they're sick, you got 'em. When they die, you got 'em.\" He smiled and added, \"The game's over when they break you up. But in the meantime you play to win. And you know you've won when the government stops you.\"\n\nTurner set his sights once more on buying a studio or a TV network, or arranging a business partnership with one. With John Malone, he tried to buy Paramount. When Viacom won that competition, Turner and Malone explored purchasing ABC and then entered what Turner thought were serious negotiations to acquire NBC; again, some of the cable owners on his board opposed him. Turner says that Gerald Levin, of Time Warner (Time Inc. had merged with Warner Communications in 1990), which owned nineteen per cent of Turner's company, used that position to veto the five-billion-dollar purchase. Levin was straightforward; he said that the interests of separate companies often diverge. If Turner wanted a network, so did Levin, who was planning to launch his own network, WB.\n\n\"Everyone wanted to merge with Ted,\" Malone told me. \"No one wanted to turn control over to Ted.\" This was true of Rupert Murdoch, who had once gone skiing with Turner. \"He is one of the most charming people you'd ever meet,\" Turner says. \"He told me he loved CNN the way it was and if we merged with him he wouldn't change a thing.\" Turner, who detests Murdoch, says that he didn't believe him. (Murdoch declined to comment.) There was a brief courtship by Bill Gates, of Microsoft; Gates thought that the power of CNN's brand could be transformed into an instantly successful online-news site. Turner thought that Microsoft's deep pockets could be used to help finance a bid for CBS. But the talks went nowhere. (Not long after this, Microsoft became a partner in MSNBC.) Meanwhile, Time Warner was determined that, if anyone was going to take over CNN and Turner's assets, it was going to be Time Warner.\n\nWhen Turner is agitated, the people close to him try to prevent him from talking to reporters or giving a speech. Around this time, however, he was scheduled to speak at a National Press Club luncheon in Washington. Jane Fonda says that she was aware of the \"fragility\" of the relationship between Turner and Time Warner. \"One false move and it would fall apart. I didn't sleep that night. Ted slept like a baby.\" When Turner rose to speak, he startled the audience by mentioning a story on clitorectomies that CNN had aired. Suddenly, he started comparing the mutilation of women to what Gerald Levin was doing to him. He cried out, \"You talk about barbaric mutilation. Well, I'm in an angry mood. I'm angry at that, too. I'm being clitorized by Time Warner!\"\n\n\"I slid under my seat,\" Fonda says. Levin, more diplomatically, says, \"Ted is Ted. He not only says what he thinks; he gives the most amazing speeches. While I think his analogy is a little stretched, he was peeved at the time. He actually called me up, and we talked about it. It wasn't a problem.\"\n\nIt was a problem. Turner felt fenced in, as he does when he is handed a speech to read or when he's told that he can't do something. \"My inner dream is to go to the place,\" he starts to explain-and suddenly breaks into the old Roy Rogers theme song-\"where the West commences, gaze at the moon till I lose my senses. . . . Don't fence me in.\" Fences loom large in Turner's mind; he hates them, and that is one reason that his landholdings are so vast. \"I'm happiest when I'm on a horse on my ranch,\" he says. At the same time, he can't stand to be alone.\n\nThis much is clear: by 1995, after thirty-two years in business, Turner no longer felt like a nimble rabbit. In the spring and early summer of that year, Terry McGuirk, representing Turner, tried to extricate Turner Broadcasting from Time Warner. \"I spent about six months negotiating an exit from Time Warner and doing a deal with John Malone,\" McGuirk recalls. But, much as Turner admired Malone, he feared placing CNN in the hands of such a committed conservative. He was also concerned about Malone's business partnerships with Murdoch. Turner's own biases clearly infected CNN. It was an international network that slavishly covered the United Nations, from whose vocabulary, by Turner's dictate, the term \"foreign news\" was banished, that aired documentaries on subjects Turner cared about. People at CNN undoubtedly knew what the boss wanted. But CNN was not used to punishing Turner's foes, as Murdoch's newspapers sometimes did to Murdoch's foes. Turner \"never once had me pull a story,\" Tom Johnson says. Nor, says Gail Evans, the CNN executive vice-president in charge of booking guests, did he ever order executives to help a friend. \"In my twenty years here, Ted has never once asked me to book a guest,\" she says.\n\nMeanwhile, Gerald Levin had concluded that his company was not big enough; he saw CNN as \"the jewel\" that he could link with Time Warner's magazines. Levin also knew that he had to move fast, before Turner was bought by a competitor. After talking it over with only two members of his team-Richard Parsons, the president, and Richard Bressler, the chief financial officer-Levin phoned Turner and asked if he could fly to Montana to discuss an \"important\" matter.\n\nLink copied\n\nThis was in August of 1995, and by then, Turner says, \"I knew I was selling the company. And there was another reason I did it, too. I was a little bit tired.\" He was tired of his cable partners. Whatever differences he had with Levin, however, Turner knew that Levin cared deeply about journalism, for he was a proud defender of his magazines' independence. Turner also knew that a merger would connect Turner Broadcasting to a Hollywood studio, a giant music company, the country's largest magazine-publishing enterprise, and its foremost cable system.\n\nWhen Levin's plane landed that morning, Jane Fonda picked him up. Although Turner had weekend house guests-including his neighbors Meredith and Tom Brokaw-he and Levin went out on the porch alone and Levin consulted ten or so points he had jotted down on a piece of paper about why Turner and Time Warner were a perfect fit. Turner Broadcasting, he said, \"would be the pivot point in the center of the company,\" and Ted Turner would be a partner, not an employee. When he and Levin walked back into the house and Turner saw Brokaw, who had just arrived, he shouted, \"Hey, buddy. We just made a deal. We're going to merge.\" Brokaw remembers that Levin looked startled when Turner revealed their secret.\n\nTurner had traded a silent boss for a real one. But he still owned almost eleven per cent of the merged company, and he was not timid. He pressed Levin to sell off company airplanes and expensive American art and to curb costs at the Hollywood studio. He stepped in to stop a fifty-million-dollar sale of Warner Bros, movies to CBS, insisting that the Warner films should be offered first to its own cable networks. He won control of all new international channels, preventing Warner Bros. from spending millions to build a staff that would duplicate Turner Broadcasting's. He pushed for across-the-board budget reductions, and, as the Wall Street Journal reported, he even fired his own son, Robert E. (Teddy) Turner IV, who was a promotions manager for Turner Home Entertainment, bluntly warning him over a family dinner, \"You're toast.\"\n\nWhether by design or by accident, Levin began to use Turner for his own purposes. \"The edict from Gerry Levin was 'Let Ted be Ted,'\" a Levin confidant recalls. \"Time Warner was buttoned up and bureaucratic. Ted was a breath of fresh air, and Gerry used that to the advantage of the company.\" When they met with employees, he remembers, \"Ted would get up and say, 'I've got one suit. I don't spend my money on suits. I own ten per cent of the company and each dollar you waste, ten cents comes from me.'\" Levin remembers that he was \"very comfortable\" with Ted's saying whatever he wanted, and had no illusions that it could be any other way. Levin and many other Time Warner executives were pleasantly surprised that Turner was a team player. Within the Turner Broadcasting group, Gail Evans says, Turner didn't change the way he worked, except to occasionally say, \"I have to check with the boss.\"\n\nNo matter how many times Turner checked, however, he and Levin never grew close. They didn't communicate regularly. Turner was hurt that Levin, who is intensely private, never invited him to his home for dinner. They had business differences-Turner, for example, wanted Levin to fold the Warner Bros. television operations into Turner Broadcasting. He still resented Levin's veto of his potential purchase of NBC, believing that if he had succeeded he never would have sold his company and, he laments, \"I'd have bought Time Warner instead of going the other way.\" Levin, who then wore a thick mustache chopped at the ends, as if he'd got tired of shaving, was reclusive and weighed his words carefully; the six-foot-one Turner towered over him and was impulsive. Levin was a schemer; Turner could become so focussed on the moment that sometimes when he got off his horse he dropped the reins and the horse galloped away, leaving him stranded. \"There are probably not two more different individuals that I've ever worked with,\" Terry McGuirk says.\n\nInevitably, perhaps, after the Time Warner merger Turner and Murdoch declared war on each other. Turner said that Murdoch had to be stopped before he took over the media and used them as a weapon to advance his conservative agenda and his business interests. Turner asserts that men of good will can resolve differences between, say, Arabs and Israelis, yet he does not believe that it is possible to play Chamberlain to Murdoch's Hitler. \"How do you make peace with a mega-maniac?\" Turner said to me in a November, 1996, interview. \"Chamberlain tried to make peace. When you've got somebody like that, I don't think there's a spark of human decency in him-except he likes his family.\" Turner said that Murdoch's Fox News network would do in America what Murdoch had done in China, where he removed the BBC from his satellite system in order to gain favor with the government. Murdoch's New York Post taunted Turner, describing him as a doormat for foreign dictators, suggesting that he was wacky, and portraying Fonda as Hanoi Jane. The battle became so ferocious that executives in both camps grew concerned; after all, Fox wanted television shows from Warner Bros. and Warner Bros. needed Murdoch's satellites. Fox would need Time Warner cable systems to carry its new cable news service. In the end, business interests outweighed principles, a truce was arranged, and, though Turner has never altered his view of Murdoch, he began to focus on other things.\n\nWith McGuirk running Turner Broadcasting day to day, Turner had more time. And, with Time Warner's stock price soaring, he also had more money. In September of 1997, he was to be honored by the United Nations Association-USA, and he had the idea of giving a billion dollars-then a third of his wealth-to the United Nations. The Turners were flying to New York when Turner told his wife what he planned. \"I was extremely moved,\" Jane Fonda says, adding that she told her husband, \"Don't you think you should talk to your lawyers first?\" He did, and learned that he could not make the gift directly to the U.N.\n\nThe next day, as U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan recalls, Turner walked into Annan's office and blurted, \"Hi, Kofi. I'm going to give you a billion dollars.\"\n\n\"I thought it was a joke,\" Annan says, shaking his head in wonderment.\n\nThat night, Turner announced that he would give a hundred million dollars a year for ten years to support such U.N. programs as the elimination of land mines, providing medicine for children, and easing the plight of refugees. He hired Tim Wirth, who eventually recruited a staff of thirty-two, to oversee the effort. Turner's only condition was that his money be used only minimally for administrative overhead. Annan remembers that Turner also said, \"All of you billionaires out there, watch out. I'm coming after you.\"\n\nTurner has written his own version of the Ten Commandments, which he keeps on typed cards in his wallet. Without prompting, he will read from a list that includes these vows: \"'I promise to care for planet earth and all living things thereon'; 'I promise to treat all persons everywhere with dignity, respect, and friendliness'; 'I promise to have no more than one or two children'; 'I reject the use of force'; 'I support the United Nations.'\" Along with his manifest generosity, Turner remains enough of a ham to seek a fitting reward: a Nobel Prize. \"I've thought about it a little bit,\" Turner said when I asked him. \"Of course I've thought of it.\"\n\nTurner is easily moved to tears. He sobbed openly when Princess Diana was killed. On a trip to China in October of 1999, with Fonda reading and CNN's Eason Jordan working, Turner put on his headphones and popped in the videotape of a popular Warner Bros. cartoon movie, \"The Iron Giant,\" the story of the friendship between a young boy and a metallic being from outer space who sacrifices himself for the sake of the planet. Jordan remembers looking over at his boss. \"Tears were streaming down his face,\" he says. \"I never saw anybody cry like that in my life.\" As the credits rolled, Turner called out, \"That's the saddest thing I've ever seen!\"\n\nLink copied\n\nAmerica and Russia still have some seven thousand nuclear weapons targeted at each other, and Turner is terrified that these-along with chemical and biological weapons-could fall into the wrong hands. He dismisses the Bush Administration's effort to build an anti-missile defense system as madness; the technology won't work, he says, and, in any case, it won't prevent weapons of mass destruction from being delivered by car, by ship, or in a suitcase. All these dangers are \"off the radar screen,\" he says. \"We have a huge job. Probably ninety-five per cent of the U.S. population doesn't know about it.\" Thus Turner's Nuclear Threat Initiative. To lead it, he has recruited former Senator Sam Nunn, who once chaired the Armed Services Committee, and who signed on only after Turner agreed to allow him a free hand. \"When he gets behind something, people know it's serious, and it's going to have the energy and resources,\" Nunn says. Most days, Turner is a fan of the cautious Nunn; some days, he worries that Nunn is fencing him in.\n\nTurner's miserable last year actually began a few years ago, when Fonda began spending more time in Atlanta and less time with him. She wanted to be with her daughter Vanessa Vadim, who had moved to Atlanta and was raising a child on her own. Fonda's daughter Lulu, whose father was a Black Panther, and whom Jane took in when she and Tom Hayden ran a California camp for troubled kids, had also moved to Atlanta. In addition, Fonda had started the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention, and had taken up the cause of nurturing teen mothers. During this time (according to an E! biography of Fonda that aired last fall), Fonda started attending services at the Providence Missionary Baptist Church. Turner, who alternately describes himself as an atheist and an agnostic, told me his reaction: \"I had absolutely no warning about it. She didn't tell me she was thinking about doing it. She just came home and said, 'I've become a Christian.' Before that, she was not a religious person. That's a pretty big change for your wife of many years to tell you. That's a shock. I mean, normally that's the kind of thing your wife or husband would discuss with you before they did it or while they were thinking about it. . . . Obviously, we weren't communicating very well at that time.\"\n\n\"My becoming a Christian upset him very much-for good reason,\" Fonda says. \"He's my husband and I chose not to discuss it with him-because he would have talked me out of it. He's a debating champion. He saw it as writing on the wall. And it was about other things. He knew my daughter was having a baby and it would take me away from him. He needs someone to be there one hundred per cent of the time. He thinks that's love. It is not love. It's babysitting. I didn't want to tell you this. We went in different directions. I grew up.\" Turner's daughter Laura doesn't think religion per se was the real basis of their disagreement. She says, \"It was another male\"-Jesus. \"It took time away from him.\"\n\nThere were other differences, friends of both say, including Turner's libido and his insecurities. \"My problem is I love every woman I meet,\" Turner has said. He and Fonda visited marriage counsellors and psychiatrists, to no avail. On January 4,2000, they announced an official separation; before the announcement, Frédérique D'arragon, who is fifty-one, and has been in and out of Turner's life for more than thirty years, came back into it. She is almost a foot shorter than Turner, and prefers jeans to designer dresses. Fonda and D'arragon had lunch recently in Atlanta, and Fonda makes it clear that D'arragon will be available for Ted in ways she no longer can be: \"He needs to be taken care of. She has no children. And she's loved him a long time.\" But travelling with Ted has taken its toll on D'arragon, just as it did on Fonda. Turner admits that the persistent travel is \"driving her nuts.\"\n\nA close friend says that Turner is burdened by three things: an insecurity that can be traced back to his abusive father; a manic, restless nature; and lust. \"Each one of these is a great huge bear,\" the friend says. \"Turner must wrestle with three bears, and they sometimes overwhelm him.\" Fonda puts it another way: \"Why this guy didn't go under psychologically at age five, I don't know. It scarred him for life. It colors everything-his relationships, his anxieties . . .\"\n\nFonda and Turner insist that they still love each other; in fact, the best I have ever seen Turner look-his white hair washed and carefully combed, his thin white mustache trimmed, a chocolate-brown sports jacket nicely contrasting with pressed gray slacks, a burgundy tie, and brown Gucci loafers-was a December day in Atlanta when he and Fonda had a lunch date. Both friends and family are distressed by their split. But Fonda, despite her own notoriety as an actor and as a political activist, had lived in the shadow of three dominant husbands. By leaving Turner, she also announced her own liberation.\n\nTurner was despondent, and his sense of abandonment was heightened by the announcement, around the same time, that Time Warner was merging with AOL-more accurately, AOL was acquiring Time Warner. The price, based on the stock values of the companies on the day of the announcement, was pegged at a hundred and sixty-five billion dollars, the largest corporate marriage ever. Although Turner had been alerted to the merger discussions, he had not been invited by Gerald Levin to participate. \"Ted was not a strategic partner,\" a senior executive at Time Warner who is close to Turner told me. \"Gerry is a sole practitioner. He keeps things to himself. Ted was not in the loop. Yet Ted did not hesitate to endorse the deal.\" It was, after all, a growth strategy. Nor, according to an AOL strategist who was a party to the negotiations, was Turner's future role even a minor part of these discussions. What was talked about much more, he continued, was what a great fit CNN and AOL would be. \"You can AOL-ize CNN and do cross-promotions,\" the executives said enthusiastically. CNN, in fact, was desperately in need of promotion, for its ratings had plunged and its promotion budget had been cut.\n\nTurner would own four per cent (now just over three and a half per cent) of the new company and remain on the board, and he had won a vice-chairman title. But, while executives at the two companies respected Turner's many successes and his \"vision,\" they also found him unfathomable. One senior AOL executive who was working with Turner for the first time says, \"In meetings I've been in with him, he just sits there and in a piercing voice-louder than you would expect someone to talk-he interrupts or conveys a sense of 'Hurry up! Why am I here?' He gives off a feeling that he's in a rush, even if he's not doing anything.\"\n\nOver the next several months, as the two companies tried to get their executives working together and achieve the synergies they had touted, Turner was in Atlanta or New York no more than four or five days a month. He was not involved in budget details, as Terry McGuirk was, and soon McGuirk, an original Turner loyalist, signalled that he \"wanted out from under Ted,\" a senior member of the AOL Time Warner team explains. McGuirk admired Turner, but, if he was to be held responsible, then he wanted the authority, too.\n\nThere was one other difficulty. In the reorganized company, Steve Case was going to be the chairman and Levin the C.E.O., and the idea was to divide the company into separate spheres, each reporting to one of two presidents. Time Warner's Richard Parsons would oversee movies, music, publishing, legal affairs, and human resources. AOL's Robert Pittman would oversee AOL, cable, the magazines, television (including HBO, Turner Broadcasting, and the WB television network), and business development. \"By a process of elimination, it made sense for Terry McGuirk to report to Bob and for Ted to take a strategic role,\" a senior AOL Time Warner strategist says.\n\nSometimes Turner made light of his diminished role. Lou Dobbs remembers being invited to Turner's Montana ranch for a weekend. While they were fishing, Dobbs, who left CNN in 1999 to start an Internet venture, Space.com-and who returned last week to, among other things, anchor \"Moneyline News Hour\"-said, \"Ted, I outrank you. I'm C.E.O. and chairman.\"\n\n\"You're forgetting,\" Turner said. \"I'm also chairman of the Turner Foundation.\"\n\n\"Ted, that's nonprofit!\"\n\n\"What do you think Space.com is?\" Turner retorted, laughing.\n\nLink copied\n\nDobbs laughs, too, when telling this story, but, like many of Turner's friends, he is angry. \"He has not been treated with the respect due him,\" Dobbs says. Jane Fonda agrees. \"The way it was handled was really shocking,\" she says. \"It makes me mad. How dare they give him a phone call!\" Surely Turner did not feel that he was treated properly when CNN cancelled a pet project of his-a multipart documentary exploring the proliferation of nuclear weapons. He recruited a producer, George Crile, but, soon after Crile started work, Turner told him that he was encountering budget opposition at CNN. They would have to scale the project back to three hours. By October, 2000, it was down to a single hour. \"There's a lot of pressure to make the budgets,\" Turner explained, disappointed. In fact, he is so agitated by the budgeting strictures at CNN that, in December, he told me, \"I am going to produce, myself, ten hours on nuclear proliferation and chemical and biological warfare. I'll give first crack to CNN, and if they don't want it I'll give it to PBS.\" (By March, CNN's founder had given up on CNN documentaries. Together with former associates like Pat Mitchell, who is the president of PBS, and Robert Wussler, who had been a top Turner Broadcasting executive, he plans to team up with Bill Moyers for a series of PBS documentaries on world issues; the Turner Foundation will provide half the financing. \"Over the next few years I would hope we would do one hundred hours,\" Wussler says.)\n\nWhen he cut the Crile project from three hours to one, Tom Johnson says, \"Ted wasn't happy. I don't think he's happy with me. Ted knows I'm in a new world today.\" Turner was reminded of this \"new world\" when he invited me to sit in on a CNN executive-committee meeting on December 19th, and the invitation was rescinded. \"He invited you to a meeting that is not his meeting,\" an AOL Time Warner executive explained.\n\nThen, this past January, although Turner calls CNN \"the most profitable news operation in the world\"-it earned three hundred million dollars the previous year-its staff, of more than four thousand, was reduced by nearly ten per cent. Those who are gone include such Turner stalwarts as Elsa Klensch, Barbara Pyle, Nick Charles, Larry Woods, Gene Randall, and the Atlanta-based Turner Environment Division, with its show \"People Count,\" which Fonda sometimes hosted. On CNN evening programs, talk replaced news reports-often the shouting-head format that CNN inaugurated with \"Crossfire\" and which Fox News and MSNBC had copied and extended. \"Basically, the Fox prime-time schedule is just talk radio,\" Rick Kaplan, the former CNN/U.S. president, says.\n\nTom Johnson, who is worried about the future of CNN, says that Bob Pittman assured him that he and his colleagues in New York believed in CNN's mission. But Pittman's definition of CNN's mission may not match Johnson's or Turner's. Daily journalism is an inherently wasteful process: it involves waiting for calls to be returned, for airlines to fly, keeping forty-two bureaus functioning, chasing stories that don't pan out, and sometimes working for days on a single story. Will stockholders think this productive? As late as December, a longtime Turner executive predicted, \"Ted will protect us.\"\n\nLess than three months later, Turner was unable to protect two longtime lieutenants-Terry McGuirk and Steve Heyer. Turner says McGuirk and Heyer chafed at AOL Time Warner's demand that Turner Broadcasting's \"operating profits\" (EBITDA, which are earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) grow by thirty-nine per cent in 2001-which Turner says is nearly double the actual profit-growth average of the company over the past five years. \"They were unhappy mainly that the financial goals they were given were unachievable without really hurting the company,\" Turner says.\n\nAOL Time Warner executives insist that the true profit-growth target for the Turner Broadcasting division is half that, and that Turner's percentage does not reflect significant accounting changes. (Nonsense, senior executives at Turner Broadcasting say, claiming that their operating profits in 2000 were just under a billion dollars and that their company-imposed goal for 2001 is nearly $1.4 billion; the growth target that AOL Time Warner presented to Wall Street for the entire company in 2001 is thirty-one per cent.) Associates say Pittman is disturbed that CNN has lost market share to Fox News and MSNBC; CNN's prime-time ratings for the first quarter of 2001 were down five per cent from last year, while Fox News's climbed by a hundred and twenty-six per cent and MSNBC's by seventeen per cent. Turner is particularly worried about Fox News, which is in fewer homes but has talk-show hosts like the conservative Bill O'Reilly, who is now reaching a larger audience than Larry King, CNN's ratings champion.\n\nTurner says that he is uncomfortable with what he believes are arbitrary budget goals-what he called the company's new preoccupation with \"short-term fluctuations\" in its stock price-saying, \"I never ran the company by the numbers.\" Pittman denies that the company is being run strictly by the numbers. \"I think CNN is one of the great assets in the world,\" he says. \"But it takes a long time to build a franchise based on reliability and trust. They got it. That's something you can't replace overnight. That's the core, the value.\" And, Pittman adds, \"everyone agreed on\" a growth-target number, including, he implies, McGuirk. McGuirk, asked about the growth target, refuses to comment. He does say, \"The numbers are given to us, not negotiated.\"\n\nTed Turner today gets more notice outside his company than in it. When Fidel Castro came to New York last year for a three-day summit meeting at the U.N., he wanted to spend one night having dinner with Turner, who flew in from Montana for the occasion. The dinner stretched past midnight, and Castro was in the middle of a long-winded story when Turner raised his hand and exclaimed, \"Fidel, this story is never going to end, is it? I got to go!\" Castro laughed as Turner exited. Turner was the first Western businessman to have a private audience with Russia's new President, Vladimir Putin, who, Turner remembers, used to drive him when Turner visited St. Petersburg and Putin was a deputy to the city's mayor. \"I learned the value of being nice to everyone,\" Turner says, jokingly. In a trip arranged by George Crile, last May, Turner was also among the few private citizens to visit a nuclear command center outside Moscow. General Vladimir Yakovlev, the commander of Russia's Strategic Rocket Forces, cautioned, \"Don't touch any buttons!\" There was a PowerPoint presentation, in English, delineating Russia's various nuclear forces. Turner learned that each of seven thousand warheads could obliterate everything within a one-to-two-mile radius before the radiation and the fires spread. Turner sat mute, Eason Jordan recalls, for an hour and a half, transfixed by what he heard and saw. \"It was the only time I ever saw him speechless,\" Jordan says.\n\nYakovlev and Putin, like Castro, watch CNN. \"The Carter Center has programs in sixty-five different nations,\" Jimmy Carter says. \"We deal with leaders of nations who have a human-rights problem or conflict. . . . We go to those countries, and they quite often do not have a U.S. embassy in them. Invariably, in the offices there will be a TV station tuned to CNN.\" They know about Turner, and they know, Carter adds, that Turner is a true citizen of the world, a man who speaks up for what he believes even when it offends his government. Carter describes Turner as a personal \"hero.\" Kofi Annan sees this in Turner's appeal. \"He and Castro have a similar quality,\" Annan says. \"They are folk heroes of a sort. You can have one hundred heads of state here, and most people will gravitate toward Castro. You can have one hundred media heads here, and people will gravitate toward Ted.\"\n\nIn mid-March, Turner made a two-day visit to Harvard. An evening appearance at the Kennedy School of Government drew a large audience, and he was introduced by Alex S. Jones, the director of the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy, who said, \"Ted Turner changed America.\" Turner jumped up on the low platform, pumped Jones's hand, and started talking, with Jones still at his side. Turner used no notes. He wore a blue corduroy jacket and gray slacks. Perhaps it was the way he jumped up and, in his joltingly loud voice, started talking quickly, or the way he suddenly paused and drawled, \"Ahhhhhhhhhh\"; or perhaps it was the way he seemed to lapse into self-pity when he said, \"I'm just trying to do the best I can,\" or the way he raced from subject to subject, sometimes letting thoughts collide-how he was rejected by Harvard when he applied, and how he'd given Jane Fonda a hundred million dollars, and how, just recently, she bestowed more than twelve million of that sum on Harvard's School of Education for the study of gender and education, and how he wasn't a journalist but had related to the species since he sold newspapers as a boy-perhaps it was these quirks that caused the audience, as often happens when Turner speaks, to giggle. Michael Baumgartner, a first-year graduate student, initially thought Turner sounded drunk. Watching Turner speak is like watching live TV, with the audience wondering what will happen next.\n\nLink copied\n\nBut although at first people seemed to be laughing at Turner, the feeling in the room soon changed. On being told that President Bush earlier that day had abandoned a campaign pledge to establish \"mandatory reduction targets\" for carbon-dioxide emissions by power plants, Turner was momentarily silenced. \"That's heartbreaking news,\" he said finally. \"I mean, I can't take any more bad news. I've lost my job and my wife this year!\" Turner went on to talk about the environment, and about curbing nuclear weapons, and about his commitment to news. When he finished, students clamored to shake his hand.\n\nThat night, Turner was discreet about CNN. Asked about its future, he said, \"Well, I hope it's a bright one.\" But, while Turner thinks CNN has programmed \"too much\" talk, he has no idea how to cure its ratings woes: \"Quite frankly, I'm not sure I have the answers.\" Privately, he is concerned about a general dumbing down that is taking place in the media, putting \"DiSiprio\"-he means Leonardo DiCaprio-\"on the cover of Time . Obviously, it should be on the cover of People or Entertainment Weekly! \"\n\nBy the next morning, the man who confesses to a congenital inability to police a secret was no longer restrained. Turner did not criticize the recent round of cutbacks at CNN, but he did criticize the parent company's growth target. This was impossible to achieve, Turner said, without doing harm to CNN's journalism. \"I always wanted CNN to be the New York Times of the television business,\" he said, a little sadly.\n\nAlthough the AOL Time Warner merger took effect only in January, there have already been some successes. As the largest individual shareholder in the conglomerate, Turner is enthusiastic about a new emphasis on coördination and synergy. Of Gerald Levin's management over the past five years, Turner bluntly says, \"The Time Warner divisions did not coöperate the way they should have. . . . I think he did a pretty marginal job of running the company.\" Now, with roughly forty per cent of Americans using AOL to reach the Internet, AOL is vital in promoting each division of the company. In the eight months ending January 31st, for example, Pittman told Wall Street analysts, AOL had sold eight hundred thousand new subscriptions to Time Inc.'s different magazines. The company is in various businesses, Levin said at a conference earlier this month, but one word united them: \"subscriptions\"-a total of a hundred and thirty million subscribers.\n\nTurner, however, is afraid that when journalistic divisions like CNN shrink corporate executives may try to \"avoid doing stories that are critical of the big companies, like the oil companies and the automobile companies. It's not easy to do stories that are critical of G.E.-you know, nuclear-power-plant stories. When was the last time you saw stories on TV critical of G.E. or DuPont? Better to stay away from the corporations-they're the sponsors. That's the danger.\" Turner, to be sure, does not talk about the embarrassments of his own tenure, including CNN's unceasing coverage of the O. J. Simpson murder case and trial.\n\nAt another of his Harvard appearances-a session in which he was questioned by Jones and several others for an hour and then stayed for an hour more as the six finalists for the Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting discussed their stories-Turner said, \"I've already been fired, and I probably will be again shortly.\" One of the Shorenstein Fellows rose and condescendingly suggested that Turner might follow the example of Henry Ford, who also left his job but who set up the Ford Foundation, which is \"one of the most influential forces for the framing of issues in the country. You have a life and a future and can use your contacts-\"\n\n\"I am,\" Turner interrupted, and he mentioned his gift to the U.N. Foundation. \"No other individual in the world is giving as much to the poor world as I am. I'm spending fifty million dollars in the United States, mostly on environmental and family-planning causes. Ahhhhhhhh . . . I mean, family planning is under attack. You know, pro-lifers have got control of the White House. Roe v. Wade is hanging on by a thread. A woman's right to choose? They want to take that away. We're fighting global warming.\" He mentioned the Nuclear Threat Initiative and the dues payment to the U.N. \"And let me tell you what else I'm doing. I'm very close to making an announcement of a personal partnership through our foundation with public broadcasting to fund important documentaries that Turner Broadcasting has dropped. . . . And I've been trying desperately to get my network. It won't be NBC, but it will start with an N-NTV. The good news? I'm gonna get my network. The bad news? It's in Russia! I'm gonna try and help freedom of the press. I mean, I am doing plenty, Bubba!\"\n\nIt's not entirely clear whether Turner will own a network in Russia. In early April, he announced a plan to purchase part of the network founded by the Russian press baron Vladimir A. Gusinsky. This pleased independent Russian journalists like Masha Lipman, the deputy editor of the magazine Itogi , who says, \"It will be much more difficult for the Russian authorities to play dirty jokes\" on Turner. But the hard questions, she says, are two: Who will control the journalistic enterprise-Turner or the Russian authorities? And will Turner receive real guarantees of editorial freedom? Turner's longtime colleague Bob Wussler says that Gazprom, the state-dominated monopoly that has asserted control over the TV network, told him and Turner, \"You go do a deal with Gusinsky and come back and we'll do a deal with you.\" And even though President Putin stopped short of offering what Wussler calls \"a ringing endorsement\" of press freedom when Turner asked for it, Wussler feels that \"Putin is a politician and can say just so much. We took it as a good sign.\" Last week, however, Turner was struggling to invent a formula to satisfy Gusinsky, Gazprom, and the journalists themselves. On the surface, the deal is consistent with Turner's world-diplomacy principle-\"Just about everybody will be friendly toward us if we are friendly with them.\" But it may also suggest a certain naïveté.\n\nTurner's ability to give his money away has diminished as his principal stock holding-AOL Time Warner-has declined by more than thirty per cent since the merger announcement, reducing his net worth by about two billion dollars. It is possible, he tells me, that he will end his association with the company entirely. He hasn't quite accepted the idea that his business career is largely over, but he believes that his primary mission now is to help save the world, and perhaps himself.\n\n\"For some reason, he has a guilty conscience,\" Jane Fonda told me. \"He went much further than his father thought he would. So what's left? To be a good guy. He knows he will go down in history. He won't go down as a greedy corporate mogul. Although he claims to be an atheist, at the end of every speech he says, 'God bless you.' He wants to get into Heaven.\" Fonda told me of a family outing in 1992 on the occasion of the five-hundredth anniversary of Columbus's discovery of America. They went to a matinée of a film about Columbus and in the darkened theatre someone screamed out a litany of Columbus's supposed sins. There was a silence, until Turner blurted, \"I never did that!\" Fonda reached over and soothed her husband by patting his knee and said, \"It's O.K., honey. I know you didn't.\" She now says, \"I did that a lot.\" Turner concedes, \"I wish I didn't apologize as much as I do.\"\n\nOver breakfast at the Charles Hotel, in Cambridge, I asked Turner why he felt so burdened. \"It's the position you're in,\" he said. \"Because I was at CNN, because I had commitments, because I did the Goodwill Games, because I was concerned, because I did all those documentaries, I developed a self-imposed sense of responsibility. If Gandhi and Martin Luther King could make the kind of sacrifices with their lives that they did, and that our parents did fighting in World War I and World War II, why couldn't I make sacrifices, too?\" At that, Turner looked up from his hearty chipped-beef-and-biscuit breakfast, in the middle of the hotel dining room, and, as people at nearby tables leaned forward to listen, he performed from memory parts of Thomas Macaulay's \"Horatius\":\n\nLink copied\n\nAnd how can man die better Than facing fearful odds, For the ashes of his fathers, And the temples of his gods. . . .\n\nHaul down the bridge, Sir Consul With all the speed ye may; I, with two more to help me, Will hold the foe in play. In yon straight path a thousand May well be stopped by three. Now who will stand on either hand, And keep the bridge with me?\n\n\"Pretty cool, huh,\" Turner said, grinning; he had, in the longer version that he recited, got almost every word right. \"If Horatius could do it, I can do it. He saved Rome. . . . He stopped the Etruscans.\" His smile widened, and he couldn't resist a final bow, with a loud \"heh-heh-heh.\" Then he leaned over and whispered, as if to a co-conspirator, \"I know a lot . My knowledge is my burden. If I didn't know so much, I could just go through life as a dilettante.\" He stood up and, watched by everyone in the room, walked briskly to the door.♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "How the Oscars Got Groovy\n\nOn April 14, 1969, Gregory Peck strode across a deserted hall of Los Angeles's Dorothy Chandler Pavilion like a weary cowboy crossing a prairie. He had become the president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences two years earlier, and his job was to introduce the Forty-first Academy Awards. On camera, Peck descended a mirrored staircase in the atrium, looked around, with his thick eyebrows furrowed, and announced in his deep voice, \"It's kind of lonesome out here. The audience is already on the inside.\"\n\nThe most nominated films that year were the splashy studio musicals \"Oliver!\" and \"Funny Girl,\" whose twenty-six-year-old star, Barbra Streisand, showed up to the ceremony in a see-through pants suit. In an effort to make the Oscar broadcast less lugubrious, Peck had hired the stage director Gower Champion. In place of Bob Hope, hosting duties were shared by \"Oscar's best friends,\" among them Ingrid Bergman, Sidney Poitier, Burt Lancaster, and, for the youth market, Jane Fonda, her short hair waved for her role in \"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?\"\n\nWhen Bergman opened the Best Actress envelope , she found a shocker: Streisand had tied with Katharine Hepburn, for \"The Lion in Winter.\" Because Hepburn was absent, Streisand had no chance of being upstaged. She cooed to her statuette, \"Hello, gorgeous!\" \"Oliver!\" won five awards. Several months earlier, the M.P.A.A. had instituted a new ratings system, replacing the old Production Code after three and a half decades. \"Oliver!\" was rated G, designating it as the kind of wholesome studio entertainment that could be enjoyed by \"general audiences,\" whoever those were. But a closer look revealed another Hollywood-and a more unconventional kind of movie-clawing at the gates. \"Rosemary's Baby\" was nominated only for its screenplay, by Roman Polanski, and for the performance of Ruth Gordon, who won Best Supporting Actress. Stanley Kubrick's \" 2001: A Space Odyssey \" had managed four nominations, Best Picture not among them, and won for special effects-the only Oscar that Kubrick would ever receive. And sitting next to Streisand was her estranged husband, the little-known Elliott Gould, wearing the droopy mustache he had grown for Robert Altman's \"M*A*S*H.\"\n\nAfter the awards, congratulations on a smashing show poured into Peck's Academy mailbox  (along with a few complaints that it was \"too far out\"). \"At a time when the morals within movies are being pushed to the outer edges of chaos,\" Vincent Canby wrote in the Times , awards for films such as \"Oliver!\" \"reassure everyone in the industry that all is well, that Hollywood really isn't some giant bordello that's about to be raided.\"\n\nHe spoke too soon. A year later, Gould would be nominated for a movie about wife-swapping, Fonda would hold up a fist on the red carpet, hippie garb would turn the Oscar stage psychedelic, and the winner of the Best Picture award would be rated X.\n\nIf Hollywood had arrived late to the sixties, the Academy arrived even later. \"The Graduate\" and \"Bonnie and Clyde\" made the Best Picture cut in 1968, but both lost to the Sidney Poitier drama \"In the Heat of the Night,\" one of Hollywood's belated acknowledgments of the civil-rights movement. The next year, the thirty-six-year-old Paramount executive Peter Bart watched \"Rosemary's Baby\" lose the adapted-screenplay award to \"The Lion in Winter.\" \"I was by far the youngest person in the audience,\" he said. On the eve of the forty-first awards, the Times mocked the Academy for its byzantine membership procedure, \"a trying ritual that rivals finding a cheap apartment in Manhattan,\" noting that its three-thousand-odd voting body was \"heavily weighted with older people, many of whom are no longer very active in the film business.\" The nominations proved the point. As Variety observed, the \"Over-50 demographic age characteristics of Academy members was brought sharply home with lack of a best picture nomination for '2001,' this year's youth fave.\"\n\nIf anyone could lead the Academy out of obsolescence, reincarnating it like \"2001\" 's Star Child, it would have to be someone who understood what the sex-drugs-and-rock-and-roll generation was looking for. Yet the job had fallen to a square-jawed fifty-three-year-old whom most of America thought of as Dad: Gregory Peck.\n\nPeck had arrived in Hollywood in 1943, a former rower with the clean-cut handsomeness to match. He could be stalwart to the point of being stiff, but, with the war depleting Hollywood of leading men, his robustness had appeal. In the nineteen-forties, he was nominated for Best Actor three years in a row, for \"The Keys of the Kingdom,\" \"The Yearling,\" and \"Gentleman's Agreement,\" which won Best Picture. In the last, he played a Gentile journalist who poses as Jewish to expose antisemitism, a role that chimed with his offscreen liberalism. In 1950, he was nominated a fourth time, for the war drama \"Twelve O'Clock High.\" Onscreen and off, he exemplified the reasonable man who takes a principled stand. But it wasn't until he was forty-six that he found the role that burnished his legend: Atticus Finch, in \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\" From behind round spectacles, Atticus embodied the citizen hero, the gentle father, the fair-minded dissenter. \"In that film,\" Harper Lee said, \"the man and the part met.\"\n\nLee gave Peck a gold watch and chain that had belonged to her late father, the model for Atticus, and he carried it with him to the Academy Awards on April 8, 1963, where he finally won Best Actor . The moral glow of Atticus Finch propelled Peck to a new role as civic figurehead. The next year, he was elected to the Academy's board of governors. Unlike Ronald Reagan, Peck declined to run for political office, instead becoming Hollywood's unofficial mayor-Reagan's liberal shadow. In June, 1967, he was elected Academy president.\n\nPeck's role as Hollywood's liberal ambassador came at a cost to his acting career. In the first month of 1969, Lyndon Johnson awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, calling him a \"humanitarian to whom Americans are deeply indebted.\" Three days later, Vincent Canby panned Peck's new film, \"The Stalking Moon,\" writing, \"Peck is so grave and earnest it seems he must be thinking about his duties on the board of the American Film Institute, rather than on survival.\" Children who were eleven in 1962, when they first saw Peck as Atticus Finch, were now burning their draft cards. They didn't want a father figure; they wanted rebellion.\n\nPeck wasn't blind to the sea change. \"Film turns young people on like nothing else,\" he said in 1968, predicting an \"American New Wave,\" brought on by such directors as Mike Nichols and Francis Ford Coppola. Where Peck belonged in that future was uncertain. Splitting his time between a Brentwood mansion and a house in the South of France, he preferred Trollope to Philip Roth.\n\nPeck entered 1969 pulled in different directions. His son Stephen had received his draft card and joined the Marine Corps. \"He was very patriotic, my dad, even though he was against the war,\" Stephen recalled. \"He stoically said, 'Well, you gotta do what you gotta do.' And off I went.\" In the spring of 1969, Stephen shipped out to Da Nang, where his father sent him boxes of Dickens and Brontë.\n\nAt the Academy, Peck was putting out fires. He had received \"some bruising comments\" about the Oscar telecast, he wrote to a friend, \"especially about Barbra Streisand's derriere.\" The efforts to jazz up the broadcast had failed to halt a ratings slump. As in recent years, when the #OscarsSoWhite scandal cast a harsh light on the Academy's sclerosis, the swiftly changing times were rendering the Oscars irrelevant. Peck had to do something bold to bring the Academy up to date. He had already commissioned a study of the membership rolls, with the idea of demoting administrators and P.R. people to non-voting status. Then he got a nudge from an unlikely source: the twenty-two-year-old starlet Candice Bergen.\n\nIn 1967, Bergen had returned to Los Angeles after nearly two years of jet-setting, making films in France and Greece, going along on pheasant shoots, and liaising with an Austrian count. She had the statuesque beauty of a Nordic deity, with silky blond hair and a tapered nose that ended in elegantly flared nostrils. Her wardrobe was stocked with Dior and Hermès, and her style fell somewhere between Holly Golightly and Princess Grace.\n\nBut the L.A. she came back to was unrecognizable. \"Men in page-boy haircuts preened, ruffled and jeweled, lurching in high-heeled buckled boots, fashionably foppish,\" she wrote in her memoir \" Knock Wood ,\" \"while women's heads were shorn: they were more eyelashes than hair, peering out from under the spiky black thatch shading each eye and trying to look like Twiggy, their patron saint.\" In New York, Bergen had attended Truman Capote's Black and White Ball at the Plaza, wearing a mink bunny mask loaned to her by Halston. As she swanned among the crowd, a Women's Wear Daily reporter asked her: Wasn't it inappropriate to be hobnobbing at a ball while war was raging in Vietnam?\n\n\"Oh, honestly,\" Bergen sniffed in her bunny ears.\n\nBack home in Los Angeles, she prepared for her twenty-first birthday, sending out invitations to \"mourn the passing of my youth\" to guests who included Rosalind Russell and Cary Grant. This was the world she knew: the world of her father, the ventriloquist Edgar Bergen, whose fame had come courtesy of his top-hatted wooden alter ego, Charlie McCarthy. When Candice was born, in 1946, the press called her \"Charlie's sister.\" In her father's office, she would gaze at his special Oscar, awarded in 1938-made of wood, with a movable mouth.\n\nNow that Candy had broken through as a Revlon model and a star of \"The Group,\" the film Sidney Lumet made from the Mary McCarthy novel, her fame eclipsed Edgar's-the \"father of Charlie McCarthy\" was now the \"father of Candice Bergen.\" The sixties had rendered him prehistoric; now Edgar and Charlie were reduced to performing at county fairs. But it wasn't as if Candy were especially up with the times. \"Evidently the Sweet Bird of Youth had passed me by like a Boeing,\" she recalled, \"and I found myself, at twenty-one, peering at the generation gap like a tourist-from the far side.\"\n\nOne night, Bergen went to a party in Benedict Canyon in her Dior lounge pajamas. Inside the house, she smelled burning sandalwood. Janis Joplin's voice blasted from the sound system. The women wore moccasins; the guys were shaggy-haired and festooned in beads and bells. \"People were sitting and passing a joint and listening to the music,\" she told me, \"and I'm there with my crocodile bag and my little kitten heels. It was just, like, where am I?\"\n\nBewildered, Bergen found the host, Terry Melcher. Doris Day's son, Melcher had been Bergen's first love when she was sixteen and he was a college dropout in Italian loafers. Five years later, Melcher wore jeans and an Indian shirt, his hair down to his shoulders. He worked at Columbia Records, which placed him at the center of the California rock scene: he produced the Byrds' \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and played on the Beach Boys' \"Pet Sounds.\" \"You seem so old,\" Melcher told Bergen. \"Don't you miss being a kid?\"\n\nThe two became a couple again. They took motorcycle rides through the mountains, and she tried to fit in with his hippie circle, which included Brian Wilson and John and Michelle Phillips, from the Mamas and the Papas. \"I was beyond straight,\" she recalled. \"No number of robes and beads, no amount of dope was going to change that, though God knows I tried.\" She moved into Melcher's house in Benedict Canyon, where the party had been: 10050 Cielo Drive.\n\nAmong their dinner guests was the self-styled shaman Rolling Thunder, who once asked Bergen if she had any fresh meat for a sacrifice; she gave him chicken legs and ground sirloin from the freezer, and he took them up a mountain and burned them. Bergen was finding her side of the generation gap. By 1968, she was covering the Oregon primaries for Cosmopolitan and expounding to the Los Angeles Times on the Maharishi and \"cosmic consciousness.\" Her Republican father disapproved of Melcher, whose radical politics were rubbing off on his daughter, with her lectures on materialism and vegetarianism. \"One week it's ducks, the next it's Indians!\" her exasperated father would exclaim.\n\nOne day, Melcher came home talking about a commune he'd visited at an old movie ranch, where young women doted on their Christlike leader, singing in the nude. Melcher halfheartedly asked if she wanted to meet them, but she had no interest in Charlie Manson.\n\nIn January, 1969, Melcher abruptly told Bergen that they were moving to his mother's beach house in Malibu. Manson had been dogging Melcher for a record contract, and the producer asked friends not to tell Manson his new address. Soon after they left the Cielo Drive house, Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate moved in.\n\nTerry's stepfather, Martin Melcher, had died nine months earlier; his survivors were shocked to learn that he had embezzled millions from Doris Day, saddling Terry with mountains of financial briefs. Terry leaned on sleeping pills and liquor, and Bergen watched the life drain out of him. Left alone to walk her St. Bernard on the beach, she felt adrift. In April, she watched the Academy Awards and saw that something was missing: people her age. \"The Academy needed new blood,\" she told me. \"It seemed to need blood, period. It skewed way too old.\"\n\nShe was uniquely qualified to act as a bridge-bred by the Old Hollywood but versed in the New. She had crossed paths with Gregory Peck growing up but didn't know him well. Nine days after \"Oliver!\" won Best Picture, Bergen sat down with her stationery pad and wrote in blue cursive:\n\nDear Mr. Peck,\n\nNot being an Academy member, I am most certainly out of place in writing you. I am a film lover and you seem to be the most receptive and constructive of all Academy Presidents.\n\nAmong the rising questions provoked by antiquated Academy rules is that of membership. Many or most members are anachronisms clogging the works of an incredibly facile mechanism called motion pictures.\n\nI would be very grateful if I could help in any way to recruit newer, younger members. Perhaps one way is compiling a list of those whose creativity and energy the Academy never before solicited. And by mailing memberships to those people voted upon jointly by the Academy or its Board of Directors. Application procedures are somewhat lengthy & discouraging.\n\nIn this way the Academy might be more of a vital, social organism improving higher, more honest standards and encouraging new talent.\n\nI know you are concerned with these very same things. I don't mean to be rude, I am simply offering my help and interest if it is needed. (Attested by the fact that I used 3 pieces of good stationery...)\n\nCongratulations to you and Mr. Champion on such an exciting show. You do us proud.\n\nSincerely,\n\nCandice Bergen\n\nTwo days later came a reply on Academy letterhead, along with the closely guarded membership list. \"Why don't you go over it, and then make out a list of young people who should be in the Academy,\" Peck suggested. \"I agree with you that the Academy must break down resistance to new ideas, and indifference to the kinds of films which have meaning today to younger audiences. Since we can't put older members, who in their time made important contributions, out on the icebergs to die, we must do our best to balance things by encouraging all of the qualified younger people to join and exert their influence.\"\n\nEmpowered by her latest crusade, Bergen got to work. Among her recruits was Dennis Hopper, who was about to release a film that would tilt Hollywood on its axis: \"Easy Rider.\" \"He was sort of a brilliant lunatic,\" Bergen recalled. \"Totally unedited and uncensored, just this force of nature, without any impulse control.\" The movie opened at Manhattan's Beekman Theatre on July 14th, as the summer of '69 was under way, and made back its budget in a week. Teens lined up barefoot and smoked so much pot in the men's room that the staff had to remove the stall doors. Life credited Hopper with creating \"the style of a New Hollywood in which producers wear love beads instead of diamond stickpins.\"\n\nLater that month, as the world stopped to watch Neil Armstrong walk on the moon, Bergen was in Eugene, Oregon, shooting \"Getting Straight,\" a comedy about a campus protest. It starred Elliott Gould, as a sardonic teaching assistant; Bergen, as his coed girlfriend; and the twenty-seven-year-old Harrison Ford, as a long-haired art student. The movie was the sort of studio concoction that tried too hard to chase the youth vote, up to its ludicrous last shot of Gould and Bergen getting it on mid-riot. As the cast gathered in a hotel room reeking of pot smoke, Bergen rolled her eyes. \"Candice said, 'While you were all downstairs watching the moon landing, I was upstairs watching 'The Prisoner of Zenda,' \" Gould told me.\n\nSoon after, Bergen returned to Malibu and to Terry Melcher, who had got hooked on Placidyl. Weird things were happening. One morning, they woke to find that the telescope on the veranda was missing. Days later, a friend passed on the message that Manson was looking for Melcher-and if he happened to be missing a telescope, that's because Manson had borrowed it. A week later, Hollywood awoke to absolute horror: Sharon Tate and four others had been murdered in Terry and Candy's old house on Cielo Drive. Bergen panicked. \"It could have been me! \" she wailed to Melcher. \"I could have been killed! \"\n\n\" We could have been killed,\" he corrected her. Bergen moved out.\n\nRumors circulated that the unidentified killers had a movie-star hit list. Los Angeles was upended with fear and speculation. Was it the Black Panthers? A celebrity stalker? Who was next? Throughout Hollywood, people armored their mansions with automatic gates and guard dogs. Gregory Peck hired a night guard in Brentwood.\n\nPeck was summering in France, conducting Academy business through the post. The most pressing matter was his plan to move noncreative members to \"associate\" status, without Oscar-voting privileges.\n\nHe was also brooding about his son Stephen, in Vietnam. \"He spent a year in almost terror of the Western Union,\" Peck's younger son Carey, who, at the time, was starting at Georgetown's School of Foreign Service, recalled. During his first semester, Carey was arrested twice for civil disobedience. His father's agent chided him for exposing Peck to potential scandal. But Peck told his son, \"These days, if you don't have an arrest record, you're not young and alive and standing on the right side of things.\"\n\nBergen was in Mexico making a new film, \"Soldier Blue,\" when Terry Melcher told her on the phone that Manson had been arrested in connection with the Tate killings. (Manson later invited Dennis Hopper to see him in prison, hoping that he would play him in a movie.) She received a subpoena but arranged to testify in private. She sat in the back of the courtroom when Tex Watson, one of the accused, was brought out. She was asked if she recognized him, but she didn't. Hippies all looked alike to her.\n\nBergen had bought her own place, called the Aviary, on the old John Barrymore estate. Having once housed exotic birds and, later, Katharine Hepburn, it was an impractical but romantic dwelling: a Mediterranean tower amid cypress trees, with stained-glass windows and moldy murals that reminded Bergen of the \"Arabian Nights\" tales. She had a horse named Herschel and spent her days practicing photography and contemplating ecological causes. But, after the Manson murders, everything seemed darker. \"I remember John Phillips came over to visit once, with Quincy Jones, and left me a gun,\" she told me. \"I said, 'Why are you giving this to me?' \"\n\nBergen had kept up her end of the bargain with Peck, cajoling Hopper and other friends to join the Academy. Her father and Peck had co-sponsored her own membership, and she sponsored her flock in turn. In the fall of 1969, she wrote a letter to the Academy president, telling him that she'd filled out the forms he'd sent for nine of her friends. \"All of them are people who are a vital and creative part of our industry (perhaps the only vital and creative part of the industry).\" But each of them needed a co-sponsor: would he oblige?\n\nBy then, Peck was in Tennessee shooting \"I Walk the Line,\" in which he was miscast as a married small-town sheriff who has an affair with a mysterious young hillbilly. From the Holiday Inn in Cookeville, he kept up on Academy affairs. ABC was \"adamant\" that Bob Hope be invited back to host the Oscars, but Peck was keen to draw in the New Hollywood set. The Academy's executive director, Margaret Herrick, wrote to him about the sponsorship cards he'd sent in, many with Bergen's help. \"Warren Beatty and Katharine Ross have been members since 1968; Julie Christie was invited in 1967 and never responded; Dustin Hoffman was invited in 1968 and never responded, but Jack Nicholson, [Elliott] Gould, Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper and Robert [Forster, the star of \"Medium Cool\"] should definitely be invited before the end of this year as they are certainly more than eligible.\"\n\nThe indifference of such young talents as Julie Christie and Dustin Hoffman was bad news. Peck sent them personal appeals, writing, \"I urge you to accept membership in the Academy when it is offered to you, as it will be in December. It is not your dues we are interested in. We do want your point of view reflected in the annual voting for awards.\" He assured them that even a single vote could change the outcome: \"Witness last year's tie vote between Katharine Hepburn & Barbra Streisand.\"\n\nThe drawbridge was lowering, and fast. Peck had something even bolder in mind. Over the winter, the Board of Governors finalized a radical new plan: anyone who had not been active in the movie industry for seven years would be made an \"associate\" member, without an Oscar vote-in other words, put \"out on the icebergs to die.\" Secret lists were drawn up; lawyers were consulted. The board agreed that the purge would be kept under wraps until after the Forty-second Academy Awards.\n\nDennis Hopper forgot all about the Academy Awards ceremony, until someone reminded him to show up. \"Easy Rider\" had been nominated for its screenplay and for its supporting actor Jack Nicholson's performance. On April 7, 1970, Hopper arrived in a velvet tux, cowboy boots, and a Stetson. Jane Fonda, wearing her \"Klute\" shag, held up a fist to the roaring fans and yelled, \"Right on!\" Her political opposite, John Wayne, also received a swell of cheers, although one person held up a sign reading, \" JOHN WAYNE IS A RACIST .\" Down the street, some fifty people demonstrated against Hollywood's stereotypical depiction of Latinos in movies like \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\" with placards reading, \"Power to the Chicanos!\"\n\nIn the Best Picture race, \"Butch Cassidy\" was up against the musical extravaganza \"Hello, Dolly!\" and the period melodrama \"Anne of the Thousand Days.\" Another nominee was John Schlesinger's \" Midnight Cowboy ,\" starring Jon Voight as a Texan who goes to Manhattan to be a gigolo but winds up servicing men, while befriending a consumptive con man called Ratso Rizzo, played by Dustin Hoffman. United Artists had actually pushed the ratings board to give it an X rating, which would equal cachet with the hippie crowd.\n\nWhen the curtains opened, Gregory Peck walked onstage and struck a philosophical tone . \"Most of us these days are asking ourselves and each other these questions: What is the meaning of the new freedom of the screen? Is it something to be feared? Should the screen be censored?\" Bob Hope, who had been invited to give his usual monologue, said a hammier version of the same. \"It's such a novelty seeing actors and actresses with their clothes on,\" he joked, after coming onstage wearing a \"True Grit\" eye patch. Summing up the new epoch of sex, drugs, and violence, Hope said, \"This is not an Academy Awards. It's a freak-out, ladies and gentlemen.\"\n\nSo it was. The audience was the generation gap made visible: Vincente Minnelli, Frank Sinatra, and Cary Grant on one side, Jane Fonda, Jack Nicholson, and Dennis Hopper on the other. \"These X-rated movies are really something,\" Hope continued. \"One theatre manager told me he's been popping corn for six months and still hasn't plugged the machine in.\" The audience laughed, with some groans. \"You could feel there was a kind of buzz when Bob Hope would host anything, because he was the conservative,\" Candice Bergen told me. \"And so it was very much us against them.\"\n\nBergen, one of the recurring presenters (\"Oscar's best friends\") wore a sequinned purple shawl with gold fringe, loaned by her friend Arnold Scaasi. She and Gould handed out the first award, Best Sound, which was won by \"Hello, Dolly!\" Gould, nominated for \"Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice,\" was surprised to find himself seated near John Wayne and his wife. When Wayne was called backstage, he turned to Gould and said, \"When I go up there, you look after her.\" It was unclear whether he knew that he was talking to the guy from the wife-swapping movie.\n\nPresenting Best Cinematography to \"Butch Cassidy,\" Wayne marked his turf in the culture war, grumbling, \"I'm John Wayne, an American movie actor. I work with my clothes on.\" Like Hope, Wayne was pro-Vietnam and was despised by the hipper members of the audience.\n\nEach award was a shot across the battle line between the two Hollywoods. The writers of \"Easy Rider\" and \"Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice\" lost to William Goldman, for \"Butch Cassidy.\" Streisand, in a pink pillbox hat, came out to present Best Actor. Both \"Midnight Cowboy\" actors lost to John Wayne.\n\nMidway through, Hope came out with Fred Astaire. \"You've never danced in the Academy show, huh?\" Hope said. The orchestra played a funky riff , and Astaire, who was born in 1899, began jerking his seventy-year-old frame to an unmistakably seventies sound. He swayed, he twirled-an old man matching his rhythm to an unfamiliar beat. Then the conductor swung into a big-band tune, and Astaire broke into an exuberant tap routine, dancing away the decades, lighter than air. It was a dance to ward off mortality, to reawaken the schmaltzy Hollywood that was falling into the sea. Later in the night, Jon Voight was crossing backstage when he saw Astaire coming toward him.\n\n\"We reached each other in the middle of this thing, me six foot two or three and Fred, slight of figure, shorter,\" Voight later recalled. \"And he looked up and said, 'Oh, Jon! Hi. Let me stand aside.' I said, 'No, no, please-let me stand aside for you.' . . . That was the meeting of the two generations in the appropriate way, with tremendous regard for each other.\"\n\nFinally, Elizabeth Taylor came out to present Best Picture. The winner was \"Midnight Cowboy.\"\n\nThe counterculture had won. \" 'Midnight Cowboy' was a total 'fuck you' to every way that the town was doing business,\" Paramount's Peter Bart said. \"An X picture was acceptable by the Academy. Would that mean that we all should get into the porn business? It was a serious discussion inside closed doors.\"\n\nAt the end of the night, Bob Hope delivered a farewell that was more like an elegy, or perhaps a white flag of surrender:\n\nNever again will Hollywood be accused of showing a lollipop world. Perhaps by showing the nitty-gritty, by giving the world a glimpse of the element of violence and its destructive effect, it will help cool it. Whatever violence the screen has shown is not an example to follow but to see in its full destructive power. The troubled, kooky characters that people the screens are not examples to emulate but to learn from and try to understand and hopefully, perhaps, contrive help for. More and more films have explored the broad spectrum of human experience. They have fearlessly, and for the most part with excellent taste, examined behavior long considered taboo.\n\nElizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton hosted a losers' after-party at the Beverly Hills Hotel, where Taylor gave one of her diamonds to Gould and Rupert Crosse-the first Black actor nominated for Best Supporting Actor, for \"The Reivers\"-and let them toss it around like a ball. \"It was the size of the Statue of Liberty,\" Gould told me. If there was a baton to be passed, this was it.\n\nHollywood's warring generations scraped uneasily into the night. John Wayne, Oscar in hand, caught up on his drinking at the Polo Lounge. At one point, his \"True Grit\" co-star Dennis Hopper approached. Hopper recalled, \"He took one look at me and called me a Communist. Then he asked me to come out on his yacht-it's actually a minesweeper-and he'd explain to me why he's worth a million per picture.\" At the Governors Ball, the official Academy after-party, Frances Bergen expressed her and Edgar's disapproval of their daughter Candy's psychedelic smock. \"She didn't have to agree to be a presenter,\" Mrs. Bergen huffed. \"But, once she did, she should have conformed and worn something elegant.\"\n\nFour days after the Oscars, the Academy announced that it had \"revised and democratized\" its rolls by reclassifying three hundred and thirty-five of its members as non-voting \"associates.\" As one headline put it, \"Stodgy Old Oscar Gets a Facelift.\" Ironically, many in the same voting body that had just awarded \"Midnight Cowboy\" Best Picture were being told that they were obsolete.\n\nPeck set up a committee to review grievances, which poured in. There was the \"distressed\" former M-G-M producer who did \"not understand what is to be gained by tossing others to the crocodiles.\" (He was reinstated.) There was the producer of \"Bud Abbott and Lou Costello in Hollywood,\" who blasted the Academy's \"prejudice or favoritism.\" (His appeal was denied.)\n\nPeck wrote gracious but firm replies, took phone calls, had meetings. After the flurry of complaints, the Academy reversed only thirteen decisions. In \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" Atticus Finch exemplifies the idea of courage as taking an unpopular stand. The Peck purge of 1970 may or may not have been courageous, but it was definitely unpopular. And by putting the survivors of Hollywood's golden age out to pasture, Peck was hastening the demise of the Hollywood that had created him, the only one in which he made sense.\n\nNearly half a century later, the Academy took similar measures after the #OscarsSoWhite outcry, bringing in hundreds of diverse new members, including Idris Elba, America Ferrera, and Ice Cube, while demoting inactive members to non-voting \"emeritus status.\" Responding to blowback from old-timers that echoed the angry letters sent to Peck, the Academy's first Black president, Cheryl Boone Isaacs, pointed to the Peck purge as a precedent. \"In the '60s and '70s it was about recruiting younger members to stay vital and relevant,\" she wrote to the membership. \"In 2016, the mandate is inclusion in all of its facets: gender, race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation.\"\n\nCandice Bergen had finally found a role that excited her, in Mike Nichols's \"Carnal Knowledge,\" opposite Nicholson. From her bedroom at the Aviary, she could spy with her telescope on the house across the canyon, where girls sunbathed topless around the pool. Bert Schneider, a producer of \"Easy Rider,\" had just moved in. He intrigued her, as did his pedigree: a child of Old Hollywood who had helped forge the New, just like her. They had met in passing, first at a première and then at the Columbia canteen.\n\nSchneider was becoming less interested in making movies and more interested in revolutionary politics. In one heady weekend, he introduced Bergen to Joan Baez, the guru Baba Ram Dass, and Huey Newton, the Black Panthers' \"minister of defense.\" Her parents were even more appalled by her new boyfriend than they had been by Terry Melcher. When Schneider implored Mrs. Bergen to \"go with the flow,\" she snapped, \"No.\"\n\nSchneider isolated Bergen from her old friends. The couple housed Abbie Hoffman when he was on the run, and they hosted Hopper when he was in from Taos, zonked. In Washington, D.C., they joined an antiwar demonstration, lying down in the Senate chamber and getting arrested. By 1972, Bergen was crossing the country campaigning for George McGovern while her father stumped for Nixon, baffled that she would throw away her inheritance on some socialist tax rate.\n\nThat same year, Schneider arranged for Charlie Chaplin to return to America with his wife Oona to receive an honorary Oscar-his first time in the country since he had been effectively exiled during the Red Scare two decades earlier. Bergen photographed the honoree for the cover of Life , and the couple accompanied the Chaplins to the Oscar ceremony, where Bergen watched Chaplin bound offstage, beaming like a schoolboy, so emotional that he misplaced his statuette.\n\nThree years later, Schneider made his own splash on the Oscar stage when his antiwar film \"Hearts and Minds\" won Best Documentary Feature. \"It is ironic that we are here at a time just before Vietnam is about to be liberated,\" he said in his speech , then read a telegram from the Vietcong expressing \"greetings of friendship to all the American people.\" Backstage, the appalled Bob Hope scrawled a statement on behalf of the Academy and handed it to Frank Sinatra to read onstage, disowning \"any political references made on the program.\"\n\nBut the days of the apolitical Oscars were over. And so were Schneider and Bergen-a casualty of Bergen's yearning for independence and Schneider's belief that monogamy was a \"bourgeois concept.\"\n\nIn June, 1970, Gregory Peck declined to run for another term as Academy president. His tenure had been transformative, even if his entreaties to the New Hollywood cohort didn't always stick. \"The Academy is only two or three years behind the critics,\" he said backstage at the 1971 ceremony, adding, \"I tried to get the young people involved in the Academy, but it's impossible to reach them.\" Hopper and Peter Fonda belong to the Academy, he said, \"but they wouldn't get involved.\" Hopper's Academy membership lapsed in 1972, owing to nonpayment of dues.\n\nPeck's next film was \"Shoot Out,\" another disappointing Western. Peck reflected, \"It was humiliating to work in mediocre films-not that I ever felt a lowering of self-esteem, but it was embarrassing to know that people who had liked my earlier work weren't enjoying my latest movies.\" It would take five more years for New Hollywood to find a role for him, in \"The Omen.\"\n\nHis son Stephen returned from Vietnam the spring that \"Midnight Cowboy\" won. \"I was pretty shut down,\" Stephen said. Two of his buddies had been killed by artillery ten feet from him. His father tried to draw him out, with little success.\n\nSoon after Stephen came home, Peck optioned a play called \"The Trial of the Catonsville Nine,\" about a group of activists who burned three hundred and seventy-eight draft files in the parking lot of a Maryland draft-board office and were sentenced to multi-year prison terms. He secured a quarter million dollars to film it.\n\nThe movie was praised at Cannes but did little business back home. Peck joked, \"All things considered, it may have shortened the war by about fifteen minutes.\" The movie didn't win him an Oscar, but he received a different sort of honor: when Nixon's enemies list was made public, in 1973, the name \"Gregory Peck\" was on it.

      "text": "In \"Be Pretty and Shut Up!,\" Actresses Challenge the Male-Run Movie Business\n\nIt takes nothing away from the genius of Alison Bechdel to note that a version of her famous Bechdel test was proposed in the nineteen-seventies by Delphine Seyrig, the great French actress and activist, in Seyrig's documentary feature \"Be Pretty and Shut Up!\" In that prescient and powerful film, Seyrig interviews twenty-two actresses-including Jane Fonda, Jill Clayburgh, Ellen Burstyn, and Maria Schneider-about their experiences as actresses in film industries dominated by men. (The film, long unavailable, is now streaming on MUBI .) To many of her subjects, Seyrig poses the same crucial question: Have they ever acted in a movie in which they've shared a \"warm\" relationship (or some version thereof) with another female character?\n\nWhereas Bechdel approaches movies from the perspective of moviegoers, Seyrig confronts them as a filmmaker. In \"Be Pretty and Shut Up!,\" Seyrig-who started her film career in the American independent film \"Pull My Daisy\"and starred in some of the most daring films of her time, including Chantal Akerman's history-making \" Jeanne Dielman \"-offers a radical view of the cinema that's voiced by its participants and matched by her audaciously pure method and reserved style. There's no inherent merit in such austerity; rather, the film's originality derives from Seyrig's imaginative expansion of it. She crafts an austerity that's anything but bare, relying on simple means and plain forms to deliver mighty torrents of ideas and experiences. \"Be Pretty and Shut Up!\" is an interview film-it contains nothing but interviews, almost exclusively ones that Seyrig herself conducts and that the cinematographer Carole Roussopoulos, also a key feminist filmmaker, films. (The sole exception is a clip of an interview with Shirley MacLaine by the talk-show host Michel Drucker, from French television.) The interviews, filmed in Hollywood in 1975 and in Paris in 1976, show the actresses in medium closeup, with no reverse shots of Seyrig, no B-roll of décor or locations, no clips from films, and, most of all, almost no editing within the interview segments. (The participants are identified in a strikingly low-tech way, by means of still photographs placed in front of the camera, by hand, at the start of the film-there are no texts superimposed over the interviews, and the end credits are merely handwritten.)\n\nSeyrig (working with the editors Joanna Wieder and Roussopoulos) selects continuous chunks of discussion, sometimes on the briefer side and sometimes several minutes long, which grant the actors intimate spans of time in which to develop their ideas and express them freely. The prime subject of \"Be Pretty and Shut Up!\" is the very idea of being a female movie actor at a time when the field was dominated by men behind the camera, in boardrooms, and-therefore-also onscreen. The first seven of the movie's sixty interview segments are all focussed on the intersection of the participants' professional lives and personal desires-whether, if they'd been male, they'd have become movie actors. Speakers such as Clayburgh, Millie Perkins, and Juliet Berto describe the many other opportunities available to men (and not so much to women) outside of movies, their long-frustrated goals to direct films instead of act in them, and what Clayburgh calls the \"masochism\" of being an actress, the dependence on the cinema's \"external daddy.\"\n\nJane Fonda-speaking in French-then quickly shifts the terrain away from the psychological price of movie acting to the physical price of stardom, as she experienced it as a teen-age neophyte in the waning days of Hollywood's studio system. (The movie is subtitled in English; its many English-speaking actors are accompanied by a simultaneous French translation, by Toby Gilbert, which somewhat drowns out their voices on the soundtrack.) Fonda says that the group of makeup men who surrounded her \"like surgeons\" transformed her appearance to render her virtually unrecognizable to herself, and that one of them wanted to have her jaw broken in order to hollow out her cheeks. The director Joshua Logan-who was also her godfather-said, \"You'll never play in a tragedy, because a nose like that cannot be taken seriously!\" The studio mogul Jack Warner demanded that she wear fake breasts to make hers look larger. (And for a decade she did, she says, along with the makeup and bleached-blond hair and eyebrows.) The result, as she puts it, is that \"I, Jane Fonda, was here and this image was there, and there was this alienation between the two.\"\n\nThis alienation from one's own appearance is a feeling many other actresses in the documentary describe, in regard to the roles that they got cast to play. For Perkins, it was wives. For the Canadian actress Luce Guilbeault, it was \"prostitutes or alcoholics, wasted women, abandoned women\"-and, when she wanted to infuse one of those characters with the practical details of their own ways of life, male producers shot the idea down in favor of her playing the \"dirty women\" that they said men liked. Patti D'Arbanville was being offered roles playing sixteen-year-olds when she was twenty-four. (\"You just want to strangle somebody,\" she says.) Maidie Norman, the only Black actress interviewed by Seyrig, says that, earlier in her career, she played \"many, many maids,\" and that there was little more for Black actresses to do \"unless you were very Black and could play a slave.\" Since then, she says, there has been \"an evolution\" in Black women's roles, which have come to include nurses, social workers, and mothers. However, she had nothing against playing maids, she adds, because there were Black women working as maids in real life-the problem was one of inadequate development of the characters.\n\nMacLaine, in her television appearance, offers a remarkable theory regarding the declining substance of actresses' roles. In the age of the censorious Hays Code, Hollywood made so-called women's pictures, in which women often played politicians and businesspeople-precisely because, MacLaine says, \"with scenes in the bedroom, you couldn't really see much. They therefore wrote parts for women outside the bedroom.\" When the code was jettisoned, the imaginations of male producers, directors, and screenwriters were finally freed up-and \"the fantasies they want to see are the women in the bedroom. The freedom from censorship backfired. Women were back in the bedroom and they never got out.\" Delia Salvi adds, in her interview with Seyrig, that \"cinema is one enormous masculine phantasm.\"\n\nCandy Clark and many other participants cite the ageism that actresses endure in Hollywood. Others, such as Schneider, address the age gap between female and male leads: her co-star in \"The Passenger,\" Jack Nicholson, was thirty-seven, and she was twenty-three-and, in \"Last Tango in Paris,\" the gap between her and Marlon Brando was even greater. (She also says that she was shut out of the creative process on which Brando and the film's director, Bernardo Bertolucci, were full collaborators.) Salvi cites the distressing case of the screenwriter Eleanor Perry, who had long collaborated with her husband, Frank, who directed. After their divorce, she found herself in virtual exile from the industry.\n\nWhat dominates the film, though, is Seyrig's curiously, urgently, and cannily insistent questioning of the actresses' \"warm relationships\" onscreen with other female characters. Few, of course, have experienced such a thing, and the deftly associative editing of the actresses' discussions reveals why this matters; the absence of films that show women's relationships with one another is no trivial omission but, rather, speaks to the cinema's crucial failing. Warm relationships with women-including with other actresses-are the very stuff of many of the participants' real lives, as they tell Seyrig. Their most damning indictment of the male-dominated world of movies is simply that it doesn't reflect their experiences, their personal, off-camera realities.\n\nMarie Dubois, the star of François Truffaut's second feature, \"Shoot the Piano Player,\" says that he and other men had recently told her that, in the age of feminist activism, \"women end up scaring them. They no longer understand women\"-if they ever really did-and \"no longer know how to write for them. Truffaut agrees. He said that women really have to take their destinies in their own hands.\" As Dubois puts it, \"One must be an auteur.\" Because men write, produce, and direct movies according to their fantasies, it would take a cinema made by women-including in the production crew, as several participants mention-to bring about changes in the work experience of actresses and in the movies in which they appear. In anticipation of such a cinema, Seyrig, with her concentrated methods and her empathetic perspective, turns her documentary into a performance space of sorts, in which female actors do more than merely give voice to their ideas-they visibly become, onscreen, in real time, who they already are. In its spare, investigative format, the film points ahead to an alternative cinema, a new kind of women's pictures, in which documentary and fiction, public images and private lives, fuse both psychologically and aesthetically.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "How the Oscars Got Groovy\n\nOn April 14, 1969, Gregory Peck strode across a deserted hall of Los Angeles's Dorothy Chandler Pavilion like a weary cowboy crossing a prairie. He had become the president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences two years earlier, and his job was to introduce the Forty-first Academy Awards. On camera, Peck descended a mirrored staircase in the atrium, looked around, with his thick eyebrows furrowed, and announced in his deep voice, \"It's kind of lonesome out here. The audience is already on the inside.\"\n\nThe most nominated films that year were the splashy studio musicals \"Oliver!\" and \"Funny Girl,\" whose twenty-six-year-old star, Barbra Streisand, showed up to the ceremony in a see-through pants suit. In an effort to make the Oscar broadcast less lugubrious, Peck had hired the stage director Gower Champion. In place of Bob Hope, hosting duties were shared by \"Oscar's best friends,\" among them Ingrid Bergman, Sidney Poitier, Burt Lancaster, and, for the youth market, Jane Fonda, her short hair waved for her role in \"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?\"\n\nWhen Bergman opened the Best Actress envelope , she found a shocker: Streisand had tied with Katharine Hepburn, for \"The Lion in Winter.\" Because Hepburn was absent, Streisand had no chance of being upstaged. She cooed to her statuette, \"Hello, gorgeous!\" \"Oliver!\" won five awards. Several months earlier, the M.P.A.A. had instituted a new ratings system, replacing the old Production Code after three and a half decades. \"Oliver!\" was rated G, designating it as the kind of wholesome studio entertainment that could be enjoyed by \"general audiences,\" whoever those were. But a closer look revealed another Hollywood-and a more unconventional kind of movie-clawing at the gates. \"Rosemary's Baby\" was nominated only for its screenplay, by Roman Polanski, and for the performance of Ruth Gordon, who won Best Supporting Actress. Stanley Kubrick's \" 2001: A Space Odyssey \" had managed four nominations, Best Picture not among them, and won for special effects-the only Oscar that Kubrick would ever receive. And sitting next to Streisand was her estranged husband, the little-known Elliott Gould, wearing the droopy mustache he had grown for Robert Altman's \"M*A*S*H.\"\n\nAfter the awards, congratulations on a smashing show poured into Peck's Academy mailbox  (along with a few complaints that it was \"too far out\"). \"At a time when the morals within movies are being pushed to the outer edges of chaos,\" Vincent Canby wrote in the Times , awards for films such as \"Oliver!\" \"reassure everyone in the industry that all is well, that Hollywood really isn't some giant bordello that's about to be raided.\"\n\nHe spoke too soon. A year later, Gould would be nominated for a movie about wife-swapping, Fonda would hold up a fist on the red carpet, hippie garb would turn the Oscar stage psychedelic, and the winner of the Best Picture award would be rated X.\n\nIf Hollywood had arrived late to the sixties, the Academy arrived even later. \"The Graduate\" and \"Bonnie and Clyde\" made the Best Picture cut in 1968, but both lost to the Sidney Poitier drama \"In the Heat of the Night,\" one of Hollywood's belated acknowledgments of the civil-rights movement. The next year, the thirty-six-year-old Paramount executive Peter Bart watched \"Rosemary's Baby\" lose the adapted-screenplay award to \"The Lion in Winter.\" \"I was by far the youngest person in the audience,\" he said. On the eve of the forty-first awards, the Times mocked the Academy for its byzantine membership procedure, \"a trying ritual that rivals finding a cheap apartment in Manhattan,\" noting that its three-thousand-odd voting body was \"heavily weighted with older people, many of whom are no longer very active in the film business.\" The nominations proved the point. As Variety observed, the \"Over-50 demographic age characteristics of Academy members was brought sharply home with lack of a best picture nomination for '2001,' this year's youth fave.\"\n\nIf anyone could lead the Academy out of obsolescence, reincarnating it like \"2001\" 's Star Child, it would have to be someone who understood what the sex-drugs-and-rock-and-roll generation was looking for. Yet the job had fallen to a square-jawed fifty-three-year-old whom most of America thought of as Dad: Gregory Peck.\n\nPeck had arrived in Hollywood in 1943, a former rower with the clean-cut handsomeness to match. He could be stalwart to the point of being stiff, but, with the war depleting Hollywood of leading men, his robustness had appeal. In the nineteen-forties, he was nominated for Best Actor three years in a row, for \"The Keys of the Kingdom,\" \"The Yearling,\" and \"Gentleman's Agreement,\" which won Best Picture. In the last, he played a Gentile journalist who poses as Jewish to expose antisemitism, a role that chimed with his offscreen liberalism. In 1950, he was nominated a fourth time, for the war drama \"Twelve O'Clock High.\" Onscreen and off, he exemplified the reasonable man who takes a principled stand. But it wasn't until he was forty-six that he found the role that burnished his legend: Atticus Finch, in \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\" From behind round spectacles, Atticus embodied the citizen hero, the gentle father, the fair-minded dissenter. \"In that film,\" Harper Lee said, \"the man and the part met.\"\n\nLee gave Peck a gold watch and chain that had belonged to her late father, the model for Atticus, and he carried it with him to the Academy Awards on April 8, 1963, where he finally won Best Actor . The moral glow of Atticus Finch propelled Peck to a new role as civic figurehead. The next year, he was elected to the Academy's board of governors. Unlike Ronald Reagan, Peck declined to run for political office, instead becoming Hollywood's unofficial mayor-Reagan's liberal shadow. In June, 1967, he was elected Academy president.\n\nPeck's role as Hollywood's liberal ambassador came at a cost to his acting career. In the first month of 1969, Lyndon Johnson awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, calling him a \"humanitarian to whom Americans are deeply indebted.\" Three days later, Vincent Canby panned Peck's new film, \"The Stalking Moon,\" writing, \"Peck is so grave and earnest it seems he must be thinking about his duties on the board of the American Film Institute, rather than on survival.\" Children who were eleven in 1962, when they first saw Peck as Atticus Finch, were now burning their draft cards. They didn't want a father figure; they wanted rebellion.\n\nPeck wasn't blind to the sea change. \"Film turns young people on like nothing else,\" he said in 1968, predicting an \"American New Wave,\" brought on by such directors as Mike Nichols and Francis Ford Coppola. Where Peck belonged in that future was uncertain. Splitting his time between a Brentwood mansion and a house in the South of France, he preferred Trollope to Philip Roth.\n\nPeck entered 1969 pulled in different directions. His son Stephen had received his draft card and joined the Marine Corps. \"He was very patriotic, my dad, even though he was against the war,\" Stephen recalled. \"He stoically said, 'Well, you gotta do what you gotta do.' And off I went.\" In the spring of 1969, Stephen shipped out to Da Nang, where his father sent him boxes of Dickens and Brontë.\n\nAt the Academy, Peck was putting out fires. He had received \"some bruising comments\" about the Oscar telecast, he wrote to a friend, \"especially about Barbra Streisand's derriere.\" The efforts to jazz up the broadcast had failed to halt a ratings slump. As in recent years, when the #OscarsSoWhite scandal cast a harsh light on the Academy's sclerosis, the swiftly changing times were rendering the Oscars irrelevant. Peck had to do something bold to bring the Academy up to date. He had already commissioned a study of the membership rolls, with the idea of demoting administrators and P.R. people to non-voting status. Then he got a nudge from an unlikely source: the twenty-two-year-old starlet Candice Bergen.\n\nIn 1967, Bergen had returned to Los Angeles after nearly two years of jet-setting, making films in France and Greece, going along on pheasant shoots, and liaising with an Austrian count. She had the statuesque beauty of a Nordic deity, with silky blond hair and a tapered nose that ended in elegantly flared nostrils. Her wardrobe was stocked with Dior and Hermès, and her style fell somewhere between Holly Golightly and Princess Grace.\n\nBut the L.A. she came back to was unrecognizable. \"Men in page-boy haircuts preened, ruffled and jeweled, lurching in high-heeled buckled boots, fashionably foppish,\" she wrote in her memoir \" Knock Wood ,\" \"while women's heads were shorn: they were more eyelashes than hair, peering out from under the spiky black thatch shading each eye and trying to look like Twiggy, their patron saint.\" In New York, Bergen had attended Truman Capote's Black and White Ball at the Plaza, wearing a mink bunny mask loaned to her by Halston. As she swanned among the crowd, a Women's Wear Daily reporter asked her: Wasn't it inappropriate to be hobnobbing at a ball while war was raging in Vietnam?\n\n\"Oh, honestly,\" Bergen sniffed in her bunny ears.\n\nBack home in Los Angeles, she prepared for her twenty-first birthday, sending out invitations to \"mourn the passing of my youth\" to guests who included Rosalind Russell and Cary Grant. This was the world she knew: the world of her father, the ventriloquist Edgar Bergen, whose fame had come courtesy of his top-hatted wooden alter ego, Charlie McCarthy. When Candice was born, in 1946, the press called her \"Charlie's sister.\" In her father's office, she would gaze at his special Oscar, awarded in 1938-made of wood, with a movable mouth.\n\nNow that Candy had broken through as a Revlon model and a star of \"The Group,\" the film Sidney Lumet made from the Mary McCarthy novel, her fame eclipsed Edgar's-the \"father of Charlie McCarthy\" was now the \"father of Candice Bergen.\" The sixties had rendered him prehistoric; now Edgar and Charlie were reduced to performing at county fairs. But it wasn't as if Candy were especially up with the times. \"Evidently the Sweet Bird of Youth had passed me by like a Boeing,\" she recalled, \"and I found myself, at twenty-one, peering at the generation gap like a tourist-from the far side.\"\n\nOne night, Bergen went to a party in Benedict Canyon in her Dior lounge pajamas. Inside the house, she smelled burning sandalwood. Janis Joplin's voice blasted from the sound system. The women wore moccasins; the guys were shaggy-haired and festooned in beads and bells. \"People were sitting and passing a joint and listening to the music,\" she told me, \"and I'm there with my crocodile bag and my little kitten heels. It was just, like, where am I?\"\n\nBewildered, Bergen found the host, Terry Melcher. Doris Day's son, Melcher had been Bergen's first love when she was sixteen and he was a college dropout in Italian loafers. Five years later, Melcher wore jeans and an Indian shirt, his hair down to his shoulders. He worked at Columbia Records, which placed him at the center of the California rock scene: he produced the Byrds' \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and played on the Beach Boys' \"Pet Sounds.\" \"You seem so old,\" Melcher told Bergen. \"Don't you miss being a kid?\"\n\nThe two became a couple again. They took motorcycle rides through the mountains, and she tried to fit in with his hippie circle, which included Brian Wilson and John and Michelle Phillips, from the Mamas and the Papas. \"I was beyond straight,\" she recalled. \"No number of robes and beads, no amount of dope was going to change that, though God knows I tried.\" She moved into Melcher's house in Benedict Canyon, where the party had been: 10050 Cielo Drive.\n\nAmong their dinner guests was the self-styled shaman Rolling Thunder, who once asked Bergen if she had any fresh meat for a sacrifice; she gave him chicken legs and ground sirloin from the freezer, and he took them up a mountain and burned them. Bergen was finding her side of the generation gap. By 1968, she was covering the Oregon primaries for Cosmopolitan and expounding to the Los Angeles Times on the Maharishi and \"cosmic consciousness.\" Her Republican father disapproved of Melcher, whose radical politics were rubbing off on his daughter, with her lectures on materialism and vegetarianism. \"One week it's ducks, the next it's Indians!\" her exasperated father would exclaim.\n\nOne day, Melcher came home talking about a commune he'd visited at an old movie ranch, where young women doted on their Christlike leader, singing in the nude. Melcher halfheartedly asked if she wanted to meet them, but she had no interest in Charlie Manson.\n\nIn January, 1969, Melcher abruptly told Bergen that they were moving to his mother's beach house in Malibu. Manson had been dogging Melcher for a record contract, and the producer asked friends not to tell Manson his new address. Soon after they left the Cielo Drive house, Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate moved in.\n\nTerry's stepfather, Martin Melcher, had died nine months earlier; his survivors were shocked to learn that he had embezzled millions from Doris Day, saddling Terry with mountains of financial briefs. Terry leaned on sleeping pills and liquor, and Bergen watched the life drain out of him. Left alone to walk her St. Bernard on the beach, she felt adrift. In April, she watched the Academy Awards and saw that something was missing: people her age. \"The Academy needed new blood,\" she told me. \"It seemed to need blood, period. It skewed way too old.\"\n\nShe was uniquely qualified to act as a bridge-bred by the Old Hollywood but versed in the New. She had crossed paths with Gregory Peck growing up but didn't know him well. Nine days after \"Oliver!\" won Best Picture, Bergen sat down with her stationery pad and wrote in blue cursive:\n\nDear Mr. Peck,\n\nNot being an Academy member, I am most certainly out of place in writing you. I am a film lover and you seem to be the most receptive and constructive of all Academy Presidents.\n\nAmong the rising questions provoked by antiquated Academy rules is that of membership. Many or most members are anachronisms clogging the works of an incredibly facile mechanism called motion pictures.\n\nI would be very grateful if I could help in any way to recruit newer, younger members. Perhaps one way is compiling a list of those whose creativity and energy the Academy never before solicited. And by mailing memberships to those people voted upon jointly by the Academy or its Board of Directors. Application procedures are somewhat lengthy & discouraging.\n\nIn this way the Academy might be more of a vital, social organism improving higher, more honest standards and encouraging new talent.\n\nI know you are concerned with these very same things. I don't mean to be rude, I am simply offering my help and interest if it is needed. (Attested by the fact that I used 3 pieces of good stationery...)\n\nCongratulations to you and Mr. Champion on such an exciting show. You do us proud.\n\nSincerely,\n\nCandice Bergen\n\nTwo days later came a reply on Academy letterhead, along with the closely guarded membership list. \"Why don't you go over it, and then make out a list of young people who should be in the Academy,\" Peck suggested. \"I agree with you that the Academy must break down resistance to new ideas, and indifference to the kinds of films which have meaning today to younger audiences. Since we can't put older members, who in their time made important contributions, out on the icebergs to die, we must do our best to balance things by encouraging all of the qualified younger people to join and exert their influence.\"\n\nEmpowered by her latest crusade, Bergen got to work. Among her recruits was Dennis Hopper, who was about to release a film that would tilt Hollywood on its axis: \"Easy Rider.\" \"He was sort of a brilliant lunatic,\" Bergen recalled. \"Totally unedited and uncensored, just this force of nature, without any impulse control.\" The movie opened at Manhattan's Beekman Theatre on July 14th, as the summer of '69 was under way, and made back its budget in a week. Teens lined up barefoot and smoked so much pot in the men's room that the staff had to remove the stall doors. Life credited Hopper with creating \"the style of a New Hollywood in which producers wear love beads instead of diamond stickpins.\"\n\nLater that month, as the world stopped to watch Neil Armstrong walk on the moon, Bergen was in Eugene, Oregon, shooting \"Getting Straight,\" a comedy about a campus protest. It starred Elliott Gould, as a sardonic teaching assistant; Bergen, as his coed girlfriend; and the twenty-seven-year-old Harrison Ford, as a long-haired art student. The movie was the sort of studio concoction that tried too hard to chase the youth vote, up to its ludicrous last shot of Gould and Bergen getting it on mid-riot. As the cast gathered in a hotel room reeking of pot smoke, Bergen rolled her eyes. \"Candice said, 'While you were all downstairs watching the moon landing, I was upstairs watching 'The Prisoner of Zenda,' \" Gould told me.\n\nSoon after, Bergen returned to Malibu and to Terry Melcher, who had got hooked on Placidyl. Weird things were happening. One morning, they woke to find that the telescope on the veranda was missing. Days later, a friend passed on the message that Manson was looking for Melcher-and if he happened to be missing a telescope, that's because Manson had borrowed it. A week later, Hollywood awoke to absolute horror: Sharon Tate and four others had been murdered in Terry and Candy's old house on Cielo Drive. Bergen panicked. \"It could have been me! \" she wailed to Melcher. \"I could have been killed! \"\n\n\" We could have been killed,\" he corrected her. Bergen moved out.\n\nRumors circulated that the unidentified killers had a movie-star hit list. Los Angeles was upended with fear and speculation. Was it the Black Panthers? A celebrity stalker? Who was next? Throughout Hollywood, people armored their mansions with automatic gates and guard dogs. Gregory Peck hired a night guard in Brentwood.\n\nPeck was summering in France, conducting Academy business through the post. The most pressing matter was his plan to move noncreative members to \"associate\" status, without Oscar-voting privileges.\n\nHe was also brooding about his son Stephen, in Vietnam. \"He spent a year in almost terror of the Western Union,\" Peck's younger son Carey, who, at the time, was starting at Georgetown's School of Foreign Service, recalled. During his first semester, Carey was arrested twice for civil disobedience. His father's agent chided him for exposing Peck to potential scandal. But Peck told his son, \"These days, if you don't have an arrest record, you're not young and alive and standing on the right side of things.\"\n\nBergen was in Mexico making a new film, \"Soldier Blue,\" when Terry Melcher told her on the phone that Manson had been arrested in connection with the Tate killings. (Manson later invited Dennis Hopper to see him in prison, hoping that he would play him in a movie.) She received a subpoena but arranged to testify in private. She sat in the back of the courtroom when Tex Watson, one of the accused, was brought out. She was asked if she recognized him, but she didn't. Hippies all looked alike to her.\n\nBergen had bought her own place, called the Aviary, on the old John Barrymore estate. Having once housed exotic birds and, later, Katharine Hepburn, it was an impractical but romantic dwelling: a Mediterranean tower amid cypress trees, with stained-glass windows and moldy murals that reminded Bergen of the \"Arabian Nights\" tales. She had a horse named Herschel and spent her days practicing photography and contemplating ecological causes. But, after the Manson murders, everything seemed darker. \"I remember John Phillips came over to visit once, with Quincy Jones, and left me a gun,\" she told me. \"I said, 'Why are you giving this to me?' \"\n\nBergen had kept up her end of the bargain with Peck, cajoling Hopper and other friends to join the Academy. Her father and Peck had co-sponsored her own membership, and she sponsored her flock in turn. In the fall of 1969, she wrote a letter to the Academy president, telling him that she'd filled out the forms he'd sent for nine of her friends. \"All of them are people who are a vital and creative part of our industry (perhaps the only vital and creative part of the industry).\" But each of them needed a co-sponsor: would he oblige?\n\nBy then, Peck was in Tennessee shooting \"I Walk the Line,\" in which he was miscast as a married small-town sheriff who has an affair with a mysterious young hillbilly. From the Holiday Inn in Cookeville, he kept up on Academy affairs. ABC was \"adamant\" that Bob Hope be invited back to host the Oscars, but Peck was keen to draw in the New Hollywood set. The Academy's executive director, Margaret Herrick, wrote to him about the sponsorship cards he'd sent in, many with Bergen's help. \"Warren Beatty and Katharine Ross have been members since 1968; Julie Christie was invited in 1967 and never responded; Dustin Hoffman was invited in 1968 and never responded, but Jack Nicholson, [Elliott] Gould, Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper and Robert [Forster, the star of \"Medium Cool\"] should definitely be invited before the end of this year as they are certainly more than eligible.\"\n\nThe indifference of such young talents as Julie Christie and Dustin Hoffman was bad news. Peck sent them personal appeals, writing, \"I urge you to accept membership in the Academy when it is offered to you, as it will be in December. It is not your dues we are interested in. We do want your point of view reflected in the annual voting for awards.\" He assured them that even a single vote could change the outcome: \"Witness last year's tie vote between Katharine Hepburn & Barbra Streisand.\"\n\nThe drawbridge was lowering, and fast. Peck had something even bolder in mind. Over the winter, the Board of Governors finalized a radical new plan: anyone who had not been active in the movie industry for seven years would be made an \"associate\" member, without an Oscar vote-in other words, put \"out on the icebergs to die.\" Secret lists were drawn up; lawyers were consulted. The board agreed that the purge would be kept under wraps until after the Forty-second Academy Awards.\n\nDennis Hopper forgot all about the Academy Awards ceremony, until someone reminded him to show up. \"Easy Rider\" had been nominated for its screenplay and for its supporting actor Jack Nicholson's performance. On April 7, 1970, Hopper arrived in a velvet tux, cowboy boots, and a Stetson. Jane Fonda, wearing her \"Klute\" shag, held up a fist to the roaring fans and yelled, \"Right on!\" Her political opposite, John Wayne, also received a swell of cheers, although one person held up a sign reading, \" JOHN WAYNE IS A RACIST .\" Down the street, some fifty people demonstrated against Hollywood's stereotypical depiction of Latinos in movies like \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\" with placards reading, \"Power to the Chicanos!\"\n\nIn the Best Picture race, \"Butch Cassidy\" was up against the musical extravaganza \"Hello, Dolly!\" and the period melodrama \"Anne of the Thousand Days.\" Another nominee was John Schlesinger's \" Midnight Cowboy ,\" starring Jon Voight as a Texan who goes to Manhattan to be a gigolo but winds up servicing men, while befriending a consumptive con man called Ratso Rizzo, played by Dustin Hoffman. United Artists had actually pushed the ratings board to give it an X rating, which would equal cachet with the hippie crowd.\n\nWhen the curtains opened, Gregory Peck walked onstage and struck a philosophical tone . \"Most of us these days are asking ourselves and each other these questions: What is the meaning of the new freedom of the screen? Is it something to be feared? Should the screen be censored?\" Bob Hope, who had been invited to give his usual monologue, said a hammier version of the same. \"It's such a novelty seeing actors and actresses with their clothes on,\" he joked, after coming onstage wearing a \"True Grit\" eye patch. Summing up the new epoch of sex, drugs, and violence, Hope said, \"This is not an Academy Awards. It's a freak-out, ladies and gentlemen.\"\n\nSo it was. The audience was the generation gap made visible: Vincente Minnelli, Frank Sinatra, and Cary Grant on one side, Jane Fonda, Jack Nicholson, and Dennis Hopper on the other. \"These X-rated movies are really something,\" Hope continued. \"One theatre manager told me he's been popping corn for six months and still hasn't plugged the machine in.\" The audience laughed, with some groans. \"You could feel there was a kind of buzz when Bob Hope would host anything, because he was the conservative,\" Candice Bergen told me. \"And so it was very much us against them.\"\n\nBergen, one of the recurring presenters (\"Oscar's best friends\") wore a sequinned purple shawl with gold fringe, loaned by her friend Arnold Scaasi. She and Gould handed out the first award, Best Sound, which was won by \"Hello, Dolly!\" Gould, nominated for \"Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice,\" was surprised to find himself seated near John Wayne and his wife. When Wayne was called backstage, he turned to Gould and said, \"When I go up there, you look after her.\" It was unclear whether he knew that he was talking to the guy from the wife-swapping movie.\n\nPresenting Best Cinematography to \"Butch Cassidy,\" Wayne marked his turf in the culture war, grumbling, \"I'm John Wayne, an American movie actor. I work with my clothes on.\" Like Hope, Wayne was pro-Vietnam and was despised by the hipper members of the audience.\n\nEach award was a shot across the battle line between the two Hollywoods. The writers of \"Easy Rider\" and \"Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice\" lost to William Goldman, for \"Butch Cassidy.\" Streisand, in a pink pillbox hat, came out to present Best Actor. Both \"Midnight Cowboy\" actors lost to John Wayne.\n\nMidway through, Hope came out with Fred Astaire. \"You've never danced in the Academy show, huh?\" Hope said. The orchestra played a funky riff , and Astaire, who was born in 1899, began jerking his seventy-year-old frame to an unmistakably seventies sound. He swayed, he twirled-an old man matching his rhythm to an unfamiliar beat. Then the conductor swung into a big-band tune, and Astaire broke into an exuberant tap routine, dancing away the decades, lighter than air. It was a dance to ward off mortality, to reawaken the schmaltzy Hollywood that was falling into the sea. Later in the night, Jon Voight was crossing backstage when he saw Astaire coming toward him.\n\n\"We reached each other in the middle of this thing, me six foot two or three and Fred, slight of figure, shorter,\" Voight later recalled. \"And he looked up and said, 'Oh, Jon! Hi. Let me stand aside.' I said, 'No, no, please-let me stand aside for you.' . . . That was the meeting of the two generations in the appropriate way, with tremendous regard for each other.\"\n\nFinally, Elizabeth Taylor came out to present Best Picture. The winner was \"Midnight Cowboy.\"\n\nThe counterculture had won. \" 'Midnight Cowboy' was a total 'fuck you' to every way that the town was doing business,\" Paramount's Peter Bart said. \"An X picture was acceptable by the Academy. Would that mean that we all should get into the porn business? It was a serious discussion inside closed doors.\"\n\nAt the end of the night, Bob Hope delivered a farewell that was more like an elegy, or perhaps a white flag of surrender:\n\nNever again will Hollywood be accused of showing a lollipop world. Perhaps by showing the nitty-gritty, by giving the world a glimpse of the element of violence and its destructive effect, it will help cool it. Whatever violence the screen has shown is not an example to follow but to see in its full destructive power. The troubled, kooky characters that people the screens are not examples to emulate but to learn from and try to understand and hopefully, perhaps, contrive help for. More and more films have explored the broad spectrum of human experience. They have fearlessly, and for the most part with excellent taste, examined behavior long considered taboo.\n\nElizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton hosted a losers' after-party at the Beverly Hills Hotel, where Taylor gave one of her diamonds to Gould and Rupert Crosse-the first Black actor nominated for Best Supporting Actor, for \"The Reivers\"-and let them toss it around like a ball. \"It was the size of the Statue of Liberty,\" Gould told me. If there was a baton to be passed, this was it.\n\nHollywood's warring generations scraped uneasily into the night. John Wayne, Oscar in hand, caught up on his drinking at the Polo Lounge. At one point, his \"True Grit\" co-star Dennis Hopper approached. Hopper recalled, \"He took one look at me and called me a Communist. Then he asked me to come out on his yacht-it's actually a minesweeper-and he'd explain to me why he's worth a million per picture.\" At the Governors Ball, the official Academy after-party, Frances Bergen expressed her and Edgar's disapproval of their daughter Candy's psychedelic smock. \"She didn't have to agree to be a presenter,\" Mrs. Bergen huffed. \"But, once she did, she should have conformed and worn something elegant.\"\n\nFour days after the Oscars, the Academy announced that it had \"revised and democratized\" its rolls by reclassifying three hundred and thirty-five of its members as non-voting \"associates.\" As one headline put it, \"Stodgy Old Oscar Gets a Facelift.\" Ironically, many in the same voting body that had just awarded \"Midnight Cowboy\" Best Picture were being told that they were obsolete.\n\nPeck set up a committee to review grievances, which poured in. There was the \"distressed\" former M-G-M producer who did \"not understand what is to be gained by tossing others to the crocodiles.\" (He was reinstated.) There was the producer of \"Bud Abbott and Lou Costello in Hollywood,\" who blasted the Academy's \"prejudice or favoritism.\" (His appeal was denied.)\n\nPeck wrote gracious but firm replies, took phone calls, had meetings. After the flurry of complaints, the Academy reversed only thirteen decisions. In \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" Atticus Finch exemplifies the idea of courage as taking an unpopular stand. The Peck purge of 1970 may or may not have been courageous, but it was definitely unpopular. And by putting the survivors of Hollywood's golden age out to pasture, Peck was hastening the demise of the Hollywood that had created him, the only one in which he made sense.\n\nNearly half a century later, the Academy took similar measures after the #OscarsSoWhite outcry, bringing in hundreds of diverse new members, including Idris Elba, America Ferrera, and Ice Cube, while demoting inactive members to non-voting \"emeritus status.\" Responding to blowback from old-timers that echoed the angry letters sent to Peck, the Academy's first Black president, Cheryl Boone Isaacs, pointed to the Peck purge as a precedent. \"In the '60s and '70s it was about recruiting younger members to stay vital and relevant,\" she wrote to the membership. \"In 2016, the mandate is inclusion in all of its facets: gender, race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation.\"\n\nCandice Bergen had finally found a role that excited her, in Mike Nichols's \"Carnal Knowledge,\" opposite Nicholson. From her bedroom at the Aviary, she could spy with her telescope on the house across the canyon, where girls sunbathed topless around the pool. Bert Schneider, a producer of \"Easy Rider,\" had just moved in. He intrigued her, as did his pedigree: a child of Old Hollywood who had helped forge the New, just like her. They had met in passing, first at a première and then at the Columbia canteen.\n\nSchneider was becoming less interested in making movies and more interested in revolutionary politics. In one heady weekend, he introduced Bergen to Joan Baez, the guru Baba Ram Dass, and Huey Newton, the Black Panthers' \"minister of defense.\" Her parents were even more appalled by her new boyfriend than they had been by Terry Melcher. When Schneider implored Mrs. Bergen to \"go with the flow,\" she snapped, \"No.\"\n\nSchneider isolated Bergen from her old friends. The couple housed Abbie Hoffman when he was on the run, and they hosted Hopper when he was in from Taos, zonked. In Washington, D.C., they joined an antiwar demonstration, lying down in the Senate chamber and getting arrested. By 1972, Bergen was crossing the country campaigning for George McGovern while her father stumped for Nixon, baffled that she would throw away her inheritance on some socialist tax rate.\n\nThat same year, Schneider arranged for Charlie Chaplin to return to America with his wife Oona to receive an honorary Oscar-his first time in the country since he had been effectively exiled during the Red Scare two decades earlier. Bergen photographed the honoree for the cover of Life , and the couple accompanied the Chaplins to the Oscar ceremony, where Bergen watched Chaplin bound offstage, beaming like a schoolboy, so emotional that he misplaced his statuette.\n\nThree years later, Schneider made his own splash on the Oscar stage when his antiwar film \"Hearts and Minds\" won Best Documentary Feature. \"It is ironic that we are here at a time just before Vietnam is about to be liberated,\" he said in his speech , then read a telegram from the Vietcong expressing \"greetings of friendship to all the American people.\" Backstage, the appalled Bob Hope scrawled a statement on behalf of the Academy and handed it to Frank Sinatra to read onstage, disowning \"any political references made on the program.\"\n\nBut the days of the apolitical Oscars were over. And so were Schneider and Bergen-a casualty of Bergen's yearning for independence and Schneider's belief that monogamy was a \"bourgeois concept.\"\n\nIn June, 1970, Gregory Peck declined to run for another term as Academy president. His tenure had been transformative, even if his entreaties to the New Hollywood cohort didn't always stick. \"The Academy is only two or three years behind the critics,\" he said backstage at the 1971 ceremony, adding, \"I tried to get the young people involved in the Academy, but it's impossible to reach them.\" Hopper and Peter Fonda belong to the Academy, he said, \"but they wouldn't get involved.\" Hopper's Academy membership lapsed in 1972, owing to nonpayment of dues.\n\nPeck's next film was \"Shoot Out,\" another disappointing Western. Peck reflected, \"It was humiliating to work in mediocre films-not that I ever felt a lowering of self-esteem, but it was embarrassing to know that people who had liked my earlier work weren't enjoying my latest movies.\" It would take five more years for New Hollywood to find a role for him, in \"The Omen.\"\n\nHis son Stephen returned from Vietnam the spring that \"Midnight Cowboy\" won. \"I was pretty shut down,\" Stephen said. Two of his buddies had been killed by artillery ten feet from him. His father tried to draw him out, with little success.\n\nSoon after Stephen came home, Peck optioned a play called \"The Trial of the Catonsville Nine,\" about a group of activists who burned three hundred and seventy-eight draft files in the parking lot of a Maryland draft-board office and were sentenced to multi-year prison terms. He secured a quarter million dollars to film it.\n\nThe movie was praised at Cannes but did little business back home.

      "text": "A Friendship That Ended the War\n\nOn Memorial Day in 1993, two United States senators were escorted through a prison in downtown Hanoi. It was a massive building, enclosed in a compound and occupying most of a block in the middle of the crowded city. The windows had bars, and some had louvred shutters. The Vietnamese name for the prison was Hoa Lo. The name given it by Americans was the Hanoi Hilton. During the war, the prison held captured fliers, whom the Vietnamese called \"air pirates,\" and on this day one of them had returned, for the first time since his release: John McCain, now a Republican senator from Arizona. As a Navy bomber pilot, he had been held prisoner for nearly six years, from October of 1967, when he was shot down, until March of 1973. Most of that time he had spent at Hoa Lo, more than two years of it in solitary confinement. This past summer, a large television audience heard McCain refer to the experience when he placed Bob Dole's name in nomination at the Republican National Convention. \"A long time ago, in another walk of life, I was deprived of my liberty,\" he said, with the understatement of a man who knows that his imprisonment is what distinguishes him.\n\nWhen McCain returned to Hoa Lo in 1993, he was accompanied by John Kerry, a Democrat from Massachusetts. Kerry, another Navy war veteran, was the chairman of the by then disbanded Senate Select Committee on P.O.W./M.I.A. Affairs, while McCain was its leading Republican; committee business had brought them back to Vietnam. Recently, Kerry told me about the visit to the prison, describing the walk down a corridor toward McCain's old cell-\"at the back end of the right-hand side as we walked in, around the corner. It was just this very small, dark, dank cell, with a little bed area, hardly fit for anybody.\"\n\nIn a recent interview with McCain, I asked him to describe the cell. \"Nine or ten feet by seven feet,\" he said, \"a little teeny window up at the top that was barred; a metal door that had what we used to call a peep door in it, where the guard can open it and look in at you.\"\n\nMcCain had communicated with the man in the next cell by tapping on the wall and listening to taps that came back. News passed along by this tap code included reports of antiwar activity at home. Peace activists like Tom Hayden and Jane Fonda showed up at the Hanoi Hilton during McCain's imprisonment. He always refused to meet with them; the prisoners hated the peaceniks. But then, more than three years into McCain's incarceration, in April of 1971, news came of an even more disturbing antiwar demonstration. Around a thousand American soldiers recently returned from Vietnam had gathered on the Mall in Washington to denounce the war. Led by a former Navy officer, they threw the medals and ribbons they had earned over a barricade at the Capitol.\n\nThe former Navy officer who led that veterans' protest and who \"turned back\" ribbons he'd won with one Silver Star, one Bronze Star, and three Purple Hearts was John Kerry. Kerry told me what it was like to stand on the threshold of the prison cell with McCain: \"I remember a kind of silence, and I remember distinctly that we were alone. . . . We had other people around us, but they melted into the background at that moment, and we were just standing in this place. I remember being in awe, feeling a sense of awe for what I could feel this guy must have gone through in that place.\" Kerry himself was part of what McCain had gone through.\n\nStanding with McCain at Hoa Lo brought Kerry face to face with the contradiction that had given shape to his life as surely as the prison had given shape to McCain's. Unlike the admirably direct McCain, Kerry is a man of many complications; the difference is reflected in their very different war histories. But now McCain's history was to the point. \"It was a time for me to listen,\" Kerry told me. \"I asked a few questions . . . and he talked a little about it. And he talked about the friend next door that he'd communicated with, and how they'd tap. . . . He told me that they knew that some veteran had stood up and said the war was wrong. They knew what was going on.\" They knew, that is, that a former Navy officer had betrayed them.\n\nIn 1984, thirteen years after that protest at the Capitol, John McCain, by then a United States representative from Arizona, went to Massachusetts to campaign against Kerry, a first-time Senate candidate. At a rally in the North End of Boston, McCain spoke in support of the Republican candidate, a businessman named Ray Shamie. \"I hadn't met John Kerry,\" McCain told me. In Boston, conservative opponents had tagged Kerry as Ho Chi Minh's candidate. McCain, in his appearance for Shamie, talked about the events of April, 1971. \"I said he shouldn't have thrown his medals on the steps, and that I heard about it while I was in prison.\"\n\nJohn McCain has never changed his mind about Kerry's participation in that antiwar demonstration, but he has changed his mind about the man. Much sets the two apart. Kerry is tall and lean, with carefully coiffed dark hair, a sharp nose and chin, and a mouth that seems small for his face, which perhaps explains why his expression falls into a smile only with reluctance. He could be cast in any movie as the patrician senator. McCain looks more like a senator's friendly appliance repairman. He is stocky, with washed-out white hair and the slightly pasty skin of a man who has been through something. But a smile comes into McCain's face like a boat into its slip. McCain is the son and grandson of admirals, while Kerry's mother was a Boston Brahmin and his father a Foreign Service officer. Kerry, a liberal Democrat, is at ease in the role of Senator Edward Kennedy's junior partner; McCain is proud to hold Barry Goldwater's Senate seat. Kerry came out of Vietnam as a leading critic of the war, McCain as one of its few true heroes.\n\nNevertheless, their names have become linked, both through their surprising friendship and through their work together on the Select Committee. \"Kerry-McCain\" is said as if it were one word. It describes legislation they have co-sponsored, and defines an unusual place in the political landscape. This past June, for example, a Kerry-McCain measure provided millions of dollars in compensation for the \"lost commandos\"-covert agents from South Vietnam whom the C.I.A. had long ago cut loose. \"Our relationship is now so easy,\" McCain told me, \"this latest, on the commandos . . . was a two-minute conversation. We didn't have to explore each other's views or anything like that. We both thought alike, and we just did it.\" Last month, when a CNBC talk show wanted comments on the United States missile attacks against Iraq, Kerry and McCain appeared as a duo. Across the boundaries of ideology, the men have formed a potent bipartisan partnership, grounded in a common, if rarely articulated, experience of the loss, grief, and bitterness that marked the generation of Americans who fought the war in Vietnam and fought against it.\n\nMcCain has long since eaten the words he uttered for Ray Shamie in 1984, and it is a good thing for John Kerry that he has. This year, Kerry, up for reëlection, is being challenged by Massachusetts' popular Republican governor, William Weld. After two terms, Kerry has an impressive record nationally and locally, but in Massachusetts politics he is always overshadowed by Ted Kennedy, and now the contrast between his hyper-formality and Weld's self-mocking frivolity-this summer, Weld leaped into the Charles River fully clothed-has him in trouble: he is in a dead heat with Weld in the polls. Kerry's refusal-or inability-to play the role either of the breezy backslapper or of the sincere self-revealer seems to leave Clinton-era voters cold. At a time when the values of the sitcom and the soap opera prevail, Kerry's reserve may mean that his best hope for November is pinned to the President's coattails.\n\nFew things would benefit Weld as much as a repeat of McCain's anti-Kerry visit to Massachusetts in 1984. The Arizona senator, whose Convention role as Dole's nominator signalled his importance, is one of the Party's most sought-after campaigners. McCain is working hard to protect the Republican majority in the Senate, and he regards the liberalism of Democrats like Kerry as a danger to the nation's future. Nevertheless, when I asked McCain if he would be campaigning for Weld, he shook his head, an emphatic no. \"I simply would not do such a thing. I couldn't do that. . . . I'm surprised you would ask. . . . Going to campaign against John Kerry is just something I wouldn't consider.\" McCain's devotion to Kerry is an anomaly in American politics, and it is a measure of Kerry's reticence that few of his home-state constituents know of it, or of the story that lies behind it.\n\nJohn McCain and nearly six hundred other P.O.W.s returned home early in 1973, but the fate of more than two thousand Americans who never returned from Vietnam continued to haunt their families and the nation. Five Presidents failed to dispel the questions surrounding the missing Americans, in part because at least three of those Presidents exploited the issue shamelessly. In 1991, the matter was taken up by the Senate, and John Kerry and John McCain found themselves at the center of the effort to solve the mystery. Their struggle made of these two unlikely figures the most intimate of political friends. It would never be \"I love you, man\" between them, especially given Kerry's reserve, but events would show that their bond ran deep and wide. \"I like him very much,\" McCain told me. \"We get along very well together. The thing about the Senate is you don't socialize with anybody.\" But, he continued, \"When we travel together to Vietnam . . . we talk.\"\n\nRead classic New Yorker stories, curated by our archivists and editors.\n\nIt seemed oddly right that the man with McCain at the Hanoi Hilton in 1993 was John Kerry. For the previous two years, they had, in the words of a McCain staff member, \"covered each other's backs\" in a political combat over the missing Americans. Thomas Vallely, the director of the Indochina Program at the Harvard Institute for International Development and an organizer of its Vietnam Program, observed the work of the Select Committee closely. \"During this period of time,\" he told me recently, \"there is a fucking war over this. Every day, someone is trying to destroy one or the other. And every day these guys are with each other . . . and that creates the friendship.\"\n\nSenator Kennedy observed the process, too. \"Kerry and McCain stood together at a time when others on that committee were pandering to the emotions of people,\" he told me. \"And the critics were very tough on them. They formed a bond of respect for each other.\"\n\nThat bond gave the Select Committee its structure and its purpose-and more. The partnership developed an unexpected momentum. \"This was an extension of the war,\" Kerry told me. \"This lying and deception and avoidance were what cost a lot of my friends their lives. . . . Whether you were John Kerry or John McCain, who came at it differently, we were all let down.\" And, as their committee heard every day for more than a year, it was still happening. Kerry and McCain rediscovered their own unfinished business with Vietnam, and they took responsibility for the nation's. Ted Kennedy told me, \"John Kerry did it because the issue of the war burned in his soul, and he found a soulmate in John McCain.\"\n\nSoon after Kerry and McCain returned from Hanoi, they briefed President Clinton, in the first of two crucial White House meetings. They built a new coalition in the Senate. After that Memorial Day, they returned from Vietnam to end the war.\n\nJohn Kerry is sometimes described as a calculating, opportunistic politician. When he became romantically involved with-and then last year married-Teresa Heinz, the extremely wealthy widow of Pennsylvania's Senator John Heinz, it seemed to some an all too convenient match for Kerry. (He has two grown daughters from a first marriage, which ended in divorce.) But these are private matters, and what has been most pointedly called into question is in fact the central public act of Kerry's long career: Years after the event, it was reported that the medals he threw over that Capitol barricade in 1971 were not his own. They belonged to two other veterans, who could not be there. What Kerry threw of his own were the ribbons he'd received with his medals. An act of hypocrisy? A sign of wanting things both ways? Many of the veterans who participated in that protest threw away their ribbons but not their medals; few threw away both. Photographs of the Capitol steps show that medals, ribbons, other insignia, and discharge papers were thrown. What veterans chose to turn back was not an issue for them, but it has often been cited against Kerry.\n\nI heard Kerry speak against the war on a number of occasions, beginning in the fall of 1970. I never doubted, and still don't doubt, the authenticity of his act. Opportunism? Kerry may have harbored political ambitions when he returned from Vietnam, but, given the divisions of the era, he had good reason to believe that what he was really throwing away was his main political chance.\n\nI was a Catholic priest at the time-a chaplain at Boston University and a campaign volunteer for the antiwar Jesuit Robert Drinan, who was running for Congress. Kerry sometimes introduced Drinan at rallies, and I remember hearing him do so once at B.U. The young Navy combat veteran was something the peace movement had not seen before, and I remember the curious silence in the packed hall as the scruffy, long-haired kids of the counterculture watched this lean, well-groomed military man approach the podium. I remember the unapologetic authority with which he laid claim to our attention. John Kerry's knowledge of the war, unlike that of other prophets of peace, was not abstract: \"We saw Vietnam ravaged equally by American bombs,\" he testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in the spring of 1971, \"as well as by search-and-destroy missions, as well as by Vietcong terrorism, and yet we listened while this country tried to blame all of the havoc on the Vietcong. . . . We learned the meaning of free-fire zones, shooting anything that moves. . . . We watched the U.S. falsification of body counts. . . . Each day, to facilitate the process by which the United States washes her hands of Vietnam, someone has to give up his life so the United States doesn't have to admit something that the entire world already knows, so that we can't say that we have made a mistake. Someone has to die so that President Nixon won't be, and these are his words, 'the first President to lose a war.'\n\n\"We are asking Americans to think about that, because how do you ask a man to be the last man to die in Vietnam? How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake?\" John Kerry's words-the truth of lived experience-cut through the inflated rhetoric of politics and registered with the establishment. But to members of his own generation his witness meant something else still: Kerry spoke as much for those who had gone off to fight the war as for those who'd rejected it. As the son of a military man, I was particularly moved. I was a peacenik with a secret: I had grown up believing in the ethos of military honor and still longed for its redemption. Years later, I came to understand more fully how my father and others like him had tried to protect our nation's moral integrity, but at the time Kerry was the only person who made it seem possible to be a patriot and a war objector both.\n\n\"For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action\": this is from the text of the official citation accompanying the Silver Star, awarded to Kerry for what happened in the waters of the Mekong Delta on February 28, 1969. \"Kerry's craft received a B-40 rocket close aboard. Once again Lieutenant (junior grade) Kerry ordered his units to charge the enemy positions. . . . Patrol Craft Fast 94 then beached in the center of the enemy positions and an enemy soldier sprang up from his position not ten feet from Patrol Craft Fast 94 and fled. Without hesitation Lieutenant (junior grade) Kerry leaped ashore, pursued the man behind a hootch and killed him, capturing a B-40 rocket launcher with a round in the chamber.\"\n\nRecently, I asked Kerry about the man he killed. We had been talking for an hour or more, and for the first time he hesitated. Then he said, \"It was either going to be him or it was going to be us. It was that simple. I don't know why it wasn't us-I mean, to this day. He had a rocket pointed right at our boat. He stood up out of a hole, and none of us saw him until he was standing in front of us, aiming a rocket right at us, and, for whatever reason, he didn't pull the trigger-he turned and ran. He was shocked to see our boat right in front of him. If he'd pulled the trigger, we'd all be dead. . . . I just won't talk about all of it. I don't and I can't. The things that probably really turned me I've never told anybody. Nobody would understand.\" Kerry stopped. He was silent. Finally, he concluded, \"These things are very personal. It was our youth.\"\n\nIt was our presumed innocence, our moral simplicity. A Vietnamese soldier, for reasons that will be forever unknown, found it impossible to kill John Kerry and his men. In turn, John Kerry killed him. There is, of course, a core of moral paradox in this event: Could Kerry have simply let the man flee? But what about that loaded rocket? This paradox prevents it from being merely heroic and makes it instead, for the killer as well as the killed, tragic.\n\nKerry rarely speaks of his combat experience. The only time one senior aide remembered hearing him publicly refer to it was when he was speaking against the launching of Desert Storm. After the short but violent Persian Gulf War, a group of senators flew to Kuwait on an inspection trip. One was Kerry, and another was McCain. The accident of their time together in the bare C-135 military transport plane in 1991 made possible the first prolonged encounter between these two men.\n\n\"We sat up opposite each other on the plane one night,\" Kerry told me. \"John was sitting there in his own flight jacket\"-the Navy-issue jacket from his days in flight school, with \"Lt. McCain\" on the patch. The fit was by then a little snug.\n\n\"We started talking about the war, and Vietnam, prison-what had happened to him, and all that. . . . Nothing had brought us together before, and we just talked. We talked about what I had done.\" Kerry was referring to the episode that McCain had denounced in the 1984 campaign. \"But by now it wasn't a big hurdle,\" he went on. \"To his credit, he didn't make it one. He made it clear that he had moved beyond all that. . . . The war was a tough period for a lot of people, for a lot of reasons. Both of us decided to put all that kind of stuff behind us, and work together at something.\"\n\nEvents gave them their common task. Within months of that conversation on the C-135, the old controversy over American soldiers abandoned in Vietnam was reawakened when newspaper front pages and then the cover of Newsweek displayed a photograph purportedly showing three American P.O.W.s still in captivity. Lurking below this issue, as always, was the war that had not yet ended. \"I set out literally to bring that ending about,\" Kerry told me. \"I knew as a matter of policy that it should take place, and I think John felt the same way.\" McCain lent Kerry his unimpeachable integrity on the question of the war that each wanted to end. Kerry drove the process, but only McCain could have enabled him to drive it home.\n\nAs a prisoner in Hoa Lo, lying on that cot in the dank cell with the \"teeny\" window, John McCain had put himself to sleep at night by memorizing the names of his fellow-P.O.W.s. \"You start with the 'A's,\" he told me, and he went on to describe how, through the tap code, he learned of the arrival of new prisoners. \"And you fill them in to where they are in the alphabet. . . . I would just associate the names: Brudno with 'brute'; Baker, and I'd think of a loaf of bread. I would remember the number of names under each letter.\" Night after night for years, McCain maintained a mental file of the names of perhaps a hundred and seventy captives. This and other acts of P.O.W. memorization were the beginning of The List, which would haunt the nation for decades.\n\nDuring McCain's first year in the Hanoi prison, his father, Admiral Jack McCain, was appointed CINCPAC -commander-in-chief of the Pacific. Perhaps for that reason, young McCain's captors offered to release him. On the wall of McCain's Washington office hangs a framed State Department telegram, dated September 13, 1968. It is also stamped with the date of its declassification: September 24, 1992. It is a report to Washington from the chief American negotiator at the 1968 Paris peace talks. \"At last tea break,\" the text reads, \"Le Duc Tho attendant. He mentioned that DRV had intended to release Admiral McCain's son as one of the three pilots freed recently, but he had refused.\" The cable is signed \"Harriman.\"\n\nDespite improperly set broken bones dating from the downing of his plane, nearly a year before, and failing health generally, McCain had refused to accept release: the P.O.W. honor code required the release of men in the order of their capture, and others had been held longer than he. McCain was not let go for nearly five more years, when every P.O.W. in Hoa Lo was freed. Robert Timberg tells McCain's prison story in his 1995 book \"The Nightingale's Song,\" a study of five Annapolis graduates. When McCain refused release in 1968, a guard told him, \"Now, McCain, it will be very bad for you.\" A regimen of beatings and torture began. The Vietnamese set out to break McCain's spirit.\n\nAfter a week, he broke. He signed a confession that read, \"I am a black criminal and I have performed deeds of an air pirate. I almost died, and the Vietnamese people saved my life.\" When McCain was returned to his cell, he had changed. \"The cockiness was gone, replaced by a suffocating despair,\" Timberg writes. \"He looked at the louvered cell window high above his head, then at the small stool in the room. He took off his dark blue prison shirt, rolled it like a rope, draped one end over his shoulder near his neck, began feeding the other end through the louvers. . . .\n\n\"A guard burst into the room, pulling McCain away from the window.\"\n\nWhen I asked McCain about his attitude toward John Kerry's antiwar activity, which he still disapproves of, his answer drifted toward what he still disapproves of in himself. Referring to \"The Nightingale's Song,\" he asked, \"Did you read in that book that I failed? So shouldn't that make me appreciate that others may fail also? I knew what the code of conduct was. I knew what I was supposed to do, and I knew that I ought to do everything I could to achieve that goal, everything humanly possible. And so it was pretty clear to me. And, as you know, Jim\"-this was the first time McCain had addressed me familiarly-\"you can appreciate this better than anyone else who's ever interviewed me.\" The bald statement cried out to be taken as a savvy politician's shameless appeal to a writer's narcissism, but my every instinct told me something else. I knew that McCain was thinking of his father and of mine, who were colleagues. When Lieutenant Commander John McCain III was shot down, and while Admiral McCain was CINCPAC , my father, Lieutenant General Joseph F. Carroll (U.S.A.F.), was the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency-the man charged with keeping track of P.O.W.s in Vietnam. It is not unlikely that, as a courtesy, my father personally briefed Admiral McCain on what the D.I.A. was learning of his son's circumstances.\n\n\"When you grew up in that environment, your dad's standards were clear,\" McCain was saying now. \"My standards were clear, and I knew that the old guy was out there, and I didn't want him to-You know.\" And I did. It was presumptuous of me, but I told McCain that, rather than any of his many acts of heroism, I regarded the moment of his degradation as the key to the man he had become. \"I think you're right,\" he said. \"It really was a crisis point. Maybe it changed the direction of my life somewhat, and made me a little bit different person in my relationship with others.\" Then the tentativeness disappeared from his voice. \"There's no doubt about it,\" he said.\n\nIt was not long after McCain was captured, in 1967, that a delegation of American peace activists, led by Tom Hayden, arrived at Hoa Lo. Years later, Hayden and McCain met in an ABC television studio, at a Vietnam retrospective with Peter Jennings as host. \"There were maybe twenty-five people there,\" Hayden told me recently. \"I saw McCain. When he saw me, he seemed stiff and uncomfortable. The room was crowded. I approached him, and uttered a few words about reconciliation. His face softened. He reached out to me, and greeted me warmly.\"\n\nMcCain recalled the encounter with Hayden at ABC, and agreed that it was significant. \"I think it was a chance to say that we understood each other's views,\" he said.\n\nHayden, referring to something I'd written in another context, told me that McCain \"had the air of a forgiven man,\" meaning that McCain knew what it was to need to be forgiven, which is the only way to learn to forgive. He was the son and grandson of heroes, yet to himself he had betrayed that tradition. And he had followed in his own life the arc of the same journey that his country was making-the journey from a sure sense of moral superiority to one of shame and dishonor.\n\nMcCain is a long way from suicide now. He has had his difficulties, which included a brush with political scandal-he was named one of the Keating Five-and painful ruptures in his family life. His first marriage, to Carol Shepp, the mother of his three grown children, did not survive the aftermath of his return from Vietnam. (With his second wife, Cindy Hensley, he began a new young family, with two sons and two daughters.) Yet Tom Hayden's observation still seems true. McCain has the air of a man at peace with himself and with the world. \"We have a place in northern Arizona, in a little valley,\" he said. We were sitting in his office as he told me this, and I watched his face relax as he spoke. \"And my greatest pleasure-this shows you I'm in my dotage-is to get up in the morning, pour a cup of coffee, and go down to a chair that sits by this creek, and the sun's coming up. I can't tell you how happy I am. I can't tell you the inner happiness that I feel when I think about my life, my family, my country, my friends. Sometimes I feel that I am far more fortunate than I deserve to be. I went through a terrible experience. I am such a better person for having had that experience that, in a way, I am fortunate.\"\n\nThere are good reasons that Americans had such trouble bringing closure to the war in Vietnam. More than fifty million young adults made up the Vietnam generation, somewhat more than half of them males. More than eight million served in the military, and more than three million in Vietnam. Three-quarters of a million saw combat, three hundred and twenty-one thousand were wounded, fifty-eight thousand were killed. In \"Achilles in Vietnam,\" published in 1994, the psychiatrist Jonathan Shay says that two hundred and fifty thousand veterans still suffer from post-traumatic-stress disorder.\n\nThe war's early years had been marked by the absolute confidence with which Robert S. McNamara tracked progress with the \"body count,\" a tally that subsequent events revealed to have been meaningless, if not completely false. Twenty years later, another macabre body count was being kept, as \"remains\" of the missing Americans were tracked down. But wild and-especially to the families of the missing-distressing inconsistencies only fuelled the patriots' version of the anger and bitterness that resisters had experienced earlier. A 1973 figure of thirteen hundred and three M.I.A.s was shrunk in 1978 to two hundred and twenty-four. It ballooned in 1980 to twenty-five hundred. In 1987, the official number of M.I.A.s was put at two hundred and sixty-nine, but by then many veterans and family members refused to believe any government statement.\n\nIn time, myth overcame reality. The figure of the P.O.W. became a kind of national fantasy-but one with a purpose. Through the seventies and eighties, America exacted revenge on the victorious Vietnamese by demonizing them more savagely than we ever did during the conflict itself, all in terms of the prisoners they had supposedly refused to release. \"Rambo\" films and their imitators portrayed camps in jungles where emaciated Americans were kept in tiger cages. Boys with toys dreamed of real rescue missions, and occasionally found underwriters, like the always ready Ross Perot. Some unscrupulous vets began to exploit the longings of the families, turning the search for phantom P.O.W.s into a commercial enterprise. Eventually, their Asian counterparts made an industry of fabricating P.O.W. \"evidence,\" such as authentic-looking dog tags and doctored photographs, all for sale. Politicians like Bob Dole may have been sincerely concerned for the men whose names they wore on bracelets-John McCain spoke gratefully of that in his nominating speech-but the issue ran away with them.\n\nThe families-the ever more sorely haunted wives, children, sisters, brothers, and parents-were surrounded by private-enterprise jackals, but it was the callous and careless agencies of the government that continued to hurt them most. In some cases, \"remains\" were \"discovered\" years later and returned to families, but, on consulting their own experts, the families learned that the sacks of dried bones had come from Asian bodies, or even from animals. Sometimes serious evidence of the true fate of an M.I.A. was discounted, while wild rumors of \"live sightings\" were given credence, raising impossible hopes. The efforts of five Administrations to resolve the issue were halfhearted or hopelessly politicized-tied to a partisan agenda.\n\nA series of P.O.W./M.I.A. hearings, committees, and commissions was begun within weeks of the release of the prisoners-including McCain-from the Hanoi Hilton in 1973. Each such undertaking eventually concluded that there was no evidence of Americans' being held, but those for whom Rambo lives were given encouragement when Ronald Reagan embraced the P.O.W./M.I.A. issue and appeared to accept the myth of tiger cages in the jungle.\n\nIn 1987, President Reagan appointed General John Vessey, a retired former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as Special Emissary to Vietnam for P.O.W./M.I.A. affairs. He was reappointed to that position by Presidents Bush and Clinton. Vessey ultimately contributed more than any other single person to the resolution of the issue. But at first \"the group around President Reagan checkmated Vessey,\" Harvard's Thomas Vallely told me. \"They wanted to fight the war a little bit longer.\" Whenever Hanoi came close to accomplishing what Vessey and others said was required for normalization, McCain says, \"we kept moving the goalposts on them.\" The Vietnamese, with reason, also did not believe what they were being told.\n\nIt had all come to seem an instance of the unities of Aristotle. Lies at the beginning of the war had become an assumption of lies long after the war had ended for everyone in the world but us. For two decades, all of this has clung to us: unresolved feelings of guilt and grief; rage at authority and loss of personal honor; diminished American self-respect; and suspicion of the neighbor whose experience of the war years was different. It was as if we had been infected with a set of viruses, related and debilitating but never quite lethal-the Vietnam syndrome exactly.\n\nAnd always, in the cage at the center of this syndrome, there was the bent-head profile of the American prisoner, the one whom we had betrayed and abandoned. So how could we ignore that photograph published in July of 1991 showing three American P.O.W.s in captivity? \"The Three Amigos,\" they were called, and the photograph was reprinted everywhere. The families of the \"captives\" identified them. \"That's Daddy,\" an Air Force colonel's daughter said on \"Good Morning America.\"\n\nThe photograph, it turned out, was a doctored seventy-year-old picture of three Russian farmers, and had been produced by Cambodian hoaxers. But by now the P.O.W./M.I.A. issue was again intense, and highly political. Susan Katz Keating reports in her book \"Prisoners of Hope\" that a poll taken in the early nineties showed that seventy per cent of the American public believed that P.O.W.s were still being held captive in Southeast Asia. Senator Bob Smith, Republican of New Hampshire, called for yet another investigation, and the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W./M.I.A. Affairs was authorized.\n\nAgainst the advice of his staff, who saw yet another committee as a political abyss, Kerry said yes when George Mitchell, the Senate Majority Leader, asked him to chair it. \"It was not a politically rewarding thing for him to take on,\" Senator Kennedy told me. \"And it turned out to be a true national service.\"\n\nMcCain, the former prisoner, was named to the committee. He had travelled to Vietnam for President Bush, in support of General Vessey's efforts. He had met with Vietnamese leaders. \"They've never understood all these allegations about their keeping people behind,\" he recalls. \"Time after time, they would say to me, 'Why would we keep them?' \" McCain saw the difficulty of coaxing Vietnamese officials, for the sake of a few hundred long-missing Americans, to coöperate in the kind of investigative work that Hanoi would never be able to do for the hundreds of thousands of its own missing soldiers. He knew that Buddhists believe that an uninterred or improperly interred corpse condemns a soul to eternal wandering, so the fate of their own missing sons was far from insignificant to the Vietnamese.\n\n\"Before that committee convened, whatever harebrained and wild allegation or story came up had instant credence,\" McCain told me. \"By the methodical work that John Kerry did . . . Americans were made much more aware of the realities.\" Kerry travelled to Vietnam eight times; he supervised the examination of thousands of documents and photographs; and he took testimony from family members, leaders of veterans' organizations, intelligence officials, and negotiators from the Paris peace talks. He subpoenaed several hundred people, and put under oath for the first time those who had run the war, including Henry Kissinger.\n\nKerry and McCain, by \"pulling in the same harness,\" in the words of one staff member, were able to get the Vietnamese to turn over troves of P.O.W. evidence; one batch included McCain's old flight helmet. What was perhaps more amazing, they were able to get the Department of Defense to declassify a million pages of documents. Every conceivable theory was aired, every charge levelled, and every hope given expression. And what this investigation revealed, in the words of its final report-twelve hundred and twenty-three pages long-was that \"while the Committee has some evidence suggesting the possibility a POW may have survived to the present, and while some information remains yet to be investigated, there is, at this time, no compelling evidence that proves that any American remains alive in captivity in Southeast Asia.\"\n\nThe judicious phrasing of this conclusion did not conceal its meaning from those who were never going to surrender the issue. They became enraged, and aimed their anger at the one person whose participation was undermining their cause: John McCain, the man who'd gone to sleep reciting the names of P.O.W.s. I saw this not long ago, at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, in Washington. There visitors can buy T-shirts, decals, and other souvenirs, and they can pick up free copies of a bimonthly broadsheet, The U.S. Veteran Dispatch . On the front page of the June-July, 1996, issue is a photograph of a young John McCain, purportedly as a prisoner in Hanoi. The headline reads \" PW SONGBIRD MC CAIN ,\" and the caption explains, \"McCain earned the title 'PW Songbird' because of the propaganda broadcasts he made for the Reds during the Vietnam War.\" The article elaborating the charge was written by a former Green Beret, a decorated Vietnam veteran. An article in a previous issue was headlined \" JOHN MC CAIN: ' THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE .' \"\n\n\"Listen,\" Kerry said to me, sitting forward in his chair at his Washington home. \"I defended him in those hearings when some stupid-ass right-wing idiot accused him of being the Manchurian Candidate, that somehow the Vietnamese had brainwashed him. This is the most unbelievably callous, degrading, nonsensical piece of crap I've ever heard in my life, coming from some chicken hawk out there, to hurl at somebody who spent as long as he did being tortured and standing up for his country, and caring about it as much as he did. It's incredible that people would behave like that, absolutely stunning.\"\n\nSometimes McCain was attacked by his fellow-senators and sometimes by witnesses. He was the lightning rod. I was told by a member of the committee staff that when Kerry and McCain were sitting near each other on the senators' dais, Kerry would, at such moments, unobtrusively move his hand over to McCain and place it on his arm and leave it there, a quiet gesture of what was becoming absolute mutual support. I asked McCain if he had been aware of Kerry's touch. \"Yes,\" he replied. \"He did that several times, and I'm glad he did. I'm grateful to him.\"\n\nIn 1992, as the Kerry committee's deliberations were nearing their conclusion, McCain was up for reëlection. That fall, he made one of his numerous trips to Vietnam, going over and back in a weekend. His Democratic opponent seized on the trip, criticizing McCain with more than an implication that he was grandstanding. Kerry had been the object of such attacks himself, so he immediately organized a letter from the members of the committee, Democrats and Republicans alike, defending McCain. Senator Bob Kerrey, of Nebraska, a committee member and a Medal of Honor winner, had gone to Arizona to campaign for the Democrat, but he, too, supported McCain on the issue. McCain won the election. Kerry and McCain had come a long way from the North End of Boston.\n\n\"During deliberations of the committee,\" McCain told me, referring to the end of the process, \"John Kerry felt it was very important to have everybody-all the Republicans, all the Democrats-sign on to that report, because, if one or two people didn't, then the radicals would leap onto that person. A couple of times, I had very spirited exchanges, to say the least, with a couple of senators-in-your-face kind of exchanges. John Kerry-to his everlasting credit, and to my everlasting discredit, O.K.?-constantly said, 'Let's discuss it. Let's talk about it.' He was very mature in handling this-more mature than I was.\"\n\nThe Select Committee's report, issued on January 13, 1993, has the signature of every member. Its unanimous, bipartisan finding of \"no compelling evidence\" would essentially remove the issue of abandoned captives from mainstream political debate, but the process that had led to this finding was equally important. In effect, Kerry and McCain had presided over the final stages of the nation's grief work, providing a forum in which the last untold stories of the war dead could be told.\n\nThe committee finished its task just as Bill Clinton took office. The next step would be to lift the embargo, leading to normalization of relations between the two countries. But would Clinton do it? George Bush, a veteran of another war, could have taken the first step, but, for his own reasons, he chose not to. During the 1992 Presidential campaign, he had been hooted down at a convention of P.O.W./M.I.A. activists. Perhaps, as Vallely surmised, he decided \"to leave this mess to his successor, who had not served in the war.\"\n\nClinton, early in his Administration, was warned by leaders of veterans' groups not to appear at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Upon hearing that, McCain-\"almost impulsively,\" he told me-offered to accompany the President there. Kerry and McCain would accompany Clinton to the end. In a crucial White House meeting on June 11, 1993, less than two weeks after their visit to Hoa Lo prison, the two senators urged the President to lift the embargo, offering geopolitical and economic reasons but also emphasizing the matter of national honor, since the Vietnamese had diligently done all that we had asked them to in the matter of M.I.A.s. But the conservative Republican Senator Bob Smith, who was vice-chair of Kerry's committee, urged Clinton \"not to be deceived,\" and argued against lifting the embargo.\n\nA week later, on June 19th, President Clinton went to Boston to deliver the commencement address at Northeastern University, and the two Massachusetts senators served as his escorts. The event took place at the old Boston Garden. Senator Kennedy told me, \"We had time backstage with the President, and John just spent the whole time filling the President in on all that was involved in normalization. It was really very powerful, his face-to-face presentation to the President, laying it all out. And what he did was absolutely indispensable to the President, and how the President could bring the whole thing to a conclusion.\" But that summer and fall Clinton remained noncommittal.\n\nIn January, 1994, a Kerry-McCain-sponsored Senate resolution urged the President to lift the embargo. A few veterans mobilized in opposition, drawing the support of the American Legion and the Republican leadership. McCain's sponsorship persuaded twenty Republicans to vote for the measure, which passed by a vote of sixty-two to thirty-eight. McCain said, \"The vote will give the President the kind of political cover he needs to lift the embargo.\" The fact is, however, that the President's real cover was coming from Kerry and McCain. The one had come to represent the United States government's long-overdue determination to tell the truth about Vietnam; the other was the military hero become a figure of healing. Together, their credibility on the question was absolute.\n\nOn February 4, 1994, a Times headline read \" CLINTON DROPS 19-YEAR TRADE EMBARGO ON VIETNAM .\" Above it appeared the most wrenching photograph of the war-the one of the naked girl, amid other children, running toward the camera, away from what the caption called \"an aerial napalm strike in 1972.\"\n\nBob Dole, by then the Republican leader, said that lifting the embargo was \"the wrong decision at the wrong time for the wrong reason.\" In the spring of 1995, he and Senator Phil Gramm, of Texas, introduced a bill urging Clinton not to grant full diplomatic recognition to Vietnam; they wanted to resuscitate the issue of sixteen hundred and nineteen missing Americans. Then, on May 23, 1995, Kerry and McCain met with Clinton in the Oval Office. Against Dole, they made the case for normalization. McCain concluded by saying, \"It doesn't matter to me anymore, Mr. President, who was for the war and who was against the war. I'm tired of looking back in anger. What's important is that we move forward now.\" Clinton had once famously said he \"despised\" the war. Now he was being asked by one of its heroes to end it. To others present, he seemed moved by McCain's statement. He thanked McCain but still made no commitment. Then, on July 11, 1995, he summoned Cabinet members, the top military brass, congressional leaders, the heads of veterans' groups, and others to the White House. Standing resolutely on the podium, he declared, \"Today I am announcing the normalization of diplomatic relationships with Vietnam.\" After a brief statement, he concluded, \"This moment offers us the opportunity to bind up our own wounds. They have resisted time for too long. We can now move on to common ground. Whatever divided us before let us consign to the past. Let this moment, in the words of the Scripture, be a time to heal, and a time to build.\" Then Bill Clinton turned immediately to the man next to him, John McCain. They began by shaking hands, but then embraced emotionally. The President turned next to John Kerry.\n\nA year later, the only freestanding foreign-sponsored academic institution in Vietnam, attached to the Ho Chi Minh City Economics University, is a project of Harvard's Institute for International Development and the American Council of Learned Societies. It is called the Fulbright Center, and was dedicated in November of 1995, four months after normalization. On that occasion, Thomas Vallely, himself a former marine who served in Vietnam in 1969 and part of 1970, told the audience, \"This teaching center is a gift to the Vietnamese people from the American people, a gift conceived by John Kerry, the senator from Massachusetts.\" Vallely went on to acknowledge John McCain as well: \"I think that if we could overhear the voices of those silent American veterans whose names are engraved on the black granite wall in Washington, they would agree with Senator McCain and say that it was time for Americans to remember the many silent Vietnamese veterans and to reach out toward Vietnam in a peace of the brave.\"\n\nIn 1994, the United States ranked fourteenth among foreign investors in Vietnam. A year later, it ranked sixth. Today, in Hanoi, the Hoa Lo prison is no more. It was torn down to make way for a hotel complex-a facility made necessary, in part, by the many American veterans who have begun to return to Vietnam. The Vietnamese Ambassador-designate to the United States, Le Van Bang, told me, \"American soldiers are coming back to Vietnam. We understand why they come, and we welcome them.\"\n\nThe site of the nightmare from which America found it so difficult to awaken is becoming a place in which tourists sleep; the unlikely friendship of two American politicians made it possible. \"John Kerry and John McCain did a noble service to this country,\" Senator Kennedy told me. \"I know that kind of talk doesn't ring any bells anymore, but it's true. A noble service.\" In Vietnam, they are revered as the men who ended the war. And the most potent symbol of the new era is what has become of the Hanoi Hilton. As for the hotel replacing the prison, McCain told me, \"When I saw it, they asked me what I thought. I said, 'I hope room service is better than it was when I was here.' \" ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Trying to Tolerate The Newsroom , Week Seven\n\nPhoto by Charley Gallay/Getty Images for TWC\n\nLONDON-Not many days left to abuse that dateline. I'm still on leave, back next week, but I made sure to watch the seventh episode of The Newsroom , Season Two. And I got Peter Suderman, Reason magazine's film critic/health policy reporter, to watch it in tandem. If you haven't read Peter on the book that's helped hacks write every brain-dead action movie script of the decade, do that now.\n\nPeter Suderman: Now we can talk about the Miley Cyrus episode of The Newsroom .\n\nDave Weigel: ‪Why do you call it that? I mean, I like how it sounds, but why that label given how many Important Things happened here?‬ PS: Because it was slightly hard to concentrate on the show given all the VMA-tweeting that was happening at the same time. To be sure, I could have solved this problem by turning off Twitter. But I didn't.‬ DW: ‪Peter, this is what's wrong with journalism. More theoretically, running a story that has been doctored and fed to you by spooks drunk on revenge is what's really wrong with journalism.‬ PS: ‪Well, yes, that is a big problem, if that's what's going on. Which it is. Was. On The Newsroom . Do you get the impression that this plotline, in which our intrepid News Night team gets a Big Story very, very wrong, is an attempt to respond to criticism of the show's first season?‬ DW: ‪Insofar as it's a plotline that runs through the season and creates something resembling tension?‬ PS: That, yes. But also in the sense that the first season, which I only saw snippets of, was perceived as very smug? This gives Sorkin a chance to take his characters down a peg. (Sort of.)‬ DW: ‪As a schlocky moral lesson, it's pretty good, and having been fitted with every kind of black hat this season, it was good to see Jerry Dantana get smacked down.‬ Yes, only to be saved when Jane Fonda suddenly believes in the power of their journalism. She hated it when they pissed off Republicans with opinion, but she'll live with it when they blow a story. Perhaps it's because her news team is now so chastened that they won't possibly rebuff her. But as a drama-as someone who reviews a lot of movies, and knows how they are structured-what did you make of the Genoa payoff?‬ PS: ‪I thought the episode worked better as drama than many of the episodes this season, mostly because it was focused on Genoa. Romantic entanglements and yesterday's news were generally back-burned, except for a Benghazi sequence intercut with a Genoa interview session at the end.‬ The show is at its best when it's telling a story with meaningful stakes rather than offering Life Lessons, and we got more of that here than in previous episodes. DW: As pompous as it can be/always is, I agree-I'd much rather watch Sorkin in \"lecturing the audience\" mode than in \"teaching those women a lesson\" mode.‬ PS: But he so obviously enjoys imparting lessons to Internet Girls everywhere.‬ ‪Part of what bugs me about the show is that it often feels like a one-man show, in which Sorkin is playing all the parts. This plot-heavy episode felt a little less like that than usual.‬ ‪What did you think of the way to Genoa story came apart?‬ I can't decide whether it felt sort of real-a cascading series of unlikely failures-or totally contrived. DW: ‪Jerry turned out to be an interesting (I almost wrote \"fascinating,\" but let's not push it) villain, and our second example this season of \"the left\" going too far and hurting its cause.‬ ‪First example: Occupy. Second: Jerry successfully goading the liberal News Night \"red team\" into thinking they were only cold on the story because they couldn't bring themselves to attack Obama.‬ In the elevator confrontation-the best of its kind since Ryan Gosling smashed that one guy's head in Drive -he whines that he wouldn't have \"done this\" (i.e., make shit up) for any other story. He just cares SO MUCH-and sic semper annoying causeheads. PS: ‪Jerry makes an interesting symbol of a liberal tendency that Sorkin wants to critique. But his motivation doesn't strike me as terribly plausible. Why this story? Now? After eight years working as a produccer in the D.C. bureau, this is the moment he chooses to cook an interview?‬ It's awfully convenient. DW: ‪Not that I've cooked a story, obviously (I HOPE that's obvious), but I could completely understand his motivation.‬ PS: ‪Why did he think he could get away with it? How did he not notice the basketball game shot clock that gave him away?‬\n\nDW: The story is sold to him as one that \"makes careers and ends presidencies.\" Gosh, that sounds fun! Having spent eight months working on it, and assuming he has everything else down cold, I understand why he'd lie.‬ Don't reporters sometimes rush into the breach before they've got the final, final confirmation, because damn it they don't want to be scooped? PS: ‪It's one thing to rush to a story before it's nailed down, and another thing to knowingly present your colleagues, and readers/watchers, with a doctored interview.‬ But you're making a better case here than the show did.\n\nDW: ‪Well, Jerry was presented from the outset as an arrogant hobgoblin with no friends or relevance to anyone's life apart from this story.‬ PS: ‪Right. A bad guy! Who exposes the weaknesses of the protagonists. And forces them to rethink Everything They Know.‬ One bit I did enjoy was the garage scene with Charlie's source. ‪Now, it was a little over-the-top. But I liked the way the source decided that the best way to get revenge on Charlie wasn't to hurt him physically-but to trick him into airing a bad story.‬ DW: ‪It was nice how that revelation of journalistic fraud by a source was laid out in a parking garage.‬ Though Sorkin, as usual, curdled the cream by having Sam Waterson snark about it.* \"A parking garage?\" Yes. Everyone gets it! PS: It's a common Sorkin problem. He doesn't trust his viewers to pick up on things.‬ For example: that the basketball game would be important later. He hung a neon sign on that plot point last episode. And then put together a Basketball Lecture sequence, with Will helpfull mansplaining sports timing rules to Mac, as well as the segment clock clue that led Mac to review Jerry's footage.‬ DW: Yes, who was the viewer who needed that? This isn't TV, it's HBO! This is the audience that watched Deadwood and tried to understand John From Cinncinati and can figure out who the six identical-looking guys with beards in Game of Thrones are!‬ Surely they saw the basketball game last episode and thought, \"Hrm, problem!\" PS: ‪And surely the problems with the footage could have been discovered by Mac obsessively rewatching the footage following complaints about the story.‬ Which is probably what a producer in that situation would actually be doing-extensively reviewing the evidence in order to see what, if anything, was missed.‬ DW: ‪But she doesn't realize that live sports happens in linear time.‬ A common mistake, honestly. PS:‪ Well, she is a woman on an Aaron Sorkin show.‬ I guess the next two episodes are just Aftermath/Redemption?‬ ‪This felt very much like the end of Act II, with everything unraveling and a period of reflection as the protagonists come to grips with all they have lost and learned.‬ Which ought to send us into Act III, in which the protagonists put all their new knowledge to use in order to Achieve Victory.‬ ‪I don't recall it being very exciting. But I assume it will be for the News Night crew, because they'll learn to get their stories right-and get their credibility back.‬ DW: The next two appear to be a suite called \"Election Night I and II.\"‬ Do you recall how exciting election night 2012 was? (I assume it will also be boring in the Sorkinverse, but Jim will have to choose between Maggie and his campaign bus squeeze.) Back to this ep, though. Let's establish that it was pretty gripping drama qua drama, far and above the usual for this show.‬ PS: ‪Yes. DW: ‪Did it feel like journalism? The coda (or pre-coda) about the News Night -ers being so sad they repeat the State Department's Benghazi spin was meant to say ... that reporters get cowed when they've screwed up? I think that's true. PS: ‪Right. There are costs to screw-ups that go beyond the original story.‬ DW: ‪Tough for them to call up their State sources knowing that they are the face of botched national security news.‬ ‪I do think that's happened. It would be interesting to see the sources' side of it-political sources do not mind manipulating reporters if they know they're bleeding credibility.‬ PS: ‪That also struck me as one of those highly convenient Sorkin moments where they had the story right-or could have, anyway.‬ ‪Maybe that's the lesson of Genoa -its true cost-that it prevented News Night from being the news program that Aaron Sorkin knows in his heart it could be.‬ DW: I think so. All season I've been giving the show bonus points for seemingly sending the message that hubris-as exhibited by every character here-is a killer.‬ But ... what if that message is softened a bit? What if it turns out that hubris is OK, as long as you don't employ an Aspergers-y guy who yells about drones? And trust him on his story? PS: There's more than a hint of that in the final scene, with Fonda.‬ DW: ‪\"We've lost the trust of the public!\"‬ \"So get it back, you stupid liberals I keep trying to fire!\"‬ I'm not sure who has the most promising yet one-note \"bossy woman\" role this year, Fonda here or Kirsten Scott Thomas in Only God Forgives . PS: She strongly suggests that the lesson these folks ought to be learn is that when they get taken by a rogue producer, the correct response is not to shoulder any of the blame, but to be really angry at that jerk producer.‬ DW: ‪Let the fall guy take it-that's why he's a fall guy. Yes, quite the lesson.‬ PS: ‪And the fact that Jerry's lawsuit basically says it was a systemic failure-well, that shows you it's the coward's argument.‬ DW: ‪Yep. If crazy Jerry thinks it's everyone's fault, surely it isn't.‬ Jim, as usual, is made to look like a saint. PS: Not that I want to defend Jerry in any way, but a little bit of reflection on the newsgathering and story verification process strikes me as totally in order following a botch like Genoa.‬ DW: ‪I hope that actor is at least getting some hot fanmail from this.‬ He's the biggest Mary Sue since Garth Marenghi. Sorry, I've been in the U.K. for a week and all my references are adjusting accordingly. PS: ‪Yeah, I had to Google that one.‬ DW: ‪\"Garth is the most talented entertainer I've ever worked with, and I've worked with Lulu and three other people. So we're talking creme de la creme.\"‬ End now my appeal to sell this on Region 1 DVDs. Anyway-yes, I'd like the comeuppance theme of the season, and feel that, as interesting as it was to watch Jerry go down, the lesson of this episode was not \"don't do bad journalism\" but \"don't hire Jerry.\" PS: ‪And/or: \"Even great journalists sometimes hire Jerry. And run his crap stories. But that doesn't mean they're not great journalists.\" It's rather defensive.‬ ‪In an earlier episode, Mac told the rest of the team to always ask of any story: \"Is this the best version of the argument?\" It's a good question for journos. I wish Sorkin were a little more committed to that standard himself.‬\n\n*Correction, Aug. 26, 2013: This post originally misspelled Sam Waterston's name.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Grace and Frankie's Reign of Terror Is Finally Over\n\nIt begins in the very first episode. Duane, a delivery man for the generically named Express Delivery Service, carries an oversized box up to a nice house. He waits for the woman inside to sign for the box, then cheerfully thanks her. \"And you have yourself a great day now,\" he says, and he sounds like he really means it. Maybe Duane genuinely loves his job and has made it his personal mission to spread joy to all the new people he gets to meet on his route. Maybe he's actually tired and cranky, but he's performing good old-fashioned emotional labor , putting this rich, white lady's feelings ahead of his own. Maybe he's just practicing basic common courtesy.\n\nWe don't know, because we don't know much about Duane. We don't even know if his name is Duane; despite it being stitched into his uniform, actor Maxwele D'Angelo is credited in the episode merely as Delivery Man. Whatever Duane's deal is, his reaction indicates that he certainly didn't expect how the WASP-y woman in the nice house in La Jolla would respond to his well wishes: \"Fuck you.\"\n\nAs viewers of Grace and Frankie , of course we know that that woman is Grace Hanson, played by Jane Fonda, and that she's upset because her husband Robert (Martin Sheen) just announced that he's gay and is leaving her for his business partner. We know a lot about Grace already in this first episode-that she's uptight, proud, and in pain. We know that in time she'll come to find a new life with her husband's lover's ex, Frankie, played by Lily Tomlin. And over the course of seven seasons, we'll learn even more. But Duane doesn't know any of that. Duane is just trying to get through the day. And he's but one of many unintended casualties in Grace and Frankie's adventures.\n\nThe best of movies, TV, books, music, and more, delivered to your inbox.\n\nThe life of a bit character like Delivery Man is not an easy one. They exist for mere minutes, bearing witness to the protagonists' antics, cleaning up after their hijinks, possibly creating a few of their own-and then, poof! They often vanish from the story entirely, never to be seen again.\n\nOn Grace and Frankie , though, these roles result in some of the show's most fascinating performances. In Season 4, Diona Reasonover plays a waitress who seats Frankie and her ex-husband Sol (Sam Waterston), who are wearing bunny ears. \"It's a Chili's now,\" she explains nonchalantly when the pair ask what happened to the animal testing facility they were hoping to protest. Her subsequently delivery of \"Welcome to Chili's\" is devoid of any enthusiasm, but it's not monotonous, either. It has a rehearsed, resigned, only slightly ironic amiability to it. Reasonover plays the entire scene with the same pleasant nihilism, unconcerned with the main plot of the episode, counting down the minutes until she can clock out.\n\nIn Season 5, Albert Kuo appears as yet another Delivery Man, this time one bringing Chinese food to Frankie and Robert. On this occasion, Frankie and Robert are so high they try to pay him with a photo of the money. Kuo has just a few lines, but between his dead stare and flat delivery, he creates a character at once haunted and desensitized, with a rich past spent peering into the lives of the kind of people who order too much Chinese food. The horrors he's seen!\n\nAnd these two characters are the lucky ones. You see, over the course of Grace and Frankie , the heroes find themselves battling ageism in its many forms-a crosswalk light that's too short, a beauty industry hostile to older women, children who don't respect their autonomy. But there are plenty of times when they're not so much sticking it to the man as inconveniencing a bunch of minimum wage workers who work for him. When Grace and Frankie's kids trick them into moving into a retirement home, they balk at the residence's rules, enforced by orderlies whose job it is to enforce those rules. One, after informing Grace she can't run a business from her residence, finally snaps, telling her: \"Well, I'm not a fan of working here, but Invisaligns don't pay for themselves and my girlfriend says I need them.\"\n\nAnd sometimes, the seniors displace their anger entirely, taking it out on service workers like our pal Duane who have nothing to do with the problem at hand. When Grace and Frankie finally flee the home and take refuge at a Del Taco, Frankie insists on being served at 9:52, even though the dining room closes at 10:00. Behind her, employees are mopping up, probably exhausted after a long day. She demands to talk to an absent employee, Craig, only to be informed that he is taking his SATs the next day. \"We are not leaving until we decide that it's time for us to go,\" Frankie yells at poor Bob behind the counter, even though he is not the one who sold her house out from under her-her kids did that. \"You stay as long as you like,\" he tells her nervously. Bob is not getting home at a reasonable hour that night.\n\nThe latest batch of episodes from Season 7 sees Grace and Frankie turn away from money laundering to a more relatable, more noble cause that takes them over the border to Mexico. But even there, no service worker is safe. Grace and Frankie are only in the country a few hours before trying to rope a waiter into their latest schemes-schemes that could land him in prison-when all the poor man wants to do is take their order. Fans will miss the odd couple, but at restaurants, at the DMV, at big-box hardware stores, and inside delivery trucks, the end of Grace and Frankie surely means that service workers of La Jolla are breathing a sigh of relief.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Tom Brady, You Truly Have to Be Kidding Me\n\nTom Brady announced he was retiring this week. Again. He did this once before, last February, and then he promptly un-retired, but this time, he swears he means it.\n\nIt's suspicious timing, if you ask me: This news arrives just as a major motion picture centered on a lightly fictionalized Brady is set to hit theaters. 80 for Brady , out Friday, is the story of a group of older female friends and unlikely football fans, played by an all-star cast of Sally Field, Jane Fonda, Rita Moreno, and Lily Tomlin, who make it their mission to see Brady play in 2017's Super Bowl LI. As soon as I saw the trailer, I was perplexed. It wasn't just the football as a backdrop for a bawdy comedy about aging ladies-it was the idea that any group of people would bond over their fandom of Tom Brady, specifically.\n\nI'm not much for sports, but I do know that Brady's golden-boy days are long behind him. He originally played for the University of Michigan and the New England Patriots, so if you're from Michigan or Boston, I would probably give you a pass for continuing to root for him after Deflategate (or, more damning to me, the whole Bridget Moynahan situation ). But Brady left the Patriots in 2020, and the amount of people on Team Brady had seriously dwindled by his Tampa Bay Buccaneers days. I know football fans didn't appreciate his 2022 retirement reversal. His wife of 13 years didn't seem to, either: Model Gisele Bündchen publicly questioned his decision to play another season, and the news of their divorce came not long after. I don't follow these things closely, but I'm told his final season was a disappointment to say the least. Plus, part of the plot of the movie is that all the ladies are horny for Brady? When's the last time you heard anyone talk about being hot for this guy? The only chatter about his looks I've seen lately is people speculating on whether he got his buccal fat removed .\n\nSo whose idea was it to make a movie about what a cutie patootie, gifted athlete, and all-around great fella Brady is? I got my answer a few minutes into an 80 for Brady screening. As the opening credits rolled, there it was: \"Produced by Tom Brady.\" It suddenly all made sense. I was about to watch a propaganda film designed to convince me that Tom Brady wasn't a guy who blew up his personal life and insisted on playing his sport past his glory days despite already having more money and Super Bowl rings than he knew what to do with. In fact, this film was ready to show me, he is a very nice man who even some of America's most distinguished and beloved actresses hold in high esteem. It's one thing to peddle this sort of puffery-which, lest we forget, is also part of a much larger machine of brainwashing about the NFL as an institution-but to use Rita Moreno and Lily Tomlin as human shields? I will not tolerate it.\n\nThe movie is loosely based on a true story of a group of women who formed an \"Over 80 for Brady\" club. Why the movie decided to drop the word over from its title is another discussion. 80 for Brady doesn't actually make sense as a phrase-I thought the movie might be about one of the women celebrating her 80 th birthday at the Super Bowl, which still wouldn't make a ton of sense (and for which I would offer the alternative title A Very Brady 80 ). But no, it's just that some of them are in their 80s, and they like Brady. And not all of the main characters in the movie have even reached 80 yet, as Field's character points out. (If I were Field, who is 76 in real life, I probably would have insisted on doing the same.) The characters supposedly started their group 20 years ago, when Brady was a new player and none of them would have been in their ninth decade yet, so there's really no reason that they would call themselves \"80 for Brady.\" Tom, I know this is your first time producing a movie, but this is just sloppy.\n\nBrady-who, I should point out, in all likelihood probably had very little to do with making this movie-did get a few things right, and as agitprop goes, the movie isn't a terrible time. Field, Fonda, Moreno, and Tomlin are fun to watch, even when the movie's plot makes very little sense and I have the feeling that there's something patronizing about our society's embrace of the \"old ladies 'n' hijinks\" genre. I did not like watching Brady, who appears several times in the film, offer inspirational advice (\"You fight and you never give up\"), but I am not immune to the charms of Moreno getting high and hallucinating that she is playing a poker game against a gaggle of people who all have Guy Fieri's face. Notice how that has nothing to do with football.\n\nWith Brady retiring for real, I can already sense some of the animosity toward him fading away: His former team wants to invite him back with a one-day contract , so he can retire as a Patriot. Even Gisele seems to be softening toward him . And here's this reputation-laundering movie just a few days later. (I wonder if there was an earlier cut of this movie that Gisele appeared in and had to be edited out of.) Well, I'm not buying it. I know you get away with everything, Tom, but you're not gonna get away with making a movie about how great you are without getting a little shit for it, even if it's just from me.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Grace and Frankie Is a Sneakily Moving Twist on the Odd-Couple Trope\n\nPhoto by Melissa Moseley - © 2015 Netflix\n\nNeil Simon's 1965 play The Odd Couple showed what could happen if a man, asked by his wife to vacate the family home, sought refuge in the Manhattan apartment of an old friend whose attitudes and habits were totally different from his own. Fifty years later, Grace and Frankie also looks at the consequences of a marital rift: Having been informed that their husbands of 40 years are partners in life as well as in business, two women with very different dispositions and values find themselves sharing a gorgeous Southern California beach house. Does hilarity ensue this time around? Not exactly, but Netflix's new 13-episode series, which will be released in its entirety on Friday, is a very modern, surprisingly endearing, twist on the now familiar odd-couple setup.\n\nType A Grace (Jane Fonda) finds herself stuck with a roommate she's never been able to stand: a hippy-dippy artist who reeks of medical marijuana, goes on peyote-assisted vision quests, and teaches painting to ex-cons. Grace is angry at Robert (Martin Sheen), whose coming out has shattered the perfect life she's gone to such lengths to create (\"It would have been easier if you'd died,\" she tells him), while Frankie (Lily Tomlin) is heartsick to have lost the companionship of Sol (Sam Waterston), her dearest friend. A few episodes in, as they leave a funeral that has also served as Robert and Sol's coming-out party, Frankie automatically gets into Sol's car when he pulls up to the curb. It's hard to break a 40-year habit, especially when you still love the man behind the wheel.\n\nBreakup is a tricky topic for humor-broken hearts and shattered dreams rarely trigger laughing jags-but when the couples are all in their 70s, extra levels of vulnerability could get in the way of glee. Grace and Frankie explores several age-related storylines, showing how easily old women are rendered invisible, how often their points of view are declared irrelevant, and how fragile their bodies are, no matter how great they look. Somehow, Fonda-uptight, taut, and self-denying (Grace lives on chicken breasts and vodka)-seems particularly vulnerable. Early in the pilot, she has her very own How to Get Away With Murder moment , when she sits in front of the mirror and removes her hair extensions and false eyelashes, an act that leaves her exposed in all kinds of ways. A few episodes later, a moment's inattention provokes a more serious health scare. Apparently, being rich, white, and skinny doesn't render your hips less brittle than any another 70-year-old's.\n\nIf this all seems grim and gloomy, take another look at that cast. Tomlin, an amazing physical comedian, routinely elevates second-rate jokes to first-class laugh lines, even in the pilot-the most cliché-ridden and least funny of the six episodes Netflix released to critics. Fonda arms her character with such a high-voltage force field of privilege and invincibility that when she allows Grace's true feelings and frailties to show through, those moments feel shockingly intimate. After years of watching Waterston as a gruff prosecutor on Law & Order and a blustery broadcaster in The Newsroom , I was surprised to see how good he is as a big-hearted goofball-albeit a goofball with a successful law practice and an amazing real-estate portfolio. I'm not so sure how to read Martin Sheen's performance. Is he uncomfortable to be playing a gay man, or is his awkwardness a projection of Robert's unease? Given Sheen's track record, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. After all, there's more to living as a proud gay man than making one announcement, and having spent 40 years as the spouse of woman who always behaves perfectly, it isn't surprising that Robert would find it embarrassing to be partnered with a guy who wears sneakers to a funeral. \"You're not doing anything right,\" he tells Sol at one point, meaning, \" You're not behaving like Grace .\"\n\nRobert and Sol have been engaged in an illicit affair for 20 years, but now they can be wed, and they want to live openly as a married couple. It's important that Grace and Frankie should also be the story of Robert and Sol: As the women adjust to life without a husband, their former spouses are learning what it's like to have one. There's something very of the moment about this story line-not so much because same-sex marriage is now an option, but in the way it acknowledges how awkward it is for a certain kind of liberal when family members whose behavior they'd love to criticize turn out to be gay. At a dinner the newly out lovers host for their four children, the thirtysomething kids complain bitterly about how annoying it is that they're not allowed to be annoyed. And somehow the abandoned spouses manage to express their hurt and anger without being homophobic-even when, filling out an online dating profile, Grace says her biggest turn on in a man is \"that he's not gay.\"\n\nIt's hard to resist the urge to compare Grace and Frankie with Transparent , another show about family members dealing with a surprising piece of news from someone they thought they'd figured out long ago. Grace and Frankie lacks the specificity of Transparent : These characters are typical TV types-rich, liberal lawyers and high-flying businesswomen whose kids might struggle with addiction or fall for the wrong guy but are basically kind and well-adjusted: a different breed from the tormented, all-too-real Pfeffermans. But there's room for more than one story about starting over late in life, and there's a deceptive profundity to Grace and Frankie . Oscar Madison and Felix Ungar could never have dreamed of such adventures.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Book Club isn't the flashiest movie of the year. But it's one of the sweetest.\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nIt's a long, lazy afternoon of a movie. That's a good thing.\n\nby Emily St. James\n\nBook Club is more of an afternoon than a movie. It's warm and a little sleepy, and if you nodded off here and there, well, that wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. It would go best with a big blanket and a glass of wine. This is a compliment.\n\nI can see where you'd think Book Club doesn't deserve the compliment, at least looking at it from the outside. The movie is undeniably cheesy. It frequently uses fake-looking backdrops and rear projection to simulate the effect of driving a car or flying a plane. Whatever expenses the movie had to spare were mostly spent on its (admittedly terrific and stacked) cast, leaving less for the design of the film than you might expect for a movie sharing a playground with Nancy Meyers , she of Something's Gotta Give and It's Complicated .\n\nVox Rating:\n\n3.5 out of 5\n\nWhat's more, director Bill Holderman (who also co-wrote the charming script with Erin Simms ) pretty much just points his camera at the actors and lets them talk. If you're looking for a movie with any visual flair at all, Book Club isn't really for you.\n\nBut the movie is sneakily great, too. Holderman and Simms's screenplay is thoughtful and surprisingly moving in places, especially when you consider that its base premise is \"a book club of women in their later years decide to read Fifty Shades of Grey .\" (The premise might seem a little dated, but the movie presents it as a sort of \"last resort\" for the book club, which helps it slide by your defenses.)\n\nAnd when the central four women are played by Diane Keaton , Jane Fonda , Candice Bergen , and Mary Steenburgen - and the rest of the cast is stuffed with ringers - well, it doesn't matter if the camerawork isn't especially vibrant.\n\nThe reason Book Club works is because of how completely Holderman understands that the movie is best served by staying out of the way of his cast. I've seen so many ensemble movies in the past decade that don't seem to understand that the way to build an ensemble is to put the actors in the same frame and let them act together. So many of these movies are shot in close-ups on the actors' faces, which might help them emote on an individual level but does little to underline connections between them.\n\nBut it's different when Holderman and his cast get to one of the handful of meetings with the full book club that pepper the movie. Those scenes always sing because the director and actors work the connections among the various players, building relationships in the precious little time they have.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nIt's a long, lazy afternoon of a movie. That's a good thing.\n\nby Emily St. James\n\nBook Club is more of an afternoon than a movie. It's warm and a little sleepy, and if you nodded off here and there, well, that wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. It would go best with a big blanket and a glass of wine. This is a compliment.\n\nI can see where you'd think Book Club doesn't deserve the compliment, at least looking at it from the outside. The movie is undeniably cheesy. It frequently uses fake-looking backdrops and rear projection to simulate the effect of driving a car or flying a plane. Whatever expenses the movie had to spare were mostly spent on its (admittedly terrific and stacked) cast, leaving less for the design of the film than you might expect for a movie sharing a playground with Nancy Meyers , she of Something's Gotta Give and It's Complicated .\n\nVox Rating:\n\n3.5 out of 5\n\nWhat's more, director Bill Holderman (who also co-wrote the charming script with Erin Simms ) pretty much just points his camera at the actors and lets them talk. If you're looking for a movie with any visual flair at all, Book Club isn't really for you.\n\nBut the movie is sneakily great, too. Holderman and Simms's screenplay is thoughtful and surprisingly moving in places, especially when you consider that its base premise is \"a book club of women in their later years decide to read Fifty Shades of Grey .\" (The premise might seem a little dated, but the movie presents it as a sort of \"last resort\" for the book club, which helps it slide by your defenses.)\n\nAnd when the central four women are played by Diane Keaton , Jane Fonda , Candice Bergen , and Mary Steenburgen - and the rest of the cast is stuffed with ringers - well, it doesn't matter if the camerawork isn't especially vibrant.\n\nThe reason Book Club works is because of how completely Holderman understands that the movie is best served by staying out of the way of his cast. I've seen so many ensemble movies in the past decade that don't seem to understand that the way to build an ensemble is to put the actors in the same frame and let them act together. So many of these movies are shot in close-ups on the actors' faces, which might help them emote on an individual level but does little to underline connections between them.\n\nBut it's different when Holderman and his cast get to one of the handful of meetings with the full book club that pepper the movie. Those scenes always sing because the director and actors work the connections among the various players, building relationships in the precious little time they have. Book Club is structured so that each of the four women has her own storyline, involving her own search for sexual and romantic gratification. Holderman gets that the best way to enhance their chemistry is to make the most of the scenes featuring all the characters.\n\nAnd he'll put them in two-shots or wide shots featuring the whole ensemble, or he'll have the actors move around and into frame with each other to facilitate building those relationships.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby Emily St. James\n\nNetflix's latest original comedy series, Grace and Frankie , is an oddly airless thing. It's the sort of show that you might nod off to during a warm weekend afternoon, waking up a few episodes later to realize very little has changed but feeling sort of pleased by that fact. (You can watch the first season here .)\n\nRating\n\nThe two older women in the title (played by Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin ) learn that their husbands, Robert and Sol ( Martin Sheen and Sam Waterston ), are gay and having a relationship with each other. The series struggles to feel like it has any dramatic weight at all, constantly at threat of floating off into the ether. But that, paradoxically, is what makes it so good to take a nap to.\n\nI don't know if I mean \"TV that's good to take a nap to\" as a compliment, but there's something weirdly appealing about a show so ephemeral. It floats right by you, best consumed in a couple of large gulps, as most Netflix shows usually are.\n\nAnd somewhere around episode eight or nine of the first season, I realized that Grace and Frankie was a hangout sitcom about older people. In and of itself, that's not a bad idea, but the show is constantly defeated by some of the hangout sitcom's worst qualities.\n\nBut what do I mean by a hangout sitcom?\n\nIt's not so bad hanging out with Frankie (Lily Tomlin, left) and Grace (Jane Fonda), right?\n\nThe progenitor of the genre is probably Seinfeld , though that show's tricky storytelling structure doesn't make it an easy fit with the many, many shows it has inspired. A more likely inspiration is Friends , a series where the drama rarely got too thick on the ground and the primary storytelling style could be best described as \"easygoing.\"\n\nThat series also introduced the idea of romantic relationships between the characters acting as the primary engine driving conflict in the show. Just when viewers were tired of Ross and Rachel, it was time to switch over to Chandler and Monica, and then, later, Joey and Rachel. The show ran for 10 years based almost entirely on these various romantic permutations.\n\nAnd lo and behold, Grace and Frankie 's co-creator (with Howard J. Morris ) is Friends ' own Marta Kauffman . And similarly to her earlier show, Grace and Frankie eventually turns into a series of relationship plot lines, balanced with overwritten jokes that don't feel like the characters talking but, rather, the writers behind the series dropping those words in their mouths, straining to be as clever as possible.\n\nThe show Grace and Frankie is most like is probably the late-1990s sitcom Dharma and Greg , in that it's about a kooky free spirit paired with a more uptight, conservative type, but the show makes less of this than you might expect.\n\nBecause of its premise, Grace and Frankie can't really be about the characters trying out the many different romantic dynamics of their little group. Outside of Grace, Frankie, and their ex-husbands, the only other characters are the women's four children (two sons for Frankie, two daughters for Grace).\n\nAnd even there, things have been set up to minimize potential romantic connections as much as possible. Grace's daughter Mallory ( Brooklyn Decker ) was once the obsession of Frankie's son Coyote ( Ethan Embry ), but that's all in the past. She's (seemingly happily) married now, minimizing the chances of potentially dramatic ruptures.\n\nSo despite the high-concept premise at the show's center, Grace and Frankie eventually settles into a low-level hum, rather than a pitched roar. It doesn't want to be anything too exciting. And therein lies the problem.\n\nMartin Sheen (left) and Sam Waterston play longtime law partners who fall in love.\n\nIn the first episode, Grace and Frankie learn that their husbands have been sleeping together for 20 years and now wish to get married to each other. To the show's credit, it mines some of the inherent tension in the two women feeling wronged, while still attempting to understand their husbands' wishes to be happy. In the show's best scenes, it finds a way to feel for all of its characters and treat them humanely.\n\nThe problem is that the series drops much of its conflict throughout. It's not that Grace and Frankie immediately forgive their husbands, but in trying to be at least somewhat understanding, the pair's anger is more of a low simmer than anything that boils over. Similarly, the two women - presented as polar opposites in the pilot - set aside their differences so quickly that the show barely bothers to examine the inherent conflict in their attempts to live together in the beach house their families co-own.\n\nMeanwhile, their exes, Robert and Sol, are trying to finally live in the open together, but because of the show's weird, bifurcated structure (split between them and their ex-wives), neither story of moving on with life as an older person gets as much time to really breathe as it needs.\n\nThere are individual episodes where things land. The show's fourth episode, written by the great comedy writer Alexa Junge , takes place at a funeral and gives full weight to everybody's emotions, as does the surprisingly lovely seventh episode, centered on all of the characters watching the National Spelling Bee, whether together or apart.\n\nOn the whole, however, the show simultaneously feels like it has too much going on - in that there are eight regulars to service, all with their own season-long story arcs - and too little - in that there's rarely any real conflict between the characters. In the grand tradition of hangout sitcoms, most of the conflict is suggested, rather than outright presented to the audience, lest the breezy, beachside vibe of the show dissipate.\n\nEven that might be okay if the show truly committed to its internal drama or came up with great jokes, delivered at a lightning-fast pace (which is how most good hangout sitcoms handle their lack of conflict). But Grace and Frankie tries to split the difference here, too, and that's what ultimately hurts it.\n\nStill, the romantic chemistry between Sheen and Waterston leaves much to be desired.\n\nBy far the thing that most gives Grace and Frankie its peculiarly airless feeling is the fact that it's obviously written by writers who are used to working with a live studio audience. The punchlines come on such a regular schedule (particularly in the earlier, weaker episodes) that you could set your watch to them, and there are frequent pauses after them, the actors holding for laughter that never comes.\n\nThe problem here is that the show is shot not like a stage play (as, say, Friends was) but like a movie (as many other hangout sitcoms, including New Girl and Happy Endings have been), and when a sitcom is shot like a movie, it has to compensate for the lack of audience laughter somehow. Most sitcoms do this by amping up the pace to blistering, then patching over the spaces between jokes with lightning-fast editing and quirky music or sound effects. This has the subconscious effect of making the audience feel like it should be laughing, even if the material isn't all that funny.\n\nBut Grace and Frankie can never decide if it wants to be an outright sitcom or more of an HBO-style dramedy. Of the two styles, it has more success with the latter. At the very least, there are some affecting scenes as the characters struggle to understand what their lives will be like going forward.\n\nBut a dramedy usually needs a stronger story hook, and Grace and Frankie 's is simply endless repetitions of its premise, then a reminder that Frankie is kind of a hippie and Grace is buttoned-up. Any moments with genuine feeling are quickly undercut by lots of hacky jokes followed by a silence meant to be filled by laughter.\n\nThere are certainly worse sitcoms out there than Grace and Frankie , and it's pleasant enough to watch. But its ultimate effect is similar to the frequent sounds of ocean waves that play in the background of many scenes. It's simply a constant, undulating presence, one that eventually and ultimately lulls you to a peaceful sleep.\n\nThe first season of Grace and Frankie is now streaming on Netflix.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nHow Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.\n\nDJs, club owners, and patrons alike say there's way too much standing around.\n\nAstrology's enormous appeal, explained for believers and skeptics.\n\nThe surprising truth about milk is hiding in plain sight.\n\n﻿From Dunkin' deodorant to Sabrina Carpenter perfume, smelling good isn't enough - it's all about smelling edible.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

The three stars of the hit '80s film 9 to 5 minced few words in terms of implying that President Trump is a sexist bigot.\n\nAfter the Hollywood legends were greeted with an instant standing ovation from the audience at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, the perpetually luminous Parton kicked things off by commenting that she'd been wanting a reunion of the famously feminist farce ever since its 1980 release. And Fonda, the most notoriously outspoken of the trio, ran with the movie's theme of standing up to sexism, noting, \"Back in 1980, in that movie, we refused to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot.\"\n\nTomlin then followed up Fonda's quip with, \"And in 2017, we still refuse to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot.\"\n\nThe women were onstage to present the award for Best Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie, but each was up for an Emmy herself . Parton was nominated in the TV movie category for her autobiographical Dolly Parton's Christmas of Many Colors: Circle of Love (though she ultimately lost to Black Mirror's \" San Junipero.\") And Tomlin and Fonda were both nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for their Netflix comedy Grace and Frankie (they lost to Julia Louis-Dreyfus's record-breaking Veep sweep). Though none of the three took home an Emmy on Sunday, they stole the spotlight from many of the evening's other contenders.\n\nThe attention getter, predictably, was Parton, who trended briefly worldwide on Twitter following the presentation. \"If it hadn't been for good support,\" she said, comparing the Supporting Actor category to her famously voluptuous cleavage, \"Shock and Awe here would be more like Flopsy and Droopy.\" About Grace and Frankie , she joked, \"I'm just hoping that I am going to get one of those Grace and Frankie vibrators in my swag bag today\" - referring to the show's viral season two sex toy gag .\n\nClearly, these women haven't lost their knack for comedy, either within or outside of regular business hours.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nHow Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.\n\nDJs, club owners, and patrons alike say there's way too much standing around.\n\nAstrology's enormous appeal, explained for believers and skeptics.\n\nThe surprising truth about milk is hiding in plain sight.\n\n﻿From Dunkin' deodorant to Sabrina Carpenter perfume, smelling good isn't enough - it's all about smelling edible.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe series has become the gentle comfort food TV you need right now.\n\nby Emily St. James\n\nGrace and Frankie is a WB show.\n\nRating\n\nYou remember The WB , right? The short-lived TV network achieved considerable, if fleeting, fame in the late 1990s and early 2000s through programming marketed to teens and 20-somethings. It was the home of Dawson's Creek and 7th Heaven , of Gilmore Girls and the first five seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer .\n\nEventually, the network was folded into The CW, where some strands of its DNA survive to this day. But the kinds of shows The WB produced in its heyday largely just don't exist anymore. They're too tiny, too low-conflict, for a TV universe that thrives on big, dramatic stakes. You can find shows that are vaguely similar on Freeform (formerly known as ABC Family); I'm thinking specifically of Switched at Birth and The Fosters . But for the most part, TV has moved past this kind of low-key programming.\n\nExcept for on Netflix, apparently. Grace and Frankie may not be perfect, but it has a gentle hangout vibe that sets it apart from most other shows on the air right now. There's little conflict, even very little angst. It's mostly an excuse to watch talented, older actors enact quiet tales of what life is like once reach your twilight years. It's as if, say, The WB's Everwood were suddenly remade with a very different target demographic in mind.\n\nThe show won't appeal to everybody. Indeed, its first season didn't really work for me . But I found its second season - which just hit Netflix this week - to be a mostly charming antidote to a lot of the rest of television. Here are five reasons why.\n\nGrace and Frankie centers on two older women (their names are in the title) who are forced to cohabitate when their respective husbands confess they've been gay lovers for decades and now wish to marry while they still have some time left on the planet. Grace and Frankie are understandably rocked by the news - they're all for marriage equality, but not necessarily if it has to apply to them.\n\nThat high-concept premise tanked roughly the first half of the show's first season. It was just so much for the characters to deal with, and the show's frequently sitcom-y jokes didn't help; it often seemed like they were written with enough extra space for a live studio audience to laugh and punctuate their banality. ( Grace and Frankie was created by sitcom vets Marta Kauffman - the co-creator of Friends - and Howard J. Morris .)\n\nIn short, the series' premise didn't align with its tone. Finding out after many years of marriage that your husband is not only gay but divorcing you so he can marry the man he's been having an affair with - that's a pretty seismic event. And yet Grace and Frankie felt fairly small and low-stakes. Its plotting was straight out of the American sitcom playbook, reverting to the status quo most episodes and punctuating emotional outbursts with easy jokes.\n\nHowever, as the series has progressed, it's slowly figured out how to handle its heavier material. In season two, as Grace and Frankie get further and further away from their divorces, they're able to see how much their exes love and care about each other, which helps them realize that remaining in their repressed marriages was hurting them as well.\n\nGenerally, the show is more soothing and slower-paced than most other TV. But the characters occasionally blister, erupting in anger or sadness, and that emotional honesty gives the show the weight it might otherwise seem to be lacking. Grace and Frankie takes its characters seriously, and its emotional stakes are finally in line with its tone.\n\nWatching Grace and Frankie often feels like going shopping for apples at a New England farmers market, like living in a lighthouse with a gorgeous view of the ocean, or like being an elderly British woman who solves mysteries with her cat. It's a calming, charming good time, one that doesn't strain for effort. Even the jokes don't try too hard to make you laugh. They just fall into the rhythm of conversation.\n\nIn that sense, the series makes for one of the better binge watches in recent memory. It doesn't push its story too much, and you can turn off Netflix in the middle of an episode - in the middle of a scene, even! - and resume watching three days later without missing much. It's less about plot or character than it is about vibe, about feeling like you're hanging out with these people as they sit on the beach.\n\nTo that end, the series' visual palette is similarly tranquil. It uses mostly muted colors, and many scenes are shot in soft-focus wide shots, to let in more of the gentle ambience. When the camera zooms in for the close-up on a character in one of those blistering moments, the results can devastate, but most of the time the show is happy to just hang back and take in the good times.\n\nThe big event of the first half of season two is that Frankie and her ex-husband, Sol, are dealing with the fact that they slept together near the end of season one, when they were cleaning out the home they shared as a married couple. In the midst of heightened emotion, they gave in to passion. Now both are afraid to tell Sol's soon-to-be husband (and Grace's ex), Robert, what happened, for obvious reasons.\n\nThis conflict drives much of Grace and Frankie 's second season. Other storylines involve Frankie going into business with Grace's daughter, Grace considering reconnecting with a man she had a flirtation with in the past, and Robert dealing with a health scare.\n\nNone of these stories are hugely dramatic, but that's fine. Very few of us live lives filled with constant drama, and TV occasionally skews too far away from presenting these sorts of realistic scenarios. Even the show's jokes have gotten softer. They're still there, but the sitcom setups are gone; they're mostly just pleasant, like everything else.\n\nI've so far avoided mentioning that Grace and Frankie 's central four roles are played by Jane Fonda (Grace), Lily Tomlin (Frankie), Sam Waterston (Sol), and Martin Sheen (Robert). But if anything has kept me tuning in during the series' rough patches, it's the fact that these excellent actors rarely get material this meaningful or meaty as they age.\n\nAnd season two allows them to dig in ever deeper. In particular, Fonda's portrayal of Grace is a lovely little thing, never pushing too far into outright brittleness while still allowing Grace to be incredibly hard to put up with. As the season goes on - and her life unravels more and more - Fonda plays Grace as someone who continues to struggle with the fact that she's been given a second chance at life, no matter how welcome or unwelcome.\n\nI should also pause to recognize the show's younger, supporting cast members, including June Diane Raphael and Brooklyn Decker as Grace and Robert's two daughters. Grace and Frankie is rarely as interested in their lives as it is in the lives of its four main characters, but every time it drops in on them, they bring their best stuff.\n\nGrace and Frankie 's characters have witnessed huge amounts of social change in their lifetimes. Sol and Robert went from having to keep their affair a deep, dark secret to getting married in broad daylight, with most of their friends and family welcoming their relationship (once they came to terms with the inherent deception, of course).\n\nIndeed, some of the most moving moments of Grace and Frankie 's second season involve Sol and Robert resolving to not let more of their lives pass by without being with each other, openly and honestly. And yet that doesn't come naturally for them. They lived in hiding for so long that being out can feel like a kind of performance. The show even subtly emphasizes how neither feels entirely comfortable with the sorts of things that are considered the stereotypical pursuits of gay men.\n\nAt its core, Grace and Frankie understands that life is long, and that the sweeping societal changes that many younger folks view as a matter of course can feel like major upheavals to those who are older. By staying keyed in to its characters' emotions and remaining true to their psychologies, Grace and Frankie can open our eyes to how it can feel to suddenly, late in life, have everything change.\n\nGrace and Frankie is streaming on Netflix .\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nHow Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.\n\nDJs, club owners, and patrons alike say there's way too much standing around.\n\nAstrology's enormous appeal, explained for believers and skeptics.\n\nThe surprising truth about milk is hiding in plain sight.\n\n﻿From Dunkin' deodorant to Sabrina Carpenter perfume, smelling good isn't enough - it's all about smelling edible.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

It was the home of Dawson's Creek and 7th Heaven , of Gilmore Girls and the first five seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer .\n\nEventually, the network was folded into The CW, where some strands of its DNA survive to this day. But the kinds of shows The WB produced in its heyday largely just don't exist anymore. They're too tiny, too low-conflict, for a TV universe that thrives on big, dramatic stakes. You can find shows that are vaguely similar on Freeform (formerly known as ABC Family); I'm thinking specifically of Switched at Birth and The Fosters . But for the most part, TV has moved past this kind of low-key programming.\n\nExcept for on Netflix, apparently. Grace and Frankie may not be perfect, but it has a gentle hangout vibe that sets it apart from most other shows on the air right now. There's little conflict, even very little angst. It's mostly an excuse to watch talented, older actors enact quiet tales of what life is like once reach your twilight years. It's as if, say, The WB's Everwood were suddenly remade with a very different target demographic in mind.\n\nThe show won't appeal to everybody. Indeed, its first season didn't really work for me . But I found its second season - which just hit Netflix this week - to be a mostly charming antidote to a lot of the rest of television. Here are five reasons why.\n\nGrace and Frankie centers on two older women (their names are in the title) who are forced to cohabitate when their respective husbands confess they've been gay lovers for decades and now wish to marry while they still have some time left on the planet. Grace and Frankie are understandably rocked by the news - they're all for marriage equality, but not necessarily if it has to apply to them.\n\nThat high-concept premise tanked roughly the first half of the show's first season. It was just so much for the characters to deal with, and the show's frequently sitcom-y jokes didn't help; it often seemed like they were written with enough extra space for a live studio audience to laugh and punctuate their banality. ( Grace and Frankie was created by sitcom vets Marta Kauffman - the co-creator of Friends - and Howard J. Morris .)\n\nIn short, the series' premise didn't align with its tone. Finding out after many years of marriage that your husband is not only gay but divorcing you so he can marry the man he's been having an affair with - that's a pretty seismic event. And yet Grace and Frankie felt fairly small and low-stakes. Its plotting was straight out of the American sitcom playbook, reverting to the status quo most episodes and punctuating emotional outbursts with easy jokes.\n\nHowever, as the series has progressed, it's slowly figured out how to handle its heavier material. In season two, as Grace and Frankie get further and further away from their divorces, they're able to see how much their exes love and care about each other, which helps them realize that remaining in their repressed marriages was hurting them as well.\n\nGenerally, the show is more soothing and slower-paced than most other TV. But the characters occasionally blister, erupting in anger or sadness, and that emotional honesty gives the show the weight it might otherwise seem to be lacking. Grace and Frankie takes its characters seriously, and its emotional stakes are finally in line with its tone.\n\nWatching Grace and Frankie often feels like going shopping for apples at a New England farmers market, like living in a lighthouse with a gorgeous view of the ocean, or like being an elderly British woman who solves mysteries with her cat. It's a calming, charming good time, one that doesn't strain for effort. Even the jokes don't try too hard to make you laugh. They just fall into the rhythm of conversation.\n\nIn that sense, the series makes for one of the better binge watches in recent memory. It doesn't push its story too much, and you can turn off Netflix in the middle of an episode - in the middle of a scene, even! - and resume watching three days later without missing much. It's less about plot or character than it is about vibe, about feeling like you're hanging out with these people as they sit on the beach.\n\nTo that end, the series' visual palette is similarly tranquil. It uses mostly muted colors, and many scenes are shot in soft-focus wide shots, to let in more of the gentle ambience. When the camera zooms in for the close-up on a character in one of those blistering moments, the results can devastate, but most of the time the show is happy to just hang back and take in the good times.\n\nThe big event of the first half of season two is that Frankie and her ex-husband, Sol, are dealing with the fact that they slept together near the end of season one, when they were cleaning out the home they shared as a married couple. In the midst of heightened emotion, they gave in to passion. Now both are afraid to tell Sol's soon-to-be husband (and Grace's ex), Robert, what happened, for obvious reasons.\n\nThis conflict drives much of Grace and Frankie 's second season. Other storylines involve Frankie going into business with Grace's daughter, Grace considering reconnecting with a man she had a flirtation with in the past, and Robert dealing with a health scare.\n\nNone of these stories are hugely dramatic, but that's fine. Very few of us live lives filled with constant drama, and TV occasionally skews too far away from presenting these sorts of realistic scenarios. Even the show's jokes have gotten softer. They're still there, but the sitcom setups are gone; they're mostly just pleasant, like everything else.\n\nI've so far avoided mentioning that Grace and Frankie 's central four roles are played by Jane Fonda (Grace), Lily Tomlin (Frankie), Sam Waterston (Sol), and Martin Sheen (Robert). But if anything has kept me tuning in during the series' rough patches, it's the fact that these excellent actors rarely get material this meaningful or meaty as they age.\n\nAnd season two allows them to dig in ever deeper. In particular, Fonda's portrayal of Grace is a lovely little thing, never pushing too far into outright brittleness while still allowing Grace to be incredibly hard to put up with. As the season goes on - and her life unravels more and more - Fonda plays Grace as someone who continues to struggle with the fact that she's been given a second chance at life, no matter how welcome or unwelcome.\n\nI should also pause to recognize the show's younger, supporting cast members, including June Diane Raphael and Brooklyn Decker as Grace and Robert's two daughters. Grace and Frankie is rarely as interested in their lives as it is in the lives of its four main characters, but every time it drops in on them, they bring their best stuff.\n\nGrace and Frankie 's characters have witnessed huge amounts of social change in their lifetimes. Sol and Robert went from having to keep their affair a deep, dark secret to getting married in broad daylight, with most of their friends and family welcoming their relationship (once they came to terms with the inherent deception, of course).\n\nIndeed, some of the most moving moments of Grace and Frankie 's second season involve Sol and Robert resolving to not let more of their lives pass by without being with each other, openly and honestly. And yet that doesn't come naturally for them. They lived in hiding for so long that being out can feel like a kind of performance. The show even subtly emphasizes how neither feels entirely comfortable with the sorts of things that are considered the stereotypical pursuits of gay men.\n\nAt its core, Grace and Frankie understands that life is long, and that the sweeping societal changes that many younger folks view as a matter of course can feel like major upheavals to those who are older. By staying keyed in to its characters' emotions and remaining true to their psychologies, Grace and Frankie can open our eyes to how it can feel to suddenly, late in life, have everything change.\n\nGrace and Frankie is streaming on Netflix .\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nHow Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.\n\nDJs, club owners, and patrons alike say there's way too much standing around.\n\nAstrology's enormous appeal, explained for believers and skeptics.\n\nThe surprising truth about milk is hiding in plain sight.\n\n﻿From Dunkin' deodorant to Sabrina Carpenter perfume, smelling good isn't enough - it's all about smelling edible.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby Emily St. James\n\nNetflix's latest original comedy series, Grace and Frankie , is an oddly airless thing. It's the sort of show that you might nod off to during a warm weekend afternoon, waking up a few episodes later to realize very little has changed but feeling sort of pleased by that fact. (You can watch the first season here .)\n\nRating\n\nThe two older women in the title (played by Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin ) learn that their husbands, Robert and Sol ( Martin Sheen and Sam Waterston ), are gay and having a relationship with each other. The series struggles to feel like it has any dramatic weight at all, constantly at threat of floating off into the ether. But that, paradoxically, is what makes it so good to take a nap to.\n\nI don't know if I mean \"TV that's good to take a nap to\" as a compliment, but there's something weirdly appealing about a show so ephemeral. It floats right by you, best consumed in a couple of large gulps, as most Netflix shows usually are.\n\nAnd somewhere around episode eight or nine of the first season, I realized that Grace and Frankie was a hangout sitcom about older people. In and of itself, that's not a bad idea, but the show is constantly defeated by some of the hangout sitcom's worst qualities.\n\nBut what do I mean by a hangout sitcom?\n\nIt's not so bad hanging out with Frankie (Lily Tomlin, left) and Grace (Jane Fonda), right?\n\nThe progenitor of the genre is probably Seinfeld , though that show's tricky storytelling structure doesn't make it an easy fit with the many, many shows it has inspired. A more likely inspiration is Friends , a series where the drama rarely got too thick on the ground and the primary storytelling style could be best described as \"easygoing.\"\n\nThat series also introduced the idea of romantic relationships between the characters acting as the primary engine driving conflict in the show. Just when viewers were tired of Ross and Rachel, it was time to switch over to Chandler and Monica, and then, later, Joey and Rachel. The show ran for 10 years based almost entirely on these various romantic permutations.\n\nAnd lo and behold, Grace and Frankie 's co-creator (with Howard J. Morris ) is Friends ' own Marta Kauffman . And similarly to her earlier show, Grace and Frankie eventually turns into a series of relationship plot lines, balanced with overwritten jokes that don't feel like the characters talking but, rather, the writers behind the series dropping those words in their mouths, straining to be as clever as possible.\n\nThe show Grace and Frankie is most like is probably the late-1990s sitcom Dharma and Greg , in that it's about a kooky free spirit paired with a more uptight, conservative type, but the show makes less of this than you might expect.\n\nBecause of its premise, Grace and Frankie can't really be about the characters trying out the many different romantic dynamics of their little group. Outside of Grace, Frankie, and their ex-husbands, the only other characters are the women's four children (two sons for Frankie, two daughters for Grace).\n\nAnd even there, things have been set up to minimize potential romantic connections as much as possible. Grace's daughter Mallory ( Brooklyn Decker ) was once the obsession of Frankie's son Coyote ( Ethan Embry ), but that's all in the past. She's (seemingly happily) married now, minimizing the chances of potentially dramatic ruptures.\n\nSo despite the high-concept premise at the show's center, Grace and Frankie eventually settles into a low-level hum, rather than a pitched roar. It doesn't want to be anything too exciting. And therein lies the problem.\n\nMartin Sheen (left) and Sam Waterston play longtime law partners who fall in love.\n\nIn the first episode, Grace and Frankie learn that their husbands have been sleeping together for 20 years and now wish to get married to each other. To the show's credit, it mines some of the inherent tension in the two women feeling wronged, while still attempting to understand their husbands' wishes to be happy. In the show's best scenes, it finds a way to feel for all of its characters and treat them humanely.\n\nThe problem is that the series drops much of its conflict throughout. It's not that Grace and Frankie immediately forgive their husbands, but in trying to be at least somewhat understanding, the pair's anger is more of a low simmer than anything that boils over. Similarly, the two women - presented as polar opposites in the pilot - set aside their differences so quickly that the show barely bothers to examine the inherent conflict in their attempts to live together in the beach house their families co-own.\n\nMeanwhile, their exes, Robert and Sol, are trying to finally live in the open together, but because of the show's weird, bifurcated structure (split between them and their ex-wives), neither story of moving on with life as an older person gets as much time to really breathe as it needs.\n\nThere are individual episodes where things land. The show's fourth episode, written by the great comedy writer Alexa Junge , takes place at a funeral and gives full weight to everybody's emotions, as does the surprisingly lovely seventh episode, centered on all of the characters watching the National Spelling Bee, whether together or apart.\n\nOn the whole, however, the show simultaneously feels like it has too much going on - in that there are eight regulars to service, all with their own season-long story arcs - and too little - in that there's rarely any real conflict between the characters. In the grand tradition of hangout sitcoms, most of the conflict is suggested, rather than outright presented to the audience, lest the breezy, beachside vibe of the show dissipate.\n\nEven that might be okay if the show truly committed to its internal drama or came up with great jokes, delivered at a lightning-fast pace (which is how most good hangout sitcoms handle their lack of conflict). But Grace and Frankie tries to split the difference here, too, and that's what ultimately hurts it.\n\nStill, the romantic chemistry between Sheen and Waterston leaves much to be desired.\n\nBy far the thing that most gives Grace and Frankie its peculiarly airless feeling is the fact that it's obviously written by writers who are used to working with a live studio audience. The punchlines come on such a regular schedule (particularly in the earlier, weaker episodes) that you could set your watch to them, and there are frequent pauses after them, the actors holding for laughter that never comes.\n\nThe problem here is that the show is shot not like a stage play (as, say, Friends was) but like a movie (as many other hangout sitcoms, including New Girl and Happy Endings have been), and when a sitcom is shot like a movie, it has to compensate for the lack of audience laughter somehow. Most sitcoms do this by amping up the pace to blistering, then patching over the spaces between jokes with lightning-fast editing and quirky music or sound effects. This has the subconscious effect of making the audience feel like it should be laughing, even if the material isn't all that funny.\n\nBut Grace and Frankie can never decide if it wants to be an outright sitcom or more of an HBO-style dramedy. Of the two styles, it has more success with the latter. At the very least, there are some affecting scenes as the characters struggle to understand what their lives will be like going forward.\n\nBut a dramedy usually needs a stronger story hook, and Grace and Frankie 's is simply endless repetitions of its premise, then a reminder that Frankie is kind of a hippie and Grace is buttoned-up. Any moments with genuine feeling are quickly undercut by lots of hacky jokes followed by a silence meant to be filled by laughter.\n\nThere are certainly worse sitcoms out there than Grace and Frankie , and it's pleasant enough to watch. But its ultimate effect is similar to the frequent sounds of ocean waves that play in the background of many scenes. It's simply a constant, undulating presence, one that eventually and ultimately lulls you to a peaceful sleep.\n\nThe first season of Grace and Frankie is now streaming on Netflix.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nHow Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.\n\nDJs, club owners, and patrons alike say there's way too much standing around.\n\nAstrology's enormous appeal, explained for believers and skeptics.\n\nThe surprising truth about milk is hiding in plain sight.\n\n﻿From Dunkin' deodorant to Sabrina Carpenter perfume, smelling good isn't enough - it's all about smelling edible.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nWhy everyone loves Dolly now.\n\nby Constance Grady\n\n\"I'm sick of Dolly, ain't you?\" said Dolly Parton to the New York Times Magazine in 2020 .\n\nFew people are. Dolly Parton is in the midst of a career revival that has seen her hailed as a kind of secular country-pop saint. And what's not to love about Dolly?\n\nDolly is the living legend who sells out arena tours in her 70s. She's the songwriting genius who wrote \"Jolene\" and \"I Will Always Love You\" on the same day. In recent decades, feminists have begun to reclaim her as a feminist icon. She is an impeccably dressed glamour queen, a business titan whose brand includes her own theme park, a philanthropist whose literacy program has sent free books to millions of children, and on top of all that she helped fund Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine - and then refused to jump the line to get a dose early . She is so beloved that WNYC devoted a full podcast series to investigating how a single figure could be adored by both blue and red states.\n\nDolly Parton is, as the New York Times put it in 2019 , the rare musical icon who is able to \"get her victory lap while she's still around to bask in the glory.\"\n\nBut Parton knew what she was talking about when she suggested to the New York Times last fall that people were starting to get sick of her. She has now achieved the sort of hysterical and highly trendy adoration that can shade into overexposure in the blink of an eye - even for a legend with a reputation as durable as Dolly Parton's. The pressure on Dolly Parton to be the single person who can unite a fractured America is so high, there is a slow and uneasy creep of incipient backlash all around her.\n\nThere was the discontent after Parton reworked her iconic \"9 to 5\" worker's anthem into \"5 to 9\" to honor the side hustle for a Super Bowl ad. There are the whispers about the dinner show that used to be called Dolly's Dixie Stampede . There is concern that the labor conditions at Dollywood aren't ideal .\n\nDolly Parton is beloved because she has devoted her career to standing for love. And, usefully, she is willing to be ambiguous about what exactly that love means and how much it includes people that those on different sides of the political aisle consider their enemies. But in a post-Trump America, is Dolly Parton's love enough?\n\nDolly Parton wasn't always so uncontroversially adored. She spent much of her early career worshipped by her country base while the rest of the country treated her as a walking boob joke, or even less than that. In her 2020 study of Parton's career, She Come By It Natural , Sarah Smarsh notes that in the 1970s and '80s, during interviews with Barbara Walters and Oprah, both interviewers \"asked [Parton] to stand up so they could point out, without humor, that she looked like a tramp.\"\n\nBut in recent decades, everything that makes Dolly Dolly has swung back into trend. \"One reason Parton's approval rating is so high, though\" Lindsay Zoladz posited in the New York Times in 2019 , \"is that all the attributes that used to set her up for criticism - the outrageous, hyper-femme style; the unapologetic business savvy needed to pull off her late-70s pop crossover; even the so-what acknowledgment of her own cosmetic surgery - are no longer taboo.\"\n\nDolly Parton often explains that she modeled her look after the town tramp, who as a small child she thought was the most beautiful person she'd ever seen, and that she knows straight men don't find it attractive and doesn't care. \"If I was trying to really impress men or be totally sexy, then I would dress differently,\" she told Playboy in 1978 . But why bother? \"I'm already married and he don't mind how I look.\"\n\nFor decades, this acknowledgment played as tacky or trashy. But in the 2010s, it came to be seen as empowering, even feminist: Dolly dresses for herself, not the male gaze. And Dolly's self is a celebration of the artificiality of femininity and glamour, a finding of authenticity in what is fake. That's downright avant-garde.\n\nMoreover, Parton's hard-nosed and palpable ambition might have once been seen as cynical. But in today's rise-and-grind culture, they are aspirational. Dolly knows where the money is, and she follows it. Who can fault her for that?\n\nParton's 21st-century career revival got an extra assist when she brought in internet-savvy new management in 2004. Up to that point, she had no website and little merchandise, and when she toured, her ticket sales were in the low thousands per venue. Then she hired Danny Nozell, who often says in interviews that he strategically charted a new generation of Dolly fans through a combination of targeted touring, TV marketing, and \"heavy viral advertising.\" (This strategy perhaps explains the number of really very good Dolly Parton memes out there.)\n\nBy 2006, Parton's tours were selling out again . In 2009, she started selling out stadiums. In 2014, she headlined the Glastonbury Festival.\n\nSo as the zeitgeist shifted into a mode more receptive to Dolly Parton's genius than previous decades had been, she was prepared to meet it. The mainstream embraced Dolly Parton, and she embraced it back.\n\nIn Come By It Natural , Smarsh describes seeing a bunch of cynical New Yorkers live tweet Dolly's Pure and Simple concert tour in 2016:\n\n\"That majestic bitch just started playing a goddamn PANFLUTE [sic],\" one tweeted.\n\n\"Dolly Parton, sitting in a pew onstage, just got a stadium full of Nyers to shout 'Amen,' \" said another. And then: \"Nothing says #Pride like a stadium full of gays singing 'Here You Come Again' with Dolly Parton.\"\n\nSuddenly two New York acquaintances I didn't realize knew one another were tweeting an exchange.\n\n\"Her voice is perfect.\"\n\n\"Dolly forever! Who knew she was such a storyteller?\"\n\n\"About to fling myself at the stage.\"\n\nSmarsh, who grew up in rural Kansas - Dolly country - recalls being shocked to see such earnest Dolly Parton worship from these coastal elites. \"I guess I figured that Dolly Parton would only be loved ironically in some places,\" she writes.\n\nBut Dolly Parton forbids irony. That's part of her magic. And for the past half-decade, coastal America and heartland America alike have loved her fully, earnestly, and unironically.\n\nTo love Dolly Parton is to love her image, which is simultaneously unchanging and evolving, over-the-top obvious and opaque.\n\n\"There is no aura of mystery ... about Dolly Parton,\" wrote Roger Ebert in 1980 , as he interviewed Parton on the 9 to 5 press tour. \"What you see is what you get.\"\n\nBut as the interview continued, Ebert's sense of who Dolly was shifted. She seemed perfectly authentic, but also somehow fictional. \"She speaks in that cornball Southern accent, but with perfect clarity and timing, so that she isn't just answering a question, she's presenting a character, she's onstage,\" he wrote . \"A fascinating phenomenon took place among the journalists at the table. Only moments ago, they were asking routine questions. Now they'd been enlisted as part of the act. They were falling into the rhythm of the performance, feeding her straight lines.\"\n\nParton's sense of the character she was playing was so strong that everyone else had to play along, too. What else do you do when faced with Dolly Parton?\n\nDolly Parton forbids irony. That's part of her magic.\n\nIt's not that she's doing \"Dolly Parton\" as a bit, exactly. Dolly exudes authenticity. But she does seem to have a clear sense that when wielded strategically, her outrageous public persona can offer plenty of cover to shelter behind.\n\nThis contradiction is part of the dance Parton has done throughout her career. She shows up in her teased wigs and plunging necklines, makes a boob joke before anyone else can make it (\"Now that we've got that off our chest!\" is a recurring Dolly-ism), and appears to be entirely straightforward and understandable. It's only after she's done talking that you realize how much she's successfully hidden away.\n\nFor example: her husband Carl Thomas Dean, to whom she's been married since 1966 and who is almost never photographed in public. Her political beliefs, which, outside of a vocal support for LGBTQ rights, remain a mystery (she will not discuss Trump). Her private life.\n\n\"Her physical appearance has always seemed to me like a metaphor for her actual person,\" wrote Hadley Freeman in the Guardian in 2019 : \"she gives a lot of good - and distracting - front, but the reality is definitely obscured.\"\n\nIn the absence of reality, rumors flourish: that Parton's arms are secretly covered in tattoos . That no one has ever seen her real hair . But as reality remains unknowable, Parton keeps finding new and fascinating angles in her elaborate star image for the public to play with.\n\n\"She doesn't reinvent herself but instead periodically turns her prismatic image so that it reflects a different light,\" argued the New York Times Magazine in 2020 . At the time, the part of Dolly's identity that was most in the light was her work as a songwriter, which is why you probably heard often last year that she wrote \"I Will Always Love You\" and \"Jolene\" in the same day. This year, with Covid-19 vaccines all over the news, it's her work as a philanthropist that is most often in the headlines.\n\nAnd as Parton's image shifts, there's one idea that keeps glittering at the center of her star, almost as constant as her stylized femininity. Throughout her career, in profile after profile, people who talk to Dolly Parton come away talking about an aura of love that surrounds her. This aura is, perhaps, the visceral sense that Parton is being entirely honest when she says, as she often does , that she \"loves everybody and wants everybody to love me.\"\n\nIn 2008, Roger Ebert returned to his 1980 Dolly Parton profile , noting that it had missed something he considered very important: her presence, which he writes \"enveloped\" him. \"This had nothing to do with sex appeal,\" he says. \"Far from it. It was as if I were being mesmerized by a benevolent power. I left the room in a cloud of good feeling.\"\n\nEbert adds that when he spoke with his writing partner Gene Siskel about Parton the next day, Siskel reported the same feeling: \"This will sound crazy,\" he said, \"but when I was interviewing Dolly Parton, I almost felt like she had healing powers.\"\n\n\"Really, who could fail to love Dolly Parton?\" mused the Guardian in 2011 . \"Well, aside from the Ku Klux Klan who, as if to confirm that it had a combined IQ in the single digits, has held demonstrations at Parton's theme park, the inevitably named Dollywood, because of her annual Gay Day.\"\n\n\"I say this with humility and as someone who is not a believer ,\" Dolly Parton's America host Jad Abumrad told Billboard in 2019 : \"There's something very Christ-like about her.\"\n\nBut America in the 21st century is no time for a secular pop saint. And there's a dark side to Dolly's ability to appeal, Christ-like, to all people at all times.\n\nThe first suggestion of a Trump-era backlash to Dolly Parton came in 2017, with the tale of the attraction that was then called Dolly Parton's Dixie Stampede.\n\n\"Advertised as an 'extraordinary dinner show ... pitting North against South in a friendly and fun rivalry [link removed],' Dolly Parton's Dixie Stampede is the Lost Cause of the Confederacy meets Cirque du Soleil,\" wrote Aisha Harris in a viral article for Slate . \"It's a lily-white kitsch extravaganza that play-acts the Civil War but never once mentions slavery.\"\n\nIn the Dixie Stampede, racing piglets named Robert E. Lee and Scarlett O'Hara faced off against piglets named Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant, while the cheering audience was instructed to pick a side. The bathrooms featured a white sign on one door saying \"Southerners Only\" and a black sign on the other saying \"Northerners Only.\"\n\n\"This was, at best, horrifyingly tone-deaf,\" Harris concluded.\n\nShortly after Harris's article came out, the attraction changed . While the retitled \" Dolly Parton's Stampede \" continues to market itself as a rivalry between North and South, it no longer includes references to the Civil War, and its antebellum nostalgia has been transformed into Gilded Age nostalgia. The restrooms now have a kitschy cowboy theme. (A \"history\" lesson involving magical Indigenous people, however, remains.)\n\n\"There's such a thing as innocent ignorance, and so many of us are guilty of that,\" Parton said to Billboard of the controversy in 2020 . \"When they said 'Dixie' was an offensive word, I thought, 'Well, I don't want to offend anybody. This is a business. We'll just call it The Stampede.' As soon as you realize that [something] is a problem, you should fix it. Don't be a dumbass. That's where my heart is. I would never dream of hurting anybody on purpose.\"\n\nParton was speaking to Billboard in July 2020 as the country was engulfed in protests following the police killing of George Floyd. The interviewer asked her what she thought of the movement.\n\n\"I understand people having to make themselves known and felt and seen,\" Parton said. \"And of course Black lives matter. Do we think our little white asses are the only ones that matter? No!\"\n\nThis kind of deft political quasi-answer is the sort of move Parton's been pulling her entire career. She expresses empathy rather than solidarity - she understands why people have to make themselves known, even if she's not showing up at a protest herself - and she affirms that she loves everybody. And since she loves everybody, of course their lives matter.\n\nWhen Parton happens to offend, as she did with the Dixie Stampede, it's an accident. And when she rebranded the Stampede, she presented it both as a decision in keeping with good Southern manners (she doesn't want to offend) and a practical business decision that no one should take personally. Her actual thoughts on the antebellum nostalgia in which the original attraction trafficked she kept to herself.\n\n\"I've got as many Republican friends as I've got Democrat friends and I just don't like voicing my opinion on things,\" she told the Guardian in 2019 . \"I've seen things before, like the Dixie Chicks . You can ruin a career for speaking out.\"\n\nParton meets any attempt to force her hand at a political statement with a quick and charming two-step. At the 2017 Emmy Awards , she reunited with her 9 to 5 co-stars Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin to present the award for Best Supporting Actor, only to find Fonda and Tomlin united in speaking out against Donald Trump.\n\n\"Back in 1980, when we made that movie, we refused to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot,\" Fonda said, quoting one of the repeated lines of 9 to 5 .\n\n\"And it's true in 2017 we still refuse to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot,\" Tomlin said, to vociferous applause.\n\nParton, between Tomlin and Fonda, went wide-eyed and took a step back from the microphone, although she continued smiling gamely. Fonda threw an arm around Parton's shoulders as she went on with award show patter about best supporting actors, and then Parton stepped forward with her go-to deflection move: a boob joke.\n\n\"Well, I know about support,\" she cracked, gesturing to her chest. \"Hadn't been for good support, Shock and Awe here would be more like Flopsy and Droopsy!\" Then she informed the crowd that she was sure Tomlin had been referring to the villainous 9 to 5 boss Mr. Hart with that little quip. \"How about a shoutout for [Hart actor] Dabney Coleman out there?\" And finally, just for good measure, she threw in a sex joke, too. \"I'm just hoping that I'm going to get one of those Grace and Frankie vibrators in my swag bag tonight.\"\n\n\"I just did not want everybody to think that whatever they think is what I think,\" Parton told the Guardian of the incident in 2019 . \"I don't really like getting up on TV and saying political things. I don't even want to make a deal out of it, but I want people to know I'm my own individual self. Even though [Fonda, Tomlin, and I] may agree on a whole lot of things - and they may have more agreement [between] themselves because they've been together for longer - I still have my own thoughts and my own way of doing things. It's not a matter of being disrespectful, it's just, OK, that's what they said, I'm not getting involved in it.\"\n\nParton's response to Tomlin and Fonda's anti-Trump statement functions as a sort of Rorschach test for the viewer: You can read whatever you like into it.\n\n\"First off, Dolly Parton didn't do anything wrong. I guess some wanted her to spit in Lily's Tomlin's face for disrespect, but guess what, that's not Dolly's style,\" read a blog post on Saving Country Music arguing that Trump-supporting Dolly fans had nothing to be angry about. \"So you know, get the hell over it. Dolly Parton is a gift bestowed to us otherwise downtrodden and depressed apes moving about the crust of the godforsaken earth with slumped shoulders, looking for meaning and respite from boredom, and I'll be damned if a bunch of tight asses will run her down for something she didn't do.\"\n\nAmerica in the 21st century is no time for a secular pop saint\n\nMeanwhile, in She Come By It Natural , Smarsh reads Parton's vibrator joke as subversively feminist, and subliminally anti-Trump in its own way. \"Hers was the least directly political comment of the three,\" Smarsh writes. \"It was also the one most assured to vex a man like Donald Trump - in whose eyes women exist for his pleasure, diminish in value as they age, and need a man to achieve sexual pleasure. What's more anti-Trump than a rich seventy-one-year-old woman fantasizing about a sex toy on national television after his name was invoked?\"\n\nParton's refusal to take any explicit public political stance has served her well for most of her career. Unlike younger stars, like Taylor Swift , she took little heat for refusing to endorse Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in the 2016 election. When she said she'd be happy to stand behind Clinton \"if she gets it\" before Clinton had officially clinched the Democratic nomination, Parton was quick to clarify herself : She meant that if Clinton became president, Parton would support her whole-heartedly. Then she threw in another boob joke.\n\n\"I try not to get political,\" she said, \"but if I am, I might as well just run myself 'cause I've got the hair for it, it's huge, and they could always use more boobs in the race.\"\n\n\"Both-sides-ism rarely feels as benevolent as it does when coming from Parton,\" mused the New York Times in 2019 .\n\nBut as Parton's 21st-century career revival continues, viewers are willing to see more sinister undertones in her \"both-sides-ism.\" After all, what do we do when \"both sides\" includes neo-Nazis and armed insurrectionists waving Confederate flags at the Capitol?\n\nIn a close reading of Parton's career on Longreads in 2018 , Jessica Wilkerson grapples with her own lifelong Dolly fandom, and specifically with the way the idea of whiteness underlies Dolly's image. \"She's embraced by feminists and queer folks at the same time she is declared a queen by Confederate apologists,\" Wilkerson writes. \"Dolly-as-mountain-girl anchors her to an ancestral white home in the imaginations of white people, while her class-conscious and gender-transgressive performance of whiteness becomes a signifier for white progressives who embrace gender fluidity and working-class iconolatry.\"\n\nIn Wilkerson's reading, Dolly is able to flirt with both sides of the political aisle - but at a cost. \"Dolly Parton has built her empire on and with the debris of old, racist amusements and wrapped it in working-class signifiers and feminist politics,\" Wilkerson concludes, nodding to Dolly Parton's Dixie Stampede. \"I ignored that fact for a long time because it didn't fit the script of the feminist, working-class heroine I had conjured. But I also ignored how others' attachment to Dolly is exactly because of her embrace of Dixie and her complex celebration of whiteness. And I have ignored how whiteness clings.\"\n\nElsewhere in the article, Wilkerson investigates labor conditions at Dollywood, which Parton established in her hometown to bring jobs back to the area. Labor conditions there, Wilkerson finds, are not Edenic: It's hard work, low pay (although above minimum wage), and patchy benefits.\n\n\"Dolly Parton promised jobs to her community; she did not promise well-paying jobs,\" Wilkerson writes. \"And while Dollywood does not pay the worst wages in Sevier County or in the theme park industry, the wages are significantly lower than those they replaced as the economy shifted from manufacturing to tourism.\"\n\nThe idea that Parton's theme park is not a labor paradise is probably not enough to get Dolly Parton canceled. Neither is the idea that she refuses to talk politics in public, or that she allows racists to like her, or that she rewrote her labor rights anthem to help sell Squarespace. But it is the sort of thing that makes the reflexively trendy worship of Dolly - like a recent petition to replace all Confederate monuments in Tennessee with statues of Dolly, \"the 'Jesus of Appalachia'\" - start to feel a little lazy, even cartoonish.\n\nDolly Parton is a brilliant artist, and she also seems to be a nice lady who is doubtless doing her best for all her many fans. But asking her to solve America's fractured social landscape and calling her Jesus is putting a lot on her. It's putting a lot on anyone. And Parton knows it.\n\nParton's internet-savvy management is well aware of the potential damage it might do even to a living legend of Dolly's stature for her to court overexposure. Last November, Novell told the New York Times that Parton's team planned to pull back from the public eye in 2021, \"to avoid oversaturating the market.\"\n\nNot long after, the news broke that Parton had helped fund Moderna's Covid vaccine. Dolly Parton, it seems, just can't help but keep giving us all what we want.\n\nIn January, the Tennessee state legislature considered a bill to put up a statue of Parton on the Capitol grounds. \"At this point in history, is there a better example, not just in America but in the world, of a leader that is [a] kind, decent, passionate human being?\" posited Democratic Rep. John Mark Windle . \"[She's] a passionate person who loves everyone, and everyone loves her.\"\n\nParton asked the legislature to remove the bill from consideration. \"Given all that is going on in the world,\" she said in a statement , \"I don't think putting me on a pedestal is appropriate at this time.\"\n\nSo perhaps it's up to the public, after all, to let Dolly take a break, and to let her leave us alone long enough for us to stop worshipping her and start missing her.\n\nBut will we? Or will we keep craving ever more Dolly Parton? Will we always keep asking her to come back to heal our wounds?\n\nCorrection, March 3: An earlier version of this story misstated the cause of George Floyd's death.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nHow Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.\n\nDJs, club owners, and patrons alike say there's way too much standing around.\n\nAstrology's enormous appeal, explained for believers and skeptics.\n\nThe surprising truth about milk is hiding in plain sight.\n\n﻿From Dunkin' deodorant to Sabrina Carpenter perfume, smelling good isn't enough - it's all about smelling edible.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

      "text": "Grace and Frankie season 2 review: Netflix's comedy is TV's most relaxing show\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe series has become the gentle comfort food TV you need right now.\n\nby Emily St. James\n\nGrace and Frankie is a WB show.\n\nRating\n\nYou remember The WB , right? The short-lived TV network achieved considerable, if fleeting, fame in the late 1990s and early 2000s through programming marketed to teens and 20-somethings. It was the home of Dawson's Creek and 7th Heaven , of Gilmore Girls and the first five seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer .\n\nEventually, the network was folded into The CW, where some strands of its DNA survive to this day. But the kinds of shows The WB produced in its heyday largely just don't exist anymore. They're too tiny, too low-conflict, for a TV universe that thrives on big, dramatic stakes. You can find shows that are vaguely similar on Freeform (formerly known as ABC Family); I'm thinking specifically of Switched at Birth and The Fosters . But for the most part, TV has moved past this kind of low-key programming.\n\nExcept for on Netflix, apparently. Grace and Frankie may not be perfect, but it has a gentle hangout vibe that sets it apart from most other shows on the air right now. There's little conflict, even very little angst. It's mostly an excuse to watch talented, older actors enact quiet tales of what life is like once reach your twilight years. It's as if, say, The WB's Everwood were suddenly remade with a very different target demographic in mind.\n\nThe show won't appeal to everybody. Indeed, its first season didn't really work for me . But I found its second season - which just hit Netflix this week - to be a mostly charming antidote to a lot of the rest of television. Here are five reasons why.\n\nGrace and Frankie centers on two older women (their names are in the title) who are forced to cohabitate when their respective husbands confess they've been gay lovers for decades and now wish to marry while they still have some time left on the planet. Grace and Frankie are understandably rocked by the news - they're all for marriage equality, but not necessarily if it has to apply to them.\n\nThat high-concept premise tanked roughly the first half of the show's first season. It was just so much for the characters to deal with, and the show's frequently sitcom-y jokes didn't help; it often seemed like they were written with enough extra space for a live studio audience to laugh and punctuate their banality. ( Grace and Frankie was created by sitcom vets Marta Kauffman - the co-creator of Friends - and Howard J. Morris .)\n\nIn short, the series' premise didn't align with its tone. Finding out after many years of marriage that your husband is not only gay but divorcing you so he can marry the man he's been having an affair with - that's a pretty seismic event. And yet Grace and Frankie felt fairly small and low-stakes. Its plotting was straight out of the American sitcom playbook, reverting to the status quo most episodes and punctuating emotional outbursts with easy jokes.\n\nHowever, as the series has progressed, it's slowly figured out how to handle its heavier material. In season two, as Grace and Frankie get further and further away from their divorces, they're able to see how much their exes love and care about each other, which helps them realize that remaining in their repressed marriages was hurting them as well.\n\nGenerally, the show is more soothing and slower-paced than most other TV. But the characters occasionally blister, erupting in anger or sadness, and that emotional honesty gives the show the weight it might otherwise seem to be lacking. Grace and Frankie takes its characters seriously, and its emotional stakes are finally in line with its tone.\n\nWatching Grace and Frankie often feels like going shopping for apples at a New England farmers market, like living in a lighthouse with a gorgeous view of the ocean, or like being an elderly British woman who solves mysteries with her cat. It's a calming, charming good time, one that doesn't strain for effort. Even the jokes don't try too hard to make you laugh. They just fall into the rhythm of conversation.\n\nIn that sense, the series makes for one of the better binge watches in recent memory. It doesn't push its story too much, and you can turn off Netflix in the middle of an episode - in the middle of a scene, even! - and resume watching three days later without missing much. It's less about plot or character than it is about vibe, about feeling like you're hanging out with these people as they sit on the beach.\n\nTo that end, the series' visual palette is similarly tranquil. It uses mostly muted colors, and many scenes are shot in soft-focus wide shots, to let in more of the gentle ambience. When the camera zooms in for the close-up on a character in one of those blistering moments, the results can devastate, but most of the time the show is happy to just hang back and take in the good times.\n\nThe big event of the first half of season two is that Frankie and her ex-husband, Sol, are dealing with the fact that they slept together near the end of season one, when they were cleaning out the home they shared as a married couple. In the midst of heightened emotion, they gave in to passion. Now both are afraid to tell Sol's soon-to-be husband (and Grace's ex), Robert, what happened, for obvious reasons.\n\nThis conflict drives much of Grace and Frankie 's second season. Other storylines involve Frankie going into business with Grace's daughter, Grace considering reconnecting with a man she had a flirtation with in the past, and Robert dealing with a health scare.\n\nNone of these stories are hugely dramatic, but that's fine. Very few of us live lives filled with constant drama, and TV occasionally skews too far away from presenting these sorts of realistic scenarios. Even the show's jokes have gotten softer. They're still there, but the sitcom setups are gone; they're mostly just pleasant, like everything else.\n\nI've so far avoided mentioning that Grace and Frankie 's central four roles are played by Jane Fonda (Grace), Lily Tomlin (Frankie), Sam Waterston (Sol), and Martin Sheen (Robert). But if anything has kept me tuning in during the series' rough patches, it's the fact that these excellent actors rarely get material this meaningful or meaty as they age.\n\nAnd season two allows them to dig in ever deeper. In particular, Fonda's portrayal of Grace is a lovely little thing, never pushing too far into outright brittleness while still allowing Grace to be incredibly hard to put up with. As the season goes on - and her life unravels more and more - Fonda plays Grace as someone who continues to struggle with the fact that she's been given a second chance at life, no matter how welcome or unwelcome.\n\nI should also pause to recognize the show's younger, supporting cast members, including June Diane Raphael and Brooklyn Decker as Grace and Robert's two daughters. Grace and Frankie is rarely as interested in their lives as it is in the lives of its four main characters, but every time it drops in on them, they bring their best stuff.\n\nGrace and Frankie 's characters have witnessed huge amounts of social change in their lifetimes. Sol and Robert went from having to keep their affair a deep, dark secret to getting married in broad daylight, with most of their friends and family welcoming their relationship (once they came to terms with the inherent deception, of course).\n\nIndeed, some of the most moving moments of Grace and Frankie 's second season involve Sol and Robert resolving to not let more of their lives pass by without being with each other, openly and honestly. And yet that doesn't come naturally for them. They lived in hiding for so long that being out can feel like a kind of performance. The show even subtly emphasizes how neither feels entirely comfortable with the sorts of things that are considered the stereotypical pursuits of gay men.\n\nAt its core, Grace and Frankie understands that life is long, and that the sweeping societal changes that many younger folks view as a matter of course can feel like major upheavals to those who are older. By staying keyed in to its characters' emotions and remaining true to their psychologies, Grace and Frankie can open our eyes to how it can feel to suddenly, late in life, have everything change.\n\nGrace and Frankie is streaming on Netflix .\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nHow Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.\n\nDJs, club owners, and patrons alike say there's way too much standing around.\n\nAstrology's enormous appeal, explained for believers and skeptics.\n\nThe surprising truth about milk is hiding in plain sight.\n\n﻿From Dunkin' deodorant to Sabrina Carpenter perfume, smelling good isn't enough - it's all about smelling edible.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

      "text": "Jane Fonda turns 80 today and in many ways is just getting started\n\nThe two-time Oscar winner reflects on turning 80 and relishing her third act.\n\n&#151; -- Jane Fonda turns 80 today and shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nThe two-time Oscar winner has made no secret of how much she is enjoying her third act.\n\nIn a Thanksgiving blog post, she wrote, \"I'm celebrating my 80th soon and marvel at how terrific and energetic I feel.\"\n\nSo in celebration of her 80 years, here are a few of the things she has said in recent years about everything from her acting to activism to staying fit in her third act of life:\n\nNot wanting to be young again\n\n\"You could not pay me to be young again,\" Fonda told the Daily Mail in 2016. \"I don't care how much money I was offered, I wouldn't do it. I didn't like being young at all. I actually felt I started to get old at 7. By the time I was 20, I hated how old I was then. At 30, I was ancient, I saw no future for myself. At 49, I said, 'I'm going down a dark hole, I can't be creative any more,' and I quit acting for almost 16 years. I was just so old... Then, after I turned 60, I began to understand who I was, and I became young again. Now I'm in sight of my 80th birthday and feeling pretty good about life!\"\n\nOn needing to stay busy\n\n\"I needed a steady job,\" she told the Daily Mail. \"It's hard to be an older actor and be in regular work -- people forget this is how we earn our living. I support other people besides myself and I need to bring in money. Plus, it's fun. I never would have thought that at my age I could say I've been working too hard to spend time pampering myself, but I'm happy to say that's the case.\"\n\nOn her work with Lily Tomlin on the Netflix series 'Grace & Frankie'\n\n\"I left the business at age 50, and I came back at age 65,\" Fonda told the Washington Post earlier this year. \"It's been an unusual situation to re-create a career at that age. But ageism, unfortunately, is still alive and well. And one of the things that Lily and I are proud of -- and want to continue with -- is showing that you may be old, you may be in your third act, but you can still be vital and sexual and funny...that life isn't over. Even when I was younger, I wanted to give a cultural face to old age.\"\n\nOn just getting started\n\n\"I think it's about how if you still have passion, and if you haven't become cynical and you've remained open to life, then no matter how old you are chronologically, you're still young. Aging is relative,\" she told Stephen Colbert on the \"Late Show\" in 2015. \"If people say that I look young for my age, it's because I feel like I'm a newbie. I feel like I'm just beginning, just learning how to do things. It's not what I expected at all.\"\n\nOn her activism\n\n\"It's like what the hell do you have to lose? So arrest me already. So I'm going to go to the barricades. So I'm going to be an activist like you've never seen,\" she told Colbert. \"So what. What can they do to me now that they haven't already tried and failed?\"\n\nOn being fit\n\n\"I have a fake hip, a fake knee and I've had a number of back surgeries, so I'm sort of half-metal and half-bionic now. I have osteoarthritis and getting in and out of a car is a challenge,\" she told the Daily Mail. \"But I feel lucky that I did a lot of fitness work earlier in my life because it means I'm stronger now.\"\n\nOn finally understanding intimacy\n\n\"When my first grandchild was born, that's when I understood intimacy. I wasn't the best mother to my daughter -- I became a political activist just as she was born so I was away a lot, which I've apologized to her about,\" Fonda told the Daily Mail. \"But when my grandchildren came along, a part of my heart broke open. It's not everyone who gets to be a grandparent, but if you do, it gives you a second chance. I feel lucky to be given that.\"\n\nOn changing our view of aging\n\nA more appropriate metaphor for aging is a staircase,\" she said in her 2011 TEDx talk. \"The upward accession of the human spirit, bringing us into wisdom, wholeness and authenticity. Age not at all as pathology but age as potential.\"\n\nOn never being happier\n\n\"Now that I'm smack dab in the middle of my third act, I've never been happier,\" she told her TEDx audience. \"I have such a powerful feeling of wellbeing.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

I have become so wonderfully, terribly aware of time, of how little of it I have left; how much of it is behind me, and everything becomes so precious,\" Fonda wrote. \"With age, I am able to appreciate the beauty in small things more than when I was younger perhaps because I pay attention more. I feel myself becoming part of everything, as if I bleed into other people's joy and pain.\"\n\nJane Fonda Becomes a Cover Girl for L'Oreal at 75\n\nAmong the things that have reduced the actress to tears? Her friend Kerry Washington's pregnant belly, lines in Eve Ensler's new play \"OPC,\" and photos of elephants.\n\n\"I've listed sad things but what startles me even more is how I get emotional about nice things,\" she wrote. \"Maybe because I'm older my heart is wider open, like a net that wants to catch all the things that matter.\"\n\nFonda also explained that these emotional responses have forced her to think about her connection to the earth in a literal sense. In that way, she has begun to plan for the inevitable.\n\nJane Fonda's Adopted Daughter Says Star Saved Her Life\n\n\"There's the reality that in a few decades (if I'm lucky) I will be in the earth, fertilizing some of the very things I look at now and tear up over,\" she wrote. \"I'm not going to be cremated, uses up too much energy and gives off too many toxins, nor do I want to be in a coffin. Just dump me in a hole and let me morph into whatever as quickly as possible.\"\n\nFor now, though, she' s happy to admit she's going through life with an open heart.\n\n\"I have to only wear waterproof mascara from now on,\" she said.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Community means power,\" she explained. \"And this is really important right now when workers' power is being attacked and community is being weakened.\"\n\nFonda said SAG-AFTRA is different from other unions because its members don't \"manufacture anything tangible.\"\n\n\"What we create is empathy,\" she noted.\n\nThe actress then spoke about the job of actors being able to \"understand and empathize with the traumatized person you're playing,\" citing her Oscar-winning role in \"Klute\" and Sebastian Stan's portrayal of Donald Trump in \"The Apprentice\" .\n\n\"Make no mistake, empathy is not weak or woke,\" she said firmly. \"And, by the way, 'woke' just means you give a damn about other people.\"\n\nFonda, a climate change activist and critic of President Trump , said \"we are in our documentary moment right now\" in reference to the political divide in the country.\n\n\"A whole lot of people are going to be really hurt by what is happening, what is coming our way. And even if they're of a different political persuasion, we need to call upon our empathy and not judge, but listen from our hearts and welcome them into our tent because we are going to need a big tent to resist, successfully, what's coming at us,\" she said.\n\n\"So let's be brave,\" she concluded. \"We must not isolate. We must stay in community. We must help the vulnerable. We must find ways to project an inspiring vision of the future -- one that is beckoning, welcoming.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Jane Fonda on her climate activism journey and the stakes in the 2024 election: \"We can't lose another 4 years\"\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nSeptember 23, 2024 / 6:00 AM EDT / CBS News\n\nShe may be an actor on screen, but she's an activist at heart. Between calling for an end to the wars in Vietnam and Iraq, rallying with the women's movement, and fighting for Indigenous rights, Jane Fonda has marched and protested nearly her entire life.\n\nBut five years ago, as she walked under a hazy orange sky filled with wildfire smoke , she felt like she still hadn't done enough. This was not the bucolic and smog-free California she experienced growing up at the end of a dirt road in the Santa Monica Mountains.\n\n\"This is way beyond what I thought it was,\" she told CBS News. \"This isn't just about the environment. This is about the whole planet.\"\n\nA switch went off - what Fonda describes as a \"lightning bolt right into my solar plexus.\" She'd always had a fondness for nature, but had never been vocal about protecting it. She realized in that moment that she needed to use her platform to draw attention to the climate crisis .\n\nThe now 86-year-old Hollywood star traded her \"Grace and Frankie\" script for \"On Fire,\" by Naomi Klein and picked up the phone to call the then-head of Greenpeace, Annie Leonard, to tell her she was moving to D.C. \"I'm gonna raise a ruckus. Can you help?\" she said.\n\nThis is just one of many moments Fonda shared about her climate activism journey in an interview with CBS News national environmental correspondent David Schechter.\n\nIn the candid conversation, Fonda details why she joined the fight to save our planet and why she's urging others to join the cause, especially with the 2024 presidential election less than two months away. \"We can't lose another four years,\" she said.\n\nThe stakes of this election are so high in Fonda's mind that she told her agent that she couldn't take on any acting work this year.\n\n\"When the election is happening that's going to determine the future, I couldn't do it,\" she told CBS News.\n\nFonda is supporting Vice President Kamala Harris, believing the Harris-Walz ticket would fight for climate solutions and make progress on ambitious targets like cutting our fossil fuel emissions in half by the end of the decade.\n\n\"I am really involved this time because of the climate emergency,\" Fonda said.\n\nA Trump-Vance win, she believes, would send the country in the wrong direction by increasing our reliance on fossil fuels. (One of Trump's slogans is \"Drill, baby, drill.\") \"We can't allow this to happen in the United States,\" Fonda said, \"not when the future of the planet is at stake.\"\n\nShe recognizes that young people may be tempted to sit the election out, especially if they're frustrated or hurt by what's happening in Gaza. But her message is clear: \"Show us your power! Vote!\"\n\n\"Do not sit this election out, no matter how angry you are,\" she urged young voters.\n\nFonda isn't the only celebrity using her voice to rally political support. After the presidential debate on Sept. 10, Taylor Swift announced her endorsement of Harris on Instagram, signing the post \"Childless Cat Lady,\" a jab at Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance .\n\n\"I thought it was really smart of her to choose to do it after the debate,\" said Fonda. \"I think it's going to have a big impact.\"\n\nAccording to vote.org data, from 9 p.m. to midnight the night of the debate, the website saw a 585% spike in people using their register/verify tool, compared to that same time frame the previous eight days. And vote.gov said it received 405,999 visitors through a link Taylor Swift shared in the 24 hours after she posted it. The site includes information about how to register to vote and cast a ballot, and directs users to state sites where they can register.\n\nWhether it's knocking on doors or posting on Instagram, Fonda believes celebrities can have enormous sway. They act as \"repeaters,\" she said, referring to the electronic devices that help amplify and expand the reach of signals. \"They pick up signals from the valley that are weak, and they distribute them so they have a larger audience,\" she said. \"That's what celebrities do, like me.\"\n\nOutside of the presidential race, Fonda is also focusing on mayoral, city council and state races. Getting climate champions elected to those offices is the main mission of Jane Fonda Climate PAC . Founded in 2022, the group's informal motto, promulgated by Fonda, is: \"If we can't change the minds of the people in power, we need to change the people in power.\"\n\n\"There's this disconnect between what science is saying and what elected officials will allow to become policy,\" she told CBS News. \"That has to change.\"\n\nDown-ballot candidates may seem like a drop in the bucket in the larger battle to combat climate change, but Fonda says the goal is to develop leaders who can rise up into larger positions. They also have the power to challenge projects in their own backyards, like Line 5, a pipeline that runs through Michigan and Wisconsin, backed by Canadian oil company Enbridge, said Fonda.\n\n\"We need local people there that will stop it.\"\n\nIn its first year, Jane Fonda Climate PAC raised $2 million and helped get 42 \"climate champions\" elected to office. This year, the PAC is looking to make an even bigger splash by backing 100 candidates across multiple states, including the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Arizona.\n\nFonda is a firm believer that the power not only rests inside the halls of government, but outside in the streets. It's a sort of symbiotic relationship, in her eyes: get people elected to government and then make them take action.\n\n\"Nonviolent civil disobedience and protests historically have changed history,\" she told CBS News. \"But you need people in the halls of power with ears and a heart to hear the protests, to hear the demands.\"\n\nFonda is no stranger to civil disobedience. In 2019, she was arrested five times during Fire Drill Fridays , a protest series she started in Washington, D.C. that was designed to draw attention to global warming. Fonda even spent the night of her 82nd birthday behind bars. \"I knew that would have an impact,\" she told CBS News.\n\nBefore that, the last time Fonda spent the night in jail was in 1970, when she was 32, while on a speaking tour protesting the Vietnam War. She was known as an outspoken critic of the Vietnam War and made a controversial trip to the embattled country in 1972.\n\nFonda says she started Fire Drill Fridays because she realized you can get a lot more done when you join forces with other people fighting for the same cause. A collective crisis demands a collective solution, she says.\n\nAsked about her advice for young people joining the cause, she echoed this sentiment: \"If you want to go fast, go alone,\" she said. \"If you want to go far, go together.\"\n\nAfter nearly 60 years of acting, dozens of movies, three marriages and six arrests, Fonda feels like she's right where she belongs.\n\n\"I think a lot about being on my deathbed, and I know that when you're on your deathbed you want to feel that it's been worthwhile,\" she told CBS News. \"For the first time I felt my life has value.\"\n\nShe may be in her final act, but she has no intention of slowing down. She's currently traveling nationwide to visit down-ballot candidates endorsed by the Jane Fonda Climate PAC and support the Harris-Waltz ticket. Just last week, she was in Ann Arbor, Michigan, knocking on doors for the campaign .\n\n\"If celebrity is a currency, which it seems to be, why are you spending it this way?\" Schecter asked Fonda during the interview.\n\nAfter a brief pause, Fonda responded, \"What other way would there be to spend it?\"\n\nThe interview with Jane Fonda was coordinated by Covering Climate Now and done in partnership with The Guardian and Rolling Stone.\n\nTracy J.  Wholf and David  Schechter contributed to this report.\n\nMary Cunningham is a reporter for CBS MoneyWatch. Before joining the business and finance vertical, she worked at \"60 Minutes\", CBSNews.com, and CBS News 24/7 as part of the CBS News Associate Program.\n\n© 2024 CBS Interactive Inc.

Between calling for an end to the wars in Vietnam and Iraq, rallying with the women's movement, and fighting for Indigenous rights, Jane Fonda has marched and protested nearly her entire life.\n\nBut five years ago, as she walked under a hazy orange sky filled with wildfire smoke , she felt like she still hadn't done enough. This was not the bucolic and smog-free California she experienced growing up at the end of a dirt road in the Santa Monica Mountains.\n\n\"This is way beyond what I thought it was,\" she told CBS News. \"This isn't just about the environment. This is about the whole planet.\"\n\nA switch went off - what Fonda describes as a \"lightning bolt right into my solar plexus.\" She'd always had a fondness for nature, but had never been vocal about protecting it. She realized in that moment that she needed to use her platform to draw attention to the climate crisis .\n\nThe now 86-year-old Hollywood star traded her \"Grace and Frankie\" script for \"On Fire,\" by Naomi Klein and picked up the phone to call the then-head of Greenpeace, Annie Leonard, to tell her she was moving to D.C. \"I'm gonna raise a ruckus. Can you help?\" she said.\n\nThis is just one of many moments Fonda shared about her climate activism journey in an interview with CBS News national environmental correspondent David Schechter.\n\nIn the candid conversation, Fonda details why she joined the fight to save our planet and why she's urging others to join the cause, especially with the 2024 presidential election less than two months away. \"We can't lose another four years,\" she said.\n\nThe stakes of this election are so high in Fonda's mind that she told her agent that she couldn't take on any acting work this year.\n\n\"When the election is happening that's going to determine the future, I couldn't do it,\" she told CBS News.\n\nFonda is supporting Vice President Kamala Harris, believing the Harris-Walz ticket would fight for climate solutions and make progress on ambitious targets like cutting our fossil fuel emissions in half by the end of the decade.\n\n\"I am really involved this time because of the climate emergency,\" Fonda said.\n\nA Trump-Vance win, she believes, would send the country in the wrong direction by increasing our reliance on fossil fuels. (One of Trump's slogans is \"Drill, baby, drill.\") \"We can't allow this to happen in the United States,\" Fonda said, \"not when the future of the planet is at stake.\"\n\nShe recognizes that young people may be tempted to sit the election out, especially if they're frustrated or hurt by what's happening in Gaza. But her message is clear: \"Show us your power! Vote!\"\n\n\"Do not sit this election out, no matter how angry you are,\" she urged young voters.\n\nFonda isn't the only celebrity using her voice to rally political support. After the presidential debate on Sept. 10, Taylor Swift announced her endorsement of Harris on Instagram, signing the post \"Childless Cat Lady,\" a jab at Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance .\n\n\"I thought it was really smart of her to choose to do it after the debate,\" said Fonda. \"I think it's going to have a big impact.\"\n\nAccording to vote.org data, from 9 p.m. to midnight the night of the debate, the website saw a 585% spike in people using their register/verify tool, compared to that same time frame the previous eight days.

The site includes information about how to register to vote and cast a ballot, and directs users to state sites where they can register.\n\nWhether it's knocking on doors or posting on Instagram, Fonda believes celebrities can have enormous sway. They act as \"repeaters,\" she said, referring to the electronic devices that help amplify and expand the reach of signals. \"They pick up signals from the valley that are weak, and they distribute them so they have a larger audience,\" she said. \"That's what celebrities do, like me.\"\n\nOutside of the presidential race, Fonda is also focusing on mayoral, city council and state races. Getting climate champions elected to those offices is the main mission of Jane Fonda Climate PAC . Founded in 2022, the group's informal motto, promulgated by Fonda, is: \"If we can't change the minds of the people in power, we need to change the people in power.\"\n\n\"There's this disconnect between what science is saying and what elected officials will allow to become policy,\" she told CBS News. \"That has to change.\"\n\nDown-ballot candidates may seem like a drop in the bucket in the larger battle to combat climate change, but Fonda says the goal is to develop leaders who can rise up into larger positions. They also have the power to challenge projects in their own backyards, like Line 5, a pipeline that runs through Michigan and Wisconsin, backed by Canadian oil company Enbridge, said Fonda.\n\n\"We need local people there that will stop it.\"\n\nIn its first year, Jane Fonda Climate PAC raised $2 million and helped get 42 \"climate champions\" elected to office. This year, the PAC is looking to make an even bigger splash by backing 100 candidates across multiple states, including the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Arizona.\n\nFonda is a firm believer that the power not only rests inside the halls of government, but outside in the streets. It's a sort of symbiotic relationship, in her eyes: get people elected to government and then make them take action.\n\n\"Nonviolent civil disobedience and protests historically have changed history,\" she told CBS News. \"But you need people in the halls of power with ears and a heart to hear the protests, to hear the demands.\"\n\nFonda is no stranger to civil disobedience. In 2019, she was arrested five times during Fire Drill Fridays , a protest series she started in Washington, D.C. that was designed to draw attention to global warming. Fonda even spent the night of her 82nd birthday behind bars. \"I knew that would have an impact,\" she told CBS News.\n\nBefore that, the last time Fonda spent the night in jail was in 1970, when she was 32, while on a speaking tour protesting the Vietnam War. She was known as an outspoken critic of the Vietnam War and made a controversial trip to the embattled country in 1972.\n\nFonda says she started Fire Drill Fridays because she realized you can get a lot more done when you join forces with other people fighting for the same cause. A collective crisis demands a collective solution, she says.\n\nAsked about her advice for young people joining the cause, she echoed this sentiment: \"If you want to go fast, go alone,\" she said. \"If you want to go far, go together.\"\n\nAfter nearly 60 years of acting, dozens of movies, three marriages and six arrests, Fonda feels like she's right where she belongs.\n\n\"I think a lot about being on my deathbed, and I know that when you're on your deathbed you want to feel that it's been worthwhile,\" she told CBS News. \"For the first time I felt my life has value.\"\n\nShe may be in her final act, but she has no intention of slowing down.

She shared the news in an Instagram post , explaining that she is hopeful despite the diagnosis.\n\n\"This is a very treatable cancer. 80% of people survive, so I feel very lucky,\" she wrote.\n\nA post shared by Jane Fonda (@janefonda)\n\nShe said she has been managing well with chemotherapy so far and intends on carrying on with her responsibilities.\n\n\"I'm doing chemo for 6 months and am handling the treatments quite well and, believe me, I will not let any of this interfere with my climate activism,\" Fonda said.\n\nShe also used the announcement as an opportunity to advocate for more equal and accessible healthcare in the U.S.\n\n\"I realize, and it's painful, that I am privileged in this,\" Fonda said. \"Almost every family in America has had to deal with cancer at one time or another and far too many don't have access to the quality health care I am receiving and this is not right.\"\n\nThis is not Fonda's first bout with cancer - she was previously diagnosed with breast cancer , but shared she was cancer free in 2010.\n\nFonda, who is a vocal climate activist , advocated for a preventative approach to cancer, writing that the U.S. should work to eliminate the chemicals and pollution that can cause the disease.\n\n\"We also need to be talking much more not just about cures but about causes so we can eliminate them,\" she said. \"For example, people need to know that fossil fuels cause cancer. So do pesticides, many of which are fossil fuel-based, like mine.\"\n\nNon-Hodgkin's lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the body's lymphatic system, which helps fight germs and bacteria, according to the American Cancer Society . There are several different subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, but in general, it occurs when white blood cells grow abnormally and can form tumors.\n\nFonda said she is grateful for the people around her and her growing community during this new battle.\n\n\"Cancer is a teacher and I'm paying attention to the lessons it holds for me,\" she wrote. \"One thing it's shown me already is the importance of community. Of growing and deepening one's community so that we are not alone.\"\n\nFonda indicated that she would not let her diagnosis diminish her activism, writing: \"We're living through the most consequential time in human history.\"\n\n\"The midterms are looming, and they are beyond consequential so you can count on me to be right there together with you as we grow our army of climate champions,\" she wrote.\n\nSimrin Singh is a social media producer and trending content writer for CBS News.\n\n© 2022 CBS Interactive Inc.

The Oscar-winning actress and workout diva, now 73, started taking the male hormone at age 70, the Telegraph reported.\n\n\"Here's something I haven't said publicly yet,\" she said in a recent interview. \"I discovered testosterone about three years ago, which makes a huge difference if you want to remain sexual and your libido has dropped.\"\n\nScience seems to be on Fonda's side. Though testosterone supplements aren't approved for use by women, recent studies have shown that they can boost women's sex drive, according to WebMD . Women who take testosterone have been shown to have more sexual thoughts and fantasies as well as more satisfying sex.\n\nThe supplements may be helpful for women who have had their ovaries removed or who have certain adrenal or pituitary gland problems, as well as those whose libido has lagged for unknown reasons. But the supplements should not be taken by women who could become pregnant, nor by women who have or have had breast or uterine cancer, high cholesterol levels, heart disease, or liver disease, according to WebMD.\n\nTestosterone is available in pills, patches, or gels. But because these can deliver a dose that may be too high for women, it may be better for women to ask a d doctor prescribe a custom-compounded supplement.\n\nIncreased growth of facial hair can be a problem for some women who try testosterone, the Los Angeles Times reported. And that's not the only possible side effect, as Fonda found out the hard way.\n\n\"I had to stop because it was giving me acne,\" she said. \"It's one thing having plastic surgery, but it is quite another to have adolescence acne. That is going too far.\"\n\nWebMD has more on sex-boosting tips for aging women .\n\n© 2011 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright ©2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved."

      "text": "Jane Fonda's third act\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nJune 4, 2012 / 8:37 AM EDT / CBS News\n\n(CBS News) Jane Fonda has played many roles both on- and off-screen. Now, at an age when plenty of people are slowing down, she talks as if she's just getting started. Lee Cowan visited her Hollywood Hills home for this Sunday Profile:\n\nJane Fonda's view of life from high above Hollywood is pretty good these days.\n\nThe fan mail never stops, and no wonder . . . Jane Fonda hasn't stopped, either.\n\nAt 74 she can still rock the red carpet. In Cannes last month, she stole the show - something that surprises even herself.\n\n\"Listen, I didn't think I'd live past 30. I mean, it's all a surprise to me,\" she said.\n\nShe's busier than ever, with movies and TV series in the works, including the upcoming HBO drama, \"The Newsroom,\" where she'll play a hard-nosed network executive.\n\nWhat Fonda calls her Third and Final Act is turning out to be a busy one.\n\n\"All of us - you know, probably you, too - were brought up with this view of life like an arc,\" she told Cowan. \"You're born, you peak at midlife, then you decline into decrepitude. You know, it's a downward slope. You're 'over the hill.'  And I realized, yeah, I'm over the hill, but look at all these other hills - no one told me there were gonna be all these hills!\n\n\"And I can climb them!\"\n\nHer latest movie opens this week - a role that, to some, may not seem like too much of a stretch. Her character - an aging, pot-smoking, one-time flower child - tries to help her up-tight lawyer daughter move on after a divorce.\n\n\"I'm so tired of movies that don't make me feel good. And it's a feel-good movie!\" Fonda said.\n\nIt's fitting perhaps that the film's title is \"Peace, Love and Misunderstanding\" - because that's a pretty apt description of Jane Fonda's long and varied life.\n\nFrom her earliest days in the public eye, she seemed to exude confidence. How else do you pull off the role of a voluptuous space traveler in \"Barbarella,\" a cult classic that she says her first husband, French director Roger Vadim, talked her into.\n\n\"All that Barbarella hair was actually mine,\" she said. \"That ain't no wig!\"\n\nIt hardly held her back. She went on to win two Academy Awards - she was nominated for five others - but Fonda said she rarely felt she was ever good enough.\n\n\"I didn't think I could say no to anything,\" she said. \"Because I was always just so astonished that anyone asked me to do anything.\"\n\nHer portrayal of a prostitute in \"Klute\" earned Fonda her first Oscar. But she was so convinced she couldn't pull it off, she told the director to give the part to someone else.\n\n\"I said to Alan Pakula, 'I've been hanging out with hookers for ten days. I've been to their after-hours clubs, I've been with them when they were with their Johns, and not once did any of those guys try to solicit me. I can't do this. I'm clearly not the type. Hire Faye Dunaway.' And he just burst out laughing and kicked me out of the room.\"\n\nHer self confidence issues, she says, started early.\n\nHer mother, New York socialite Frances Brokaw, committed suicide when Jane was only 12.\n\n\"Parents are supposed to reflect their children back to them with eyes of love,\" Fonda said.  \"My mother had duct tape over her eyes because of mental illness.\"\n\nAnd being the daughter of legendary screen actor Henry Fonda wasn't easy, either. The two had a famously strained relationship.\n\n\"Dad didn't know how to express emotions. It was a certain generation that you just didn't do that.\"\n\nWhen the two appeared together in \"On Golden Pond,\" it was like a therapy session in front of the cameras.\n\nShe said there were things she was able to say to Fonda as a character that she wasn't able to as a daughter. \"It was very hard for me to do that. It was hard,\" she told Cowan. \"When I said, 'I want to be your friend,' I reached out and I touched his arm. And I don't know if you can see it on the screen, it's so slight. But what I saw happen, condensed into a nanosecond, I saw surprise, I saw anger, I saw tears. And then he ducks his head like that. God forbid he should show emotion.\"\n\nKatharine Hepburn, who starred opposite Henry Fonda, was just off-camera watching it all unfold.\n\n\"I looked up and Hepburn was hiding in the bushes. And she raised her fists to me - 'You can do it. You can do it, Jane.' And she willed me into the scene, God bless her!\"\n\nBy that time, of course, Fonda had already made more than 30 films. But she was known for far more than just being an actress.\n\nShe remains, to this day, one of the more controversial faces of the protest movement against the Vietnam War.\n\nHer trip to Hanoi in 1972 still sparks outrage among some veterans, largely for her sitting on a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun, smiling and laughing.\n\n\"I made a terrible mistake, unwittingly sitting on that gun,\" Fonda said. \"it was a terrible thing. Because it belied who I am and what I stood for, and the fact that I had been working with soldiers for years before then.\n\n\"The appearance was that I was against my country and my soldiers and, you know, I will go to my grave - that is a regret I will never get over.\"\n\nHer vocal opposition to the war led to interest in other social issues - and a new husband, activist Tom Hayden. Together, the two traveled the country promoting everything from solar power to environmental protection. But behind the scenes, she was engaged in another battle: bulimia.\n\nFonda said she had struggled with eating issues from age 15, off and on, to about age 45. She hid it from everyone - even her husbands -- until she started working out.\n\nAnd we all know what that became.\n\n\"Up until then, I was like a dry drunk, you know?\" she said. \"I wasn't engaging in my addiction, but I wasn't healed, either, and the workout helped me heal. Because I discovered another way to manage my body issues.\"\n\nShe said when she first started making workout videos she had \"not a clue\" that they were groundbreaking. \"I was very resistant to it in the beginning,\" she said. \"I thought, 'I'm an actor! I don't want to make an exercise video. It's gonna hurt my career.'\"\n\nIt didn't, of course. The \"Workout\" remains one of the bestselling home videos of all time.\n\nBut it still wasn't enough to boost her self-image - and acting began to fade from the picture.\n\n\"I have a really hard time becoming another character when I'm feeling really, really, really bad about myself,\" she said. \"I mean literally, when I thought about the future, I saw nothing but gray. I thought there's no future. I just - I can't go in front of the camera again. \"\n\nAnd she didn't - for 15 years.\n\nWhich was just fine with her third husband, Ted Turner.  She again molded herself to the man she married, and became a philanthropist on a billionaire's arm.\n\nShe didn't miss movies, she says . . . not at first. But then, while writing her memoir, the itch came back.\n\n\"Monster in Law\" marked her over-the-top return. Critics hated it, but no matter: Fonda loved it. She was re-energized.\n\n\"Were you a little rusty, or was it like riding a bike?\" Cowan asked.\n\n\"No! It's like riding a bike, totally!\"\n\nSoon she was back to writing, too. She finished \"Prime Time\" last year, and it's pure Fonda - a straight-talking how-to-age manual detailing everything from planning a will  to having sex after 70.\n\n\"I wanted to write a book where older people would say Nobody's ever said this before! \" she laughed.\n\nShe's even got a new series of workout DVDs designed for people like her, who can't quite do what they used to.\n\nIs she proof that exercise works? \"Well, you know they'll say, 'Oh I guess it works.' But you know, I've made no secret of the fact that I've had some plastic surgery. And I have good genes.\"\n\nShe's a mother, now a grandmother, and has found love again she says, this time with music producer Richard Perry.\n\nShe may have had more acts that a variety show - and yet, it's this last act she says, that's her favorite.\n\n\"I think with a lot of intention, and courage, and stick -to-it-ive-ness, I have managed to overcome my weaknesses and to play on my strengths and to become a happy, peaceful, present person,\" she said.\n\nFor more info:\n\n© 2012 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "Remember when Jane Fonda revolutionized exercise in a leotard and leg warmers?\n\nRemember when Jane Fonda became the queen of 1980s at-home exercise?\n\nReleased in 1982, \"Jane Fonda's Workout\" is one of the bestselling VHS tapes of all time. Following on the heels of her New York Times bestseller of the previous year, \"Jane Fonda's Workout Book,\" the home video helped galvanize the actor's aerobics empire, which held strong throughout the '80s and into the '90s.\n\nWith VHS tapes, books, LPs and those long-forgotten videodiscs, Fonda showed us why we didn't need the gym to get fit, laying the groundwork for the hugely profitable home video industry at the time - not to mention the explosion of the fitness industry today.\n\nAs gyms and in-person classes have shifted to living room workouts due to the coronavirus pandemic, Fonda's ballet-inspired classic routine has been thrust back into the spotlight and touted as standing the test of time. (She's even taken to TikTok to revive the workout and promote her climate crisis efforts.)\n\nWhen Fonda released the video of herself in a striped leotard, black tights and burgundy stirrup leg warmers - flanked by a crew of high-energy men and women whooping through repetitions of side stretches and leg lifts - she was undergoing something of a reinvention.\n\n\"Jane Fonda's Workout\" wasn't just an exercise in transformation for the millions of viewers who bought her tapes, but for the model-turned award-winning actor turned activist, too.\n\n\"It was a pretty interesting time for me because people recognized me in a whole different way,\" Fonda recalled in the 2018 HBO documentary \"Jane Fonda In Five Acts.\"\n\nRelated article Remember When Kylie Minogue's gold hotpants stole the turn of the millennium?\n\nFonda is no stranger to reinvention. Born to an actor father (Henry Fonda) and socialite mother, she rose to fame in the 1960s with a string of romcoms and as the spacey vixen of 1968 cult classic \"Barbarella,\" before diving into political activism in the US, notably as a thorn in the side of then President Richard Nixon.\n\nLike many Americans, the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War had inspired Fonda to activism in the late 1960s, and her fundraising for the Black Panthers and antiwar campaign efforts eventually landed her under surveillance by the FBI, CIA and NSA.\n\nIn 1970, her now iconic mugshot, showing her with choppy hair and a defiant raised fist, captured the mood of the counterculture. Fonda had been arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking and for assaulting a customs officer while on her way into Cleveland after giving an anti-Vietnam War speech in Canada.\n\nRelated article Remember when Dolly Parton fully subverted the 'dumb blonde' cliché with her '80s excess styling?\n\nBut Fonda's mugshot wasn't the only image of her to spread like wildfire. In 1972, she ignited outrage when she was photographed while touring North Vietnam, where she made a radio plea to US troops to reconsider the civilian cost of the war. Fonda has repeatedly apologized for the photo, which showed her on an anti-aircraft gun used to take down American planes. Media outlets ran with the biting nickname \"Hanoi Jane.\"\n\n\"It was a very tumultuous and polarized time,\" she said in the HBO documentary. \"...I didn't always know how to channel my anger in constructive ways.\"\n\nA decade later, in her aerobics videos, Fonda's message was aspirational and approachable - anyone could change their body and their life - and her outfit, leotard, leggings and, of course, leg warmers, became the workout uniform de rigueur for 1980s wellness. Now with soft curls and a bright encouraging smile, her workout series looked like a departure from the image of her as a radical revolutionary.\n\nBut Fonda's new endeavor as a relatable fitness instructor was still a political act. She filmed \"Jane Fonda's Workout\" in order to further her causes, with all the profits going to the Campaign for Economic Democracy, a political action committee (PAC) she co-founded with her husband at the time, Tom Hayden.\n\nWith her new PAC, Fonda had a more focused agenda. She and Hayden wanted to move \"power out of the super rich and the corporations into the hands of people - the way it should be in a democracy,\" she said in the documentary. \"We knew we wanted to spread a message throughout the country.\"\n\nRelated article Remember when the women of Twin Peaks made nostalgia new again?\n\nThey decided to start a business to fund the work, first considering a restaurant or a carwash, she said. But Fonda had a background studying ballet, and the idea for her to capitalize on her knowledge of fitness just clicked. \"And then one day I suddenly thought: the workout. If It's one thing I understand it's working out.\"\n\nHer routine was meant to help women become stronger and healthier, but it wound up having that effect on her, too. She had been hiding an eating disorder before she became famous for her workout video, and Fonda credits the exercise with helping her build healthier habits, though she continued to struggle with her disorder, which she refers to as an addiction, for many years.\n\n\"The longer space you put between yourself and the addiction, the easier it gets,\" she told People in 2018. \"I started the workout, and that kind of cemented my ability to eat normal, which I can do now. Some people say you can never get over it, but you can.\"\n\nThis February, Fonda will receive a lifetime achievement award at the Golden Globes. Outside of her acting work, her ongoing activism has also been in the spotlight. In 2019, she launched a series of climate action events called Fire Drill Fridays in Washington DC. There, she has led demonstrations - and been arrested while doing so - while wearing her recognizable bright red coat, which she has vowed is the last item of clothing she'll ever buy, in order to keep a more sustainable closet.\n\nFonda's fitness brand and her activism have always been connected through their purpose, but she has always remained ardent in their symmetry of spirit as well. Early in her career, she stated: \"Any healthy country, like any healthy individual, should be in perpetual revolution, perpetual change.\" Through all of her reinventions, that belief has been a constant.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

It showed that she's not that good an interviewer.\"\n\nAs to whether Fonda would ever appear on Kelly's show again, the actress said yes, but only \"if she comes around and learns her stuff, sure.\"\n\nRelated: Jane Fonda really didn't want to talk about plastic surgery with Megyn Kelly\n\nKelly reacted to Fonda's criticism on her show, \"Megyn Kelly Today.\"\n\n\"It's time to address the poor-me routine,\" Kelly said. \"First, some context. Fonda was on to promote a film about aging. For years, she has spoken openly about her joy in giving a cultural face to older women.\"\n\nKelly went on to say that she doesn't need advice from Fonda.\n\n\"But I have no regrets about the question,\" Kelly said. \"Nor am I in the market for a lesson from Jane Fonda on what is and is not appropriate. After all, this is a woman whose name is synonymous with outrage.\"\n\nThe viral moment between Kelly and Fonda took place in September when the former Fox News host asked Fonda about the \"work\" she's had done. Fonda appeared on Kelly's show with Robert Redford to promote their film, \"Our Souls at Night.\"\n\n\"You've been an example to everyone in how to age beautifully and with strength and unapologetically,\" Kelly said to Fonda at the time. \"You admit you've had work done, which I think is to your credit. But you look amazing...I read that you said you're not proud to say you've had work done. Why not?\"\n\nFonda responded after a pause and then changed the subject back to her movie: \"Good attitude, good posture. I take care of myself. But let me tell you why I love this movie that we did, 'Our Souls at Night,' rather than plastic surgery.\"\n\nBut Kelly on Monday not only defended her interview with Fonda, but questioned the actress' patriotism.\n\n\"By the way, she still says she's not proud of America,\" Kelly said. \"So, the moral indignation is a little much. She put her plastic surgery out there. She said she wanted to discuss the plight of older women in America. And honestly she has no business lecturing anyone on what qualifies as offensive.\"\n\nFonda courted controversy during a 1972 visit to North Vietnam, where she met with and posed for pictures with the Viet Cong at an anti-aircraft gun site. She denounced \"US imperialism\" on Viet Cong radio, earning her the nickname \"Hanoi Jane.\" Fonda publicly apologized for her actions in a \"20/20\" interview in 1988.\n\n\"Look at her treatment of our military during the Vietnam War. Many of our veterans still call her 'Hanoi Jane' thanks to her radio broadcasts which attempted to shame American troops,\" Kelly said. \"She posed on an anti-aircraft gun used to shoot down our pilots.\"\n\nCNN has reached out to Fonda's representative for comment.\n\nOliver Darcy and Tom Kludt contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

But the 80-year-old Hollywood icon is not entirely proud of her beauty decisions.\n\nFonda opened up about getting plastic surgery in a new HBO documentary about her life, \" Jane Fonda in Five Acts ,\" which is available for streaming on Monday, September 24. She said that while she's glad she \"looks good for [her] age,\" she won't lie about getting work done , as reported by People.\n\n\"On one level, I hate the fact that I've had the need to alter myself physically to feel that I'm OK,\" she says. \"I wish I wasn't like that. I love older faces. I love lived-in faces. I loved Vanessa Redgrave's face.\"\n\n\"I wish I was braver. But I am what I am.\"\n\nIn the past, Fonda has admitted to getting rid of wrinkles and having work done on her jaw. The Oscar-winning actress and activist told Harper's Bazaar in 2011 that she's \"vain\" and particularly self-conscious about \" loose flesh.\"\n\n\"I was taught by my father that how I looked was all that mattered, frankly,\" she told the magazine. \"He was a good man, and I was mad for him, but he sent messages to me that fathers should not send: Unless you look perfect, you're not going to be loved.\"\n\nFonda is well-known for launching a workout video empire and her fanatical love of pilates - but her obsessive workout habits often grew from her battle with body image.\n\nShe struggled with eating disorders anorexia and bulimia for about 30 years.\n\n\"I wasn't very happy from, I would say, puberty to 50? It took me a long time,\" she told Harper's Bazaar. \"It was in my 40s, and if you suffer from bulimia, the older you get, the worse it gets. It takes longer to recover from a bout. I had a career, I was winning awards, I was supporting nonprofits, I had a family. I had to make a choice: I live or I die.\"\n\nShe told The Guardian in 2015 that she believes plastic surgery can easily become \"an addiction,\" especially for women who experienced trauma in the past.\n\n\"I wish I were brave enough to not do plastic surgery but I think I bought myself a decade,\" she said.\n\nVisit INSIDER's homepage for more.\n\nFollow INSIDER on Facebook .\n\nJump to"

I love being outdoors in the woods, especially up and down hills.\"\n\nRegardless of her schedule, Fonda ensures that she gets a bit of exercise every day .\n\n\"I work out every day, so it is important to mix up the way I move. I alternate days doing upper body and lower body work for strength. I also find some way to get cardio in. Walking outside is one of my favorite ways to do so,\" she said.\n\nThe actor has long been passionate about fitness. In the '80s, she released a series of home workout videos , beginning with \"Jane Fonda's Workout\" in 1982.\n\nLooking back at her home workout tapes, Fonda said she had \"no idea\" they would become so popular.\n\n\"When I was starting out, there weren't many rigorous forms of exercise available to women,\" Fonda said. \"I learned the basic workout from a charismatic teacher named Leni Kasden in the '70s.\"\n\nAfter the videos were released, she would receive \"amazing letters from around the world\" from fans about how the workouts impacted their lives, she added.\n\n\"One was from a young woman in the Peace Corps in Guatemala who did the exercises in her mud hut,\" Fonda said. \"Another woman said she looked in the mirror as she was brushing her teeth and noticed new muscles in her arms. She wrote that it made her feel empowered, and that day she went to work and stood up to her handsy boss for the first time.\"\n\nFor those who lead sedentary lifestyles, the best thing they can do for their health is to start somewhere , Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, a preventative cardiologist, told Business Insider previously.\n\n\"Doing something is better than doing nothing,\" she said. \"If walking is the beginning stages of embracing a heart healthy life, then it is the initial stages that will create habits that will be sustainable and last for a lifetime.\"\n\nA study published in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology in 2023 found that walking just 4,000 steps a day can lower a person's risk of dying early .\n\nResearch shows that walking can help reduce stress and anxiety while improving heart health. Some studies also suggest that brisk walking - at about 2.7 to 3 miles an hour - can make a bigger difference in terms of health benefits.\n\nA representative for Fonda did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by BI outside regular hours.\n\nJump to"

During the episode which aired Thursday, she attributed it to overcoming a fear of asking that her sexual needs be met.\n\n\"You know, we waste way too much time not wanting to say, 'Wait a minute, hold, hold it, hold it. No, no, no. Slow down. And a little to the left.'

      "text": "Meet the man behind Jane Fonda and Sharon Osbourne's stunning gray hair transformations\n\nBefore she had even announced the Academy Award winner for best picture, Hollywood icon Jane Fonda shocked everyone when she appeared onstage with a brand new gray hairdo.\n\nA week later, Sharon Osbourne similarly surprised fans when she debuted silver hair that was drastically different from her signature red locks.\n\nFonda and Osbourne may have just begun a new movement in celebrity beauty , and they have Jack Martin to thank.\n\nThe California hair colorist has become famous for helping women embrace their gray hair, and clients have flown from as far as Australia and Argentina just to get into his chair.\n\nMartin, who has been coloring hair for 28 years, told Insider that he has done approximately 500 gray transformations.\n\nIt all began three years ago, when a client came into his salon and said she was tired of dyeing her gray hair brown. Martin knew it would be tricky - she had been using at-home dye every three to four weeks for years - but he loved a challenge.\n\nAfter 12 hours, the woman's hair was a gorgeous icy silver. Martin had found his calling.\n\nMartin became more and more well-known for his skill with gray transformations through the years, eventually catching 82-year-old Fonda's attention.\n\nBut when he first got the call about doing Fonda's hair for the Oscars, Martin thought it was a joke.\n\n\"I thought it was a fake message, that somebody was playing a game with me,\" he told Insider. \"When I found out it was a real message, I was very happy. I felt proud of myself that my work got to Jane Fonda.\"\n\nMartin was booked solid for weeks with clients who had already paid for flights and hotels to see him. So, on the Sunday before the Oscars, he came in on his day off to do Fonda's hair.\n\nThe colorist said Fonda was \"phenomenal and energetic\" from the minute she got out of her car and greeted him at his Tustin salon.\n\n\"She said, 'What a beautiful accent you have, where are you from?\"' recalled Martin, who was born in Syria.\n\nMartin said Fonda, a longtime political activist , expressed sympathy for his native country - which has been caught in a civil war since 2011. Then, she gave him a hug.\n\n\"We have the wrong idea about celebrities, to be honest with you,\" Martin added. \"They're very down to earth, they're human beings. They're sweet, they're like everyone else. The difference is they have a spotlight on them.\"\n\nAs Martin got started, he said Fonda worked on her upcoming book and memorized lines for the last season of \"Grace and Frankie,\" the Netflix show that she stars in with Lily Tomlin.\n\n\"At the same time she was reading newspapers, talking with me and her crew, laughing and joking,\" Martin said. \"She has a very cute sense of humor and, honestly, I didn't want the day to end.\"\n\nMartin said Fonda was \"very happy\" with his work, which she put on display a week later at the Academy Awards.\n\n\"I got the chills when she walked onstage,\" he said. \"She really owned the show completely with her new look, she shocked everybody. I could not be more proud than that moment.\"\n\nOsbourne, 67, had actually heard about Martin six months ago. But it was after seeing Fonda's new hair that she finally decided to take the plunge and go gray.\n\nMartin said Osbourne had been coloring her hair red every week for 18 years.\n\n\"She had very bad experiences before, trying to get out of the red color,\" he added. \"But every time she did, they turned her hair into a disaster.\"\n\nMartin said Obsourne's hair was \"definitely harder\" compared to Fonda's, and he told \"The Talk\" host that there was no guarantee he could get her to silver.\n\nBut after eight hours, Osbourne's hair had been completely transformed.\n\n\"Oh my god, her reaction,\" he said. \"She was like, 'You are a magician, wow my hair even feels much better than when it was red.\"'\n\nOsbourne later spoke about her new hairdo during last Tuesday's episode of \"The Talk.\"\n\nPlatinum Queen 👑\n\nA post shared by  The Talk (@thetalkcbs) on Feb 18, 2020 at 12:06pm PST Feb 18, 2020 at 12:06pm PST\n\n\"I was just so fed up of going and having it dyed and having it dyed, and I was just like, I can't do this anymore,\" Osbourne told her cohosts. \"Why am I trying to do something or be something that I'm not? Just be who you are.\"\n\nOsbourne's comments are similar to what Martin says he hears every week from the women in his salon chair.\n\n\"They are so frustrated of the commitment or the trap of coloring every two to three weeks ,\" he said. \"They just want to free themselves.\"\n\n\"There's nothing better than being natural, you know,\" he added. \"But we can enhance that nature by allowing ladies to grow their own natural hair and add a little bit of enhancement to it and make it a little more glamorous. They even look younger in the after photo compared to the before photo.\"\n\nMartin always has his clients grow out 3-4 inches of their natural hair before coming into his salon. This allows him to see the pattern of their natural roots, which he then tries to match.\n\nBlack colored hair to ashy blonde. This beautiful client came to me from The bay area seeking grey silver color to blend and match her natural gray roots so she can stop coloring her hair black color, total service was 12 hours, and I can say that was the hardest project I have ever done in my whole career just because her ends were extremely dark and it took me for ever to lighten it but I had to choose between reaching my goal with damaged results and reaching a blended blonde with healthier hair and like you see I choose the second option. I started the long process by cutting the hair to a semi A-line bob with layers because I always believed in building the house then paint it, then I started removing the artificial dye using @pravana color extractor twice for 20 minutes each process, then I bleach the whole head starting from where her gray roots starts in foils by taking very thin sections using @oligopro with 20 vol and @olaplex for 4 hours, after hour and half I reopened each foil and reapplied a new lightener mixture on the warm areas until I reached the lightest pale blonde, rinsed hair, pre-toned with @redken shade eq 1/2 oz 9V + 1/2 oz 9B + 1 oz clear mixed with 2 oz processing solution for 20 minutes, rinsed, dry hair 70% then apply @wellahairusa pale platinum mixed with 6 vol and brass kicker applied on the whole hair only leaving her natural roots out for 30 minutes. Then did Olaplex number 2 for 20 minutes to reconstruct the hair, shampooed, style with round brushes. #behindthechair #modernsalon #americansalon @behindthechair_com @american_salon @modernsalon #tustinhairstylist #tustinsalon #tustinhair #irvinehair #irvinesalon #irvinebalayage #newportbeachsalon #newportbeachhair #newportbeachbalayage #silverhair #orangecountysalon #orangecountyhairstylist #beverlyhillshair #beverlyhillssalon #beverlyhillshairstylist #olaplex #greyhair #greyhairdontcare @wellaeducation #oligopro @saloncentric @cosmoprofbeauty\n\nA post shared by  ᒍᗩᑕK ᗰᗩᖇTIᑎ (@jackmartincolorist) on Nov 21, 2019 at 9:30am PST Nov 21, 2019 at 9:30am PST\n\nThis beautiful client came to me from North Carolina with hair that had multi different light and dark brassy colors, she was seeking gray silver ashy color to blend and match her gray roots so she can stop coloring her hair every 3-4 weeks, total service was 10 hours and one session, I started the long process by cutting her hair to a shorter bob with layers, then I bleach the whole head starting from where her gray roots starts in foils using @redken flash lift power 9 with 20 vol with @olaplex leaving her gray roots out for about 4 hours by foiling the hair based on her root gray pattern very thin sections for faster and even lifting until I reached level 10 pale yellow blonde, at the same time all the hair that was left outside the foils I colored it with redken gels 1/2 5AB + 1/2 7Ab mixed with 10 vol for about 30 min to create that salt and pepper look. I Then rinsed hair, toned with @redken shade eq 1/2 oz 9b + 1/2 oz 9v mixed with 2oz Cristal clear and 3 oz of processing solution for 20 minuets, rinsed, shampooed, conditioned, styled with round brushes.

Martin then adds dimension to the strands by blending two to three different shades that fit with the natural gray pattern.\n\nThe process can take anywhere from eight to 15 hours - depending on how long, thick, and dark the client's hair is - but the upkeep is extremely minimal.\n\nAfter their gray transformations, Martin's clients tend to come in only two to three times a year for a toning service that brings the icy silver effect back to their strands.\n\nA lot of people, stylists and clients asked me to post a photo of how my silver transformations look like after few weeks, this beautiful client came to me for silver transformation 3 month ago, today she just came back for a trim and I suggested to give her more layers. Client is extremely happy with the way the color stayed , but she followed religiously all maintenance steps I asked her to do, purple shampoo, shampoo once a week with cold water, eliminate the use of hot tools, use a deep conditioning mask once a week. I hope this post answers a lot of people's concerns about the upkeeps and the fading process. #behindthechair #modernsalon #americansalon #tustinhairstylist #tustinsalon #tustinhair #irvinehair #irvinehairstylist #irvinesalon #irvinebalayage #newportbeachsalon #newportbeachhair #newportbeachhairstylist #newportbeachbalayage #orangecountysalon #orangecountyhairstylist #beverlyhillshair #beverlyhillssalon #beverlyhillshairstylist @behindthechair_com @modernsalon @american_salon\n\nA post shared by  ᒍᗩᑕK ᗰᗩᖇTIᑎ (@jackmartincolorist) on Jan 5, 2020 at 11:23am PST Jan 5, 2020 at 11:23am PST\n\nMartin also gives his clients a toner formula to take home, along with a list of simple tips that include washing with cold water, using purple shampoo, and staying away from hot tools.\n\nAfter transforming Fonda and Osbourne's hair, Martin said business has never been better. And he doesn't see the gray trend going away anytime soon.\n\n\"It's already all over social media with groups like 'Silver Sisters' and 'Silver Hair Don't Care,'\" he said. \"Ladies are supporting each other. Silver hair isn't related to just old age anymore, and I like that.\"\n\nThis beautiful client came to me from ocean side seeking silver hair to match her roots. I lightened the whole head in foils just the colored hair by taking very thin sections in lots of foils using the amazing extra blonde by @oligopro with 20 vol and the amazing @olaplex until I reached level 10 natural blonde and toned the hair with @wellahairusa blondor new permanent toner 1/2 pale silver and 1/2 pale platinum with 2 capful brass kicker mixed with 6 vol for 30 minutes.

I led a secret life.\"\n\n\"I was very, very unhappy,\" she added. \"I assumed I wouldn't live past 30 - I'm 85, I don't understand. I didn't go out. I didn't hardly date because I was unhappy and I had this eating disorder. And then I was also making movies that I didn't very much like.\"\n\nFonda, who is the daughter of the Hollywood legend Henry Fonda, previously said her mother, Frances Ford Seymour, also developed an eating disorder before her suicide at age 42 in 1950, when Jane Fonda was 12.\n\nFonda went on to say that while her eating disorder seemed \"so innocent\" and \"so innocuous\" at first, it didn't stay that way.\n\n\"What you don't realize is it becomes a terrible addiction that takes over your life,\" she said, adding that she was \"miserable\" and \"kept wanting to quit.\"\n\n\"It harms the way you look. You end up looking tired. It becomes impossible to have an authentic relationship when you're doing this secretly,\" she continued. \"Your day becomes organized around getting food and then eating it, which requires that you're by yourself and that no one knows what you're doing.\"\n\nFonda added that as she got older, her bulimia got \"worse and worse\" and began to take a toll on her body, leading her to think: \"If I keep on like this, I'm going to die.\"\n\nIn her 40s, the actor said, she sought to quit \"cold turkey\" without the help of a medical professional or support group simply because she didn't know that was an option.\n\n\"I didn't realize there were groups you could join,\" the \"Barbarella\" star said. \"I didn't know anything about that.

It becomes easier and easier.\"\n\nCorrection: February 9, 2023 - An earlier version of this story misidentified Jane Fonda's father. He was Henry Fonda, not Henry Ford.
