Thousands of his supporters were outside the Capitol that day and hundreds broke in, many of them beating and injuring law enforcement officers in brutal hand-to-hand combat as the officers tried to stop them from storming through windows and doors. There is ample video evidence of the violence, and more than 1,400 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the riot.\n\nMany of those who broke into the Capitol were echoing Trump's false claims of election fraud, and some menacingly called out the names of lawmakers - particularly then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and then-Vice President Mike Pence, who refused to try to object to Biden's legitimate win. The rioters interrupted the certification of Biden's victory, but lawmakers who had evacuated both chambers returned that night to finish.\n\nTrump, now the presumptive GOP nominee to challenge Biden, has not only continued to mislead voters about what happened that day but has also heaped praise on the rioters , calling them \"hostages\" and promising to pardon them if he is elected. A look at some of his false claims:\n\nCLAIM: At the debate, Trump was asked by CNN's Jake Tapper what he would say to any voters \"who believe that you have violated your constitutional oath through your actions, inaction on January 6, 2021, and worry that you'll do it again?\" Trump simply replied: \"Well, I didn't say that to anybody. I said peacefully and patriotically.\"\n\nTHE FACTS: In a speech on the White House Ellipse the morning of Jan. 6 to thousands of supporters, Trump did tell the crowd to march \"peacefully and patriotically\" to the Capitol. But he also used far more incendiary language when speaking off the cuff in other parts of the speech, such as telling the crowd: \"We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.\"\n\nTrump did not address Tapper's question about his inaction as his supporters broke into the building and injured police. More than three hours elapsed between the time his supporters violently breached the Capitol perimeter and Trump's first effort to get the rioters to disperse. He released a video message at 4:17 p.m. that day in which he asked his supporters to go home but reassured them, \"We love you, you're very special.\"\n\nSome rioters facing criminal charges have said in court they believed they had been following Trump's instructions on Jan. 6. And evidence shown during trials illustrates that far-right extremists were galvanized by a Trump tweet inviting his supporters to a \"wild\" protest on Jan. 6. \"He called us all to the Capitol and wants us to make it wild!!!\" wrote one Oath Keepers member who was convicted of seditious conspiracy.\n\nCLAIM: Trump said at the debate: \"They talk about a relatively small number of people that went to the Capitol. And in many cases were ushered in by the police.\" The next day, Trump said at a rally: \"So many of these people were told to go in, right? The police: 'Go in, go in, go in.'\"\n\nTHE FACTS: More than 100 Capitol Police and Metropolitan Police officers were injured, some severely, as they tried to keep the rioters from breaking into the Capitol. In some cases police retreated or stepped aside as they were overwhelmed by the violent, advancing mob, but there is no evidence that any rioter was \"ushered\" into the building.\n\nIn an internal memo last year, U.S. Capitol Police Chief J. Thomas Manger said that the allegation that \"our officers helped the rioters and acted as 'tour guides'\" is \"outrageous and false.\" Manger said police were completely overwhelmed and outnumbered, and in many cases resorted to de-escalation tactics to try to persuade rioters to leave the building.\n\nThe Capitol Police said in a statement this week that \"under extreme circumstances, our officers performed their duties to the best of their ability to protect the members of Congress. With the assistance of multiple law enforcement agencies and the National Guard, which more than doubled the number of officers on site, it took several hours to secure the U.S. Capitol. At the end of the day, because of our officers' dedication, nobody who they were charged with protecting was hurt and the legislative process continued.\"\n\nCLAIM: Trump said he offered 10,000 National Guard troops to Pelosi and \"she now admits that she turned it down.\" Referring to a video Pelosi's daughter took that day, Trump claimed that Pelosi said, \"I take full responsibility for January 6.\"\n\nTHE FACTS: Trump has repeatedly and falsely claimed that he offered National Guard troops to the Capitol and that his offer was rejected. He has previously said he signed an order for 20,000 troops to go to the Capitol.\n\nWhile Trump was involved in discussions in the days prior to Jan. 6 about whether the National Guard would be called ahead of the joint session, he issued no such order or formal request before or during the rioting, and the guard's arrival was delayed for hours as Pentagon officials deliberated over how to proceed .\n\nIn a 2022 interview with the Democratic-led House committee that investigated the attack , Christopher Miller, the acting Defense secretary at that time, confirmed that there was no order from the president.\n\nThe Capitol Police Board makes the decision on whether to call National Guard troops to the Capitol, and two members of that board - the House Sergeant at Arms and the Senate Sergeant at Arms - decided through informal discussions not to call the guard ahead of the joint session that was eventually interrupted by Trump's supporters, despite a request from the Capitol Police. The House Sergeant at Arms reports to the Speaker of the House, who was then Pelosi, and the Senate Sergeant at Arms reported to then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. But Pelosi's office has said she was never informed of the request.\n\nThe board eventually requested the guard's assistance after the rioting was underway, and Pelosi and McConnell called the Pentagon and begged for military assistance. Pence, who was in a secure location inside the building, also called the Pentagon to demand reinforcements.\n\nIn a video recently released by House Republicans, Pelosi is seen in the back of a car on Jan. 6 and talking to an aide. In the raw video recorded by her daughter, Pelosi is angrily asking her aide why the National Guard wasn't at the Capitol when the rioting started. \"Why weren't the National Guard there to begin with?\" she asks.\n\n\"We did not have any accountability for what was going on there and we should have, this is ridiculous,\" Pelosi says, while her aide responds that security officials thought they had sufficient resources. \"They clearly didn't know and I take responsibility for not having them just prepare for more,\" Pelosi says in the video.\n\nThere is no mention of a request from Trump, and Pelosi never said that she took \"full responsibility for Jan. 6.\"\n\nIn a statement, Pelosi spokesman Ian Krager said Trump's repeated comments about Pelosi are revisionist history.\n\n\"Numerous independent fact-checkers have confirmed again and again that Speaker Pelosi did not plan her own assassination on January 6th,\" Krager said. \"The Speaker of the House is not in charge of the security of the Capitol Complex - on January 6th or any other day of the week.\"\n\nCLAIM: Trump said to Biden during the debate, \"What they've done to some people that are so innocent, you ought to be ashamed of yourself, what you have done, how you've destroyed the lives of so many people.\"\n\nTHE FACTS: Echoing Trump's false claims of a stolen election, rioters at the Capitol engaged in hand-to-hand combat with police and a slew of rioters were carrying weapons, including firearms, knives, brass knuckle gloves, a pitchfork, a hatchet, a sledgehammer and a bow. They also used makeshift weapons, including flagpoles, a table leg, hockey stick and crutch, to attack officers. Police officers were bruised and bloodied, some dragged into the crowd and beaten. One officer was crushed in a doorframe and another suffered a heart attack after a rioter pressed a stun gun against his neck and repeatedly shocked him. One rioter has been charged with climbing scaffolding and firing a gun in the air during the melee.\n\nThe rioters broke through windows and doors, ransacking the Capitol and briefly occupying the Senate chamber. Senators had evacuated minutes earlier. They also tried to break into the House chamber, breaking glass windows and beating on the doors. But police held them off with guns drawn.\n\nAbout 900 of the rioters have been sentenced, with roughly two-thirds of them receiving a term of imprisonment ranging from a few days to 22 years . Hundreds of people who went into the Capitol but did not attack police or damage the building were charged only with misdemeanors.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Barbara Whitaker, Alanna Durkin Richer, Melissa Goldin and Jill Colvin contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFind AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nOn Sunday President Joe Biden spoke to new Democratic members of Congress about the January 6th, 2021 Capitol riot and the importance of the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks at a reception for new Democratic members of Congress in the State Dining Room of the White House, Sunday, Jan. 5, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks with reporters after signing the Social Security Fairness Act in the East Room of the White House, Sunday, Jan. 5, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)\n\nPresident Joe Biden is decrying what he calls an \"unrelenting effort\" to downplay a mob of Donald Trump supporters overrunning the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to block certification of the 2020 election - seeking to contrast that day's chaos with what he promises will be an orderly transition returning Trump to power for a second term.\n\nIn an opinion piece published Sunday in The Washington Post, Biden recalled Jan. 6, 2021, writing that \"violent insurrectionists attacked the Capitol.\"\n\n\"We should be proud that our democracy withstood this assault,\" Biden wrote. \"And we should be glad we will not see such a shameful attack again this year.\"\n\nCongress is convening in Washington on Monday to certify Trump's victory in November's election - in a session presided over by the candidate he defeated, Vice President Kamala Harris . No violence, or even procedural objections, are expected this time, marking a return to a U.S. tradition that launches the peaceful transfer of presidential power.\n\nThat's despite Trump continuing to deny that he lost to Biden in 2020 , already musing publicly about staying beyond the Constitution's two-term White House limit, and promising to pardon some of the more than 1,250 people who have pleaded guilty or were convicted of crimes for the Capitol siege.\n\nIn his opinion piece, Biden says of the certification process, \"After what we all witnessed on Jan. 6, 2021, we know we can never again take it for granted.\" He doesn't mention Trump directly but says \"an unrelenting effort has been underway to rewrite - even erase - the history of that day.\"\n\n\"To tell us we didn't see what we all saw with our own eyes,\" Biden wrote. \"We cannot allow the truth to be lost.\"\n\nHe vowed that the \"election will be certified peacefully. I have invited the incoming president to the White House on the morning of Jan. 20, and I will be present for his inauguration that afternoon,\" even though Trump skipped Biden's inauguration in 2021.\n\n\"But on this day, we cannot forget,\" Biden added. \"We should commit to remembering Jan. 6, 2021, every year. To remember it as a day when our democracy was put to the test and prevailed. To remember that democracy - even in America - is never guaranteed.\"\n\nTrump, on Monday, didn't mention Biden's opinion piece but disputed the Democratic president's assertion that he's worked to ensure an orderly transfer of power from one administration to the next.\n\n\"They talk about a transition. They're always saying, 'Oh, no, we want to have a smooth transition from party to party of government,'\" Trump told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. \"Well, they're making it really difficult. They're throwing everything they can in the way.\"\n\nThose comments came as Trump bristled at an 11th hour order issued Monday by Biden banning offshore oil and gas drilling in most federal waters , which the Republican president-elect vowed to roll back once he's in office.\n\nBiden's published opinion piece on Sunday evening followed him telling reporters at the White House earlier in the day that the history of what occurred on Jan. 6, 2021, \"should not be rewritten\" and adding, \"I don't think it should be forgotten.\"\n\nBiden spent much of 2024 warning voters that Trump was a serious threat to the nation's democracy . And this past week, the president awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal to Liz Cheney and Bennie Thompson, leaders of the congressional investigation into the Capitol riot.\n\nAs he did with his opinion piece, Biden used his Sunday comments to reports to insist that he's overseeing a peaceful handover of power - and contrast that with Trump's actions in early 2021.\n\n\"I've reached out to make sure the smooth transition,\" Biden said of Trump's incoming administration. \"We've got to get back to basic, normal transfer of power.\"\n\nAsked if he still viewed his soon-to-be successor in the White House as a threat to democracy, Biden responded, \"I think what he did was a genuine threat to democracy. I'm hopeful we're beyond that now.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - In the follow-up to their 2018 bestseller \"How Democracies Die,\" authors Daniel Ziblatt and Steven Levitsky write about three rules that political parties must follow: accept the results of fair elections, reject the use of violence to gain power and break ties to extremists.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2020 election , they write, only one U.S. political party \"violated all three.\"\n\nSaturday marks the third anniversary of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol , and Donald Trump , the former president, is far-and-away the leading Republican candidate in 2024. He still refuses to acknowledge his earlier loss to President Joe Biden . Far from rejecting the rioters, he has suggested he would pardon some of those who have been convicted of violent crimes. Rather than distance himself from extremists, he welcomes them at his rallies and calls them patriots.\n\nAnd Trump is now backed by many of the Republican leaders who fled for their lives and hid from the rioters, even some who had condemned Trump. Several top GOP leaders have endorsed his candidacy.\n\nThe support for Trump starkly highlights the divisions in the aftermath of the deadly storming of the Capitol and frames the question about whose definition of governance will prevail - or if democracy will prevail at all.\n\n\"If our political leaders do not stand up in defense of democracy, our democracy won't be defended,\" said Levitsky, one of the Harvard professors whose new book is \"Tyranny of the Minority.\"\n\n\"There's no country in the world, no country on Earth in history, where the politicians abdicated democracy but the institutions held,\" he told The Associated Press. \"People have to defend democracy.\"\n\nThe third anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack comes during the most convulsive period in American politics in at least a generation, with Congress barely able to keep up with the basics of governing, and the start of the presidential nominating contests just over a week away.\n\nRep.

Scott Applewhite)\n\nTrump's persistent false claims that the election of 2020 was stolen - which has been rejected in at least 60 court cases , every state election certification and by the former president's one-time attorney general - continue to animate the presidential race as he eyes a rematch with Biden.\n\nInstead, Trump now faces more than 90 criminal charges in federal and state courts, including the federal indictment brought by special counsel Jack Smith that accused Trump of conspiring to defraud the U.S. over the election.\n\nBiden, speaking Friday near Pennsylvania's Valley Forge, commemorated Jan. 6, saying on that day \"we nearly lost America - lost it all.\"\n\nWhile the Congress returned that night to certify the election results and show the world democracy was still standing, Biden said Trump is now trying to revise the narrative of what happened that day - calling the rioters \"patriots\" and promising to pardon them. And he said some Republicans in Congress were complicit.\n\nMatthew Graves, U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia spoke to reporters on Thursday (Jan 4) saying \"much work has been done to hold members of the mob responsible for the crimes they committed.\"\n\n\"When the attack on Jan. 6 happened there was no doubt about the truth,\" Biden said. \"Now these MAGA voices - who know the truth about Trump and Jan. 6 - have abandoned the truth and abandoned the democracy.\"\n\nAt a quieter Capitol, without much ceremony planned for Saturday, it will be the last time the anniversary will pass before Congress is called upon again, on Jan. 6, 2025, to certify the results of the presidential election -- democracy once more put to the test.\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin, the Maryland Democrat who led Trump's impeachment over the insurrection, said Biden's 306-232 electoral victory in 2020 remains \"the hard, inescapable, irradicable fact that Donald Trump and his followers have not been able to accept - to this day.\"\n\nRaskin envisions a time when there will be a Capitol exhibit, and tours for visitors, to commemorate what happened Jan. 6, 2021. Five people died during the riot and the immediate aftermath, including Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed by police.\n\nAll told,140 police officers were injured in the Capitol siege, including U.S. Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick who died later. Several others died later by suicide.\n\nOne officer, Harry Dunn , has announced he is running for Congress to \"ensure it never happens again.\"\n\nTrump's decision to reject the results of the 2020 election was the only time Americans have not witnessed the peaceful transfer of presidential power, a hallmark of U.S. democracy.\n\nA giant portrait of George Washington resigning his military commission hangs in the U.S. Capitol, a symbol of the voluntary relinquishing of power - a move that was considered breathtaking at the time. He later was elected the first U.S. president.\n\nTrump opened his first rally of his 2024 presidential campaign with a popular recording of the J6 Prison Choir --- riot defendants singing \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" recorded over a phone line from jail, interspersed with Trump reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nMore than 1,200 people have been charged in the riot, with nearly 900 convicted , including leaders of the extremist groups the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers who are serving lengthy terms for seditious conspiracy .\n\nTrump has called Jan. 6 defendants \"hostages\" and said there was so much love at the \"Stop the Steal\" rally he held near the White House that day before he encouraged the mob to march down Pennsylvania Avenue, assuring he would be with them at the Capitol, though he never did join.\n\nAllies of Trump scoff at the narrative of Jan. 6 that has emerged. Mike Davis, a Trump ally sometimes mentioned as a future attorney general, has mocked the Democrats and others for turning Jan. 6 into a \"religious holiday.\"\n\nRepublican Kevin McCarthy, who went on to become House speaker, had called Jan. 6 the \"saddest day\" he ever had in Congress. But McCarthy, R-Calif., retired last month he endorsed Trump for president and said he would consider joining his cabinet.\n\nSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has said he would back whomever becomes the Republican Party nominee, despite a scathing speech at the time in which he called Trump's actions \"disgraceful\" and said the rioters \"had been fed wild falsehoods by the most powerful man on Earth because he was angry he lost an election.\"\n\nAsked about Trump's second-term agenda, GOP lawmakers brushed off his admission that he would be a dictator on \"day one.\"\n\n\"He's joking,\" said Trump ally Byron Donalds, R-Fla.\n\n\"Just bravado,\" said Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn. \"There's still checks and balances.\"\n\nLevitsky said when he and his colleague wrote their earlier book, they believed that the Republicans in Congress would be a \"bulwark against Trump.\"\n\nBut with so many of the Trump detractors having retired or been voted out of office, \"We were much less pessimistic than we are today.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jeff Dean)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Republican Donald Trump has launched his general election campaign not merely rewriting the history of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack , but positioning the violent siege and its failed attempt to overturn the 2020 election as a cornerstone of his bid to return to the White House .\n\nAt a weekend rally in Ohio , his first as the presumed Republican Party presidential nominee, Trump stood onstage, his hand raised in salute to the brim of his red MAGA hat, as a recorded chorus of prisoners in jail for their roles in the Jan. 6 attack sang the national anthem .\n\nAn announcer asked the crowd to please rise \"for the horribly and unfairly treated January 6th hostages.\" And people did, and sang along.\n\n\"They were unbelievable patriots,\" Trump said as the recording ended.\n\nHaving previously vowed to pardon the rioters , he promised to help them \"the first day we get into office.\"\n\nInitially relegated to a fringe theory on the edges of the Republican Party, the revisionist history of Jan. 6, which Trump amplified during the early days of the GOP primary campaign to rouse his most devoted voters, remains a rally centerpiece even as he must appeal more broadly to a general election audience.\n\nIn heaping praise on the rioters, Trump is shifting blame for his own role in the run-up to the bloody mob siege and asking voters to absolve hundreds of them - and himself - over the deadliest attack on a seat of American power in 200 years.\n\nAt the same time, Trump's allies are installing 2020 election-deniers to the Republican National Committee , further institutionalizing the lies that spurred the violence. That raises red flags about next year, when Congress will again be called upon to certify the vote.\n\nAnd they're not alone. Republicans in Congress are embarking on a re-investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack that seeks to shield Trump of wrongdoing while lawmakers are showcasing side theories about why thousands of his supporters descended on Capitol Hill in what became a brutal scene of hand-to-hand combat with police.\n\nFive people died in the riot and its aftermath.\n\nPresident Donald Trump arrives to speak at a rally in Washington, on Jan. 6, 2021.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File)\n\nTaken together, it's what those who study authoritarian regimes warn is a classic case of what's called consolidation - where the state apparatus is being transformed around a singular figure, in this case Trump.\n\nJason Stanley, a philosophy professor at Yale, said in history the question comes up over and over again: How could people not have taken an authoritarian leader at his word about what was going to happen?\n\n\"Listen to Trump,\" he said.\n\n\"When a coup against the democratic regime happens and it's not punished, that is a very strong indicator of the end of the rule of law and the victory of that authoritarian movement,\" said Stanley, the author of \"How Fascism Works.\"\n\n\"Americans have a hard time understanding that what happens in most of the world can happen here, too.\"\n\nTrump is facing a four-count federal indictment over Jan. 6 - charges he conspired to defraud Americans over his 2020 election defeat and obstructed the official proceeding in Congress to certify the vote for Joe Biden. As the Supreme Court considers Trump's claim that he should be immune from prosecution , it's unclear when the case will go to trial, raising the possibility it might not be resolved until after the election.\n\nThe initial House Select Committee on Jan. 6 found that Trump criminally engaged in a \"multi-part conspiracy\" to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election and failed to act to stop his supporters from attacking the Capitol and beating police.\n\nSupporters of President Donald Trump riot at the Capitol in Washington, on Jan. 6, 2021.

Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and attorney John Eastman face legal challenges over their work on the 2020 election.\n\nTrump's campaign, in response to an inquiry from The Associated Press, pointed to the work from the House investigators who are trying to show inconsistencies in the Select Committee's probe and its star witness Cassidy Hutchinson , a former aide who had a front-row seat to inner workings at the White House.\n\nTrump's national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Justice Department has spent more time prosecuting the former president and \"targeting Americans for peacefully protesting on January 6th\" than other criminals.\n\n\"President Trump will restore justice for all Americas who have been unfairly treated,\" she said.\n\nEven as Republicans worry privately that Trump risks turning off women and independent voters he would need in the general election rematch against Biden, top aides have said there is only so much they can do as Trump is going to be Trump .\n\nOver the weekend, Trump focused his attention on Liz Cheney , the former Republican congresswoman, who was vice chair of the Select Committee and personally secured Hutchinson's blockbuster 2022 testimony .\n\n\"She should go to Jail along with the rest of the Unselect Committee!\" Trump posted on social media.\n\nCheney posted in response - \"Hi Donald: you know these are lies\" - as she has worked to dispel falsehoods about Jan. 6.\n\n\"If your response to Trump's assault on our democracy is to lie & cover up what he did, attack the brave men & women who came forward with the truth, and defend the criminals who violently assaulted the Capitol,\" she said in one post, \"you need to rethink whose side you're on. Hint: It's not America's.\"\n\nSupporters of President Donald Trump gather for a rally on Jan. 6, 2021, at the Ellipse near the White House in Washington. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File)\n\nMany Republicans are willfully ignoring the issue, especially in Congress, despite lawmakers having run for their lives and taken shelter as the rioters stormed the Senate chamber and ransacked Capitol offices.\n\nSenators who sharply criticized Trump after the Jan. 6 attack, like Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and South Dakota's John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican, have now reluctantly endorsed him.\n\nOthers are still declining to endorse Trump, including Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, who voted to convict Trump in his second impeachment on the charge of inciting the insurrection for the Jan. 6 attack. But the holdouts are in the minority.\n\nAppearing on NBC's \"Meet The Press,\" Cassidy would only say, \"I plan to vote for a Republican for the presidency of the United States.\"\n\nOne Republican willing to speak out is Mike Pence, the former vice president, whom rioters shouted they wanted to \"hang\" that day as a makeshift gallows stood on the Capitol's West Front.\n\n\"I was there on January 6th. I have no doubt in my mind ... that some people were caught up in the moment,\" Pence said on CBS's \"Face the Nation.\"\n\n\"But the assaults on police officers, ultimately an environment that claimed lives, is something that I think was tragic that day,\" Pence said. \"And I'll never diminish it.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Through eight hearings, 20 live witnesses and dozens of hours of recorded testimony, the House Jan. 6 panel has focused its case squarely on former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe panel has unveiled stunning evidence about the Capitol insurrection over six weeks of hearings, laying out in vivid detail what the panel calls an \"attempted coup\" by Trump as he desperately sought to overturn Joe Biden's election. Culling material from more than 1,000 witnesses, lawmakers have shown that officials inside the government fought Trump's schemes at every turn, calling them \"nuts\" and \"unhinged.\"\n\nFrom jaw-dropping testimony, to shocking video, to never-before-seen documents, revelations came fast during the tightly scripted hearings. Here are the moments that stood out:\n\n'AN ATTEMPTED COUP'\n\nThe first hearing, aired in prime time and watched by more than 20 million viewers, set the stage for the next seven.\n\nIt laid out the conclusion that the panel would come back to in every hearing: that Trump conspired to overturn his own defeat, taking actions that sparked the violent insurrection at the Capitol, when hundreds of his supporters beat police and broke through windows and doors to interrupt the certification of President Joe Biden's victory.\n\n\"January 6th was the culmination of an attempted coup, a brazen attempt, as one rioter put it shortly after January 6th, to overthrow the government,\" said Mississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson, the Democratic chairman of the panel. \"The violence was no accident. It represents seeing Trump's last stand, most desperate chance to halt the transfer of power.\"\n\n'CARNAGE' AT THE CAPITOL\n\nCapitol Police Officer Caroline Edwards, one of two witnesses at the first hearing, described what she saw outside the Capitol on Jan. 6 as a \"war scene.\" As some Republicans, including Trump, have tried to downplay the violence of the insurrection, calling it \"peaceful,\" Edwards recalled the brutality she experienced on the front lines. She suffered a traumatic head injury that day as some of the first protesters barreled through the flimsy bike rack barriers that she and other officers were trying to hold.\n\n\"I couldn't believe my eyes,\" Edwards testified. \"There were officers on the ground. You know, they were bleeding. They were throwing up. ... It was carnage. It was chaos.\"\n\n'DETATCHED FROM REALITY'\n\nThe committee has used clips of its interview with former Attorney General Bill Barr in almost every hearing, showing the public over and over his definitive statements that the election was not stolen by Biden - and his description of Trump's resistance as he told the president the truth.\n\nAt the second hearing, the panel showed a clip of Barr recalling how he told Trump to his face that the Justice Department had found no evidence of the widespread voter fraud that Trump was claiming. Barr said he thought Trump had become \"detached from reality\" if he really believed his own theories and said there was \"never an indication of interest in what the actual facts were.\"\n\n\"And my opinion then and my opinion now is that the election was not stolen by fraud and I haven't seen anything since the election that changes my mind on that,\" Barr said.\n\nA TENSE CONVERSATION\n\nOne question going into the hearings was what Trump and Vice President Mike Pence talked about in a phone call the morning of Jan. 6. The conversation came after Trump had pressured his vice president for weeks to try and somehow object or delay as he presided over Biden's certification. Pence firmly resisted, and would gavel down Trump's defeat - and his own - in the early hours of Jan. 7, after rioters had been cleared from the Capitol.\n\nWhile only Trump and Pence were on the Jan. 6 call, White House aides filled in some details at the committee's third hearing by recounting what they heard Trump say on his end of the line.\n\n\"Wimp is the word I remember,\" said former Trump aide Nicholas Luna. \"You're not tough enough,\" recalled Keith Kellogg, Pence's national security adviser. \"It became heated\" after starting out in a calmer tone, said White House lawyer Eric Herschmann.\n\n\"It was a different tone than I'd heard him take with the vice president before,\" said Ivanka Trump.\n\n40 FEET AWAY\n\nEncouraged by Trump's tweet, after the attack had started, that Pence \"didn't have the courage to do what should have been done,\" rioters at the Capitol singled out the vice president. Many chanted \"Hang Mike Pence!\" as they moved through the building. Pence evacuated the Senate just minutes before the chamber was breached, and later was rushed to safety as rioters were just 40 feet away.\n\nGreg Jacob, the president's lawyer, testified at the third hearing and said he had not known they were that close.\n\nJacob said Secret Service agents wanted them to leave the building but Pence refused to get in the car. \"The vice president didn't want to take any chance\" that the world would see him leaving the Capitol, Jacob said.\n\n'I WILL NOT BREAK MY OATH'\n\nAt the committee's fourth hearing, state officials detailed the extraordinary pressure the president put on them to overturn their states' legitimate and certified results. Rusty Bowers, Arizona's House speaker, told the committee how Trump asked him directly to appoint alternate electors falsely stating that he had won the state of Arizona and not Biden.\n\nBowers detailed additional calls with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani. \"I will not do it,\" Bowers told him, adding: \"You are asking me to do something against my oath, and I will not break my oath.\"\n\nLIVES UPENDED\n\nGeorgia election workers Wandrea \"Shaye\" Moss and her mother, Ruby Freeman, also testified before the panel in the fourth hearing, describing constant threats after Trump and his allies spread false rumors that they introduced suitcases of illegal ballots and committed other acts of election fraud. The Justice Department debunked those claims.\n\nThe two women said they had their lives upended by Trump's false claims and his efforts to go after them personally. Through tears, Moss told lawmakers that she no longer leaves her house.\n\nIn videotaped testimony, Freeman said there is \"nowhere I feel safe\" after the harassment she experienced.\n\nJUSTICE DEPARTMENT RESISTS THE SCHEME\n\nWhen his efforts to overturn his defeat failed in the courts and in the states, Trump turned his focus to the leadership of the Justice Department.\n\nRichard Donoghue, the acting No. 2 at the time, testified about his resistance to entreaties by another department official, Jeffrey Clark, who was circulating a draft letter recommending that battleground states reconsider the election results. Trump at one point floated replacing then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen with Clark, but backed down after Donoghue and others threatened to resign.\n\n\"For the department to insert itself into the political process this way, I think would have had grave consequences for the country,\" Donoghue testified. \"It may very well have spiraled us into a constitutional crisis.\"\n\n'THEY'RE NOT HERE TO HURT ME'\n\nIn a surprise sixth hearing, former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson recounted some of Trump's actions on Jan. 6, including his dismissive response when told that some in the crowd waiting for him to speak outside the White House were armed.\n\n\"I was in the vicinity of a conversation where I overheard the president say something to the effect of, 'I don't effing care that they have weapons,'\" Hutchinson said. \"'They're not here to hurt me. Take the effin' mags away. Let my people in. They can march to the Capitol from here.'\"\n\nUpset that the crowd didn't appear larger, Trump told his aides to take the metal-detecting magnetometers away. In the coming hours, he would step on the stage and tell them to \"fight like hell.\"\n\nHutchinson also described Trump's anger after security officials told him he couldn't go to the U.S. Capitol with his supporters after he had told them he would. She said she was told that the president even grabbed the steering wheel in the presidential SUV when he was told he couldn't go.\n\nFor the president to have visited the Capitol during Biden's certification, and as his supporters descended on the building, would have been unprecedented.\n\n'UNHINGED' WHITE HOUSE MEETING\n\nAt its seventh hearing, the committee painstakingly reconstructed a Dec. 18 meeting at the White House where outside advisers to Trump pushing election fraud claims clashed with White House lawyers and others who were telling him to give up the fight.\n\nThe six-hour meeting featured profanity, screaming and threats of fisticuffs, according to the participants, as Trump lawyer Sidney Powell and others threw out conspiracy theories, including that the Democrats were working with Venezuelans and that voting machines were hacked. Pat Cipollone, the top White House lawyer, testified that he kept asking for evidence, to no avail.\n\nHours later, at 1:42 a.m., Trump sent a tweet urging supporters to come for a \"big protest\" on Jan. 6: \"Will be wild,\" Trump promised.\n\n187 MINUTES\n\nThe final hearing focused on what Trump was doing for 187 minutes that afternoon, between his speech at the rally and when he finally released a video telling the rioters to go home at 4:17 p.m.\n\nThey showed that Trump was sitting at a dining room table near the Oval Office, watching Fox News coverage of the violence. But he made no calls for help - not to the Defense Department, the Homeland Security Department nor the attorney general - even as his aides repeatedly told him to call it off.\n\nIn the video released at 4:17 p.m., as some of the worst of the fighting was still happening down the street, Trump told rioters to go home but said they were \"very special.\"\n\nThe committee showed never-before-seen outtakes of a speech Trump released on Jan. 7 in which he condemned the violence and promised an orderly transition of power. But he bristled at one line in the prepared script, telling his daughter Ivanka Trump and others in the room, \"I don't want to say the election is over.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the Jan. 6 committee hearings at https://apnews.com/hub/capitol-siege .\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., as he presides over a joint session of Congress as it convenes to count the Electoral College votes cast in November's election, at the Capitol in Washington, Jan. 6, 2021. (Saul Loeb/Pool via AP, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - This presidential election , the first since the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol , will be a stress test of the new systems and guardrails that Congress put in place to ensure America's long tradition of the peaceful transfer of presidential power.\n\nAs Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris race toward the finish, pro-democracy advocates and elected officials are preparing for a volatile period in the aftermath of Election Day, as legal challenges are filed, bad actors spread misinformation and voters wait for Congress to affirm the results.\n\n\"One of the unusual characteristics of this election is that so much of the potential danger and so many of the attacks on the election system are focused on the post-election period,\" said Wendy Weiser, vice president for democracy at the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nAfter the Jan. 6 attack, Congress set out to shore up the process and prevent a repeat of that unprecedented period when Trump, joined by some GOP allies in Congress, refused to concede defeat to President Joe Biden . Trump spent months pushing dozens of failed legal cases before sending his supporters to the U.S. Capitol, where they disrupted the electoral count with a bloody riot. He faces a federal indictment for the scheme, which included slates of fake electors from states falsely claiming he won.\n\nWhile the new Electoral Count Reform Act approved by Congress has clarified the post-election processes - to more speedily resolve legal challenges and reinforce that the vice president has no ability to change the election outcome on Jan. 6 - the new law is by no means ironclad.\n\nMuch depends on the people involved, from the presidential winners and losers to the elected leaders in Congress and the voters across America putting their trust in the democratic system that has stood for more than 200 years. Over the weekend, Trump said he and House Speaker Mike Johnson have a \"little secret\" for winning the election.\n\nA poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that American voters are approaching the election with deep unease about what could follow.\n\nDick Gephardt, the former House leader, now serves on the executive board of the nonpartisan Keep our Republic, which has been working to provide civic education about the process in the presidential battleground states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.\n\n\"We are concerned about one thing and one thing only: Can Americans still have valid trust in elections and can we have consistently a peaceful transfer of power in all offices, including the presidency?\" Gephardt said in a briefing earlier this month.\n\n\"January 6th in 2021 was really a wake-up call, I think, for all of us,\" he said.\n\nIt's not just the onslaught of legal challenges that worries democracy groups, as dozens of cases already have been filed by both Republicans and Democrats even before Election Day. They say the sheer volume of cases has the potential to sow doubt in the election tally and give rise to disinformation, both domestic and foreign, as happened in 2020 when Trump's legal team unfurled far-flung theories that proved to be wildly inaccurate .\n\nAs Trump runs to retake the White House, he is already setting the stage for challenges to the election he wants to be \"too big to rig.\" The Republican National Committee has made legal strategy a cornerstone of its Election Integrity program .\n\nTrump is backed by Republicans on Capitol Hill, including House Speaker Mike Johnson , who has adopted similar language, saying he would accept the results only if the election is free and fair.\n\n\"We're going to have the peaceful transition of power,\" said Johnson, who led one of Trump's 2020 legal challenges, on CBS. \"I believe President Trump's going to win, and this will be taken care of.\"\n\nOne specific line of attack from House Republicans has been to suggest there will be illegal voting by noncitizens, even though it is a crime to do so, and state and federal reviews have found it to be extremely rare . Johnson has pointed to past House races, including one in Iowa in 2020 that was won by six votes, to bolster his concerns.\n\nRep. Joseph Morelle of New York, the top Democrat on the Committee on House Administration, said Johnson is \"saying the quiet part out loud,\" signaling the way Republicans may challenge the outcome.\n\nThat \"troubles me,\" he said.\n\nAt the Brennan Center, they've conducted war-game-like scenarios for what could happen after the election, at a time when state election officials are facing a resurgence in conspiracy theories and misinformation about voting.\n\nA series of deadlines between Election Day on Nov. 5 and Inauguration Day on Jan. 20 are built into the process, once routine steps that are now important milestones that can be met - or missed.\n\nStates are required to certify their electors by Dec. 11 in advance of a meeting of the Electoral College, which is set this year on Dec. 17.\n\nThe new Congress convenes Jan. 3 to elect a House speaker and swear in lawmakers. Then, on Jan. 6, Congress holds a joint session to accept the electoral count from the states - a typically ceremonial session presided over by the vice president.\n\nTo fortify the process in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack, the Electoral Count Reform Act instituted several changes intended to shore up the process and make sure the disputes are resolved by the time the Congress meets. Legal challenges to the results are to be more quickly resolved, under an expedited timeline for judicial review, all the way to the Supreme Court, if necessary. If a county refuses to certify its results, as some did during the 2022 midterm elections, the governor has more authority to certify the state's tally.\n\nOn Jan. 6, the law now requires 20% of the House and Senate to challenge a state's electors to force a vote on rejecting them, rather than a single member threshold from each chamber.\n\n\"You know people have a right, if they have a problem with the election, to go to court and be heard,\" said Rep. Zoe Lofgren , D-Calif. \"The thing is, once that's over, it's over.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(Angelina Katsanis/Pool Photo Photo via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Many Republican senators say they do not agree with President Donald Trump's decision to pardon and commute sentences for more than 1,500 people who assaulted police officers, broke into the building or committed other crimes related to the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol four years ago.\n\nBut they aren't pushing back on the decision.\n\n\"We're not looking backwards, we're looking forward,\" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, repeating his frequent response to questions about Trump's promises of retribution from his first term.\n\nThune did not say whether he supported or opposed the pardons, which rattled many on Capitol Hill who lived through the attack and fled the mob of Trump's supporters as they violently broke into the building and halted the certification of President Joe Biden's victory.\n\nRepublican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said he would have preferred \"a more surgical approach\" to the pardons, looking at them case by case. \"It's not ideal in my mind,\" Cramer said. \"But I do think I understand the spirit of it, and I'm comfortable with it ... hopefully we move forward now.\"\n\nSen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., agreed.\n\n\"It's a hard one, because we work with them up here,\" Tuberville said of the Capitol Police who were beaten by the rioters and guard lawmakers every day. \"At the end of the day, we've got to get Jan. 6 behind us.\"\n\nMoving beyond the attack on the Capitol - and downplaying its violence - have become a central approach for congressional Republicans who have enthusiastically re-embraced Trump after his 2020 defeat and his attempts to overturn Biden's win. And the muted GOP response to his sweeping pardons of both non-violent and violent Jan. 6 rioters was another display of their longtime strategy of praising Trump when they agree and ignoring him when they don't.\n\n\"We're looking forward and beyond on other policy issues,\" said West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a member of Republican leadership.\n\nThe pardons, part of a flurry of executive orders on Trump's first day in office, immediately upended what had become the largest prosecution in Justice Department history and freed criminals who brutally beat police and members of far-right extremist groups determined to stop Biden from assuming office. More than 100 police officers were injured. Some were never able to fully return to work.\n\nMany prominent Republicans, including Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, Vice President JD Vance and Attorney General nominee Pam Bondi, had suggested that Trump would review the cases individually. But, as he had long promised, Trump's actions were much more sweeping.\n\nIn defending Trump's move, Republicans have also been able to point to Biden's own flurry of preemptive pardons, including of his own family and House members who investigated the Jan. 6 attack, as he left office.\n\n\"How come everybody's asking me about January 6th? Aren't you going to ask me about the Biden pardons?\" asked Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa.\n\n\"What we should be focusing on is the Biden pardons,\" Kansas Sen. Roger Marshall said angrily as reporters asked him about the clemency for Jan. 6 rioters.\n\nMany Democrats said they disagreed with Biden's actions, as well. Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal said that he opposed the preemptive pardons, and was frustrated that they gave Trump \"an argument - even though it's a false argument - to pardon the Jan. 6 insurrectionists as well.\"\n\nA few Republicans said they agreed with Trump.\n\nNew Ohio Sen. Bernie Moreno said that he appreciates Capitol Police officers, but \"nobody's been treated worse\" than the rioters. Wyoming Sen. Cynthia Lummis said she is \"so glad those people are out of jail.\"\n\nMore than 200 people convicted of Jan. 6 crimes were released from federal Bureau of Prisons custody by Tuesday morning, officials told The Associated Press.\n\nA few Republican senators said they opposed the pardons, even as they appeared resigned to the idea. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis said he has an \"honest disagreement\" with the president over pardoning violent offenders. South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds said he couldn't defend them.\n\nMaine Sen. Susan Collins said she had received a message from a police officer who sent her a video of his assault. \"I don't disagree with him at all,\" she said. \"People who committed violent crimes on January 6th, 2021, should not be pardoned.\"\n\nThe pardons by both Trump and Biden \"erodes public confidence,\" she said.\n\nAlaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski said she was disappointed in the pardons, and pointed to a police officer who was guarding Republicans as they entered their weekly luncheon.\n\n\"I do fear the message that is sent to these great men and women that stood by us,\" Murkowski said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Stephen Groves, Lisa Mascaro and Ellen Knickmeyer contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - In the first presidential debate , Republican Donald Trump skimmed over the Jan. 6, 2021, attack at the Capitol , shifted blame for the violent mob siege and declined repeatedly to state unequivocally that he will accept the results of this year's White House election .\n\nAnd President Joe Biden , who has said the work of his presidency is to restore the soul of the nation, flubbed and floundered , failing to forcefully confront, contradict and hold Trump, the indicted former president, accountable for the attack on the election - and democracy.\n\nIt is an extraordinary moment, or lack of one, that is alarming to democracy advocates, the far-reaching effort to overturn the 2020 election and the subsequent insurrection that defined the Trump presidency fading from view during the opening debate of the general election campaign.\n\nMississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson, the Democrat who chaired the House's Jan. 6 committee investigation in the last Congress, said it is a deeply unfortunate situation.\n\n\"We could have a Jan. 6, 2.0,\" Thompson said Friday outside the Capitol.\n\nThe outcome underscores the choice Americans face this fall as the riot over the 2020 election remains fundamental to the 2024 campaign, but also obscured by it, despite the four-count federal indictment against Trump for working to overturn the results four years ago in the run-up to the violent siege and despite the convictions of more than 1,000 people in the Capitol attack.\n\nIt comes as the Supreme Court is weighing cases involving Jan. 6, including a decision Friday that makes it easier for some rioters to contest their charges and convictions, and another expected Monday on whether Trump can claim immunity in the federal election case.\n\nAll told, what seemed politically untenable, as the defeated Trump departed Washington downcast on Biden's inauguration day on Jan. 20, 2021, is now within reach as the president who tried to overturn an election is the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, edging toward an Oval Office return.\n\n\"We are four months away from the first presidential election since a violent attack on our Capitol. ... And the man responsible for that - Donald Trump - is currently the leading candidate,\" said Ian Bassin, executive director of the advocacy group Protect Democracy, which works to counter authoritarianism.\n\n\"You'd think that alone would be disqualifying, or at a minimum would be the central focus of the election,\" he said.\n\nAnd yet, Bassin said, the topic was \"relegated to an afterthought\" in the debate, \"and the current president is struggling to press the case on why this issue should be of existential importance.\"\n\nThe forum itself is not necessarily to blame. The moderators pressed the candidates , asking Trump not once, but repeatedly, whether he would commit to not having another Jan. 6 and accepting the results of the election this time.\n\nTrump insisted he had \"virtually nothing to do\" with the storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6 and tried to shift blame to then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., repeating his false claims about the delay in sending in the National Guard.\n\nBiden, whose underwhelming debate performance of stunted answers and trailing thoughts has sent the Democratic Party into turmoil, struggled to deliver a cohesive response, despite having given high-profile speeches about Jan. 6, including on the first anniversary.\n\n\"Look, he encouraged those folks to go up on Capitol Hill,\" Biden said on the debate stage.\n\nThompson, whose committee produced a lengthy, 1,000-plus page report on its investigation into Trump's monthslong attempt to overturn the election and the storming of the Capitol, said Biden missed a \"golden opportunity\" to set the record straight as millions of people watched the debate.\n\nThis combination of photos shows Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump, left, and President Joe Biden during a presidential debate hosted by CNN, Thursday, June 27, 2024, in Atlanta. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert)\n\nIt was left to the people who actually experienced Jan. 6, the lawmakers who fled to safety as the mob of Trump supporters approached, to respond. Rioters, many wielding flag poles and with tactical gear, engaged in brutal, bloody hand-to-hand combat, fighting the U.S. Capitol Police to gain access to the building.\n\n\"January 6 was a dark day,\" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on social media.\n\n\"Trump-inspired insurrectionists sought to obstruct the peaceful transfer of power,\" he said. Schumer decried Friday's \"shameful decision\" from the Supreme Court that he said \"will embolden anti-democracy radicals and make it harder for our judicial system to try insurrectionists.\"\n\nPelosi said Trump presented \"another pack of lies\" during the debate. \"How dare he place the blame for January 6th on anyone but himself, the inciter of an insurrection?\"\n\nOn Friday, the Supreme Court limited a federal obstruction law that has been used to charge Trump, alongside hundreds of Capitol riot defendants. While the ruling is certain to cause a reconsideration of some cases against the rioters, it is unclear how it will impact Trump's indictment, which includes other charges.\n\nTrump, during a rally Friday in Chesapeake, Virginia, said a \"great thing\" just happened in response to the decision in the obstruction case, to the roar of \"USA!\" chants from the crowd.\n\n\"They should be immediately released - immediately,\" Trump said about the defendants he called \"the J6 hostages.\"\n\nA more energized Biden, at his own rally in the swing state of North Carolina, said \"the choice in this election is simple. Donald Trump will destroy our democracy. I will defend it.\"\n\n--\n\nAssociated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Terrifying Story That Shows Jan. 6 Was Not a 'Day of Love'\n\nSpecial Correspondent\n\nIn describing Jan. 6, 2021, as \" a day of love \" at a televised Town Hall on Wednesday, Donald Trump yet again added insult to injury for the 140 police officers who were assaulted at the Capitol that day.\n\n\"I saw friends with blood all over their faces. I was slipping in people's blood,\" Caroline Edwards of the Capitol Police testified in May of 2022 before the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack.\n\nShe went on, \"I was catching people as they fell... it was carnage. It was chaos. I can't even describe what I saw. Never in my wildest dreams did I think that, as a police officer, as a law enforcement officer, I would find myself in the middle of a battle.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEdwards has not been available for comment. But she provided a detailed account during a pre-hearing interview in April of 2022. She reported that she had handled some 300 \"civil disturbance events\" during her three years as a police officer.\n\n\"Usually, 99.9 percent of the time, we're just using verbal judo to calm people down, deescalate, move people along, making sure that nothing happens,\" she told the committee. \"Until January 6th, we had not encountered protesters that would not respond to any deescalation techniques that we used.\"\n\nThe first sign of what the day would bring came via her Apple watch.\n\n\"I remember getting text messages that day from people being like, 'Be careful, please be safe today.' And it sounds naive right now, but I had no idea what they were talking about, because our information comes from the Capitol Police about a certain event. Officers try not to go to outside media sources to gather intelligence on any events. It could create a bias. It could create a reaction that you don't want.\"\n\nShe went on, \"I just remembered being very just confused as to why I was getting so many text messages from people telling me to be careful, and that they were praying for me.\"\n\nShe began to understand as a large crowd gathered in the Peace Circle in front of the Capitol.\n\n\"The general mood was angry, and I've worked enough events where I can... tell they're angry about a situation or they're starting to get angry at me,\" she said. \"We heard, 'animal,' we heard, 'You're Nancy Pelosi's dogs. Bark for us.'\"\n\nShe remembered turning to a supervisor who stood with her and a handful of other officers.\n\n\"I was like, 'Sergeant, I think we're going to need a couple more people down here.' And, you know, that's the understatement of the century.\"\n\nShe added, \"I can protect myself, you know, but somebody coming after Congress is a way bigger deal than somebody coming after me.\"\n\nShe recalled being nervous, \"But I still did not in my wildest imagination believe that they were going to try to beat us up in the way that they did. I figured they would tear down some fencing, intimidate us, possibly start tearing down the inauguration stage. That was the extent of my imagination as to how this was going to go.\"\n\nThere were cries of \"this is our house!\" as the crowd tore down a fence and advanced on a row of bike racks. Edwards hooked her arms through two of the racks and widened her stance in an effort to create a barrier. Men in the crowd raised the rack up over her head and brought it down, striking her in the temple. She still held onto it.\n\n\"They started using the bike rack to kind of push me backwards, and the last thing I remember is going down and my chin hitting the handrail. And then that's where I fell backwards and the back of my head hit concrete.\"\n\nShe had a ringing in her ears as she lost consciousness. When she awoke, she was somehow on her feet. She saw that somebody was attacking a fellow officer.\n\n\"I remember just kind of trying to will my body, like, 'Okay, you need to go over there and help.' But like I was just out.\"\n\nShe figures that adrenaline kicked in and soon enough, she was back in action, joining the other cops in holding the line against the crowd\n\n\"I was just screaming like, 'Get back. Don't take one more step. Get back, get back,' And they were saying stuff like, 'Make us; this is our house.'\"\n\nThe crowd hit the cops with construction debris and flag poles.\n\n\"With blue line flags,\" she noted.\n\nShe remembered \"just thinking like, is this real life? Like are these people serious? American flags, blue line flags as weapons...to harm police officers.\"\n\nShe had an internal dialogue that other cops would later tell her they also had.\n\n\"[The] dialogue going through your head is, 'What happens next? What's their end goal? What are they doing?' And that was the thought throughout the day. We had no clue that their intention was to, you know, destroy their own symbol of democracy.\"\n\nA protester she identified as Ryan Samsel and who would later be convicted of assaulting an officer in the attack, came over and handed her her hat, which must have come off when she was hit in the head.\n\n\"He said, 'I'm the one that picked you up off the ground, remember?' Of course, I don't remember. I was knocked unconscious.\"\n\nShe sensed he was gaslighting her\n\n\"It gave me like domestic abuser vibes,\" she told the committee. \"He was just like very insistent. It was like, 'Don't you remember? I'm the one that picked you up. Don't remember?'\"\n\nAfter two hours of fighting to hold the line on the west side of the Capitol, Edwards and her band moved to the west front. These were different protesters, but the chants were the same, with more, \"Bark for me, Nancy Pelosi's dogs.\"\n\nShe recalled. \"One guy tried to kiss me, which is really gross.\"\n\nShe sensed movement out of the corner of her eye. She turned and saw Police Officer Brian Sicknick , who would die from the cumulative effects of the attack.\n\n\"I could tell he had been sprayed with something, and his face was like white,\" she remembered. \"It was pale.\"\n\nBy her experience, the usual reaction to chemical agents was for the face to turn beetroot red.\n\n\"So I can remember alarm bells going off. I was like 'What's wrong with Sicknick?' Because if you looked around, everybody was red faced, but he was pale.\"\n\nShe looked over to see who had sprayed Sicknick.\n\n\"That's when I got a direct hit in the eyes with chemical spray. And it turns out it was the same chemical spray that he got hit with.\"\n\nThe effect was considerably more intense than the pepper spray cops are exposed to in training, which in her words \"is no joke\" and \"feels like someone just punched two holes in your eye sockets.\" She said the effect of the spray was \"pain unimaginable.\"\n\n\"I couldn't ever open my eyes. So I was stumbling around a little bit.\"\n\nA fellow officer helped her around to the middle of the west font, and began to rinse her eyes with water as a line of other cops held back more protesters.\n\nOne of them was her husband. He saw her and rushed over. He began to take her toward an entrance to the Capitol .\n\n\"That's when I got hit with tear gas. The combination of the chemicals made my throat immediately close. I couldn't take a breath at all. That was one of a few times that day where I was like, 'Yeah, this is probably like where I'm not going to make it.\"\n\nBut a Hazardous Devices Section officer happened to be there, equipped with oxygen.\n\n\"They took off my vest and my gun belt and started giving me oxygen and I came back,\" she remembered.\n\nHer husband took her to headquarters.\n\n\"But a shots fired call came out over the radio. So we ran back towards the Capitol.\"\n\nThe emergency passed as they responded. Edwards' husband helped another cop lock the Senate subway doors while she assisted staffers in evacuating. There were was a report of a breach and she hurried over to see an apparent intruder who was now complaining he had been pepper sprayed and he might be having a heart attack. She had him checked out by D.C. Fire which said he was fine.\n\n\"I put him in handcuffs and told him he was under arrest and took him to prisoner processing. I started to notice that I was out of it. I've been in prisoner processing I can't even tell you how many times, but I started asking like where are the computers? And I sat down to put my username and password in, and that's when I just slumped over, and I woke up in a cold sweat.\"\n\nShe was transported by ambulance to a nearby hospital. She was diagnosed with traumatic brain injury. She had severe balance issues as well as vertigo, that kept her \"off the line\" from the department.\n\n\"It's tough,\" she said. \"You know, that was your identity, that was your whole being, now you're no longer part of that team, that's no longer your identity. You go through this intense identity crisis of 'who am I without the uniform?' That's been a struggle.\"\n\nBut with grit and a lot of physical therapy, she was cleared by the doctors to return to full duty a year and four months after the Jan. 6 attack.\n\nIn the intervening months, she has been a member of a peer support group for officers who were injured physically and physiologically in the attack.\n\n\"Maybe they shouldn't let somebody so broken be a part of it,\" she said in the congressional interview \"But, it's great to now be able to take all of that and be able to do something good with it.\"\n\nOne of the committee members told her during the interview that they had several witnesses who said January 6th was not violent. Edwards replied that it was a denial of what she and her fellow officers and their families had been through.\n\n\"It's an insult,\" she said.\n\nAt another point, a committee member asked how she would be different when she went back to full duty.\n\n\" I would like to say that my trust level has not been affected,\" she replied. \"But, you know, my trust of people is definitely affected. We used to be a police department that welcomed wholeheartedly 1st Amendment demonstrations, and now every time one comes up, it's always in the back of your mind-is somebody going to try something?\"\n\nShe went on, \"it's made for some sadder but wiser officers, you want officers to be able to trust Americans to come up here and let their voice be heard without that manner of distrust, but it's an impossible ask at this time.\"\n\nShe said she will remind herself that one of the 300 protests she worked was violent.\n\n\"So, you know, I'll be cautious. But at the same time, I know that the majority of Americans are just here to make their voice heard, and I'm going to keep allowing them to do that with the same grace that I allowed it before, just maybe a little bit less trust.\"\n\nShe is sure to stick to that even if the next president inaugurated has called Jan. 6 \"a day of love.\" She is also sure to defend the Capitol if he loses and some of his followers refuse to go along with a peaceful transfer of power.\n\nAnd, the Daily Beast had learned, she had been promoted. She will be doing so as Sergeant Caroline Edwards.\n\nSpecial Correspondent\n\nmichael.daly@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

Rioter to Receive 'Medal of Freedom'\n\nFreelance Reporter\n\nA Christian TV host has called on President Donald Trump to handsomely reward a January 6th rioter who brutally attacked cops outside the U.S. Capitol building.\n\nChristian radio host, Rick Green, urged the president to award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Ronald Colton McAbee, a former sheriff's deputy in Tennessee who was wearing brass knuckles when he punched a cop administering aid to a colleague on January 6, 2021.\n\n\"I think Colton's case is one of the worst travesties of injustice that's ever happened in our nation,\" Green, who is a former Texan representative, said to McAbee, who appeared as a guest on the Flashpoint program.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"But certainly, out of the J6 cases, a lot of travesties of injustice happened that day. But for him, it's just off the charts.\"\n\nMcAbee, who pleaded guilty and was sentenced to nearly six years in prison, became one of the around 1,500 Capitol rioters to be pardoned by President Donald Trump on Monday.\n\nSpeaking to McAbee, Green went on to demand that Trump offer the \"patriot\" the highest of honors.\n\n\"Colton, you're a patriot. You're a hero, and I think you deserve the Medal of Freedom. I think Donald Trump should bring you to the White House and put it on your neck himself and show to the American people who you are, and as tough as you are and as amazing as you are,\" he said.\n\nSeated next to McAbee was his wife Sarah, who has blamed the FBI for creating havoc on January 6th - not thousands of Trump supporters storming the Capitol and putting dozens of congresspeople at serious risk.\n\nGreen praised the \"J6 advocate\" for her defense of her husband over the last four years.\n\n\"Sarah has been amazing over the last four years the way that she's gone out all over the country, championing not only Colton, but so many other people that received the injustice from the Department of Justice,\" he continued. \"I'm proud of both of you. I'm so glad to see you reunited outside the walls and and I hope that you're you know, basically, your voices are amplified across our country to prevent this from ever, ever happening again.\"\n\nSeveral Republicans, including close allies of Trump, have blasted the president for his sweeping pardons.\n\nRepublican Sen.

      "text": "Trump Frees Thugs Who Beat Cops With Weapons on Jan. 6\n\nFreelance Reporter\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order pardoning about 1,500 people for convictions related to the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot on Monday night, one of his first acts as president.\n\nTrump only briefly addressed the order while signing a mountain of other executive orders on the Resolute Desk. An aide told the president that the order applied to \"approximately 1,500\" people at the riot. \"We have about six commutations in there, where we're doing further research,\" Trump added.\n\n\"We hope they come out tonight, frankly,\" the president said as he signed the order. \"They're expecting it.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn the fourth anniversary of the attacks earlier this month, the Justice Department said that approximately 1,583 individuals were charged with crimes related to the riots that took place as Congress certified the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThat staggering figure included 608 charged with \"assaulting, resisting, or impeding law enforcement agents,\" as well as another 174 that were charged with using a deadly weapon to injure a police officer.\n\nThese include a 71-year-old man from Pennsylvania who was given 46 months in prison for beating a police officer with a metal flag pole, as well as Christopher Worrell, a member of the Proud Boys, who was handed a 10-year prison sentence after emptying an entire can of pepper spray onto police officers defending the building.\n\nShane Jenkins, a Capitol rioter from Texas, was sentenced to seven years in prison after trying to using a tomahawk to break through windows, then joining a \"concerted assault\" on police officers defending a tunnel entrance to the building, according to the Justice Department .\n\nAnother Texas man, Andrew Taake, pleaded guilty for attacking Metropolitan Police Department officers with a metal whip and bear spray after he was caught bragging about it on the dating app Bumble.\n\nOthers faced sentences for trespassing, obstruction, and entering the building-even if they did not clash with law enforcement. Alan Hostetter, a former California police chief-turned-yoga instructor, was sentenced to over 11 years in prison for entering the Capitol with a deadly weapon and obstructing an official proceeding.\n\nOther rioters were given smaller sentences for less violent crimes. Jay Johnston, a comedic actor known for his former role voicing a character on Bob's Burgers, pleaded guilty to charges of obstructing law enforcement officers and was sentenced to a year in prison .\n\nA statement later released by the White House clarified that the president's order commuted the sentences of 14 individuals-including Stewart Rhodes, the leader of the Oath Keepers militia, who was sentenced to 18 years in prison on charges of seditious conspiracy.\n\nThe other individuals were granted a \"complete and unconditional pardon.\"\n\nThe list of pardons also includes the former leader of the Proud Boys, who was previously sentenced to 22 years in prison on charges of seditious conspiracy and obstruction of Congress for his role in planning the attack.\n\nEnrique Tarrio, the alt-right organization's former national chairman, is one of the thousands of people expected to be freed after Trump's sweeping order.\n\nAn attorney for Tarrio told NBC News he was being processed out of FCI Pollock in Louisiana, but exact details of what kind of clemency he was going to receive were unclear. Tarrio's representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Daily Beast.\n\nF ederal prosecutors said the Proud Boys played a \"central role in setting the January 6th attack on our Capitol into motion.\" Tarrio was eventually convicted alongside three other Proud Boys members on charges of seditious conspiracy.\n\nTarrio was sentenced to 22 years in prison , followed by 36 months of supervised release, in September 2023.\n\n\"He's very excited,\" his mother, Duarte Tarrio, previously told Local 10 News in Florida. \"It's surreal to him. He's ready to go.\"\n\nBut not everyone was ecstatic about Trump's broad pardons for some of his most loyal followers. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), who was overseeing the certification of former President Joe Biden's election in 2020, called the executive order an \"outrageous insult to our justice system and the heroes who suffered physical scars and emotional trauma as they protected the Capitol.\"\n\nFreelance Reporter\n\nGot a tip?

They were released minutes ago from the DC Jail. A HISTORIC DAY IN AMERICA! 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/7INfhxLqGr\n\nThey were part of a violent mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and tried to overthrow former President Joe Biden 's 2020 election victory, leaving a police officer and four rioters dead. Four other police officers died by suicide in the months that followed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe boys are free from FCI Oakdale, La Ronald Mele Alan Hostetter Jason Farris Welcome home patriot HERO's ❤️🤍💙 pic.twitter.com/K7pQF21zVc\n\nThe pardons left officers who risked their lives defending the capital feeling \"betrayed,\" they said. At one point during the attack, Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone found himself lying stunned and injured on the ground of the U.S. Capitol building.\n\nHe'd been Tasered several times in the back of the neck, and as the mob stripped him of his ammunition, his police radio and his badge, someone tried to rip away his gun. That's when he heard someone say, \"Kill him with his own gun.\"\n\nOn Monday, Fanone, now 44, reacted to the news that one of Donald Trump's first presidential acts had been to pardon more than 1,500 rioters who stormed the Capitol and tried to overthrow former President Joe Biden 's 2020 election victory.\n\n\"I have been betrayed by my country, and I have been betrayed by those who supported Donald Trump,\" Fanone told CNN's Anderson Cooper . \"The only thing going through my mind is that this is what the American people voted for.\"\n\n\"I have been betrayed by my country\": Former DC police officer Michael Fanone talks to Anderson after President Trump pardons more than 1,000 convicted of committing crimes during the January 6 attack on the Capitol. pic.twitter.com/fhN3dhqbPz\n\nThroughout his presidential campaign, Trump had promised to pardon the violent criminals responsible for the Jan. 6 riots, which left a police officer and four rioters dead. Four other police officers died by suicide in the months that followed.\n\nThe would-be insurrectionists were arrested for pepper spraying and beating police officers with flagpoles, stomping on their heads, throwing a bomb into a tunnel full of police, hurling officers down a flight of stairs and plotting to kill FBI agents investigating the attacks. The judge in the case concluded the riot was an act of terrorism, and leaders of the Proud Boys militia received prison sentences of up to 22 years.\n\nInstead of condoning the violence, Trump-who also claimed to love police officers-called the rioters \"hostages\" and \"patriots,\" and even opened campaign rallies with a recording of a performance by the \"J6 Prison Choir.\"\n\n\"Whether you supported [Trump] because he promised these pardons or for some other reason, you knew that this was coming, and here we are,\" Fanone told Cooper.\n\nHe said he'd been receiving death threats ever since he testified before Congress in July 2021 about the horrors he'd experienced on Jan. 6. As members of the mob threatened to kill him, the 20-year law enforcement veteran went into \"survival mode\" and tried to appeal to their humanity by telling them about his kids. Apparently, it worked, and some of the rioters protected him until help arrived.\n\nHe was so badly injured, though, he could only return to limited duty in September 2021. A few months later, he retired completely.\n\n\"Right now, I think the Republican Party owns a monopoly on hypocrisy when it comes to their supposed support of law enforcement because tonight the leader of the Republican party pardoned hundreds of violent cop assaulters,\" he told Cooper.\n\nDaniel Hodges, another Capitol police officer who testified before Congress who still serves on the force, also responded to news of the pardons with disgust.\n\n\"Just worked about 14 hours making sure Trump's inauguration was secure and peaceful, got home, read this. Thanks America,\" he wrote on the social media platform X.\n\nJust worked about 14 hours making sure Trump's inauguration was secure and peaceful, got home, read this.  Thanks America. https://t.co/30RMeKzkIa\n\nVideo of Hodges being beaten and crushed in a door, his mouth full of blood while he cried out for help, went viral after the attacks.\n\n\"I don't think a day has gone by where I haven't thought about it,\" he told WUSA in the lead-up to Monday's inauguration.\n\nFour men who were convicted of assaulting him were presumably on Trump's list of pardons. But Hodges said he wasn't worried about his safety.\n\n\"I'm a cop in D.C. It's not the first time I've been threatened, it's not going to be the last. If they want to come after me, that's their choice. I'm ready,\" he said before the inauguration. \"I would encourage them to rethink their ways, particularly if people are pardoned.\"\n\nFalcone, however, said he's been concerned about his and his family's safety ever since he testified. In recent months his 76-year-old mother's house has been swatted, meaning someone made a fake emergency call to get police to swarm the premises.\n\n\"She's had human feces thrown on her while she was raking leaves in her front yard,\" he said. \"This is who we are as a nation. This is what we have become, and it has been further exacerbated by Donald Trump.\"\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "The Capitol Police Weren't Ready on Jan. 6, and They Aren't Ready Now\n\nSitting on my bed on the evening of Jan. 3, 2021, days before the infamous insurrection on our nation's Capitol , I wrote in my intelligence assessment the words that would come to haunt me and this country in the years that followed: \"Congress itself is the target on the 6th.\" This, combined with the nearly 70 pieces of raw intelligence I sent up my chain of command warning of violence, was largely ignored.\n\nAt the time I was the Assistant Director of Intelligence and Interagency Coordination at the United States Capitol Police. I was providing relevant, necessary information to the leadership.  But it didn't result in action.\n\nIf I had been a man writing those prescient words, would they have listened?  Would the outcome of January 6th have been different?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPerhaps. And it's infuriating that, in 2023, I must even consider that. But what really makes my blood boil-what really keeps me up at night-is whether we've learned enough from what happened in 2021 to keep the Capitol safe in 2024 and, more importantly, whether we're willing to confront a larger issue: the danger that our senators and congresspeople are in on a daily basis.\n\nAs election season approaches, in what very well could be a rematch between Biden and Trump, the Capitol Police will be ready for the next certification of the electoral votes. Surely, they will have anti-scale fences, the National Guard, and other law enforcement partners on hand to protect against the threats they know.\n\nWhen-not if-there is another attack from an unknown threat though, will they be ready for that?\n\nAll signs point to no.\n\nThe next crisis will likely be the result of hostility toward a member of Congress. Often fueled by extremist ideology, just as January 6th was, violence against elected officials is the most immediate danger facing the legislative branch today. The volume of threats )\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.uscp.gov/media-center/press-releases/uscp-threat-assessment-cases-2022__;!!LsXw!RchffyxQNfbghDwydrXY482QOcdQGYKi1g4yzuDpeFQNn96tK-2o6PqMngWNesiu9siJtdtAqjWRCvJbra2zwetSd9dNHar5$\">volume of threats members of Congress have received has grown to astronomical numbers, much more than the small team of investigators at the Capitol Police can handle.\n\nThe things I saw firsthand as the Assistant Director of Intelligence at the Capitol Police that allowed them to fail on Jan. 6-poor communication, disjointed leadership, organizational silos, unclear or nonexistent guidance, and a lack of accountability-are cultural issues that still have not been adequately addressed. This will inevitably result in failure. Again.\n\nOfficers and agents alike are overworked, and with the overwhelming volume, the threats cannot be given the dedicated attention they need. With the high attrition rate and the difficulties police departments across the country are having in recruiting new officers to fill their ranks, the Capitol Police are not well-positioned to detect, prevent, or respond to the next threat.\n\nThis was evident in November 2022 when Paul Pelosi, husband of then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, was attacked inside his home. Although his house had security, the Capitol Police who were responsible for monitoring those security cameras )\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.politico.com/news/2022/11/04/fresh-finger-pointing-over-capitol-polices-future-after-pelosi-home-invasion-00065064__;!!LsXw!RchffyxQNfbghDwydrXY482QOcdQGYKi1g4yzuDpeFQNn96tK-2o6PqMngWNesiu9siJtdtAqjWRCvJbra2zwetSd6ZQ0bNl$\">monitoring those security cameras failed to do so. Only 10 members of Congress receive regular protective details; the remaining 525 members are left on their own to find security.\n\nThe Capitol Police need a complete overhaul. The safety of Congress and our democracy requires it.  Specifically, Congress should consider:\n\n1. Moving the Capitol Police to be a protective workforce. Congress must separate protection of people from protection of buildings. The mission of the Capitol Police should be narrowed to focus exclusively on providing protection to members of Congress. The Capitol Police have demonstrated they are not capable of protecting the Capitol building against a large mob.  The only reason groups have not been successful at breaking into the Capitol before is because none have ever tried. By streamlining the Capitol Police's mission, they'll have a greater opportunity for success and, if done right, it will provide enhanced safety for our elected officials.\n\n2. Transferring the responsibility of securing congressional buildings to the Sergeant-at-Arms offices or another federal entity. The responsibility of protecting the congressional buildings should fall to the Sergeant-at-Arms offices or another capable federal agency like the U.S. Marshals, who are also responsible for protecting federal courthouses.\n\n3. Giving jurisdiction of investigations of threats to the FBI. The Capitol Police do not have the staff or expertise to handle the threat workload or develop cases that are more favorable to prosecution. The FBI has offices throughout the United States and beyond and is better able to absorb this massive workload. Even with the Capitol Police's two field offices and a handful of others contemplated in the future, they do not have the footprint, nor the staffing, to adequately handle the volume of threat cases in the field.\n\n4. Requiring the Capitol Police to be subject to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Though there are committees charged with oversight of the Capitol Police, with a Congress so divided oversight is often manipulated for political gain. Therefore, oversight should shift to the American people by permitting records to be requested under FOIA. While members of Congress may be concerned about sensitive information about them specifically being leaked, the law already provides exemptions and exclusions from release. Subjecting the Capitol Police to FOIA would provide a greater level of transparency and accountability.\n\nWhile there are many paths to ensure accountability and meaningful reform, one thing is certain: The Capitol Police cannot allow themselves to fail again.\n\nJulie Farnam served as the Assistant Director of Intelligence and Interagency Coordination at the United States Capitol Police from October 2020 to June 2023.

      "text": "Joe Rogan Says It's a 'Fact' That Jan. 6 Was a False Flag, Cites Ray Epps\n\nSenior Media Reporter\n\nWildly popular podcaster Joe Rogan once again pushed the baseless conspiracy theory that the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection was a false flag orchestrated by the federal government, adding that pro-Trump rioter Ray Epps \"clearly instigated\" the attack.\n\nEarlier this month, Epps sued Fox News for defaming him with the \"fantastical story\" that he was an undercover federal agent who incited the violence at the Capitol in an effort to take down former President Donald Trump and his supporters.\n\nRogan, who signed a $200 million contract with Spotify in 2020, has repeatedly embraced the unsubstantiated claim that federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies used \"agent provocateurs\" such as Epps to manipulate the crowd to attack the Capitol. In past episodes, Rogan said the intelligence community had a \"vested interest in this going sideways,\" adding that \"if somebody wanted to disparage a political party or to maybe have some sort of a justification for getting some influential person like Donald Trump offline, that would be the way they would do it.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile hosting comedian Jim Gaffigan on his July 28 broadcast, the conspiracy-peddling podcaster once again peddled the notion that the FBI and CIA had helped engineer the chaos on that fateful day, noting that the agencies have a history of disrupting \"peaceful protests\" in order to unsympathetically portray demonstrators as violent.\n\n\"The Jan. 6 thing is bad, but also, the intelligence agencies were involved in provoking people into the Capitol Building. That's a fact,\" Rogan proclaimed before invoking Epps' supposed involvement in pushing rioters to attack the Capitol.\n\nWhile calling it a \"fact\" that the federal government utilized \"agent provocateurs\" on Jan. 6 while citing Epps, he also asserted that he still doesn't know if Epps was actually working with the FBI. Instead, he was merely asking questions and noting other people seemed to believe that Epps was an undercover agent.\n\nJoe Rogan Blows Jim Gaffigan's Mind That Intelligence Agencies May Have Infiltrated Jan 6th \"Trump was very open about his disdain for the intelligence agencies...Throughout history people of unchecked power and unchecked influence have enemies, and Trump was their enemy.\" pic.twitter.com/7MxC5B49ND\n\n\"I don't know, but I do know that every other, I think that every other person who was involved in Jan. 6, who was involved in coordinating a break-in into the Capitol and then instigating people, they were all arrested,\" he insisted. \"This guy wasn't. Not only that, but they were defending him in The New York Times , The Washington Post , all these different things saying Fox News has unjustly accused him of instigating when he clearly instigated, he did it on camera. I don't know if he was a fed. I know a lot of people think he was a fed.\"\n\nAccording to Rogan, the reason why the intelligence community was so determined to frame Trump during the Jan. 6 riots-a protest to stop the 2020 presidential election from being certified-was due to the ex-president's hatred of the so-called \"deep state.\"\n\n\"Trump was very open about his disdain for the intelligence agencies,\" Rogan said. \"Throughout history, people of unchecked power and unchecked influence have enemies, and Trump was their enemy.\"\n\nHe added that the intelligence agencies were \"going to get him any way that they could,\" claiming that Jan. 6 offered them the opportunity to portray him as \"responsible for this insurrection attempt.\"\n\nIn the months after the insurrection, Epps-a former Trump acolyte who believed the 2020 election was \"stolen\" from the ex-president-soon found himself the focus of a fictitious narrative relentlessly spun by ex-Fox News star Tucker Carlson night after night.\n\n\"Just as Fox had focused on voting machine companies when falsely claiming a rigged election, Fox knew it needed a scapegoat for January 6th,\" Epps' complaint against Fox News says. \"It settled on Ray Epps and began promoting the lie that Epps was a federal agent who incited the attack on the Capitol.\"\n\nEventually, Carlson's repeated and unfounded claims that Epps had incited rioters to storm the Capitol made their way to Congress, prompting Republican lawmakers to link Epps with the planning of the attack. Epps, according to his lawsuit against Fox, began receiving countless death threats and had to move to a remote trailer park for safety.\n\nIronically, in Epps' complaint, he says that he had been a devoted Fox News viewer. The network's amplification of false claims that voting machines rigged the election against Trump helped convince him to go to Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, 2021. The network settled a defamation lawsuit with Dominion Voting Systems for $787.5 million this spring.\n\nEpps also says that since conservatives have accused him of being a federal agent, the Justice Department informed him in May that it will file criminal charges against him for his role in the riots. His lawsuit notes that the notion that he was protected from prosecution because of his supposed role as an inside provocateur was undermined by the pending charges.\n\nA lawyer for Epps and a rep for Spotify did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSenior Media Reporter\n\nGot a tip?

Pelosi (D-CA). Instead, he wrongly claimed that he made only \"very beautiful, very heartwarming statements\" on the day of the attack, suggesting he wasn't the person who incited the violence.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"I heard, and I watched, and the one thing I'll say is they kept saying about what I said right after the insurrection, which I think was an insurrection caused by Nancy Pelosi,\" he said. \"I said peacefully and patriotically... Take a look at the statements I made before and after, and you'll see a whole different dialogue.\"\n\nPresident Trump on January 6th: \"If you take a look at my words right after, you take a look at my speech from the Rose Garden which was very shortly after...I said 'peacefully and patriotically' pic.twitter.com/0PeEE0gXYk\n\nAaron Bennett, a spokesperson for Pelosi, called out just how bizarre the claim was in a statement to The Daily Beast.\n\n\"No matter what unhinged lies Trump spews about the insurrection he instigated, as numerous independent fact-checkers have confirmed, Speaker Pelosi did not plan her own assassination,\" he said.\n\nTrump faces federal charges in an election subversion trial, which partially stem from him not acting to stop the violence during the initial stages of the riot. While the Capitol was being overrun, and minutes after Vice President Mike Pence was evacuated, Trump tweeted that day, \"Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify. USA demands the truth!\"\n\nIn typical fashion on Thursday, the former president's bizarre statement about the California congresswoman was just the beginning of a rambling press conference that spanned from him claiming he was leading in each election poll to alleging, with zero evidence, that Joe Biden is committing \"election interference.\"\n\nTrump referred to the Capitol attack as an insurrection multiple times in his spiel, contradicting his earlier comments that insisted what happened on Jan. 6, 2021, wasn't an insurrection.\n\nHe blurred the lines on whether he believes what happened was an insurrection or not in the closing of his rant, after answering a question from a reporter.\n\n\"I think it was an insurrection caused by Nancy Pelosi,\" he repeated. \"This was an insurrection, if it was an insurrection, which, there were no guns, there were no anything, except for the fact that they shot Ashli Babbitt. Somebody from, at least four, shot Ashli Babbitt. So unnecessary, so sad, so horrible. But there were no guns. There were no anything.\"\n\nBabbitt was the lone rioter to be shot and killed by police during the riot, with a Capitol officer opening fire on her as she attempted to break into the building through a shattered window.\n\nThose arrested for participating on Jan. 6 have admitted to carrying guns into the Capitol, though none have been charged with opening fire.\n\nBreaking News Reporter\n\nJosh.Fiallo@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

Why are we trying to help a guy like Milley?\" Trump said Monday at the Capitol.\n\nBut Liz Cheney's pardon seemed even more infuriating to the new president, who is returning to the White House after a four-year hiatus following his 2020 loss to Biden.\n\n\"Why are we helping Liz Cheney?\" he asked. \"I mean, Liz Cheney is a disaster. She's a crying lunatic and crying, crying.\"\n\nAnd he called Jan. 6 member Adam Kinzinger, the former GOP congressman who joined Cheney in taking on their own party's president, a \"super crime.\"\n\nShortly before his peaceful transfer of power to Trump, Biden said, \"These public servants have served our nation with honor and distinction and do not deserve to be the targets of unjustified and politically motivated prosecutions.\"\n\nBut Republicans say the pardons signal an admission of guilt and that the investigation was corrupt.\n\n\"Proves they know she's guilty,\" Sen. Jim Banks (R-IN) told the Daily Beast, referring to Cheney, who was among a rash of officials who received a pardon from Biden on his way out of office Monday morning.\n\nThe preemptive pardons look to shield Trump's foes from potential future prosecution, and can't be undone by the new administration. But Trump allies have repeatedly taken aim at the investigation led by Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-MS) and Cheney.\n\n\"Joe Biden's last-minute pardons of the January 6th sham committee members will forever seal the negative legacy of the Biden administration which will be will be one of corruption, pay to play schemes, and the overall total sellout of our 'American principles,'\" Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC) told the Daily Beast.\n\nRep. Barry Loudermilk (R-GA), who led the GOP counter-probe into the Jan. 6 committee, called the Monday morning pardons a \"direct result of our investigation.\"\n\nAnd Rep. Eli Crane (R-AZ) agreed, drawing attention to what he called the \"unlawful, deceitful and corrupt\" behavior by those pardoned.\n\nSoon after Biden issued the pardons, Trump texted NBC's Kristen Welker: \"It is disgraceful. Many are guilty of MAJOR CRIMES! DJT.\"\n\nThe committee members shot back at Republicans' accusations, claiming they've faced \"harassment, lies and threats of criminal violence\" in addition to threats of imprisonment for \"simply for doing our jobs.\"\n\n\"We have been pardoned today not for breaking the law but for upholding it,\" they said in a joint statement, arguing the pardons were necessary to provide protection against \"false prosecution\" for their work exposing what they termed \"a months-long criminal effort to override the will of the voters.\"\n\nIn addition to pardoning Milley and members and staff of the Jan. 6 select committee, Biden also issued pardons for Dr. Anthony Fauci, who led the nation's response on the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSenior Political Correspondent\n\nWashington Bureau Chief\n\nmaryann.akers@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Fiddling, Fumbling, Fuming: Trump's Jan. 6 Timeline Revealed\n\nPolitical Investigations Reporter\n\nAfter giving his fiery speech to armed supporters at a park and telling them to march on Congress to keep him in power on Jan. 6, 2021, former President Donald Trump returned to the White House, sat in his private dining room, and watched Fox News for hours-repeatedly refusing to intervene.\n\nInstead, Trump continued to push forward his plan to use lawsuits and legislative delays to buy time in an obsessive attempt to overturn the 2020 election, calling his lawyer and pressuring senators to remain loyal to him.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee kicked off its long-awaited, prime-time hearing Thursday by laying out how Trump fully intended to lead a mob to the Capitol, how he angrily confronted U.S. Secret Service agents who stood in his way, and how he refused to do anything to stop the siege on the Capitol for more than three hours.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"For 187 minutes on January 6th, this man of unbridled destructive energy could not be moved-not by his aides, not by his allies... or the desperate pleas of those facing down the rioters,\" Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-MS) said. \"He ignored and disregarded the desperate pleas of his own family, including Ivanka and Don Jr., even though he was the only person in the world who could call off the mob. He could not be moved to rise from the dining room table... and carry his message to the violent mob.\"\n\nThe committee played audio recording of General Mark A. Milley, the top military official as the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, who said, \"You've got an assault on the Capitol of the United States of America... and there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero?\"\n\nPiecing together a timeline of events that the world has never seen before, the committee presented a detailed account of the former president's every move that afternoon.\n\nAt 1:10 p.m., Trump ended his speech at the Ellipse, a park just south of the White House. When Secret Service agents refused to drive him to the Capitol building-ending his plan to lead the MAGA-loyal insurrectionists-he arrived at the presidential mansion minutes later. He kept the motorcade on standby, according to videotaped testimony of a District of Columbia Metropolitan Police sergeant familiar with the events that day from interactions with the cops on that detail.\n\nBy 1:24 p.m., Trump was comfortably in the White House dining room just next door to the Oval Office. The committee revealed that Trump simply sat at the head of a wooden table at the White House dining room watching Fox News. White House records showed no phone calls, no activity, and an official White House photographer was explicitly told to take no photos.\n\nInstead, congressional investigators were forced to rely on witnesses and phone records obtained through subpoenas to peek into the window of time between 1:25 p.m., when Trump entered the dining room, until he came out at roughly 4 p.m.\n\nMeanwhile, the committee also revealed new details about then-Vice President Mike Pence's timeline on Jan. 6. After Pence evacuated the Senate chamber shortly after 2 p.m., he and his Secret Service detail stood by in his office near the floor for 13 chaotic minutes.\n\nAs Pence and Secret Service agents held in the office, rioters began encircling the Senate chamber. Secret Service agents were so disturbed by the situation that, according to an anonymous national security official who was monitoring the radio traffic, agents began saying goodbyes to family members.\n\n\"I don't like talking about it,\" the anonymous official, whose voice was obscured to protect their identity, told the Jan. 6 committee in a taped deposition.\n\nDuring the time that senators were fleeing the chamber, instead of directing the military on how to intervene, Trump was placing phone calls to senators encouraging them to delay the certification of the 2020 election, according to Rep. Elaine Luria (D-VA). The committee played a snippet of video testimony from Kayleigh McEnany, then the Trump White House press secretary, who remembered leaving the president with a list of senators he wanted to reach.\n\n\"He wanted a list of senators and I left him at that point,\" McEnany previously told the committee.\n\nIn a deposition transcript, Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann recalled telling fellow attorney Pat Cipollone that \"the president didn't want anything done.\"\n\nPiecing together the clues, the committee determined that Trump, who was watching the insurrection violence unfold on Fox News, his attention was squarely on his plan to overturn the 2020 election through legal maneuvers. Trump called Rudy Giuliani, the lawyer leading that effort, at 1:39 p.m. and had a call that lasted four minutes, according to Giuliani's phone records that were obtained by the committee.\n\nTrump and Giuliani had another phone chat half an hour later. Two minutes after the call ended at 2:13 p.m., enraged rioters who had beaten police officers and gassed them with caustic chemicals made their way to the Capitol building's doors and broke windows to get inside. Trump continued to watch the violence unfold on TV.\n\nThe committee asked Sarah Matthews, a former Trump official who is intimately familiar with the White House's public communications capabilities, how long it would have taken Trump to make a national address to stop the rioters.\n\n\"It would take less than 60 seconds from the dining room to the briefing room,\" she testified. \"There is a camera that is on in there at all times. If the president had wanted to make a statement and address the American people, he could have been there almost instantly.\"\n\nAfter Trump had discussions with his daughter Ivanka, he was finally convinced to put out a tweet that would serve as a perfunctory attempt to intervene. The tweet sent out at 2:38 p.m. said, \"Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful!\"\n\nBut Matthews testified that Press Secretary McEnany told her the president had initially resisted using the word \"peaceful.\" At that very moment, Fox News was reporting that members of Congress had been instructed to put on emergency hoods stashed throughout the Capitol to hide their identities.\n\nAt 3:58 p.m., the president continued to watch Fox News as the cable network reported that the FBI and D.C. National Guard had been deployed to the Capitol building.\n\nWhen White House staff finally convinced him to put out a video directing the insurrectionists to halt their attack, Trump refused to read a script asking rioters to leave the Capitol immediately and go home \"in a peaceful way.\"\n\nInstead, he went off-the-cuff and delivered the infamous speech that ended with him telling the enraged, seething attackers, \"Go home. We love you, you're very special.\"\n\nHerschmann, the White House lawyer, told committee investigators that, at that point, they called it a day, because \"people were emotionally drained by the time that videotape was done.\"\n\nMeanwhile, rioters were still besieging the Capitol and roaming the congressional halls.\n\nAs Trump officially ended his day and left the Oval Office, a White House employee told congressional investigators that Trump muttered, \"Mike Pence let me down.\"\n\nBut later that evening, Giuliani was still trying to convince senators to delay counting the electoral college results, according to records obtained by the committee.\n\nAt 7:02 p.m., Giuliani called Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) and left him a voicemail pressuring him to prolong the certification.\n\n\"Senator Tuberville... this is Rudy Giuliani,\" he began. \"We need you, our Republican friends, to try to just slow it down so we can get these legislatures to get more information to you.\"\n\nThe following day, as Republicans across the country lambasted Trump's role in inciting the insurrection and the nation reeled from the attempted coup, the president remained defiant about what happened. As he prepared to make a national address on camera, never-before-seen video outtakes acquired by the committee showed how Trump still refused to acknowledge that the fight to stay in power was over.\n\n\"This election is now over. Congress has certified,\" Trump read from a script, then stopping to speak to his daughter Ivanka behind the camera. \"I don't want to say the election is over. I just want to say congress has certified the results. I don't want to say the election is over, OK?\"\n\nThe committee received live testimony from two former Trump administration officials who quit in protest in the immediate aftermath of the violence on that day: deputy national security adviser Matthew Pottinger and deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews.\n\nBoth have serious credentials and commanded respect in Trump World-while they were there.\n\nPottinger, a Reuters journalist who became a U.S. Marine , was brought into the Trump administration because of his national security expertise on Asia. Matthews used her comms role at the White House to aggressively defend Trump, rising to his defense when his niece, Mary Trump, wrote a tell-all book that she called a money grab .\n\nAfter witnessing the MAGA-loyal crowd attack the Capitol building, Matthews put out a statement saying, \"As someone who worked in the halls of Congress I was deeply disturbed by what I saw today.\"\n\nOn the attack's one-year anniversary, she tweeted , \"Make no mistake, the events on the 6th were a coup attempt, a term we'd use had they happened in any other country, and former President Trump failed to meet the moment.\"\n\nAt the start of the hearing, Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) began laying the groundwork to show how the twice-impeached former president didn't rise to the challenge of that day-a day of violence he created and exacerbated.\n\n\"He refused to defend our nation and our constitution. He refused to do what every American president must. In the days after January 6th, no one from either political party would defend his conduct. And no one should do so today,\" she said.\n\nPerhaps for the many Republicans who have shrugged off the impact of the violent attack in the past year and a half-hand-to-hand combat that left several Capitol police officers dead from physical or psychological trauma-Cheney pointed to what the top Senate Republican said the month after the battle.\n\nThe committee played a video of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) on the Senate floor placing much of the blame for Jan. 6 on Trump. \"These criminals were carrying his banners, hanging his flag, and screaming their loyalty to him. It was obvious. It was obvious that only President Trump could end this,\" McConnell said.\n\nCheney also referenced the flood of new evidence-and witnesses-who have started coming forward since the congressional committee began holding public hearings in June.\n\n\"The dam has begun to break,\" she said, noting that the committee will spend August collecting evidence and will resume additional hearings in September.\n\nPolitical Investigations Reporter\n\njose.pagliery@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

Kennedy Jr. completed the full right-wing heel turn on Thursday night when he told Tucker Carlson and Vivek Ramaswamy that the January 6 Capitol insurrection wasn't that bad. Sitting in front of an Anaheim, California audience as a part of his appearance on the Tucker Carlson Live Show Tour , Kennedy said \"people broke the law on January 6, if you broke the law you should be punished, but what, was the Republic threatened on January 6th?\" \"Even if a building is burned down, it's not the end of the republic,\" Kennedy went on. \"And you have the U.S. military there, you have these agencies we have institutions in our country that are still functioning, we have a congress, etcetera, that would resist the violent overthrow.\" Incidentally, the burning down of the Capitol building, as some January 6 insurrectionists had planned , would have likely killed member of Congress.

      "text": "US supreme court ruling could make it harder to prosecute January 6 rioters - and Trump\n\nCourt rules prosecutors overstepped in bringing obstruction charges against Capitol rioters\n\nConservative bloc\n\nAlito - Majority\n\nBarrett - Minority\n\nGorsuch - Majority\n\nKavanaugh - Majority\n\nRoberts - Majority\n\nThomas - Majority\n\nLiberal bloc\n\nJackson - Majority\n\nKagan - Minority\n\nSotomayor - Minority\n\nThe US supreme court has narrowed the statute that prosecutors have relied on in the cases of hundreds of rioters who took part in the January 6 Capitol attack for obstruction of an official proceeding - a ruling with profound implications for participants on that day in 2021.\n\nThe 6-3 ruling in the case of Fischer v United States could also affect the federal criminal case against Donald Trump, who is charged with similar offences in special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into the assault. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson joined the conservative justices in the case, with Chief Justice John Roberts writing the majority opinion. Conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote a dissenting opinion joined by Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.\n\nThe decision stems from the conviction of Joseph Fischer, a former Pennsylvania police officer, who took part in Trump's so-called \"stop the steal\" rally on the morning of January 6 before then entering the Capitol with the mob.\n\nFischer was one of about 350 people federal prosecutors charged under a federal statute, 18 USC section 1512(c)(2), which says any person who \"otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding, or attempts to do so\" can be fined or punished with up to 20 years in prison. The 350 people charged with the crime represent about a quarter of all those charged in connection with the January 6 attack on the Capitol.\n\nThe central question in the case was what kind of conduct exactly the language prohibited. The previous section of the law, 18 USC section 1512(c)(1), is more specific, saying anyone is guilty of a crime who \"alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals a record, document, or other object, or attempts to do so, with the intent to impair the object's integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding\".\n\nWriting for the majority, Chief Justice Roberts zeroed in on the word \"otherwise\" in the second part of the statute.\n\n\"Complex as subsection (c)(1) may look, it simply consists of many specific examples of prohibited actions undertaken with the intent to impair an object's integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding: altering a record, altering a document, concealing a record, concealing a document, and so on,\" he wrote. \"Guided by the basic logic that Congress would not go to the trouble of spelling out the list in (c)(1) if a neighboring term swallowed it up, the most sensible inference is that the scope of (c)(2) is defined by reference to (c)(1).\n\n\"To prove a violation of Section 1512(c)(2), the Government must establish that the defendant impaired the availability or integrity for use in an official proceeding of records, documents, objects, or as we earlier explained, other things used in the proceeding, or attempted to do so,\" he added. The majority sent the opinion back to the court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit for further consideration.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, faces four criminal charges in the case, one of which is a violation of 18 USC section 1512(c)(2). He is also charged with conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding. His lawyers could now argue that those two charges fall under the narrower standard the supreme court announced Friday. Some experts have argued that the evidence against Trump would allow the charges to stick even under a narrower standard.\n\n\"It will be a much tougher case to argue that he impaired an official proceeding if the prosecution must also show that it related to the destruction or alteration, or related activities, of documents,\" said Derek Muller, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame.\n\n\"It may be more about whether paperwork submitted to Pence relating to other electoral votes, or what to do with those votes, rises to the level of criminal activity in the statute. We'll see whether the Department of Justice keeps this charge against Trump, but it may fall back to some of the other charges and rely more heavily on them instead.\"\n\nWhile the statute has been used to charge hundreds of people in January 6 cases, it rarely is the sole charge they face. The charge against Fischer, for example, was one of seven criminal charges filed against him.\n\nWriting in dissent, Barrett said the majority had done \"textual backflips to find some way - any way - to narrow the reach of subsection (c)(2)\".\n\n\"Joseph Fischer allegedly participated in a riot at the Capitol that forced the delay of Congress's joint session on January 6th. Blocking an official proceeding from moving forward surely qualifies as obstructing or impeding the proceeding by means other than document destruction,\" she wrote. \"There is no getting around it: Section 1512(c)(2) is an expansive statute.\"\n\nNoah Bookbinder, the executive director of the left-leaning watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said the justices had helped \"insurrectionists dodge accountability once again\".\n\n\"If attempting to block the certification of the 2020 election isn't obstructing an official proceeding in the court's eyes, then what is?\" he said in a statement. \"This is another example of the court failing to stand up for our democracy and enforce the plain text of the law.\""

      "text": "The five truths Trump hopes you will forget about 6 January 2021\n\nThe US Capitol attack was a shameful event in US history, yet Americans remain confused and divided about what occurred\n\nThree years ago this week, the United States Capitol was attacked by thousands of armed loyalists of Donald Trump , some intent on killing members of Congress.\n\nRoughly 140 police officers were injured in the attack. Four people died . Capitol police officer Brian D Sicknick, who participated in the response, passed away the following day. Another Capitol police officer and a Washington DC police officer who also responded to the attack have since died by suicide.\n\nJanuary 6, 2021, will be remembered as one of the most shameful days in US history. Yet three years later, Americans remain confused and divided about the significance of what occurred.\n\nLet me offer five basic truths:\n\nThe events of January 6 capped two months during which Donald Trump sought to reverse the outcome of the 2020 election.\n\nIn the wake of the election, Trump repeatedly asserted that he had won and Biden had lost, without any basis in fact or law. Sixty federal courts as well as Trump's own Departments of Justice and Homeland Security concluded that there was no evidence of substantial fraud.\n\nTrump summoned to the White House Republican lawmakers from Pennsylvania and Michigan to inquire about how they might alter the election results.\n\nHe called two local canvassing board officials in Wayne county, Michigan, that state's most populous county and one that overwhelmingly favored Biden.\n\nHe phoned Georgia's Republican secretary of state to \" find 11,780 votes \", according to a recording of that conversation, adding that \"the people of Georgia are angry, the people of the country are angry. And there's nothing wrong with saying that, you know, um, that you've recalculated.\"\n\nHe alluded that Georgia's secretary of state would face criminal prosecution if he did not do as Trump told him: \"You know what they did and you're not reporting it. You know, that's a criminal - that's a criminal offense. And you know, you can't let that happen. That's a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer. That's a big risk.\"\n\nHe pressed the acting US attorney general and deputy attorney general to declare the election fraudulent.\n\nWhen the deputy said the department had found no evidence of widespread fraud and warned that it had no power to change the outcome of the election, Trump replied : \"Just say that the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me.\"\n\nTrump and his allies continued to harangue the attorney general and top justice department officials nearly every day until January 6.\n\nTrump plotted with an assistant attorney general to oust the acting attorney general and pressure lawmakers in Georgia to overturn the state's election results. Trump ultimately decided against it after top department leaders pledged to resign en masse .\n\nTrump then incited the attack on the Capitol.\n\nFor weeks before the attack, Trump urged his supporters to come to Washington for a Save America protest on January 6, when Congress was scheduled to ceremonially count the electoral votes of Joe Biden's win.\n\nHe tweeted on December 19: \"Big protest in DC on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!\" On December 26: \"See you in Washington, DC, on January 6th. Don't miss it. Information to follow.\"\n\nOn December 30: \"JANUARY SIXTH, SEE YOU IN DC!\" On January 1: \"The BIG Protest Rally in Washington, DC will take place at 11:00 A.M. on January 6th. Locational details to follow. StopTheSteal!\"\n\nAt a rally he held just before the violence began, Trump repeated his lies about how the election had been stolen. \"We will never give up,\" he said . \"We will never concede. It will never happen. You don't concede when there's theft involved. Our country has had enough. We will not take it any more.\"\n\nHe told the crowd that Republicans were fighting like a boxer with his hands tied behind his back, overly respectful of \"bad people\".\n\nInstead, he said, Republicans are \"going to have to fight much harder ... We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them, because you'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength, and you have to be strong ... We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country any more.\"\n\nHe then told the crowd that \"different rules\" applied to them.\n\n\"When you catch somebody in a fraud, you are allowed to go by very different rules. So I hope Mike [Pence] has the courage to do what he has to do, and I hope he doesn't listen to the Rinos [Republicans in name only] and the stupid people that he's listening to.\"\n\nThen - knowing that members of the crowd were armed - he dispatched them to the Capitol as the electoral count was about to start. The attack on the Capitol came immediately after.\n\nHe watched the attack on television from the White House. For three hours, he made no attempt to stop it or ask his supporters to refrain from violence.\n\nTrump's attempted coup continues to this day.\n\nTrump still refuses to concede the 2020 election. He continues to assert it was stolen.\n\nSign up to Follow Robert Reich\n\nGet Robert Reich's latest columns delivered straight to your inbox\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nHe has presided over a network of loyalists and allies who sought to overturn the election and erode public confidence in it by mounting partisan state \"audits\" and escalating attacks on state election officials.\n\nA year later, on 6 January 2022, Trump hosted a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. \"Remember,\" he said, \"the insurrection took place on November 3rd. It was the completely unarmed protest of the rigged election that took place on January 6th.\" (Reminder: some were, in fact, armed .)\n\nTrump then referred to the House investigation of the attack on the Capitol: \"Why isn't the Unselect Committee of highly partisan political hacks investigating the CAUSE of the January 6th protest, which was the rigged Presidential Election of 2020?\"\n\nHe went on to castigate \"Rinos\", presumably referring to his opponents within the party, such as Republican representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, who sat on the January 6 committee. \"In many ways a Rino is worse than a Radical Left Democrat,\" Trump said, \"because you don't know where they are coming from and you have no idea how bad they really are for our Country.\" He added: \"the good news is there are fewer and fewer Rinos left as we elect strong Patriots who love America.\"\n\nTrump then led a purge of congressional Republicans who had failed to support him. He endorsed a primary challenger to Cheney, who lost her re-election bid in Wyoming. Kinzinger left Congress.\n\nTrump is now running for president again, with a wide lead over other Republican candidates for the nomination.\n\nDuring his campaign, he has called January 6, 2021, \"a beautiful day\" and described those imprisoned for the insurrection as \"great, great patriots\" and \"hostages\". At his campaign rallies he has played a recording of The Star-Spangled Banner sung by jailed rioters, accompanied by his recitation of the pledge of allegiance.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump will spend the third anniversary of the January 6 attack at two rallies in Iowa.\n\nTrump has still not been held accountable.\n\nTrump's post-riot impeachment was rejected by Republican senators, including the Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, who claimed there were better ways to hold him accountable than impeaching him.\n\nAlthough the House January 6 committee had no direct power to hold Trump accountable, its revelations did affect the 2022 midterms, where many Republican candidates who had supported Trump's lies were defeated. It also laid a foundation for the justice department to indict Trump.\n\nThe Republican presidential primaries have not held Trump accountable. To the contrary, the justice department's indictment and a similar indictment in Georgia have apparently strengthened Trump's grip on the nomination, as he uses them as evidence that he's being persecuted.\n\nThe Colorado supreme court and Maine's secretary of state have determined that Trump should not be on their state ballots because of section 3 of the 14th amendment to the constitution, which bars someone who has previously sworn allegiance to the constitution but then engaged in an insurrection from holding public office. Trump has appealed the decisions.\n\nTrump maintains a demagogic hold over the Republican party\n\nA belligerent and narcissistic authoritarian has gained a powerful hold over a large portion of the US, including the Republican party.\n\nAccording to recent polls, 70% of Republican voters believe his lie that the 2020 election was stolen. Thirty-four per cent of Republicans believe the FBI organized and encouraged the insurrection (compared with 30% of independents and 13% of Democrats).\n\nThe Republican party is close to becoming a cult whose central animating idea is that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.\n\nTrump has had help, of course. Fox News hosts and social media groups have promoted and amplified his ravings for their own purposes. The vast majority of Republicans in Congress and in the states have played along.\n\nThe 2024 election will be the final and probably last opportunity to hold Trump accountable for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, including his attempted coup three years ago today.\n\nThe 2024 election may therefore be the last chance for American democracy to function.\n\nRobert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few and The Common Good .

      "text": "'January 6 was just the warm-up': the film that tracks three Maga extremists storming the Capitol\n\nMichael Premo spent months getting to know, and filming, three Maga insurrectionists who took part in the riots. Why does the documentary-maker now think America is tottering on the brink of civil war?\n\nH omegrown is a documentary about three American patriots who love their country, revere Donald Trump and balk at the result of the 2020 presidential election. Director Michael Premo spent months trailing his subjects - Chris, Thad and Randy - in the run-up to the attack on the Capitol building of 6 January 2021, and his illuminating, gripping film looks back at a dark period of recent US history. Implicitly, though, it also warns of further unrest.\n\n\"I think January 6th was just the warm-up,\" Premo says. \"This November, we're going to see an even more frantic and desperate attempt to attack every level of the electoral system.\" He is not optimistic about the US's current direction of travel. The country, he argues, is effectively on the brink of civil war.\n\nHomegrown premieres in the International Critics' Week sidebar at this year's Venice film festival . It is one of a number of campaigning political pictures that could put the event at loggerheads with Giorgia Meloni's rightwing Italian government. Joining it on the programme is Separated, Errol Morris 's documentary about family separation on the US's southern border; Dani Rosenberg's harrowing Gaza-themed drama Of Dogs and Men; and Olha Zhurba's Songs of Slow Burning Earth, which is billed as an audiovisual diary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAnother highlight, says festival boss Alberto Barbera, will be the epic M: Son of the Century, Joe Wright's eight-part TV biopic charting the life and times of Italy's fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, whose government established the Venice film festival back in 1932. \"And I must add,\" Barbera told Variety magazine, \"the time it describes has some pretty striking similarities with the present day.\"\n\nLinks with the past are certainly clear in Homegrown, which spotlights a right-wing insurrectionist movement that had flourished on the fringes for decades before finding a new energy and focus under the Maga banner of Trump. Premo, a New York-based film-maker, began researching the documentary in 2018, eventually homing in on his three main protesters. One, Chris Quaglin, is a New Jersey electrician who divides his time between preparing a nursery for his soon-to-be-born son and stocking his \"man-cave\" with firearms in readiness for war. He says: \"An AR-15 and enough people is enough to take our country back.\"\n\nThis, Premo argues, remains a distinct possibility. \"Most prominent thinkers still dismiss the idea of civil war, because their reference is an event that occurred in 1860 under a very specific set of circumstances. But that's discounting the way that modern political violence manifests itself, and particularly the way that sectarian violence plays out around the world. If this was happening in another country, say in Africa or Asia, I think American journalists would already be referring to the situation as a cold civil war. That's how it feels to me.\"\n\nHomegrown climaxes with powerful, ground-level footage of the January 6 attack. We see Quaglin in the thick of the action, resplendent in his stars-and-stripes Maga jumpsuit. He is swept up in the moment, storming the DC police by the metal barricades. \"Almost a victory, I would say,\" he brags afterwards, although this moment of near triumph proves short-lived. Quaglin was later found guilty of assaulting police and obstructing Congress and is currently serving a 12-year prison sentence.\n\nPremo has spent his career filming direct action protests. January 6 felt different, he says. \"This was one of the most well-documented crimes in history. It was planned in public: a collaborative conspiracy involving numerous actors and institutions. Everyone knew it was coming.\"\n\nThe director says he anticipated a massive police presence which would prevent protesters from gaining access to the Capitol. In the event, he was shocked by the lack of security; he says it almost felt deliberate. \"I have to imagine that there are many law enforcement people who are part of these same conservative Facebook groups. They're watching Fox News, watching Alex Jones and all the other pundits bang the drum about storming the Capitol. They had the same information I did and chose to do nothing about it.\"\n\nWhat Homegrown highlights, however, is how broad-based and diverse America's right-wing populist movement has become. Premo, who is black, claims that its main organising principle is not race hatred so much as despair and disillusion, characterised by a widespread loss of faith in American democracy's ability to safeguard public interests. Significantly, the film chooses to cross-cut Quaglin's journey with that of his fellow rebel Thad Cisneros, a charismatic Latino activist from Texas. Cisneros explains that he was first radicalised by watching Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 . He now dreams of forming an alliance with Black Lives Matter organisers.\n\nCisneros, it transpires, is now also serving time and thus unavailable for comment. But he represents an increasingly fractured and muddied political landscape, one in which the old left-and-right stereotypes no longer apply. \"We need to have a more nuanced understanding of the people driving this movement,\" Premo says. \"We need to know who these people are, what they look like, where they come from. Only then can we understand what we need to do to support the principle of a pluralistic democracy that stands any chance of surviving beyond this current era of us-versus-them politics.\"\n\nHomegrown screens at the Venice film festival on 30 August"

      "text": "Without proof, top Trump adviser accuses January 6 committee of destroying evidence - as it happened\n\nThis live blog is now closed. You can read all our latest US politics stories here:\n\nRightwing figures on social media are celebrating news that Daniel Penny has been acquitted of charges related to the chokehold death of Jordan Neely on a New York City subway train.\n\nA jury acquitted the Marine Corps veteran Penny on a charge of criminally negligent homicide, after last week deadlocking on a manslaughter charge that the judge then ordered dismissed.\n\nIn reaction to the news, the Republican congressman Eli Crane wrote on X :\n\nMassive vibe shift and a huge win for our nation.\n\nThe commentator Matt Walsh said:\n\nDaniel Penny now has his freedom. He should also have the Medal of Freedom for the courage he displayed on the train that day, and during the ordeal that followed. Maybe with Trump coming in, that might actually happen.\n\nThe Trump ally Charlie Kirk wrote:\n\nMarine hero Daniel Penny has been found NOT GUILTY. He has been acquitted!! Thank God!!\n\nHere's more about the verdict:\n\nJust after midnight, Donald Trump made this somewhat strange post on Truth Social :\n\nThe Democrats are fighting hard to get rid of the Popular Vote in future Elections. They want all future Presidential Elections to be based exclusively on the Electoral College!\n\nHe did not say which Democrats he was referring to, and the comment seems at odds with the public views of some in the party, at least before the 2024 election.\n\nIf there's any aspect of US elections that Democrats want to change, it would be the electoral college, not the popular vote. Some in the party complain that the system favors the GOP, particularly since since George W Bush in 2000 and Donald Trump in 2016 both won the presidency in those years despite not winning the popular vote. Kamala Harris 's running mate Tim Walz even mentioned getting rid of the electoral college during the campaign.\n\nTrump, of course, won both the electoral college and popular vote on 5 November - a decisive victory that abolishing the electoral college would not have prevented.\n\nShasti Conrad, chair of the Washington state Democrats , has formally launched a bid to become one of the vice-chairs of the Democratic National Committee, which will hold leadership elections in February.\n\nIn a statement announcing her candidacy, Conrad touted the $9m the state party has raised since she became chair last year and noted that Washington state bucked the national trend of shifting toward Republicans in the presidential election last month.\n\n\"I am asking for the votes of every Democratic National Committee member to be your next Vice Chair to bring the tools that helped Washington State Democrats succeed to a national platform,\" Conrad said.\n\n\"I believe in the power of partnership. Our policies are popular. Our values are American values. Together, let's lead our party out of the wilderness and start improving the lives of all Americans again.\"\n\nThe DNC has four vice-chair posts to fill, and at least one other candidate, the pro-Palestinian advocate and longtime DNC member James Zogby , has already launched a bid. David Hogg, a survivor of the 2018 Parkland shooting turned gun safety activist, is also considering a run.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, the Democratic congressman James Clyburn said Donald Trump's comments about jailing the January 6 committee members should be taken seriously.\n\n\"Those are his words. We ought to believe him when he says it. And I know there are people already saying, 'Oh, he doesn't mean that.' OK, go and look and see ... what he did after the 2016 election. We got a precursor way back then to what's now being called Project 2025,\" Clyburn said.\n\nThe South Carolina lawmaker also warned that the last time a president like Trump took office, states imposed Jim Crow laws :\n\nI've studied history all of my life, and I'm telling you, what I see going on, what I hear coming from those people who are planning to work in this administration should be concerned for everybody. I know what happened. The history is very clear what happened the last time we had a presidential election that portended this, Jim Crow became the law of the land. And that's where we're headed if we aren't careful.\n\nThe supreme court has turned down a request by Donald Trump 's attorneys to order the lifting of the gag order imposed on the president-elect in his hush-money case.\n\nIn a brief order, the court denied a petition from Trump's attorneys that was addressed to Samuel Alito , a member of its conservative supermajority.\n\nJuan Merchan , the New York judge who presided over the trial that saw Trump convicted of 34 felony business fraud charges, imposed the gag order in March, which currently prevents the incoming president from making public statements about prosecutors, court staff and their families. Here's more:\n\nIn his weekend interview with NBC News where he said members of the January 6 committee should be jailed, Donald Trump also made clear that he planned to stick with his promise to pardon those charged over the attack on the Capitol. Here's more, from the Guardian's Michael Sainato :\n\nIn his first sit-down television news interview since winning a second presidency in November's election, Donald Trump renewed promises to pardon his supporters involved in the attack on the US Capitol in early 2021.\n\nHe also doubled down on promises of mass deportations and tariffs in the conversation with NBC's Meet the Press host, Kristen Welker - the latter of which he acknowledged could cause Americans to pay more after riding voters' complaints about higher prices back to the White House at the expense of Vice-President Kamala Harris .\n\n\"I'm going to be acting very quickly. First day,\" Trump said in the interview, claiming convicted Capitol attackers had been put through a \"very nasty system\".\n\n\"I know the system,\" said Trump, himself convicted in May by New York state prosecutors of criminally falsifying business records to conceal hush-money payments to the adult film actor Stormy Daniels. \"The system's a very corrupt system.\"\n\nTrump said there may be some exceptions to his pardons over an attack on the Capitol that was meant to keep him in the Oval Office after losing the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden - and which was linked to multiple deaths, including the suicides of traumatized law enforcement officers. He referenced previously debunked claims of anti-Trump law enforcement infiltrating his supporters' ranks and agitating the attack.\n\nYesterday on CNN, the Republican senator Markwayne Mullin was asked for his thoughts on Donald Trump's comments about prosecuting members of the January 6 committee.\n\nHe said the now-shuttered House investigation was worthy of investigation, and repeated Trump's factually dubious assertions that they destroyed evidence, but stopped short of calling for the members' jailing. \"I don't think they have a reason to be afraid now,\" Mullin said. He continued:\n\nI think that investigation should be in looked into if there was criminal activity that took place with the January 6 committee. There was a lot of questions that didn't get answered. There was a lot of information that was destroyed. Why did they destroy it? Why didn't they? Why did they refuse to allow a lot of people to testify, or their testimony to actually become public? If the American people want to know that, then maybe we do another hearing.\n\nAdam Schiff, the California senator-elect who served on the January 6 committee during his just-concluded time in the House, responded to Donald Trump's call for his jailing.\n\nWriting on X , Schiff said:\n\nWhen Trump violated his oath, I stood up to him. When he tried to overturn the 2020 election, the January 6th Committee stood in defense of our democracy. Threats to jail us will not deter us. Nothing will stop me from doing my duty to the American people.\n\nIn his interview with NBC News , Donald Trump said the January 6 committee \"deleted and destroyed all evidence\", before insisting he was not responsible for the violent attack on the Capitol.\n\n\"And Cheney was behind it. And so was [Democratic chair] Bennie Thompson and everybody on that committee. For what they did, honestly, they should go to jail,\" Trump said.\n\nThe committee's report and its evidence remains publicly available , and Liz Cheney , the Republican former congresswoman who served as the body's vice-chair, said in a statement that Trump was not telling the truth about its work:\n\nThis morning, President-elect Trump again lied about the January 6th Select Committee, and said members of the Committee 'should go to jail' for carrying out our constitutional responsibilities. Here is the truth: Donald Trump attempted to overturn the 2020 presidential election and seize power. He mobilized an angry mob and sent them to the United States Capitol, where they attacked police officers, invaded the building, and halted the official counting of electoral votes. Trump watched on television as police officers were brutally beaten and the Capitol was assaulted, refusing for hours to tell the mob to leave. This was the worst breach of our Constitution by any president in our nation's history. Donald Trump's suggestion that members of Congress who later investigated his illegal and unconstitutional actions should be jailed is a continuation of his assault on the rule of law and the foundations of our republic.\n\nDonald Trump knows his claims about the select committee are ridiculous and false, as has been detailed extensively, including by Chairman Thompson in this July 2023 letter. There is no conceivably appropriate factual or constitutional basis for what Donald Trump is suggesting - a Justice Department investigation of the work of a congressional committee - and any lawyer who attempts to pursue that course would quickly find themselves engaged in sanctionable conduct.\n\nGood morning, US politics blog readers. In his first sit-down interview since winning the presidential election, Donald Trump made clear to NBC News on Sunday that he planned to upend an array of governing norms as soon as he gets into the White House. The president-elect said he would pardon most January 6 insurrectionists, and that the former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney and other lawmakers who served on the bipartisan House committee that investigated the attack on the Capitol \"should go to jail\". That prompted a furious riposte from Cheney, who was ousted from Congress's lower chamber two years ago over her break from Trump.\n\n\"Here is the truth: Donald Trump attempted to overturn the 2020 presidential election and seize power,\" Cheney said in a statement, where she also called for the justice department special counsel, Jack Smith , to release evidence he gathered into Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election. We'll see if any other former members of the committee speak out today.\n\nHere's what else is going on today:\n\nJoe Biden speaks at the Tribal Nations Summit in Washington DC at 3.45pm ET, then parties with members of Congress at their Holiday Ball at 6pm.\n\nAndy Kim of New Jersey and Adam Schiff of California, both Democrats, are expected to be sworn into the Senate today, after resigning their seats in the House to take up their new roles.\n\nCongress is continuing work on a massive year-end defense spending bill that will be one of the last things it does before the new Republican majority takes their seats next year."

Your heart rate increases, you have a festering sense that things are wrong and you're playing by the rules and other people aren't and it's just not right.\"\n\nSign up to This Week in Trumpland\n\nA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nOther forms of racial resentment, according to this framework, would include the perception that affirmative action unfairly hurts white applicants - or the idea that DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) policies unfairly benefit people of color.\n\nDistinct from racial hatred or prejudice, racial resentment, Wilson argues, is a particularly powerful motive to action because it stems from a sense of injustice.\n\nThe psycho-social phenomenon can have consequences for democracy, Wilson said.\n\n\"If you can get people to believe that democracy is about your freedom, and that the government is taking that away through taxes, through policies, through regulatory efforts, and [even] by fixing and rigging elections, you can stoke their resentment and they can even come to resent democracy.\""

      "text": "DHS Jan. 6 Investigators Raised Alarm About Being Stonewalled Last Year\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nA trail of documents shows the DHS watchdog disclosed serious issues with records access in general terms in October 2021.\n\nAfter The Intercept broke the news that the Secret Service had deleted text messages from on and around January 6 , the Department of Homeland Security's watchdog came under fire for not having notified Congress that it had discovered the deletions sooner. Top congressional Democrats have taken the extraordinary step of calling for DHS Inspector General Joseph Cuffari's recusal from the January 6 investigation, following reports that Cuffari knew about the deleted text messages as early as May 2021 but didn't notify the committee investigating the insurrection until July 14, 2022. On Monday, the Washington Post editorial board likewise called for his recusal.\n\nBut documents obtained by The Intercept show that the DHS Office of Inspector General disclosed its access issues in general terms in semiannual reports to Congress in September 2021 and March 2022 and also shared its issues with other inspectors general in October 2021. The reports were met with skepticism by President Joe Biden's Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas, who appeared to make light of their seriousness. Meanwhile, oversight officials tasked with investigating January 6 are growing increasingly frustrated with what they say is DHS agencies' refusal to cooperate with the inquiry.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nWhile Congress's January 6 committee investigation has garnered the most media attention, parallel investigations into the raid of the Capitol are also being conducted by inspectors general at the departments of Defense, Justice, and Interior. Inspectors general enjoy an array of tools including criminal investigators, auditors, and forensics specialists, who are authorized to have timely access to all records relevant to IG responsibilities. Inspectors general are independent from the agencies in which they are embedded and cooperate with each other via the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, or CIGIE.\n\nIn the semiannual report to Congress covering April 1, 2021, to September 30, 2021, the DHS OIG describes the agency's lack of cooperation with its January 6 probe, without getting into details. \"The Department significantly delayed access to OIG's access to Department records,\" the office writes, noting that it is required to disclose when that occurs, \"thereby impeding the progress of OIG's review of the January 6 events at the Capitol.\"\n\nAsked about the access issues, a spokesperson for the DHS OIG declined to comment, saying, \"To preserve the integrity of our work and protect our independence, we do not discuss our ongoing reviews or our communications with Congress.\"\n\nOn October 7, Cuffari notified other inspectors general in an email that the DHS OIG was facing an unusual amount of pushback on getting relevant records from January 6 - and that the office had reports that DHS employees were being told not to comply. \"We have received communication from DHS employees that they have been directed not to comply with our requests,\" according to a copy of the email reviewed by The Intercept. \"They have also reported concerns regarding their communications with our office about the January 6th and other previous matters.\" He also said the office's general counsel was meeting with the DHS general counsel on the matter.\n\nOn October 18, Mark Greenblatt, vice chair of the CIGIE and inspector general for the Department of the Interior, followed up with Cuffari. \"Just checking in to see whether things have improved regarding your access issues?\" he wrote. \"Let me know if we at CIGIE can help in any way.\"\n\nCuffari responded: \"DHS OIG carefully documented concerns we had about our access to DHS' January 6 events at the Capitol documents. I am pleased that we have been able to work through those issues. As I may have mentioned, we are nonetheless issuing a management alert and more formally documenting the concerns in our SAR.\" A management alert notifies senior officials at an agency that there is a threat of waste, fraud, or abuse; an SAR is a semiannual report to Congress.\n\nDespite Cuffari's optimism in October 2021 that the issues with DHS were coming to a close, in the following semiannual report, which covered October 2021 through March 2022, the DHS OIG reported that the access interruptions were continuing. From the report: \"During the previous reporting period we included information about Secret Service's significant delay of OIG's access to Secret Service records, impeding the progress of our January 6, 2021 review. We continue to discuss this issue with Secret Service.\"\n\nWhile these mentions are vague, they do show that the DHS OIG was actively pursuing the records and raising the access issues outside its own office.\n\nMayorkas has repeatedly downplayed the notion that the Secret Service was not being cooperative, as well as the OIG's semiannual reports warning of the same, and instead suggested that the OIG's requests were unreasonable. Mayorkas may also be concerned about giving ammunition to House Republicans if they come to power following the midterms. Republicans have not been shy to threaten that they are collecting evidence and \"building a case\" against Mayorkas for not adhering to their hardline border policies.\n\nIn a June 14 letter to House Oversight Committee Ranking Member James Comer, Mayorkas wrote that in response to the OIG's \"sweeping\" requests, the Secret Service and other DHS agencies have made available \"countless documents.\" He also complained that many of the records produced \"required discussion to ensure proper handling of highly sensitive information.\" Of the semiannual reports mentioning the Secret Service's alleged noncompliance, Mayorkas said he was \"concerned\" that the report to Congress \"does not always provide sufficient context.\"\n\n\"It is particularly disturbing,\" he writes, \"that the OIG does not provide any specifics concerning this unfounded assertion, with which the DHS strongly disagrees.\"\n\nThere may also have been a reason the DHS OIG didn't disclose the details about the deleted texts in the semiannual report: The office reportedly told the Secret Service later in July that the inquiry into the Secret Service was criminal in nature, and criminal investigations are typically closely held.\n\nThe role that the Secret Service played on January 6 is one of the biggest remaining questions about what happened that day. During the unrest, Vice President Mike Pence's Secret Service detail tried to evacuate him from the Capitol, which would have prevented him from certifying the election results, had Pence not refused. Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., a member of the January 6 committee, called Pence's terse refusal- \"I'm not getting in the car\"- the \"six most chilling words of this entire thing I've seen so far.\"\n\nAppointed by President Donald Trump in 2019, Cuffari was unanimously confirmed by the Senate, but that may be where the smooth sailing for him ended. Almost immediately, Cuffari was thrust into a brutal power struggle within the OIG, as The Intercept reported last year. Within months, a misconduct investigation into several top OIG officials was launched. The results of that investigation found, among other things, a senior official fantasizing about a fictional assassin from \"Game of Thrones\" \"taking care of\" John V. Kelly, then the head of the agency, and generally painting a picture of acrimony and chaos within the agency. Cuffari is now himself under investigation for launching that investigation.\n\nThe Intercept was not able to immediately corroborate Cuffari's suspicions that DHS employees were being told not to cooperate with the oversight office on the January 6 investigation, but a briefing memo from early July shows DHS coaching Customs and Border Protection leadership on ways they could push back against the OIG's records requests. The memo, which cites discussions with the DHS Office of the General Counsel, was shared with The Intercept by a CBP official concerned that its parent agency was attempting to block inspector general oversight.\n\nThe memo bemoans \"the high number of OIG audits,\" noting that \"the OIG has been persistent\" in its request for \"direct, unfettered access to CBP systems.\" (The OIG has reported to Congress detailed allegations about being denied access to the same specific systems, among others.) Legally, the OIG is entitled to transparent access to all internal discussions, documents, and other agency records unless a specific law expressly limits the OIG's access. It isn't clear that there is any such law.\n\n\"OIG's access to information is not unlimited,\" states the memo, which was produced to prep CBP officials prior to a meeting with the DHS OIG. \"For example, CBP is not required to provide information if it is ... protected from disclosure in the interest of national defense or national security or in the conduct of foreign affairs.\"\n\nThe briefing also suggests another legal route to obscure OIG access: the Inspector General Act, which established agency watchdogs in 1978 following the Watergate scandal, could be interpreted to include a reasonableness standard that could be used to deny IG records requests.\n\nThe memo cites a single passage in the law dictating what should happen when a request for information is \"unreasonably\" refused by an agency - and uses the passage as a jumping-off point to speculate about what a \"reasonable\" refusal might look like. \"Although the Inspector General Act does not provide guidance on what is considered 'reasonable,' it is possible that the cost could be a factor in deciding whether an OIG request is reasonable, if an appropriate decisionmaker determines that compliance is too costly,\" the memo reads, also suggesting that requests could be denied if they were deemed \"not relevant\" or \"overly broad.\"\n\nSen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee, expressed similar concerns about DHS compliance in an August 2 letter to Mayorkas.\n\nPortman's letter lays blame for the impediments to the DHS OIG's January 6 investigation on Mayorkas, and a careful reading of Mayorkas does suggest that he wants to limit OIG access. Mayorkas has communicated, Portman writes (emphasis his), \"that the Department has worked 'to provide broad access to information ... subject to the Department's legal obligations ' and noting your commitment to provide 'timely access to relevant information,' while also taking issue with the breadth of the requests and their relevancy to the OIG's review.\"\n\nCuffari had previously told Congress, Portman also notes, that DHS's general counsel had directed DHS agencies \"not to provide the OIG requested documents and information directly\" but instead to \"first provide responsive records to the General Counsel for review before producing them to the OIG.\" This, Portman maintains, is not legally necessary.\n\nFor his part, Mayorkas vigorously denies that DHS has played any role in restricting or delaying the inspector general's access. In the June 14 letter to Comer, Mayorkas writes, \"At no time did the Department refuse access to relevant information or impede progress in either of January 6-related reviews.\"\n\nHowever, in an internal memo sent to DHS employees on September 30, 2021 - around the same time Cuffari was raising flags about access - Mayorkas reminds staff that they should cooperate with the DHS OIG. \"Any effort to conceal information or obstruct the OIG in carrying out its critical work,\" he writes , \"is against Department directives and can lead to serious consequences.\"\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have?

      "text": "\"Jan 6th is gonna be crazy. ... lol\": DHS Officials Expected Violence at the Capitol, Kept It to Themselves\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nA new report from the DHS Office of Inspector General documents intelligence officials joking about Democrats being hanged.\n\nIn the days leading up to the January 6, 2021, siege of the U.S. Capitol, officials inside the Department of Homeland Security were feeling anxious. Within the department's Office of Intelligence and Analysis, the sole component of the federal government authorized to disseminate threat information to state and local law enforcement agencies, analysts had watched as maps of the Capitol were circulated online amid talk of hanging Democrats, murdering protesters, and dying in a blaze of glory.\n\nThe Homeland Security officials warned each other to be vigilant going to and from work as the \"Stop the Steal\" rally to protest the results of the 2020 election approached. Expecting violence, some planned to stay home when the day finally came. Despite the measures they planned to take for their own safety, however, and the abundant evidence that January 6 was a powder keg waiting to blow, the federal office responsible for warning the rest of the government about dangerous events decided to keep its concerns to itself.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThese are the findings of a DHS Office of Inspector General report released Tuesday that calls for \"essential changes\" to I&A, the department's troubled intelligence office. The 50-page report documents how the various divisions of I&A - from open-source intelligence \"collectors,\" to its counterterrorism wing, to officials posted at \"fusion centers\" around the country - repeatedly encountered evidence of preparations for violence at the Capitol and chose not to report that information to a wider audience.\n\nAs early as December 21, 2020, according to the report, I&A officials internally circulated information about an individual describing plans to kill protesters by the dozens; calls to bring weapons to Washington, D.C.; an increase in weapons brandished by individuals already in the capital; and threats of violence against \"ideological adversaries,\" law enforcement agents, and government officials. None of that information made it outside the office prior to January 6, however. While one I&A official did submit information about the various threats to be approved for a report on January 5, the inspector general noted, that release was not approved and disseminated until two days after the siege, at which point four people who were at the event were dead, including one who was shot by a Capitol police officer.\n\n\"In the weeks before the events at the U.S. Capitol, I&A identified specific open source threat information related to January 6 but did not issue any intelligence products about these threats until January 8,\" the report said. \"On several occasions leading up to January 6, collectors messaged each other about the threats they discovered online.\"\n\nThe inspector general pointed to two core explanations for I&A's inaction: a rushed hiring push in 2019 that put inexperienced and untrained officials on the job and public backlash following the office's targeting of journalists covering the George Floyd protests in 2020.\n\nThe report is the latest blow for I&A, which has long been the subject of criticism for its troubled relationship to constitutionally protected protest activities and among those who see the post-9/11 office as unnecessarily duplicative in a world where the FBI already exists. In the summer of 2020, I&A was embroiled in controversy when documents leaked showing that analysts had created files on journalists covering the George Floyd protests. Soon after that, Brian Murphy, the head of I&A at the time, filed a whistleblower complaint alleging that the two top officials at DHS pressured his analysts to downplay intelligence involving threats from the far right and to amplify intelligence supporting the president's reelection messaging on the dangerousness of left-wing agitators. The DHS political appointees in question, Chad Wolf and Ken Cuccinelli, denied the allegation.\n\n\"As Secretary Mayorkas has said, the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021 was a violent assault on our democracy,\" a DHS spokesperson said in a statement to The Intercept. \"Over the past fourteen months, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has strengthened intelligence analysis, information sharing, and operational preparedness to help prevent acts of violence and keep our communities safe.\"\n\nIn addition to implementing a first of its kind National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism , the official noted that since the Capitol siege, I&A has conducted \"more than 70 engagements with partners across every level of government, in the private sector, and local communities regarding emerging threat,\" while the department as whole has issued \"more than 95 intelligence products related to domestic violent extremism.\"\n\nIn December, President Joe Biden nominated Kenneth Wainstein , a former adviser to President George W. Bush and chief of staff to longtime FBI Director Robert Mueller, to take over the intelligence office.\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, welcomed the inspector general's report. \"I'm glad that the IG made it clear that our intelligence agencies under the previous administration should have done much more before the January 6th attack on the capitol,\" Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi, said in a statement to The Intercept. \"Thankfully, Office of Intelligence and Analysis has agreed with IG's recommendations and I look forward to working with it on implementing them.\"\n\nOregon Sen. Ron Wyden, a sharp critic of surveillance excesses at DHS - from Customs and Border Protection's targeting of journalists, lawyers, and immigration advocates at the border to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement program that vacuumed up millions of Americans' financial records - said the report was indicative of a pattern of problems at the nation's largest law enforcement agency that had impacted his own hometown.\n\n\"The new Inspector General Report is another reminder that multiple federal agencies failed to appropriately respond to the very real, public threats to the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021,\" Wyden said in a statement to The Intercept. \"That failure came only a few months after DHS officials inappropriately collected and shared intelligence about reporters and other people who posed no threat to homeland security in Portland.\"\n\n\"Clearly DHS Intelligence activities need an overhaul to ensure that the department is focused on real threats, not harassing reporters and non-violent protesters,\" the senator added. \"The public also deserves more information about DHS's intelligence activities, and I am pleased that Ken Wainstein, the nominee to head the Department's intelligence office, has committed to me to conduct an immediate review on how to increase transparency.\"\n\nThe inspector general's findings indicate that the dysfunction that plagued I&A in the summer of 2020 continued into the winter of 2021.\n\nIn one passage, the report presents a series of messages that two \"collectors,\" officials responsible for trawling through open-source information to identify domestic security threats, exchanged late on the night of January 2, after one of the officials noticed that people were sharing a map of the Capitol online.\n\n\"I feel like people are actually going to try and hurt politicians,\" the official who came across the map wrote. \"Jan 6th is gonna be crazy, not to mention the inauguration.\"\n\nThe official suspected that their supervisors would order extra shifts for the event, writing, \"Watch us get surged for that lol.\"\n\nThe second official had a similar feeling, adding that the Proud Boys - a right-wing street-fighting gang - were in town the night before. A few hours later, the first official wrote again.\n\n\"Like there's these people talking about hanging Democrats from ropes like wtf,\" they said.\n\n\"They'd need alot of rope,\" the second official replied. \"I think DC is pretty much all democrat haha.\"\n\nBy 2:53 a.m., the first official had arrived at a succinct description of the threats they were seeing: \"I mean people are talking about storming Congress, bringing guns, willing to die for the cause, hanging politicians with ropes,\" they wrote.\n\nAccording to the inspector general, neither official considered filing a report describing what they were seeing. \"When reviewing threats pertaining to January 6 events, the collectors generally concluded that the statements online were hyperbole, and not true threats or incitement, because they thought storming the U.S. Capitol and other threats were unlikely or not possible,\" the report said.\n\nOne collector who spoke to the oversight investigators recalled describing to a colleague how \"nervous\" they were after seeing a group of people who looked \"like they are going to battle\" post about their arrival in Washington. \"Yet, these collectors did not draft any intelligence products reflecting possible safety concerns in the area,\" the report said.\n\nThe inspector general traced some of the inaction to shift changes in the summer of 2019 that resulted in an exodus of collectors from I&A. The office responded with a hiring blitz, bringing in replacements \"mostly at entry level positions, with many not having Federal government or intelligence experience.\"\n\n\"As of January 6, 2021, 16 out of 21 collectors had less than 1 year of experience, and some of these new collectors said they did not receive adequate training to help determine when threat information should be reported,\" the report said.\n\nFallout from the summer of 2020 disclosures - which included hearings on Capitol Hill and a separate inspector general report published, ironically, on January 6, 2021 - may have also played a role in the inaction. Out of the 24 collectors the inspector general interviewed, 22 said that their reporting approach \"was affected by the scrutiny they received\" the previous summer, when DHS deployed Border Patrol tactical teams in response to protests in Portland, Oregon, and compiled \" intelligence reports \" on members of the media. When considering the potential for violent actors mixed in with racial justice protests, it was an anything goes approach, the collectors said; in the runup to January 6 there was a \"pendulum swing\" in the other direction.\n\n\"They explained that they thought almost anything was reportable during the Portland protests, but they were hesitant or fearful to report information related to January 6 events,\" the report said. \"One collector said people were afraid to do their jobs because of the fear of being reprimanded by I&A leadership and concerns about congressional scrutiny. Another explained there was a 'chilling effect' on their approach to reporting following the summer of 2020.\"\n\nDespite I&A's failure to do its core job in one of the most important moments in the nearly two-decade existence of DHS, the inspector general's recommendations for correcting course were mild, focusing mostly on improved training and guidance. The inspector general did, however, gesture at the historical significance of the January 6 siege and the need for change, particularly in the event of another attempted government overthrow.\n\n\"I&A staff disagree about whether an intelligence product from I&A would have affected the outcome on January 6,\" the report said. \"Nonetheless, the issues we found during our review demonstrate the need for essential changes at I&A to ensure it is better equipped to respond to similar events in the future.\"\n\nUpdate: March 10, 2022, 1:47 p.m. ET This article has been updated to include a statement from the Department of Homeland Security that was received after publication.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Trump's Bad Week May Hasten His Ruin - or Simply Stoke His Hubris\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nA forthcoming subpoena and a cascade of disadvantageous court rulings made last week particularly trying for the ex-president.\n\nCommittee members watch video footage of former President Donald Trump during the last scheduled hearing of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on U.S. Capitol, in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 13, 2022. Photo: Shuran Huang/Getty Images Weeks like last week explain why Donald Trump is so eager to regain power. He wants to avoid accountability for his dangerous actions, which still threaten to turn America into a right-wing autocracy.\n\nCommittee members watch video footage of former President Donald Trump during the last scheduled hearing of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on U.S. Capitol, in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 13, 2022.\n\nLast week was a particularly trying one for Trump. He faced a blizzard of bad news, on multiple fronts, underscoring his exposure now that he is just a regular citizen and not president.\n\nThe highlight came on Thursday, when the House January 6 committee held its last public hearing before the midterm elections in November. Committee members made the case that Trump himself brought on the January 6 insurrection aimed at stopping Congress from certifying Joe Biden as president. The committee's vice chair, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., called Trump the \"central player\" of January 6.\n\nDuring the hearing, the committee revealed evidence that Trump incited the insurrection, even though he had privately acknowledged that he knew he'd lost. The committee aired testimony from a former Trump White House aide who recalled going into the Oval Office a week after the November, 2020 election, and finding Trump watching television. \" Can you believe I lost to this fucking guy? \" Trump asked the aide, referring to Biden.\n\nThe panel voted unanimously to subpoena Trump to testify. But that was just the beginning of Trump's very bad week.\n\nWhile the House hearing was underway on Thursday, the Supreme Court, which Trump had packed with three ultraconservative justices, and which he might thus have expected to be sympathetic to his cause, ruled against him. The court rejected a key Trump appeal of a lower-court ruling, part of his broader legal strategy to stop the Justice Department and the FBI from using the classified documents found during a court-authorized search of his Mar-a-Lago home in August. Trump wants the government to be forced to return the documents to him, which he apparently thinks would stop the Justice Department's ongoing criminal investigation in connection with the documents; the Supreme Court's terse order effectively rejected that notion.\n\nThe ruling followed press reports Wednesday that a Trump employee has told the FBI that, as government officials sought to retrieve thousands of documents that Trump was keeping at Mar-a-Lago, Trump personally ordered the employee to move the boxes containing the documents to his residence. Security camera footage of the employee moving the boxes appears to corroborate his story. Such testimony could be damning evidence in an obstruction of justice case against Trump.\n\nOther legal problems for Trump surfaced elsewhere last week. Marc Short, the chief of staff for former Vice President Mike Pence, testified Thursday before a federal grand jury in Washington in connection with the Justice Department's criminal investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Trump had sought to block Short's testimony, invoking executive privilege, but a judge rejected that claim . The ruling could ultimately make it easier for federal prosecutors to get other former top Trump administration officials to testify before the grand jury.\n\nThe former president's legal problems continued in New York, where Attorney General Letitia James asked a judge on Thursday to prevent Trump's company from selling or moving assets without court approval. James wants to stop Trump from trying to shield his money from the possible penalties he may face as a result of the lawsuit she filed in September against Trump, three of his children, and their family business. In that suit, James accused them of engaging in a prolonged fraud by falsifying the value of company assets. Her office has also referred the evidence gathered in her civil lawsuit to federal prosecutors for a criminal investigation.\n\nFinally, in yet another courtroom back in Washington, Trump's long-standing efforts to discredit the FBI's investigation into alleged collusion between his 2016 presidential campaign and the Kremlin took another damaging hit this week. While Trump was still president, then-U.S. Attorney General William Barr appointed John Durham as special prosecutor to investigate the origins of the FBI's Trump-Russia investigation. The appointment was Barr's gift to Trump; Durham's mission was to search for wrongdoing in the way the investigation was opened and conducted.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nBut while Durham has stayed on as a special prosecutor long after the end of the Trump administration, his attempts to prove that the Trump-Russia case was a politicized bad faith effort to undermine Trump have largely failed. He has had only two cases that have led to charges, and the first one fell apart in May, when Michael Sussmann, a lawyer with ties to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, was acquitted on charges of lying to the FBI for sharing a tip about Trump and Russia.\n\nThis week, his last remaining case, against FBI informant Igor Danchenko, has taken a series of damaging hits. Durham charged Danchenko with lying to the FBI about issues related to the Trump-Russia investigation, particularly the so-called Steele dossier, a collection of rumors and tips about possible ties between Trump and Russia compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele. Danchenko was a source for Steele, while also serving as an FBI informant.\n\nBut the FBI agents who Durham brought in to testify have undermined Durham's case and defended Danchenko. They have said that he was a valuable informant, and one testified that the Steele dossier had nothing to do with the opening of Crossfire Hurricane, the code name for the FBI's Trump-Russia investigation. On Friday, the judge in the case dismissed one of the charges brought against Danchenko, damaging Durham's prosecution even further.\n\nA few more weeks like this one might bankrupt Trump or land him in prison - or he might just officially announce that he's running for president in 2024.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Biggs Helped Plan January 6 Event, Lead Organizer Says\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nIn December, Ali Alexander claimed he and three House Republicans were organizing the rally that led to a storming of the Capitol on January 6.\n\nThe head of the House Freedom Caucus, Republican Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, helped plan the January 6 event that culminated in a storming of the Capitol , according to Ali Alexander, a lead organizer of the gathering. Alexander, a pro-Trump personality , was an early founder of the \"Stop the Steal\" movement and helped bring together various right-wing factions around a mass event on January 6, aimed to coincide with objections to the counting of Electoral College votes.\n\nAlexander made his claim in three separate livestreams in late December, adding that Reps. Paul Gosar of Arizona and Mo Brooks of Alabama were also involved. \"We're the four guys who came up with a January 6 event,\" Alexander said. On December 8, the Arizona Republican Party boosted Alexander, asking supporters if they were willing to give their lives in the fight over the results of the presidential election.\n\nHis claim is also buttressed by a fourth video from a December 19 rally at the Arizona State Capitol, at which Alexander played a video that Biggs had supplied. In the video, Biggs mentions Brooks as his ally in the fight. Gosar spoke in person at the event.\n\nHere is Ali handing Gosar the mic at a stop the steal event. Video posted to Gosar's Parler account Nov. 30. https://t.co/QtJJ4DtvJc pic.twitter.com/lg41ex3GC4\n\n- Jason Paladino (@jason_paladino) January 8, 2021\n\nBiggs's connection to Alexander was reported on Sunday by the Arizona Republic, which quoted his spokesperson, Daniel Stefanski, denying any connection to Alexander. \"Congressman Biggs is not aware of hearing of or meeting Mr. Alexander at any point - let alone working with him to organize some part of a planned protest,\" Stefanski said . \"He did not have any contact with protestors or rioters, nor did he ever encourage or foster the rally or protests.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nGosar did not respond to inquiries from The Intercept.  Alexander did not respond to a text or phone call; his voicemail was full. Alexander, who adopted a new name after pleading guilty to felony property theft in 2007 and felony credit card abuse in 2008, has been suspended from Twitter and other platforms for his role in organizing the January 6 event. As the Daily Beast reported, he has said he has been unfairly blamed for the violence on January 6, and has gone underground.\n\nBrooks, after the event, sought to legitimize political violence in a radio interview .In a statement to The Intercept following publication, Brooks's office denied the congressman incited violence, writing in part: \"Congressman Brooks has no recollection of ever communicating in any way with whoever Ali Alexander is. Congressman Brooks has not in any way, shape or form coordinated with Ali Alexander on the January 6th 'Save America' rally. Congressman Brooks spoke at the 'Save America' rally at the invitation of the White House (the invitation was extended the day before), not anyone else.\"\n\nAlexander's contemporaneous claims have taken on new relevance as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has floated the possibility of expelling members of Congress who are found to have been involved in the riot. \"Your views on the 25th Amendment, 14th Amendment Section 3 and impeachment are valued as we continue,\" she wrote to her colleagues over the weekend.\n\nSection 3 of the 14th Amendment, ratified after the Civil War, reads:\n\nNo person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.\n\nAlexander made his comments in a livestream posted December 28. Jason Paladino, an investigator with the Project on Government Oversight, archived the video from Alexander's now-suspended account and provided it to The Intercept. \"I was the person who came up with the January 6 idea with Congressman Gosar, Congressman Mo Brooks, and then Congressman Andy Biggs. We four schemed up of putting maximum pressure on Congress while they were voting so that who we couldn't lobby, we could change the hearts and the minds of Republicans who were in that body hearing our loud roar from outside,\" Alexander said in the livestream.\n\nin case he takes the video down, here's the relevant section pic.twitter.com/IYiqxeX6Ch\n\n- Jason Paladino (@jason_paladino) January 8, 2021\n\nAlexander reiterated the claim of collaborating with Biggs, Gosar, and Brooks a second time, using almost identical language in a December 29 livestream similarly provided by Paladino, who has tracked Alexander. \"I'm the guy who came up with the idea of January 6 when I was talking with Congressman Gosar, Congressman Andy Biggs, and Congressman Mo Brooks. So we're the four guys who came up with a January 6 event - #DoNotCertify - and it was to build momentum and pressure, and then on the day change hearts and minds of congresspeoples who weren't yet decided, or saw everyone outside and said, 'I can't be on the other side of that mob,'\" Alexander said a week before the event he predicted would bring more than a million people to Washington, D.C.\n\nOn December 21, Alexander made the same claim on a livestream . \"We're working closely with Congressman Mo Brooks, we're working closely with Congressman Andy Biggs, and closely with, obviously, Congressman Paul Gosar, my great friend,\" Alexander said. \"I believe that the president should do something brave, I think the vice president should do something brave. I believe that that's how we maintain the White House. ... It's a moral imperative to maintain the White House.\"\n\nThe Office of Congressional Ethics has seen some of the claims made by Alexander and is looking into the connection between him, Gosar, Brooks, and Biggs, according to two sources familiar with the situation. The OCE was unable to confirm or deny whether any specific investigations are underway, in accordance with the office's rules.\n\nAt the December 19 rally, two days before that claim, Alexander more clearly delineated the different roles Biggs and Gosar were playing. \"Congressman Gosar has been the spirit animal of this movement, and he's helped out where he could. He's offered to call donors. We actually had our first D.C. march because he called me and he said, 'You need to go to the Supreme Court.' I said, 'All right, my captain,'\" Alexander told the audience at the Arizona State Capitol.\n\n\"One of the other heroes has been Congressman Andy Biggs. Now, when the good doctor Paul, now a friend, has been concentrating on the movement, Andy Biggs has been running ahead of him and whipping votes in Congress. So he stayed in Washington, D.C.,\" Alexander noted, explaining that Biggs had \"sent us a video.\"\n\nIn the video, Biggs tells the audience:\n\nI wish I could be with you today. I pledge to you that I'm going to keep fighting for President Trump. And when it comes to January 6, I'll be right down there in the well of the House with my friend from Alabama, Mo Brooks, and dozens of others who will join me as we look at some of the elections around the country and we say, \"How do you explain that?\" And more than that, we're going to stand up for this president and for the voters of America. That's legal; not only is it legal, that's constitutional; not only is it constitutional, it's the moral thing to do. And we're going to keep fighting. And I implore you to keep fighting too.\n\nWhen asked why Biggs would record a video for someone he doesn't know, Stefanski told The Intercept: \"Rep. Gosar's team asked for the video, and he provided it.\"\n\nOn the day of the riot, Gosar used his official Twitter account to call for peaceful protest, urging Trump supporters \"not to get carried away\" so no one gets hurt, while spreading an entirely different message on Parler, a right-wing social media platform created in opposition to Twitter. \"Americans are upset,\" he wrote, sharing a photo of the rioters climbing the Capitol walls.\n\nRep. Paul Gosar post via Parler on January 6, 2021. Rep. Paul Gosar post via Parler on Jan. 6, 2021. Screengrab: Parler\n\nRep. Paul Gosar post via Parler on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nAt the December 19 rally, Alexander also thanked Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward. \"I want to thank Chairwoman Kelli Ward and the Arizona Republican Party. I work in seven states, and there is no party like the Arizona GOP Party, so let's thank Kelli Ward,\" Alexander said. Ward spoke at the rally.\n\n\"Let me tell you an open secret. The president watches these rallies, and he's watching you today,\" Alexander said, leading the crowd variously in \"Fight for Trump,\" \"1776,\" and \"Christ is King\" chants.\n\nThat day, Donald Trump posted to his since-suspended Twitter account: \"Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!\"\n\nGosar tagged Alexander on Twitter twice on January 6, and tagged him repeatedly in his posts throughout November and December.\n\nBiden should concede.   I want his concession on my desk tomorrow morning. Don't make me come over there. #StopTheSteaI2021 @ali pic.twitter.com/E2kuoWPUVy\n\n- Paul Gosar (@DrPaulGosar) January 6, 2021\n\nAs the mob broke into the Capitol, Gosar was in the middle of his speech objecting to the certification of Arizona's Electoral College votes. Once the Capitol was cleared, Gosar continued to object, as blood dried on the marble floors just steps away.\n\nUpdate: January 12, 2021 This story has been updated with a comment Rep. Mo Brooks's office sent after publication. The full statement reads: \"Congressman Brooks has no recollection of ever communicating in any way with whoever Ali Alexander is. Congressman Brooks has not in any way, shape or form coordinated with Ali Alexander on the January 6th 'Save America' rally. Congressman Brooks spoke at the 'Save America' rally at the invitation of the White House (the invitation was extended the day before), not anyone else. Congressman Brooks never incited violence, as has been egregiously and falsely claimed by his political opponents and the Fake News Media who distort Congressman Brooks' remarks, take them out of context, and thereby sully Congressman Brooks' reputation for political advantage. As the words in the speech unambiguously reflect (see the very preceding sentence to the 'take name' sentence), Congressman Brooks gave his 'take names' remarks in the context of winning elections in 2022 and 2024 and sought to motivate despondent Republicans into seeking change at the ballot box in 2022 and 2024. The only action Congressman Brooks asked the rally attendees to undertake at the Capitol was to say the words 'USA.' Period.'\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Forever Warrior\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nTrump's Last Defense Secretary Has Regrets - but Not About Jan. 6\n\nWhen bureaucrats get big promotions, they tend to receive congratulations from their friends, but after Christopher Miller landed the biggest job of his life, his wife and some of his colleagues were horrified.\n\nIt was November 9, 2020, the day President Donald Trump fired his secretary of defense, Mark Esper. It was widely assumed that Trump would install an acolyte who would do whatever was needed to help the defeated president stay in power. Esper, just days before, had confided to a journalist, \"Who's going to come in behind me? It's going to be a real yes man. And then God help us.\"\n\nTrump appointed Miller, an unknown whose rise was so far-fetched that the secretary of the Army, Ryan McCarthy, had to Google his new boss to figure out who he was. Wikipedia was useless because at the time, Miller didn't merit an entry.\n\nAfter retiring from the Army as a Special Forces colonel in 2014, Miller moved from one mid-level job to another in Washington, D.C., a nobody in a city of somebodies. Things began to pick up after Trump's election, and by August 2020, he was promoted to director of the National Counterterrorism Center. Just three months later, he was summoned to the Oval Office and put in charge of the world's most powerful military.\n\n\"I'm at work on a Monday morning, and the phone rings, and they're like, 'Get your ass down here,'\" Miller said in an interview, referring to the moment he was called to the White House. \"I was like, 'Oh, shit.'\"\n\nMiller knew his name was circulating in the White House, but the announcement came abruptly and was not greeted with warmth by his life partner. \"Yeah, my wife is like, 'The only thing we have is our name and you're ruining it,'\" Miller recalled. \"She's like, 'You're an idiot. I think this is the stupidest thing that's ever happened.' And I'm like, 'Yes dear, I know that.'\"\n\nActing Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller and his wife Kathryn make prerecorded remarks for the Military Spouse Employment Partnership New Partner Induction Ceremony at the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., on Dec. 4, 2020.\n\nAs improbable Washington stories go, Miller's blink-and-it's-over journey from Beltway nothingness to what his detractors regard as a semi-witting participant in a plot to overthrow the constitutional order - well, it's quite something. Miller was in charge of the Pentagon on January 6, 2021, and is accused of delaying the deployment of National Guard troops so the mob that beat its way into the Capitol might succeed in creating more than a pause in the Senate's count of Electoral College votes. At a combative oversight hearing a few months later, Democratic members of Congress derided Miller as \"AWOL,\" \"disgusting,\" and \"ridiculous,\" to which he responded, \"Thank you for your thoughts.\"\n\nAs is customary, Miller has written a memoir of his extremely brief time in power, \" Soldier Secretary ,\" published last month by Center Street, whose other authors include Newt Gingrich and Betsy DeVos. It's a typical Washington book in many ways - revealing at times, suspect at others. For instance, Miller describes House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as suffering a \"total nuclear meltdown\" during a phone call with him on January 6, but there is no evidence for that characterization. His book sticks closely to the Beltway norm of having a principal character who displays calmness and reason while others go nuts; the principal character is the author.\n\nHis rhetoric is a profane blend of MAGA and Noam Chomsky.\n\nBut just as Miller's journey to the top is atypical, so too is his obscenity-flecked memoir, because the retired soldier emerges as a scorched-earth critic of the institution he served for more than three decades and presided over for 73 days. He wants to fire most of the generals at the Pentagon, slash defense spending by half, shut down the military academies, break up the military-industrial complex, and he describes the invasion of Iraq as an unjust war based on lies. His rhetoric is a profane blend of MAGA and Noam Chomsky.\n\n\"Today, there are virtually no brakes on the American war machine,\" Miller writes. \"Military leaders are always predisposed to see war as a solution, because when you're a hammer, all the world's a nail. The establishments of both major political parties are overwhelmingly dominated by interventionists and internationalists who believe that America can and should police the world. Even the press - once so skeptical of war during the Vietnam era - is today little more than a brood of bloodthirsty vampires cheering on American missile strikes and urging greater involvement in conflicts America has no business fighting.\"\n\nI was as surprised as everyone else when I heard the news about Miller's appointment, but it's not because I had to Google him. I knew who he was. We first met in Afghanistan in 2001, when he was a leader of the Special Forces unit that chased the Taliban out of their final stronghold, and I was reporting on that for the New York Times Magazine. I got to know him and wrote an article in 2002 about his Afghan combat and his preparations for the Iraq invasion the following year. With the publication of his memoir, Miller is now making the media rounds, so we got together again.\n\nAfter more than two decades of the forever wars, Miller is pissed off in the way a lot of former soldiers are pissed off - and, I have to say, in the way a lot of former war reporters are pissed off too. It's hard to have been a participant in those calamities and not feel betrayed in some fashion, as pundits attempt to whitewash the disaster and promotions are announced for officials who masterminded it. Miller's evolution from Special Forces operator to Trump Cabinet member is a forever wars parable that helps us understand the moral injury festering in our political corpus.

It was December 2001, he was a 36-year-old major in the 3rd Battalion of the 5th Special Forces Group, and this was his first combat deployment.\n\nI spotted Miller at the entrance to a compound on the outskirts of the city. Until a few days earlier, it had been the residence of Mullah Mohammed Omar, the spiritual leader of the Taliban who, after Osama bin Laden, was the most hunted man in the country. The scene was surreal because the compound was now the temporary home of Hamid Karzai, the soon-to-be leader of Afghanistan, whose security was guaranteed by Miller's soldiers. These just-arrived Americans were dressed half in camouflage, half in fleece jackets, and they sported the types of accessories that ordinary GIs were prohibited from having, such as beards and long hair. Mixed among them were Afghan fighters with AK-47s who had fought with the Taliban not long ago but switched loyalties, which is an accepted practice in Afghanistan when your team is losing.\n\nI struck up a conversation with Miller, a tall officer with bushy red hair and a wicked-looking assault weapon slung over his shoulder. Most of his soldiers were silent and grim - they weren't happy about the journalists who had shown up - but Miller, who recognized my name because he had read my memoir on the Bosnian war, was friendly and answered a few questions. I asked if he had been to Bosnia, and he gave me a vague special operator laugh and said, \"I've been everywhere, man.\" As it turned out, he'd worked undercover in Bosnia in the late 1990s alongside CIA operatives tracking Serb war criminals.\n\nI stayed in Kandahar for a while longer, as did Miller. We were both spending time around the city's U.S.-installed warlord, Gul Agha Shirzai , whom Miller describes in his book as \"a self-serving piece of shit,\" which is totally accurate. After we both returned to America, I got Miller to invite me to spend a few days at his battalion's headquarters at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. We talked for hours about what happened in Afghanistan, about the soldiers he lost, about the Al Qaeda fighters he helped kill, and about the next war on the horizon (this was a year before the illegal invasion of Iraq). Miller was as friendly and transparent as I could hope for from a Special Forces officer. His favorite word was \"knucklehead,\" which he sometimes used to describe himself .\n\nMiller didn't know it at the time, but he was at the cusp of a profound disenchantment with the country's military and political leaders, a disillusionment he shared with a lot of soldiers, thanks to the deceptions and errors embedded in the wars they fought. Miller is exceptional only in his Cabinet-level end point. While it's important to remember that the vast bulk of these veterans are law-abiding, a small but influential group have been radicalized to violence rather than government service.\n\nRelated Another Official Dismissed at the Pentagon as Trump Continues Unusual Shake-Up\n\nVeterans are one of the key subjects in historian Kathleen Belew's lauded book about right-wing extremism, titled \" Bring the War Home .\" American history teaches us a consistent lesson: There will almost always be blowback at home from wars fought elsewhere. Of 968 people indicted after the storming of the Capitol, 131 have military backgrounds, according to the Program on Extremism at George Washington University. Due to the respect military service generates among civilians in right-wing movements, veterans composed a disproportionately large number of the ringleaders on January 6, including Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes , who was convicted of seditious conspiracy last year.\n\nSoon after we met in 2001, Miller noticed omens of dysfunction in the American war machine. It began, he wrote in his book, with a visit to the airport that U.S. Marines seized outside Kandahar a few days after the Special Forces sped into town in their four-wheel-drive vehicles. Miller and one of his sergeants had to pick up supplies at the airport, and they saw Marines putting up a big tent. The sergeant told Miller, \"Sir, it's time for us to get the fuck out of here.\" Miller asked why, and the sergeant replied, \"They're building the PX. It's time for the Green Berets to leave.\"\n\n\"We should have kept it to about 500 people, just let that be the special operations theater.\"\n\nHe meant the military was settling in for the long haul. Sprawling bases would be constructed with Burger King and Pizza Hut outlets, staffed by workers flown in from Nepal, Kenya, and other countries. There would be more than 100,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan at the peak of President Barack Obama's surge, and hundreds of billions of dollars spent in the country, yielding decades of full employment for generals and executives in the weapons industry. Miller had a front-row seat at this carnival. \"We should have kept it to about 500 people, just let that be the special operations theater,\" he told me. In other words, quickly arrange a power-sharing deal between Karzai and the Taliban rather than try to eliminate the Taliban and leave a small number of special operators to find and kill Osama bin Laden and the remnants of Al Qaeda.\n\nI don't think Miller sensed all this when he saw that tent going up; nobody knew what was going to happen that early in the game. And remember, you can't trust Beltway memoirs; they're a racket of myth construction. But locating the exact moment of Miller's awareness is less important than the fact he eventually recognized, as most of us did, a historic error that he blamed on his leadership. \"As soon as we went conventional, that war was lost,\" Miller said. \"That's what I'll take to my grave. As soon as we brought in the Army generals and all their big ideas - war was over at that point.\"\n\nChristopher Miller in old photos from his time in Afghanistan, left, and Iraq, right. Photos: Alyssa Schukar for The Intercept\n\nLike many veterans, Miller participated in not just the Afghanistan disaster, but also the one in Iraq. There he had an even stronger sense of betrayal.\n\nAs the invasion neared, Miller was responsible for operational planning for his Special Forces battalion, and he put together a blueprint for seizing an airfield southwest of Baghdad as an advance position for the capture of Iraq's capital. He thought the buildup was a bluff to coerce Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein into giving up the weapons of mass destruction that the Bush administration insisted he possessed (though he did not). In Miller's telling, it wasn't until he was geared up in an MH-53 helicopter at night, heading deep into Iraq, that he knew it was on. The future acting defense secretary turned to a soldier next to him and said, \"We're really doing this. I can't believe we're fucking doing this.\" According to Miller, the soldier replied, \"Me neither.\"\n\nMiller and I were sitting in a café at the public library in Westport, Connecticut - he lives in northern Virginia and was visiting this wealthy suburb for a fundraiser for a play about the Special Forces. He was dressed in khaki pants and a casual shirt, and his shag of red hair from 20 years ago was gone; it had thinned out to a distinguished-looking silver. He is 57 years old now and looks no different from any other close-to-senior citizen killing time at a library (same goes for me, I should confess). He sipped his coffee and continued, \"Invading a sovereign country is a big deal, you know. We typically don't do that except in extenuating circumstances. I thought it was all coercive diplomacy. Then when it goes down, you're like, 'Damn.'\" As he writes in his book, \"I had been an active participant in an unjust war. We invaded a sovereign nation, killed and maimed a lot of Iraqis and lost some of the greatest American patriots to ever live - all for a god-damned lie.\"\n\nIf your nation calls on you to send your comrades to their deaths in battle, you expect it will be for a good reason; soldiers have a lot more at stake than Beltway hawks for whom a bad day consists of getting bumped from their hit on CNN or Fox. That's why Miller describes himself as \"white-hot\" angry toward the leaders who lied or dissembled and suffered no consequences; many have profited in retirement, thanks to amply compensated speaking gigs and board seats . \"You can mess up a piece of paperwork and get run out of the Army,\" Miller told me. \"But you can lose a damn war and nobody is held accountable.\"\n\nIf that line came from a pundit, it would be a platitude. But Miller described to me the case of a soldier he knew well who was forced out of the military for not having the paperwork for a machine gun he left in Afghanistan for troops replacing his unit. The soldier was trying to help other soldiers who didn't have all the weapons they needed. It didn't matter; he was gone, and Miller couldn't stop it.\n\nMiller trembled a bit as he narrated this story. Maybe he was on the verge of tears; I couldn't be sure. There's a saying in journalism that if your mother says she loves you, check it out. Never trust a source, especially one selling a book and an image of himself. As these things always are, our conversation was a bit of a performance by each of us, both trying to get out of the other as much as we could. Miller's intentions were hard to pin down, but his anger was not. I had seen some of what he had seen.\n\nIn 2014, after three decades in the Army and more than a dozen deployments to Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kuwait, Bosnia, and elsewhere, Miller retired. He had a lot of baggage to deal with. As he writes, \"For years I had been cramming unpleasant memories into a box and storing them on a shelf deep in the recesses of my psyche, knowing that someday I'd have to unpack each one.\"\n\nHe set a goal: Complete a marathon in less than three hours. His long practice runs of 15-25 miles were, as he put it, therapy sessions to work through the wreckage of the wars he fought and \"a simmering sense of betrayal that every veteran today must feel - the recognition that so many sacrifices were ultimately made in the service of a lie, as in Iraq, or to further a delusion.\" After running that marathon, he entered a 50-mile race on the Appalachian Trail and finished in less than eight hours, ranking second in his age group .\n\nThere were no epiphanies at the end. Physical exhaustion would not eliminate his bitterness about Iraq and Afghanistan. \"It still makes my blood boil,\" he writes, \"and it probably will until the day I die.\"\n\nActing Defense Secretary Christopher Miller, center left, walks with Lt. Gen. John Deedrick after arriving to Kabul, Afghanistan, on Dec. 22, 2020.\n\nWhile Miller describes himself as falling \"ass-backwards\" into the job of acting secretary of defense, you don't rise to the top by mistake in Washington, and people who run ultramarathons don't tend to be lily pads just floating along. Miller has a gosh-darn way of talking, and even his detractors describe him as affable, but he's a special operator, and you shouldn't forget that. After retiring from the military, he made a series of canny moves to join the National Security Council at the White House and pair up with a key figure in Trump's orbit, Kash Patel.\n\nPatel became Washington famous in the first years of the Trump era because, as an aide to Rep. Devin Nunes, he played a behind-the-scenes role in the GOP effort to undermine special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. In early 2019, Patel was rewarded with a job on the NSC, reportedly on direct orders from Trump. Miller had joined the NSC the previous year as senior director for counterterrorism and transnational threats, and Patel became his deputy. Miller claims that initially, he was wary.\n\n\"I got online and Wikipedia'd him, and I'm like, 'Oh my God, this is the crazy guy,\" he told me with a laugh.\n\nWhat happened next could be a how-to guide for Beltway strivers.\n\n\"I just had convening authority,\" Miller recalled of his time at the NSC. \"I'm like, 'That's bullshit.' So I went to the Pentagon and took a job as a political appointee because I needed to have money and people.\"\n\nIt was early 2020 when he became deputy assistant secretary of defense for special operations and combating terrorism. This gave him greater influence over the hunt for ISIS and Al Qaeda terrorists, which had been his obsession at the NSC. Yet it wasn't enough. As Miller describes it, \"Now I had people, now I had money, but still not being very successful. ... I still need more juice.\"\n\nKash Patel, former chief of staff to then-Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller, departs from a deposition meeting on Capitol Hill with the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack, on Dec. 9, 2021, in Washington, D.C.\n\nOne of his friends in the administration made a suggestion: Why don't you shoot for a Senate-confirmed position?\n\n\"I was like, 'That gives me more wasta , right?'\" Miller said, using an Arabic word for clout. \"And I'm like, 'Shit yeah.'\"\n\nTrump nominated him to head the National Counterterrorism Center, and on August 6, the Senate confirmed him in a unanimous voice vote.\n\n\"So now I've got more fucking throw weight,\" Miller continued. \"Patel's working in the National Security Council with the president. We're starting to grind down the resistors.\" The resistance, he said, was against a heightened effort he and Patel advocated to finish off the remaining leaders of Al Qaeda and rescue a handful of remaining American hostages.\n\nMiller was invited for a talk with Johnny McEntee, the head of the White House Presidential Personnel Office. In the twilight of the Trump era, McEntee was one of the president's most loyal confidantes; though just 29 years old at the time, he was described, in a magazine article , as the \"deputy president.\" Miller knew through the grapevine that he might be in line for Esper's job because the administration had just a few Senate-confirmed officials with national security credentials. McEntee was sizing him up.\n\n\"I'm like, 'Oh shit,' because I didn't want the job,\" Miller told me.\n\nThis was part of Miller's \"ass-backwards\" shtick. Why grind as hard as he did to stop short of the biggest prize of all? I pushed back, and he acknowledged that while the job might \"suck really, really badly,\" it could be worthwhile even if Trump lost the election. \"I had a work list,\" Miller said. \"I thought, 'I can get a lot of shit done.'\" His main tasks, he told me, included stabilizing the Pentagon after Esper's ouster; withdrawing the remaining U.S. forces from Iraq, Afghanistan, and Somalia; and elevating special operations forces in the Department of Defense's hierarchy.\n\nJust before the election, he heard the shuffle was imminent.\n\n\"The word comes down: They're getting rid of Esper, win or lose,\" Miller said. \"It's payback time.\"\n\nOn Monday morning, six days after Trump lost the election, Miller's phone rang. Come to the White House, now.\n\nPictured, from left, Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller, Vice Adm. Sean Buck, President Donald Trump, Lt. Gen. Darryl Williams, and Chair of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Mark Milley before the start of a game at Michie Stadium on Dec. 12, 2020, in West Point, N.Y.\n\nMiller suffered a literal misstep his first day on the job: Walking into the Pentagon, he tripped and nearly fell on the steps in front of the mammoth building. That prompted laughs online , but the bigger issue was the entourage that surrounded him as he took charge of the nearly 3 million soldiers and civilians in the Department of Defense.\n\nHe was accompanied by a murderer's row of Trump loyalists. Patel was his chief of staff. Ezra Cohen, a controversial analyst, got a top intelligence post. Douglas Macgregor, a Fox News pundit, became a special assistant. Anthony Tata, a retired general who called Obama a \"terrorist leader,\" was appointed policy chief. Gen. Mark Milley, chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was reportedly so alarmed that he told Patel and Cohen, \"Life looks really shitty from behind bars. ... And if you guys do anything that's illegal, I don't mind having you in prison.\"\n\nMiller, when I asked about his advisers, waved off the concerns and said, \"Complete misappreciation of those people.\"\n\nCutting the U.S. footprint overseas was one of his top priorities, the residue of his long journey through the forever wars. It was a big part of his support for Trump, who was far more critical of those wars than most politicians. In the 2016 primaries, Trump distanced himself from other Republicans by accusing the George W. Bush administration of manufacturing evidence to justify the Iraq invasion. \"They lied,\" Trump declared at a debate in South Carolina, drawing boos from the Republican audience. \"They said there were weapons of mass destruction. There were none, and they knew there were none.\" This was an occasion on which Trump's political interests - trying to embarrass front-runner Jeb Bush, the brother of the former president - aligned with something that was actually true.\n\nOnce he got to the White House, though, Trump didn't make a lot of changes. Since 9/11, the generals who oversaw America's wars had resisted when civilian leaders said it was time to scale back. And Trump actually quickened the tempo of some military operations by offering greater support to the disastrous Saudi-led war in Yemen and taking an especially hawkish position on Iran. But he was stymied on Iraq and Afghanistan, not just by active-duty generals at the Pentagon, but also by the retired ones he appointed to such key posts as national security adviser, chief of staff, and secretary of defense. They were all gone by the final act of his presidency.\n\nBy the time Miller left the Pentagon when President Joe Biden was sworn in, U.S. forces in Afghanistan and Iraq had been cut to 2,500 troops in each country (from about 4,000 in Afghanistan and 3,000 in Iraq). The approximately 700 soldiers based in Somalia were withdrawn. But that would not be Miller's most memorable legacy.\n\nIt was mid-afternoon on January 6, 2021. A pro-Trump mob had bashed its way through police barricades and invaded the Capitol . Ashli Babbitt had been shot dead. The rioters who occupied the Senate chamber included a half-naked shaman wearing a horned helmet and carrying a spear. Where was the National Guard?\n\nMiller was the one to know, which is why he was on the phone with Nancy Pelosi at 3:44 p.m.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\n\"I was sitting at my desk in the Pentagon holding a phone six inches away from my ear, trying my best to make sense of the incoherent shrieking blasting out of the receiver,\" he writes on the first page of his book. \"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was on the line, and she was in a state of total nuclear meltdown. To be fair, the other members of congressional leadership on the call weren't exactly composed either. Every time Pelosi paused to catch her breath, Senator Mitch McConnell, Senator Chuck Schumer, and Congressman Steny Hoyer took turns hyperventilating into the phone.\"\n\nThat passage in Miller's five-page introduction got a bit of attention on social media when it was first excerpted in January, and not all of it was positive. Wonkette described Miller's account as \"verifiably false\" and pointed its readers to a video released by the January 6 committee showing Pelosi and other congressional leaders speaking in urgent but calm voices with Miller. They asked him to send troops immediately and demanded to know why it was taking so long. Pelosi is intense but not melting down; McConnell, Schumer, and Hoyer are not hyperventilating.\n\nWhen I met Miller in Westport, I asked if he was aware of this discrepancy. He became slightly agitated.\n\n\"The one they show is a different call,\" he replied. \"The one used [by] the January 6 committee is a later phone call where they're much calmer. The first call was frantic. Like literally losing their shit. ... So that's bullshit, dude.\"\n\nHe told me to look into it.\n\nThe January 6 committee released partial footage of two calls that show Pelosi speaking with Miller. The first call, according to the time stamp on the committee's video , occurred at 3 p.m. The sequence begins with Pelosi sitting near Schumer, who is holding a cellphone and saying, \"I'm going to call up the effing secretary of DOD.\" The next shot shows Schumer, Pelosi, and Hoyer huddled around the phone talking with Miller in measured voices; McConnell is not shown in this clip. The second call for which the committee released some footage is the one Wonkette pointed to. The participants in this second call are the ones mentioned by Miller in his book: McConnell is in this footage, along with Pelosi, Schumer, and Hoyer. There are no meltdowns. The committee's time stamp for this call is 3:46 p.m., which is a nearly exact match for the time Miller provides in his book: 3:44 p.m.\n\nWhat this means is that the phone call Miller described in his book almost certainly is the one Wonkette pointed to and did not occur the way Miller describes, unless there is an incriminating portion of the video we have not seen, which is what Miller claims. Yet that seems unlikely because there is no mention, in the multitude of testimonies and articles about that day, of Pelosi melting down at any moment. And that makes another passage in Miller's introduction problematic too.\n\n\"I had never seen anyone - not even the greenest, pimple-faced 19-year-old Army private - panic like our nation's elder statesmen did on January 6 and in the months that followed,\" Miller wrote. \"For the American people, and for our enemies watching overseas, the events of that day undeniably laid bare the true character of our ruling class. Here were the most powerful men and women in the world - the leaders of the legislative branch of the mightiest nation in history - cowering like frightened children for all the world to see.\"\n\nExcept they weren't cowering. They had been evacuated by security guards to Fort McNair because a mob of thousands had broken into the Capitol screaming \"Where's Nancy?\" and \"Hang Pence!\" Miller makes no mention in his book of the speech Trump delivered on January 6 that encouraged his followers to march on the Capitol. There is no mention of the fact that while Pelosi and others, including Vice President Mike Pence, urged Miller to send troops, Trump did not; the commander in chief did not speak with his defense secretary that day. Although Miller has elsewhere gently described Trump's speech as not helping matters, his book mocks the targets of the crime rather than criticizing the person who inspired and abetted it.\n\n\"Prior to that very moment, the Speaker and her Democrat colleagues had spent months decrying the use of National Guard troops to quell left-wing riots following the death of George Floyd that caused countless deaths and billions of dollars in property damage nationwide,\" he writes. \"But as soon as it was her ass on the line, Pelosi had been miraculously born again as a passionate, if less than altruistic, champion of law and order.\"\n\nThis is unbalanced because the violence in the summer of 2020 - on the margins of nationwide protests that were overwhelmingly peaceful - did not endanger the transfer of power from a defeated president to his duly elected successor. The buildings that were attacked were not the seat of national government. And there weren't \"countless deaths\" - there were about 25 , including two men killed by far-right vigilante Kyle Rittenhouse in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The rhetoric in Miller's book has the aroma of reheated spots from Fox News.\n\nThe contours of his political anger comes into clearer focus after reading a passage from his chapter on Iraq. He recalled his pride in the swift capture of Baghdad, but as he flew home in a C-17 aircraft, he couldn't fully enjoy the triumph, couldn't really unwind. \"The further we got from the war zone, the more my stress turned into burning white-hot anger,\" he wrote. He returned to an empty house in North Carolina - his family was in Massachusetts for the July 4 holiday - so he worked out, drank some beer, and read a lot. It didn't help much. There was, as he put it, \"a rage building inside me\" that was directed at two groups. The first was the group he regards as the instigators, \"the neoconservatives who bullied us into an unjust and unwinnable war.\" The second was Congress \"for abrogating its constitutional duties regarding the declaring, funding, and overseeing of our nation's wars.\"\n\nMiller's homecoming was reenacted by a generation of bitter soldiers, aid workers, and journalists. His list of culprits is a good one, though I would add the names of President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney to the top, because they issued the orders that destroyed Iraq. Their omission from Miller's list, combined with his rant against Pelosi, reveals how his outrage follows a strange path, focusing on a political party that, while energetically backing the wars, was not the one that started them. And Democrats did not foment the storming of the Capitol either.\n\nMiller's anger is real, but his target is poorly chosen, which is the story of America after 9/11.\n\nA video of Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on a phone call with Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller, is played during a hearing by the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack, in Washington, D.C. on October 13, 2022.\n\nJust as the Watergate scandal had its 18-minute gap , there's a now-infamous gap of more than four hours between the storming of the Capitol and the arrival of National Guard troops around 5:30 p.m. Miller is at the center of the controversy because the singular status of the District of Columbia means the Pentagon controls its National Guard - and Miller was the Pentagon boss on January 6.\n\nThe January 6 committee, which deposed Miller and other military and police officials, said in its 814-page final report that it \"found no evidence that the Department of Defense intentionally delayed deployment of the National Guard.\" The committee blamed the delay on \"a likely miscommunication\" between multiple layers of civilian and military officials. The abundant depositions reveal that the committee was being extremely kind when it chose the word \"miscommunication.\" Soldiers have a special word to describe what seems to have happened at the Pentagon: a clusterfuck.\n\nAt 1:49 p.m., as pro-Trump demonstrators beat their way past police lines, the head of the U.S. Capitol Police force called the commander of the D.C. National Guard, Gen. William Walker, and notified him there was a \"dire emergency\" and troops were needed immediately. Walker alerted the Pentagon, and a video conference convened at 2:22 p.m. among generals and civilian officials, though not Miller. Walker told the January 6 committee that generals at the Pentagon \"started talking about they didn't have the authority, wouldn't be their best military advice or guidance to suggest to the Secretary that we have uniformed presence at the Capitol. ... They were concerned about how it would look, the optics.\"\n\nThe \"optics\" refers to the Pentagon being sharply criticized after National Guard soldiers helped suppress Black Lives Matters protests in the capital on June 1, 2020. Lafayette Square, just outside the White House, was violently cleared in a controversial operation that even involved military helicopters flying low at night to disperse protesters. At one point, Trump triumphantly emerged from the White House with a retinue that included Defense Secretary Esper and Milley; later, both men apologized for allowing themselves to be connected to the crackdown. After that debacle, the Pentagon was reluctant to involve troops in any crowd control in the capital, and local leaders made clear that they opposed it too; there was no appetite to amass troops that Trump might misuse.\n\nYet the storming of the Capitol, taking law enforcement by surprise, created an emergency that justified using the Guard. As Walker told the committee, \"I just couldn't believe nobody was saying, 'Hey, go.'\" Walker testified that he admonished the generals and officials on the 2:22 p.m. call: \"Aren't you watching the news? Can't you see what's going on? We need to get there.\"\n\nArmy Secretary Ryan McCarthy - who two months earlier had to Google Miller's name to figure out who he was - testified that he joined the 2:22 p.m. call and then ran a quarter mile through Pentagon hallways to Miller's office, arriving there out of breath (\"I'm a middle-aged man now,\" he told the committee. \"I was in a suit and leather shoes.\"). At 3:04 p.m., Miller gave a verbal order for the mobilization of the D.C. Guard. It was an hour-and-a-quarter since the Capitol Police's first plea for help, but it would take more than two additional hours for the troops to get there. This is the delay Miller has been particularly blamed for, though it does not appear to have been his fault alone.\n\nMiller regarded his 3:04 p.m. order as final; Walker and his direct civilian commander, McCarthy, now had a green light to move troops to the Capitol, Miller testified . Some troops were already prepared to go there, according to the committee report. A ground officer, Col. Craig Hunter, was ready to move with a quick reaction force of 40 soldiers and about 95 others who were mostly at traffic control points in the area. Despite Miller's 3:04 p.m. order, it would be hours before Hunter would be told to roll. Members of the Washington D.C.

National Guard arrive to keep rioters away from the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe committee's report includes a 45-page appendix that's a catalogue of recriminations among Walker, McCarthy, Miller, and others. Their depositions offer conflicting accounts of what was said in chaotic conversations that day, and they even disagree about whether certain conversations took place. They also express contrary views on who had the authority to issue orders, precisely what orders were needed, and what some orders even meant. The depositions were taken under oath, so despite their contradictions, they are the best record we have about what happened and far more reliable than most of the books and interviews that some of the principals have produced.\n\nMcCarthy prioritized the time-consuming task of drawing up an operational plan that doesn't appear to have been necessary because Hunter's troops were already equipped for riot control and knew what to do and where to go. McCarthy also spent a lot of time talking on the phone to politicians and journalists, as well as joining a press conference. As he told the committee, \"So it went into the next 25 minutes of literally standing there, people handing me telephones, whether it was the media or it was Congress. And I had to explain to all of them, 'No, we're coming, we're coming, we're coming.' So that chewed up a great deal of time.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Walker said he couldn't reach McCarthy to find out whether he had permission to send his troops to the Capitol. Testifying on April 21, 2022, Walker said he was never called by McCarthy and was unable to contact him directly because the work number he had for McCarthy didn't function: An automated message said, \"This phone is out of service.\" One of his officers happened to have McCarthy's private cellphone number, but there was no answer on it. \"The story we were told is that he is running through the Pentagon looking for the secretary of defense,\" Walker testified. \"That's why he wasn't answering his phone.\" (McCarthy insisted in his testimony that they had talked.)\n\nThe delay wasn't due to faulty telecommunications alone. McCarthy told the committee that he believed he needed another order from Miller, beyond the one issued at 3:04 p.m., before he could tell Walker to move. Miller issued an additional order at 4:32 p.m., but McCarthy failed to immediately inform Walker; the order didn't reach the National Guard commander until 5:09 p.m., when a four-star general happened to notice Walker in a conference room and said, \"Hey, we have a green light, you're approved to go.\" By the time Walker's troops arrived at the Capitol, the fighting was over, and they were asked to watch over rioters already arrested by the bloodied police.\n\nToward the end of his testimony to the January 6 committee, Miller was asked why Walker had not scrambled his troops sooner. \"Why didn't he launch them?\" Miller replied. \"I'd love to know. That's a question I was hoping you'd find out. ... Beats me.\"\n\nChristopher Miller poses for a portrait in between media interviews at his home office on Tuesday, February 7, 2023. His book \"Soldier Secretary\" was released that day.\n\nOne of the people I interviewed for this story was Paul Yingling, who, in 2007, became famous in military circles for writing an article titled \" A Failure in Generalship .\" Yingling was serving as an Army officer at the time and broke the fourth wall of martial protocol by calling out his wartime commanders. In a line that's been quoted many times since - Miller repeated a variation of it to me - Yingling wrote, \"As matters stand now, a private who loses a rifle suffers far greater consequences than a general who loses a war.\"\n\nYingling wasn't particularly flattered by Miller's embrace of his idea. Miller is right about the generals, Yingling said, but \"much of the criticism he's made has been made elsewhere earlier and better. ... It's not original work.\" That wasn't Yingling's main beef with Miller; he was incensed over what he regards as a fellow officer's involvement in an effort to overturn a presidential election. \"I don't think he is aware of his role to this day,\" Yingling said. \"He has spun a narrative for himself that justifies his actions on J6. He was in over his head in a political world that to this day he doesn't understand.\"\n\nYingling mentioned the story of Caligula appointing his horse as a consul in ancient Rome. That myth goes to the strategy of discrediting and disempowering institutions by filling them with incompetent leaders (or beloved equines). And Yingling is certainly right that Trump appointed D-list characters to sensitive positions: the internet troll Richard Grenell as acting director of national intelligence, for instance, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as a senior White House adviser.\n\nIt's also true that the January 6 clusterfuck seems to have had less to do with malignant decisions by Miller than with a parade of errors by officials under his command. As acting secretary of defense, he failed to ensure that his orders at 3:04 p.m. and again at 4:32 p.m. were carried out with greater speed, though Miller says he didn't want to micromanage his subordinates. There may have been an element of subconscious bias, too.\n\n\"I'm African American,\" Walker told the committee. \"Child of the '60s. I think it would have been a vastly different response if those were African Americans trying to breach the Capitol.\"\n\nYet I hesitate to ignite the tinder around Miller. If we drop a match at his feet and walk away with a sense of satisfaction about the justice we think we've delivered, we have not changed or even recognized the political culture that gave us the forever wars and everything that flowed from them, including January 6. At some point in the future, we'll just have more of what we've already endured, and perhaps it will be a variant of militarism and racism that's more potent still.\n\nAt some point in the future, we'll just have more of what we've already endured, and perhaps it will be a variant of militarism and racism that's more potent still.\n\nLook, for instance, at who Joe Biden chose to fill the seat kept warm by Miller: Lloyd Austin, a retired general who earned millions of dollars as a board member of defense contractors Raytheon Technologies and Booz Allen Hamilton. Look at Esper, who preceded Miller: He was a lobbyist for Raytheon Technologies, earning more than $1.5 million in salary and bonuses. Look at who came before Esper: Jim Mattis, who was on the board of General Dynamics (as well as Theranos, the fraudulent blood-testing firm). And take a moment to read a few pages of Craig Whitlock's \" The Afghanistan Papers ,\" which uses government documents to reveal a generation of lies from America's top generals and officials. The professional interests of these people have been closely connected to exorbitant defense spending and \"overseas contingency operations\" that account for the U.S. devoting more money to its military than the next nine countries combined - all while school teachers drive Ubers at night and people in Mississippi have to drink bottled water because the municipal system has collapsed.\n\nWhere are their bonfires?\n\nA year ago, before Biden's State of the Union address, Miller joined a press conference outside the Capitol that was organized by the GOP's far-right Freedom Caucus and featured speakers against mask and vaccine mandates. The last to talk, Miller riffed for seven minutes, saying nothing about Covid-19 and focusing on Afghanistan instead. As he recalled being on a mountainside where an errant American bomb killed nearly two dozen U.S. and Afghan soldiers, a woman behind him shifted with visible unease as he angrily described in graphic terms what you don't often hear from former Cabinet members: \"I stood there and it looked as if someone had taken a pail of ground meat, of hamburger meat, and thrown it onto that hill. And those were the remains of so many who gave their lives on that day.\"\n\nLet's agree, then, that Miller is a bit askew. One of his encounters with reporters in his final days as defense secretary was described by a British correspondent as a \"gobsmacking incoherent briefing\" that included the phrase \"blah blah bluh blah,\" according to the Pentagon's official transcript . But if you're not askew after going through the mindfuck of the forever wars, there's probably something wrong with you. It's an inversion of the \"Catch-22\" scenario in which the novel's protagonist, Capt. John Yossarian, tries to be declared insane so that he can get out of the bomber missions that he knows are nearly suicidal, but his desire to get out of them proves he's sane, so he's not excused. In an opposite way, generals and politicians who emerge from the carnage of the forever wars without coarse passions, who speak in modulated tones about staying the course and shoveling more money to the Pentagon - they are cracked ones who should not operate the machinery of war.\n\nSo here we are, just a few days away from the 20th anniversary of the Iraq invasion on March 19, a cataclysm that killed hundreds of thousands of people, cost trillions of dollars, and began with lies. The Pentagon just decided to name a warship the USS Fallujah , after the city that suffered more violence at the hands of American forces than any other place in Iraq. And Harvard University has just decided to give a prominent position to Meghan O'Sullivan, a Bush administration official who helped design the invasion and occupation of Iraq and since 2017 has been a board member of - you may have heard this one before - Raytheon Technologies (for which she was paid $321,387 in 2021). It's been 20 years and thanks in part to journalists who were complicit in spreading the first lies and were rewarded professionally for doing so, there has been neither accountability nor learning.\n\nIndividual pathologies determine how we medicate ourselves after traumatic events, and I think the politics we choose are forms of medication. Miller opted for service in the Trump administration, and while it strikes me as the least-admirable segment of his life since we met in Kandahar, he's not an outlier among veterans. For as long as our nation is subordinate to its war machine, we'll be hearing more from them. Forever wars do not end when soldiers come home.\n\nWAIT!

Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren't on the beat?\n\nThe kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable.

      "text": "The Law School Dean Who Quietly Worked to Overturn the Election\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nLawyers who worked to keep Trump in power in 2020 have risked being disbarred. But not Mark Martin.\n\nO n the evening of January 6, 2021 - as the Capitol Police were doing final sweeps of ransacked buildings and senators were preparing to resume the electoral vote count - former President Donald Trump asked the White House switchboard to get Mark Martin on the phone.\n\nA retired North Carolina Supreme Court justice, Martin was a key adviser to Trump's multi-pronged fight to overturn his loss in November 2020. In discussions with aides and administration officials, Trump considered Martin's counsel as important as that of attorney John Eastman, who's currently under indictment in two states and may be disbarred in a third. Trump so trusted Martin that another legal adviser name-dropped him to bolster his own pitches.\n\nAs another election looms, one that is shaping up to be settled by courts, it's crucial to examine the legal players who tried to reverse Trump's defeat in 2020. But unlike Eastman and other Trump-aligned lawyers, Martin has largely escaped scrutiny for his contribution to the Big Lie effort, which culminated in a nine-minute call as Trump and his allies were still looking for ways to pressure former Vice President Mike Pence into handing Trump the election.\n\nBased on extensive review of records from the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack and other sources, The Intercept pieced together the most exhaustive account of how Martin spent the weeks before the insurrection.\n\nWe found previously unreported details, including his ideological influence on a key MAGA state legislator, his central role in orchestrating a ludicrous Supreme Court challenge in coordination with the Trump campaign and White House staffers, and the extent to which Trump and his aides leveraged Martin's reputation to pressure Justice Department officials.\n\nDespite all this, Martin is still a law school dean and active member of prestigious legal institutions, including ethics and election law committees. In May, a far-right group floated him as a potential Supreme Court nominee.\n\nMartin did not respond to any of The Intercept's questions for this article. His current employer, High Point University in North Carolina, sent an identical statement to one previously given to other outlets: \"Chief Justice Martin assured HPU that he never has, nor ever will, support a betrayal of the Constitution or an insurrection of any kind.\" A university spokesperson declined to answer further questions.\n\nIn the past, Martin and his defenders have repeatedly invoked \"confidentiality\" to dodge questions while simultaneously claiming Trump and his campaign never retained Martin as an attorney. The Trump campaign also did not respond to questions about Martin's role.\n\nSince Martin never represented Trump in court or signed any filings, his efforts were not subject to rules governing lawyers' conduct in judicial proceedings. But retired justice Robert Orr, his former colleague on the North Carolina Supreme Court, thinks that given Martin's prominence in the legal community, he should still account for what he did.\n\n\"I'm a big fan of candor,\" Orr told The Intercept. \"Considering what transpired on January 6, he has a responsibility as a law school dean and former chief justice to be more forthcoming.\"\n\nIn January 2019, after 20 years on the North Carolina Supreme Court and four as its chief justice, Martin abruptly stepped down and took over as dean of Regent University Law School in Virginia, part of an evangelical Christian university founded by televangelist Pat Robertson. The move took some by surprise, particularly given the reputation Martin cultivated as a moderate, centrist Republican and longtime member of the elite American Law Institute.\n\nBut Martin quickly took to his new role at a bastion of the conservative legal movement, where one of Trump's attorneys, Jay Sekulow, was already on the faculty. Within weeks of starting at Regent, Martin appeared on Robertson's television program twice to defend Trump against the Mueller investigation.\n\nSoon after the 2020 election, Martin joined a core group of attorneys workshopping legal theories to help Trump, according to testimony during Eastman's disciplinary hearings in California.\n\nMartin reportedly came into Trump's orbit via Mark Meadows, a fellow North Carolinian and the White House chief of staff, who was indicted in Arizona and Georgia after the 2020 election. The two go back at least to 2013, when Martin posted a selfie with Meadows to Facebook. (Meadows did not respond to The Intercept's questions either.)\n\nRecords from the January 6 committee and other sources show Martin had his fingers in multiple phases of the drive to keep Trump in power. One of his earliest contributions targeted state legislatures, which has not been previously reported.\n\n\"This is huge and hugely important.\"\n\n\"This is huge and hugely important,\" Eastman wrote in an email to Martin and other attorneys in a strategy thread about communicating with \"the various State electors.\"\n\nMartin had a particular influence on one Arizona state representative: Mark Finchem, who emerged as a leader among MAGA state legislators.\n\nSoon after Trump's narrow loss in Arizona, records show Martin offered Finchem a theory: that the U.S. Constitution grants each state legislature \"plenary,\" or absolute, authority to choose presidential electors, no matter what else the state's constitution or laws might say about the proper procedure to do so.\n\nThis \"plenary\" theory, which cherry-picks from Supreme Court decisions dating back to the late 19th century, wove through various efforts by Martin and other attorneys aligned with Trump. It wound up becoming one of Finchem's go-to arguments to deny the validity of the 2020 election results.\n\nThe strategy has largely been credited to Eastman, but Finchem attributed the \"plenary\" theory to Martin.\n\nAn email obtained by The Intercept via public records request shows that communications between Finchem and Martin were underway by November 16, 2020. Finchem later told the January 6 committee that they were put in touch by another attorney advising Trump, Bill Olson. \"This Mark Martin guy, he is a constitutional scholar,\" Finchem recalled Olson telling him. \"He's worth listening to.\"\n\nThree days after emailing Martin, Finchem tweeted about his \"plenary duty to act.\" He argued that the Arizona Legislature could call itself into special session to investigate purported \"fraud,\" even without the governor or the supermajority vote required for such a session under Arizona law.\n\nBy November 21, Finchem had written an entire memo about the plenary theory and its implications for his own power as a state legislator. He emailed it to Martin and the Trump campaign, along with two of his colleagues in the Arizona Legislature, according to January 6 committee records, and he credited Martin by name.\n\n\"As articulated by retired North Carolina Supreme Court Chief Justice Mark Martin,\" Finchem wrote in the memo , \"the Constitution grants no role in directing the appointment of electors to the state's executive or judicial branches. It is the plenary authority and obligation of the Legislature to do so. Since this authority and obligation is placed solely upon the Legislature by the highest law of the land, the Legislatures are not impeded by state statutes in fulfilling this duty.\"\n\nIn a version he later published online , Finchem attributes these as verbatim quotes to Martin. In his January 6 committee interview, he was somewhat evasive about their discussions. \"I wouldn't say that he helped me with the memo,\" Finchem told the committee, adding that he had also reached out to Eastman and others as he wrote it. But his memo cites only Martin.\n\nFinchem would not answer The Intercept's questions about Martin. \"I don't understand why you think it's acceptable that I do your journalist research,\" he said in an email. \"If you have a question, reach out to Justice Mark Martin about the citation.\" As with other issues, Martin didn't respond when asked about Finchem.\n\nIn the following weeks, Finchem tied virtually all of his efforts to his \"plenary\" authority.\n\nUnable to scrounge up enough votes for a special session, Finchem organized an unofficial \"hearing\" in a hotel ballroom in late November 2020, which he opened with a brief discussion of the plenary theory.\n\nIn mid-December, he organized a faux \"joint resolution\" urging the vice president to accept an \"alternate\" slate of electors. This pseudo-resolution, which was printed on letterhead and signed by a smattering of GOP legislators, claimed that \"the state legislature's authority over the appointment of presidential electors is plenary.\"\n\nBut Finchem's resolution was never actually voted on and adopted by a majority of the legislature, and the Arizona attorney general later characterized it as \"fake.\" But because of the plenary theory, these were all trivial technicalities to Finchem.\n\n\"Once again, you go back to the question of plenary authority,\" Finchem argued to the January 6 committee. \"Does the body have to be in session for members to be recognized? And it was our belief that we don't have to be.\"\n\nIn the days before the insurrection, Finchem organized a letter asking Pence to \"block the use of any Electors from Arizona.\" The letter argued that legislators could \"withdraw\" their approval of these electors \"under the same plenary power.\"\n\nAs late as February 2022, Finchem was invoking the plenary theory as grounds to \"decertify\" certain Arizona counties' results from 2020.\n\nAfter the insurrection - during which he was photographed outside the Capitol building - Finchem faced considerable scrutiny, including ethics complaints and a lawsuit seeking to bar him from seeking office again, which were all ultimately dismissed. The Arizona attorney general's office also gave Finchem a nod as \"Unindicted Coconspirator 3\" in the \"fake electors\" indictment, which named Eastman, Meadows, and more than a dozen other defendants in an ongoing case.\n\nMartin's name is not among them, and he has never publicly accounted for feeding Finchem unhinged ideas about the \"plenary\" powers of state legislators.\n\nIn 2023, the Supreme Court rejected an even milder variant of this notion, called the \"independent state legislature\" theory, by a 6-3 margin. Martin actually moderated a panel about the ruling for the American Bar Association's election law committee, of which he is an emeritus member.\n\nMartin's role in shaping and endorsing the \"plenary\" theory went entirely unmentioned during the ABA panel, as did his other efforts to help Trump. One panelist said he was unaware of Martin's efforts after the 2020 election.\n\n\"Mark's been very good about being friends in elite circles,\" said Orr, his former state Supreme Court colleague. \"It's one of the main reasons I think he's been able to dodge much inquiry.\"\n\nMartin's involvement didn't stop with state legislators like Finchem. Operating under the same fringe version of the plenary theory, Martin was also deeply enmeshed in efforts to drag the post-election battle before the Supreme Court.\n\nIn prior reporting about the Trump campaign's Supreme Court machinations, Martin has often been cast as a relatively minor player. But one key lawyer, Kurt Olsen, testified that Martin was his entry point to the project of developing a lawsuit for Republican state attorneys to file directly to the Supreme Court. In an online radio interview, another attorney, Don Brown, called it Martin's \"brainchild.\" And as he pitched the lawsuit to Republican state officials, records show Brown called the team behind it \"Mark Martin's group.\" Other emails show Martin called one state attorney general himself, and he was part of discussions with the Trump campaign about the lawsuit.\n\nThe Intercept's review of records found that this group even asked White House speechwriters like Stephen Miller to help with punching up the language. And as Trump and his allies tried to engineer a Supreme Court case, they traded repeatedly on Martin's name and reputation as a retired judge and law school dean.\n\nTheir strategy was to fast track the case via the Supreme Court's \"original jurisdiction\" over disputes between states, which means the case would not need to go through lower federal courts first. In early December 2020, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed the suit, Texas v. Pennsylvania.\n\nThe arguments had a familiar ring to them, grounded in the plenary theory.\n\n\"The power to select electors is a plenary power of the State legislatures, and this remains so, without regard to state law,\" Paxton's brief argued. He alleged a range of \"significant and unconstitutional irregularities\" in Pennsylvania and three other states won by Joe Biden, and that these states had violated their respective legislatures' plenary authority by, among other things, adjusting voting rules in light of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Supreme Court quickly declined to hear the case, which was, as one election law professor summarized , \"Dangerous garbage, but garbage.\"\n\nMartin had joined the effort weeks earlier, soon after the 2020 election, according to testimony from Eastman's disciplinary hearings. By late November 2020, Martin was helping shop the \"state v. state\" idea around to Republican attorneys general in at least three states - including South Carolina, Louisiana, and Texas - according to materials from the January 6 committee and emails obtained through public records requests by American Oversight, Mount Holyoke College, and the New York Times.\n\n\"Former CJ Martin called me last night to give me an update,\" South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson wrote to Brown two days before Thanksgiving. Brown had emailed Wilson earlier to discuss his work with \"former NC Chief Justice Mark Martin's group.\"\n\n\"Glad CJ Martin called,\" Brown replied , adding that he had \"heard from one of the attorneys today working under CJ Martin\" that \"Texas is warming up to maybe jumping on board.\"\n\nIn a brief interview with The Intercept, Brown said Martin was \"certainly one of the most brilliant legal minds I've ever known.\" He did not respond to subsequent questions, nor did Wilson's office.\n\nMartin was eager to brief Wilson, according to Brown's emails, as was Mike Farris, who at the time was the president of the right-wing Alliance Defending Freedom. \"Chief Justice Martin indicated that if it were possible, he and Mike would be pleased to have a phone conference,\" Brown wrote. He promised that Martin's group would send a \"much-improved\" analysis, including a study that Martin told Brown had been authorized \"at the highest levels,\" which Brown wrote that he took to mean it was commissioned by the White House.\n\n\"The CJ tells me it will be more difficult for the opposition to punch holes in the evidentiary conclusions,\" Brown wrote.\n\n\"The CJ tells me it will be more difficult for the opposition to punch holes in the evidentiary conclusions.\"\n\nThe group also tried to court Louisiana's then-solicitor general and now-attorney general, Elizabeth Murrill. A few days before Thanksgiving, another right-wing attorney, Phillip Jauregui, emailed Murrill with an offer to brief her on the draft filings, which he attached. Martin was included in the back-and-forth.\n\nA spokesperson said Murrill never spoke to Martin directly. \"I could not pick him out of a lineup,\" Murrill said in an emailed statement.\n\nMartin also helped woo the Texas attorney general's office to file the contrived lawsuit. As the group was doing so, they looped in both the Trump campaign and White House staff. Alex Cannon, a lawyer for the Trump campaign, told the January 6 committee that Martin was part of emails discussing \"a Texas-only complaint\" in late November 2020. Cannon also recalled having a phone call with Martin and another attorney, Kurt Olsen, about the lawsuit.\n\nOn December 5, Olsen emailed the Trump campaign again, copying Martin, looking for evidence to \"make the complaint more persuasive.\"\n\n\"This is a complaint to be sent to Texas tomorrow at noon, and it's our last shot,\" Olsen wrote to Cannon. Paxton's office did not respond to The Intercept's questions.\n\nThe group asked Trump's speechwriters to put the finishing touches on the briefs, according to testimony to the January 6 committee. Farris sent edited copies to Trump's executive assistant on December 4, who passed them along to Miller and other speechwriters. Miller, who is not an attorney, told the January 6 committee his speechwriters were \"asked to revise the preamble\" of the complaint, which he did not find odd \"in the least.\"\n\nThree days later, Paxton filed a complaint to the Supreme Court on behalf of Texas. Many passages were identical to drafts circulated by Martin's group to Louisiana and South Carolina officials, down to an arcane quote from John Adams and claims about \"outcome-determinative\" fraud.\n\nThe briefs included an eye-popping and statistically ridiculous claim to the Supreme Court, which Olsen later testified that he wrote: that Biden's probability of winning these four states was \"less than one in a quadrillion.\" The economist cited for this figure later disavowed the briefs, writing that his analysis did \"not support what Paxton claimed about Trump winning.\"\n\nPaxton retained two of the attorneys who worked with Martin, Kurt Olsen and Larry Joseph, as \"special counsel\" for Texas, and they both attached their names to Supreme Court filings. Martin, however, never signed any of the briefs.\n\nPaxton and one of his deputies are still fighting misconduct charges over the case, which the Texas bar's disciplinary counsel alleged contained \"dishonest\" assertions about purported voter fraud as well as \"misrepresentations and false statements.\" Complaints were also filed against Olsen in July.\n\nEarlier this year, a California judge ruled Eastman tried to mislead the Supreme Court when he filed a brief on Trump's behalf in the case, which endorsed certain false statements from the Texas briefs. (Olsen testified that Martin may have consulted on Eastman's brief too.) Eastman has appealed the ruling, which recommended that he be disbarred.\n\nBut Martin - who, by Brown's account, oversaw the broader effort - has faced only intermittent scrutiny by the press.\n\n\"The rule of law allows individuals and parties to contest election results in court if they believe the results were inconsistent with the law,\" he told Inside Higher Ed in 2023. \"This is how the rule of law works, and this is what I support. It is consistent with who I am, my life's work, and the oath that I have taken to support the Constitution.\"\n\nEven after the Supreme Court refused to take up the Texas complaint, Martin did not give up on the plenary theory. Records show he urged Trump to try another tack: order the federal Justice Department to file essentially the same lawsuit straight to the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Christmas Day, attorney Bill Olson, who had previously introduced Finchem and Martin, called Trump to discuss the strategy, according to a memo Olson sent to Trump. (Olson did not respond to The Intercept's questions.)\n\n\"You told me you would then call Mark Martin, former Chief Justice of North Carolina, to discuss the concept further,\" Olson wrote. \"I know you called Mark Martin, and that he supported filing the case.\"\n\nTrump then brought the idea to the Justice Department. When DOJ leaders balked at the threadbare underlying theory, Trump and his aides leaned on Martin's endorsement.\n\nIn a December 27 call, Trump brought up Martin, former Acting Deputy Attorney General Rich Donoghue told the January 6 committee. \"He's a real 'scholar.' He knows about this stuff,\" Donoghue recalled Trump saying, in testimony peppered with quotes from his handwritten notes .\n\nTwo days later, on December 29, Donoghue and Jeff Rosen, the acting attorney general, met with Mark Meadows at the White House to discuss the proposal. Martin's support for using DOJ to file the suit came up almost immediately, according to Donoghue's notes, along with Eastman's blessing.\n\n\"Mark Martin and John Eastman, they were attorneys of some sort that had, according to the chief of staff, some views or insights about whether or not this original jurisdiction case could be brought at the Supreme Court,\" Donoghue testified.\n\nTrump \"trusts their view,\" he jotted down in his notes.\n\nRosen recalled Meadows being more emphatic.\n\n\"Well, Mark Martin and John Eastman, who are, you know, these great legal scholars, think it's a great idea,\" Rosen told the committee, paraphrasing Meadows.\n\nTrump's assistant sent Rosen and Donoghue a draft filing to review. Kurt Olsen also sent a copy, which he said Trump had already reviewed and was \"modeled after the Texas action.\"\n\nThe proposed draft, which now targeted six states instead of four, had striking resemblances to the document recently swatted away by the Supreme Court, down to the \"one in a quadrillion\" line and the full-throated reliance on the plenary theory.\n\nOn top of the lack of credible evidence, Justice Department officials flagged an even more fundamental problem: The federal government had no viable grounds to file the lawsuit, and even weaker ones than Texas claimed.\n\n\"We cannot ethically file a suit without a legal basis, and we are certain that if we did so, the Justices would promptly dismiss it,\" advised a top DOJ lawyer, Steve Engel, in a memo later released by the January 6 committee.\n\n\"Anyone who thinks otherwise simply does not know the law, much less the Supreme Court,\" Engel wrote. \"This case is not even within its original jurisdiction.\"\n\nAfter a heated call with Olsen, Rosen and Donoghue explained to Trump why, despite Martin's support, the Justice Department could not file this lawsuit that would benefit his campaign.\n\n\"I wound up telling the President, 'This doesn't work. There's multiple problems with it. And the Department of Justice is not going to be able to do it,'\" Rosen testified.\n\nAs it became clear that courts were not a viable route, Martin joined Eastman and a cast of familiar characters in looking for ways to use the vice president to overturn the election. This final chapter of Martin's involvement culminated in his call with Trump on the evening of January 6.\n\n\"Martin advised President Trump that Vice President Pence possessed the constitutional authority to impede the electoral count,\" the January 6 committee wrote in a footnote to its final report, citing reporting from the New York Times . Martin has repeatedly declined to address what he and Trump talked about as Pence was preparing to bring the Senate back into session.\n\n\"Martin advised President Trump that Vice President Pence possessed the constitutional authority to impede the electoral count.\"\n\nBut in the weeks leading up to the insurrection, records show Martin was part of discussions about how best to leverage Pence. In late December 2020, as the Justice Department ploy was unraveling, Martin was on an email thread with Larry Joseph, who asked for help workshopping yet another lawsuit .\n\nThis one, which Joseph filed on behalf of Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, asked a federal court if Pence had to follow the law and count the electoral votes, or if the vice president was free to discard some.\n\nEastman and Bill Olson, who were also on the thread, thought this lawsuit was a terrible idea. It \"could completely tank the January 6 strategy,\" Olson wrote. Eastman agreed there was a \"very high\" risk that courts would rule \"that Pence has no authority to reject the Biden-certified ballots.\" Martin did not share his own views of the lawsuit in the emails released by the January 6 committee.\n\nThe next week, Joseph went ahead and filed the suit anyway, which the court quickly dismissed for lack of standing. Disciplinary charges are currently pending against Joseph in Washington, D.C., over that lawsuit.\n\nIn a subsequent \"war gaming\" memo for potential scenarios on January 6, Eastman emphasized that it was important for Pence to derail the vote count \"without asking for permission\" from a court or Congress.\n\n\"The illegality of the plan was obvious,\" a federal judge later wrote of Eastman's role.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nMany Trump-aligned attorneys worked to pressure Pence, both in direct appeals to Pence and indirectly through state legislators like Finchem. During this period, Martin's name also comes up in January 6 committee records.\n\nOn January 2, Eastman and other Trump-aligned attorneys briefed more than 300 state legislators over Zoom, which Trump also joined. Eastman urged the legislators to \"assert your plenary power\" and demand that Pence delay the electoral vote count, according to an email from the call's organizer.\n\nMartin may also have been part of that briefing, based on transcripts from multiple interviews with the January 6 committee. \"I believe Mark Martin was on the call,\" a committee investigator told White House aide Casey Hutchinson, who said she was unfamiliar with what happened during the Zoom meeting. Investigators told two more witnesses that Martin was on the briefing call, but neither witness confirmed that fact.\n\nThe call's organizer, former Kansas Attorney General Phill Kline, who lost his law license in 2013 for misleading a grand jury and other misconduct, told The Intercept he could not recall if Martin joined Eastman on the call.\n\nOn January 4 and 5, Trump and Eastman tried to convince Pence that he had authority over the outcome of the presidential election far beyond what's spelled out in the Constitution and federal law. Pence's attorney, Greg Jacob, who refuted such theories based on what the law actually says, told the January 6 committee that Martin was not part of these discussions.\n\nDuring at least one conversation with Pence leading up to January 6, Trump reportedly invoked Martin's view that Pence could throw out electoral votes that were contested. The New York Times did not name its source for this claim.\n\nOn January 6, after Trump attacked Pence by name in tweets and a furious speech on the Ellipse, the vice president publicly rejected the pressure campaign. Pence issued a public letter declaring that his role was \"largely ceremonial\" and limited to counting the electoral votes. Soon after, Trump supporters breached the Capitol with chants of \" Hang Mike Pence !\" and the Secret Service rushed Pence and his family to a secure location.\n\nThat evening, after tweeting a video telling his followers to leave the Capitol but still looking for ways to pressure Pence before the Senate reconvened, Trump told the White House switchboard to get Martin and Kurt Olsen on the phone. Records show Trump gave this order at some point before 6:27 p.m., when he left the Oval Office dining room to retire to the presidential residence on the second floor of the White House.\n\nThe January 6 committee asked multiple witnesses what Trump and Martin discussed at 7:30 p.m. that evening, including Ivanka Trump, one of Trump's aides, and a White House lawyer. None could say.\n\nMartin's nine-minute call with Trump was sandwiched between Trump's two discussions with Olsen, who spoke with the former president for a total of 21 minutes. Olsen, who fought his January 6 committee subpoena, did not answer The Intercept's questions about what he and Trump spoke about that night.\n\nAnd Martin still won't say either.\n\nUnlike so many of the other attorneys who have been at least called to answer for their role seeking to keep Trump in power - including John Eastman, Rudy Giuliani, Kurt Olsen, Bill Olson, Ken Paxton, and Larry Joseph, to name just a few - Martin has faced only withering op-eds and a brief campaign against his selection to lead High Point University's new law school, which the school shrugged off.\n\nThe final report of the January 6 committee, published in December 2022, barely mentions him. In fact, the committee never subpoenaed Martin or called him for an interview, unlike every other person Trump spoke with the evening of the insurrection.\n\n\"On January 6, Trump was very selective in who he's talking with.\"\n\n\"How do you not follow up?\" Orr wondered about the committee's failure to talk to Martin. \"On January 6, Trump was very selective in who he's talking with. He's the president.\"\n\nMartin and High Point University like to note this fact to deflect questions about Martin's involvement.\n\n\"As it relates to the events of Jan. 6,\" High Point said in its recycled statement to The Intercept, \"more than 1,000 people were interviewed as part of the thorough work of the House Select Committee, and Mark Martin was not one of them.\"\n\nHigh Point had no response, however, to questions about how frequently Martin's name came up in the committee's investigation. The January 6 committee asked at least 17 witnesses about Martin, and they sought documents and information about him in subpoenas to key witnesses.\n\nMeadows, who defied his own subpoena and refused to testify, was told he would be deposed about the \"theories and/or understandings\" of both Martin and Eastman regarding the constitutional role of the vice president. The committee also mentioned Martin by name in subpoenas to Pennsylvania state Sen. Doug Mastriano, former national security adviser Mike Flynn, and Peter Navarro, Trump's trade adviser who went to prison for four months for defying his subpoena.\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., who chaired the January 6 committee, called it \"disingenuous\" for Martin to claim he is \"absolved of anything\" just because he never got a subpoena.\n\n\"Regardless of how they would now like to distance themselves,\" Thompson said in a statement, \"all of these conspirators know their shame, and I look forward to the day when they are all held accountable.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Josh Hawley Won't Let Go of His Manhood\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nIn his new book, the senator from Missouri unsuccessfully addresses a genuine problem.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, March 15, 2023.\n\nAcross the ages, right-wing politics has had an enduring fixation: manliness, whatever that means exactly.\n\nYou may remember that Hogan Gidley, the press secretary for former President Donald Trump's 2020 campaign, declared that Trump was \"the most masculine person ever to hold the White House.\"\n\nBefore that, there was Trump's runner-up in manliness, George W. Bush. When Bush delivered his \"Mission Accomplished\" speech on an aircraft carrier, convicted Watergate felon G. Gordon Liddy said Bush's flight suit \"made the best of his manly characteristic.\" Bush's one-time chief speechwriter Michael Gerson described him as possessing \"a manly humor.\"\n\nThen there was the Vietnam War, a manly endeavor prosecuted by the Nixon administration's manly men. When Henry Kissinger's assistant Anthony Lake objected to the intense U.S. bombing of North Vietnam, Kissinger told Lake he was \"not manly enough.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nPractitioners of this politics perceive themselves as exemplars of masculinity, even as they fear manliness in general is being sapped from society by the forces of darkness. For example, Kissinger once told Gerson that radical Islam was trying to humiliate us, \"and we need to humiliate them.\" Nixon referred to our Vietnamese enemies as \"little cocksuckers.\"\n\nA few years before, in 1965, the U.S. had supported a massive bloodbath in Indonesia in which at least 500,000 people were slaughtered. The Indonesian military justified this by claiming that communist witches had castrated several army generals. This fear goes back as far as humans do: The 1486 exposé of witchcraft \"Malleus Maleficarum\" proved that witches can, via sorcery, \"truly and actually remove men's members.\"\n\n\"Manhood: The Masculine Virtues America Needs,\" a new book by Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, is a worthy heir to this tradition.\n\nBefore you ask, the answer to your question is no. In a book titled \"Manhood,\" Hawley literally never mentions the most famous act of his life: running away from the protesters in the Capitol on January 6, 2021, the protesters he had earlier that day saluted with a raised fist of solidarity.\n\nThe internet has set Hawley's wee scamper of fear to many different tunes, each of which adds a different frisson of joy to the footage. There's the theme from \"Chariots of Fire ,\" the theme from Benny Hill , \"Gonna Fly Now\" from \"Rocky,\" \"Stayin' Alive\" by the Bee Gees , and many, many more .\n\nJosh Hawley running away to a variety of soundtracks.\n\nPt. 11: This one's for Finland. ?? pic.twitter.com/edOqe5l1Tc\n\n- Mallory Nees (@The_Mal_Gallery) August 4, 2022\n\nHow can Hawley tell us, you might ask, that a man must be \"willing to give his life for others, willing to act boldly, to face death,\" yet not say anything about his well-known Sprint of Self-Preservation? How can he at the same time condemn \"liberals\" because they \"flee from trial and pain\"?\n\nYour guess is as good as mine. My assumption is that it's because the U.S. right has created an entire self-contained fantasy world, one in which GOP politicians like Hawley can thrive without ever facing the most obvious questions, so he doesn't feel the need to bother. Notably, \"Manhood\" is published by the conservative Regnery, where editors presumably understand Hawley's readers won't want any intrusions from unpleasant reality.\n\nA photograph of Sen. Josh Hawley from January 6 is seen on screen hearing of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol in the Cannon House Office Building on July 21, 2022 in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"Manhood\" is somehow both short and long: Short because it's an op-ed stretched out to barely 200 pages, and long because it is preternaturally boring. There are zero jokes, not even a single wry remark. Consuming it is like eating a small but dense log of suet.\n\nHawley's thesis is that America's men are in crisis: fathering children out of wedlock, failing to get jobs, committing crime, and playing video games. Why? The problem is the Greek philosopher Epicurus and his modern descendants, liberals.\n\nEpicurus taught us, Hawley summarizes, that \"the universe is neither planned nor orderly. ... Mankind should put the gods aside and focus on what really matters, which is, he said, pleasure, happiness. ... The trick was to arrange one's life, and society in such a way to allow maximum choice for pursuing pleasure.\" (This is actually not at all what Epicurus said ; he wrote that \"pleasure is the end\" but emphasized the pleasure of \"living prudently and honorably and justly.\" But who cares, I guess.)\n\nHowever, there is another philosophy of life, as found in the Bible: \"It says man was created as God's image and called to perform God's work.\" In Genesis, the Garden of Eden \"is the only place of order and flourishing. ... When we learn anything of the land beyond Eden's borders, it appears untamed, wild. Dark forces lurk there.\" The job of men is not to give into their hedonistic yearnings but assume the yoke of manhood and \"subdue what is yet wild.\"\n\nThe problem is that \"there are dark forces that resist this mighty work,\" i.e., the Epicurean liberals. Because the Epicureans believe only in base sensuality and giving no thought for the morrow, they are naturally hostile to God and the role he has given man and therefore proclaim that manhood is a wholly negative force that must be destroyed.\n\nHawley turns this idea into a book by repeating it at you 700 times. In addition, there are a smattering of statistics and a few charming anecdotes about Hawley's sons Elijah and Blaise. But that's pretty much it. \"Manhood\" is striking because it is fundamentally a work of airless theology. It's just a dreary debate between Hawley's interpretation of the Bible and his straw man Epicureans, all with the intellectual rigor of what he tells us in the last chapter: \"The Bible is right. The Epicurean liberals are wrong.\" Case closed.\n\nEven Hawley's conception of manhood is a shallow mess. The liberal Epicureans, he informs us, want to abolish masculinity altogether. But this would be a horrible mistake. To illustrate this, he relates a tale from his wife's family, who had a homestead in New Mexico in the 1860s. It was occasionally menaced by \"the region's most notorious outlaw, Captain William Coe,\" known for murder and pillage. On one occasion, Coe arrived while being chased by federal soldiers. Hawley's wife's widowed ancestor Susan fed Coe and then waited for him to fall asleep. She then sent her son Bud, then in his early teens, to search for the soldiers and bring them back to the homestead, even though she knew that if Coe woke while Bud was gone that Coe might kill her.\n\nBud succeeded, and Coe was captured. For Hawley, this means various things, but it is foremost \"the story of a young man becoming something every man is called to be - a warrior.\"\n\nYet as Hawley tells it, the most courage was shown by Susan. She was the one directly at risk. Moreover, Coe himself was a warrior, a Civil War veteran who was a \"charismatic leader, in a malevolent sort of way.\" So que es mas macho here? When Hawley writes elsewhere that \"men are part of God's solution to danger in the world,\" shouldn't he emphasize that a great deal of this danger is also created by men?\n\nAnother example Hawley provides of manliness is his uncle Gene, who served with the 101st Airborne Division in Vietnam. \"That's part of what it meant to be a man - to go stand on the line, to go and defend,\" says Hawley. \"To confront evil and do something about it.\" Hawley does not mention the Tiger Force unit of the 101st, which carried out a voluminous spree of rape and murder of Vietnamese civilians. Nor does he ask whether any masculinity was demonstrated by the men who refused to go 7,000 miles as agents of the most powerful empire that's ever existed to dump napalm on a peasant society.\n\nHawley's core unseriousness is especially pernicious because America should be considering the issues he raises - just not like this. Hawley tells us that \"the corporations [want] a nation of androgynous consumers who don't rock the boat and don't question much but buy plenty of cheap paraphernalia to keep the corporations profitable.\" This is essentially accurate, but it's also obviously the basic characteristic of our economic system, not the philosophy of elusive modern-day \"Epicureans.\" Ferocious 21st century capitalism and the society it's created is clearly a bad fit for humans in general - and young men in particular. All you need to understand this is to witness how many of them are carrying out random massacres with AR-15s (something that goes unmentioned by Hawley).\n\nThe funniest part of all is that Hawley tells us that \"America's most urgent need politically is not for this or that piece of legislation. It is for men to embrace a call to character.\"\n\nSo ... WHY IS HE A SENATOR? By Hawley's own estimation, he is the weakest, most unmanly man imaginable. His entire life is what he did on January 6: succumbing to his own desire for power, running away as fast as possible from the consequences, and refusing to acknowledge any of it.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

That single executive action undid years of work and investigation by the FBI, US prosecutors, and one person in particular: Tim Heaphy .\n\nIn the first episode of More To The Story , Reveal 's new podcast, host Al Letson talks with Heaphy, the lead investigative counsel for the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol, who's arguably done more than anyone to piece together what happened that day. His work helped inform related cases that were brought against rioters, Trump administration officials, and even Trump himself.\n\n\"I spent my whole career as a lawyer,\" Heaphy says, \"and I've always believed that accountability is essential to democracy. That when people violate community standards, violate laws-laws like you can't interfere with an official proceeding, you can't assault police officers-that there are consequences.\" Heaphy, who investigated the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, also draws striking similarities between that event and the insurrection at the Capitol.\n\nTake a listen:\n\nSubscribe to Mother Jones podcasts on Apple Podcasts or your favorite podcast app.\n\nFind this episode of More To The Story in the Reveal feed on Apple podcasts or your favorite podcast app. And be sure you click follow so you don't miss a single episode.\n\nThe first episode of More to the Story is here!!🎙️ Host @Al_Letson talks to the lead investigator of the Jan. 6 committee about the sweeping effects of Trump's pardons-and watching the investigation getting fundamentally rewritten. https://t.co/sqaHX4lzY1 pic.twitter.com/mh0reS74zh\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Meet the 71-Year-Old Insurrectionist Rejecting Trump's Pardon\n\nConvicted insurrectionist Pam Hemphill does not want Trump's pardon-even though it would end her probation 8 months early. Matthew Kelley/AP\n\nBefore Pamela Hemphill stormed the Capitol with thousands of other insurrectionists on January 6, 2021, she posted a photo of herself on Facebook in her living room holding a giant, plastic firearm. \"Happy New Year!\" the post read. \"On my way to Washington DC January 6th!\"\n\nOnce there, Hemphill encouraged the rioters to enter the Capitol, saying, \"Let's do this; let's go to the Capitol. We did it in Boise,\" referring to an August 2020 riot at the Idaho Capitol over pandemic restrictions, led by anti-government militant Ammon Bundy. (According to court filings, Hemphill filmed that incident; her lawyer alleged in court that she did not actually break windows or property at the building in Boise.) Later, Hemphill wandered the halls of the Capitol armed with a selfie stick, according to a court filing from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that included stills from surveillance footage.\n\nEight months later, law enforcement officials arrested Hemphill in Boise. In January 2022, she pleaded guilty to a charge of violent entry and disorderly conduct on capitol grounds, and was soon after sentenced to two months in prison-which she served at the now-shuttered FCI Dublin in California-three years probation, and a $500 fine.\n\nToday, 71-year-old Hemphill does not recognize her insurrectionist self. \"My dream is to meet the Capitol police officers,\" she told me on Zoom on Thursday, \"and give them a hug.\" She is so appalled by her past actions, in fact, that she has rejected the pardons Trump issued to the insurrectionists on Monday-despite the fact that it would have ended her ongoing period of probation, which prevents her from leaving the state, owning a weapon, or returning to the Capitol. (Whether she can legally reject the pardon remains unclear. Her attorney declined to comment when reached by phone on Thursday.)\n\nA retired substance abuse counselor who says she's been sober for more than four decades, Hemphill likens her decision to abstain from the pardon to the process of recovery: \"It's by doing the right thing and accepting responsibility for your actions that's going to bring you more peace than anything you could imagine,\" she told me.\n\nI called up Hemphill-who said she voted for Kamala Harris in the last election-to discuss her path to insurrectionist, the consequences of her criminal conviction, and Trump.\n\nThis interview has been lightly condensed and edited.\n\nHow did you wind up at the Capitol on Jan. 6?\n\nMy brother had called and said, \"Hey, how would you like to go there as a Christmas gift? It'll be the last time we may be able to see Trump.\" I said, \"Oh, I'd love that,\" because two weeks after I was going to start chemotherapy [for breast cancer], so I had a little window, and I thought, \"this would be great.\" I'd never been to Washington.\n\nSo by the time you got to DC on January 6, did you think that the 2020 election had been stolen?\n\nI was on the fence. But I was believing if [Rudy] Giuliani's out there and Trump and all those other very famous people, they wouldn't be lying to the country.\n\nCan you talk about the violence you saw that day?\n\n[The insurrectionists] pushed the barriers. They pushed the officers. They ran up to the steps, they pushed me down, stepped on my head, pulled my shoulder, cut my knee. I couldn't breathe. The police officers pulled me up and saved my life. I would be dead because they were walking all over me.\n\nSo how does it feel to know that some of these people who perpetrated acts of violence against these police officers have now been pardoned and released from prison?\n\nI'm so disgusted. How could they ever have been released? I mean, they're the most dangerous criminals, and a lot of them had committed crimes before. I'm just still so disgusted and so angry. And that's why I won't take a pardon-because it would be a slap in the face to the Capitol Police, the rule of law, and to our nation.\n\nDo you know of anyone else who was convicted for what they did on January 6 who also want to reject the pardons?\n\nNo, I wish. I keep asking people, journalists, and different people, \"Do you know of anybody? I'd love to be able to talk to them.\" You feel so alone. I can't be the only one.\n\nWhen you were in prison, did you start to question the narrative of January 6 at all?\n\nNo, not at all. You're just trying to focus. I was taking it an hour at a time.\n\nOnce in a while when I was laying in my bunk, I would think it over, but I got so many letters saying I'm a hero, and \"what you did was great.\" And my gut said, \"I don't think so. I broke the law.\" I would go back and forth with myself.\n\nWhen I got out and went to see my therapist that I had been seeing for years-because I still suffer from childhood PTSD issues-he looked at me, he heard my little back-and-forth denial. He says, \"Miss Hemphill, come on, you're not a victim. You had a choice. You were a volunteer.\" And I got mad, and said, \"I'm never gonna go back and see that therapist.\"\n\nI got home that night, and because I've been sober for 45 years, one of the steps in recovery is, \"When you're wrong, properly admit it.\" I realized: \"Oh, he's right. I had a choice. I'm not a victim.\" And that started turning my thinking around.\n\nWhat message do you think Trump is trying to send by issuing these pardons? And what message do you think he's actually sending?\n\nIn my opinion, the message is the DOJ is weaponized against him. He's so evil. He needs his little own militia out there on the streets. He's sending a message to the DOJ: \"We know that you came after me like a witch hunt, and I did nothing wrong, and neither did the J6ers.\" It's the best gaslighting campaign I've ever seen.\n\nYou use the word \"militia.\"  Are you worried that the people who have been released from prison could go on to more political violence? What do you think they're capable of going forward?\n\nEverything they were capable of doing on January 6. Nothing's changed. They haven't taken any responsibility for what they did at all. I mean, nobody forced them to break a window or hit an officer. In fact, it's empowered them more. So, yes, I'm afraid that there will be more violence.\n\nWhy don't you want to accept this pardon? Is rejecting it even legally possible?\n\nAccording to what I've researched, yes.\n\nI told my probation officer and I think she's probably waiting for paperwork. But whatever I have to do to sign that thing I will, and then I'm going to frame it.\n\nThe reason I'm not accepting it is because it would just contribute to their gaslighting and their lying about what happened on January 6-that it was okay, that we're innocent. I don't want to be a part of their continued rewrite of history. I broke the law. I know it would be difficult if you are in prison, looking at a ten-year sentence, but I'm sure I would still do this. Because you got to live with you, not anybody else. I have to live with Pam and my God that I believe in. So it's the right thing to do, for no other reason.\n\nI'm curious, does your background as a substance counselor and the steps that you have taken toward recovery, does that impact how you think about this?\n\nYeah, because it's not just saying, \"I'm sorry.\" That's easy.\n\nMaking amends means to make it right. You can't make January 6 right. But at least by speaking out, trying to reach out to others that are confused and lost family members in the MAGA cult, maybe I can say something to help them get through this. Or maybe-hopefully-somebody, a J6er or another criminal, might sit back and give it some thought and say, \"you know, I was wrong that day. I need to take accountability.\"\n\nYou never know. We just plant the seeds.\n\nHas your conviction had any ongoing consequences to your life and to opportunities you've sought after getting out of prison? If so, has that made you question at all whether you should take the pardon?\n\nThe consequences are troubles of my own making. I put myself there; I didn't leave. I have to take the consequences that come with it. You don't do things that are wrong and then think everything in your life's going to be ok now.\n\nThere's been some consequences. I lost my Social Security. A relationship of 12 years left when I moved away from the MAGA cult. Lost my counseling license.\n\nEx-Capitol and DC police officers who were attacked that day now say they feel betrayed that Trump issued these pardons. Meanwhile, Trump has insisted he's a \"friend to police.\" What's your response to this?\n\nI'm so angry. Congress approved the plaque for the Capitol police officers and they have not put it up. It's the least our nation could do for the Capitol police.\n\nRight now it's real important to give them all the support that they could get to let them know that we know they were the heroes that day, and to thank them and let them know that we're behind them.\n\nTrump ain't a friend to nobody. He's a narcissist; he's a dangerous narcissist.\n\nHe plays both sides, all the time. You never know what he's going to do, and he lies about everything.\n\nWhat is your message to Trump and to other people who were convicted who are now taking solace in these pardons?\n\nIt's hard to say what you would say to Trump because he wouldn't even let you say anything.\n\nTo the others, since I was honest with myself, I sleep well at night. I have peace of mind. I didn't like doing it. I wanted to stay a victim. When I changed and started realizing that Trump was a cult leader, I went through a lot this last year and a half. It's not like if you do recognize you were wrong, don't be thinking that it's going to be easy, because it's not. But you're going to feel good, personally, inside.\n\nUpdate, Jan. 24: This story was updated with details from court records of Hemphill's actions on Jan. 6 and at an August 2020 riot at the Idaho Capitol that Hemphill filmed.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "January 6 Report Presents a Devastating Case Against Trump\n\nMother Jones; zz/KGC-375/STAR MAX/IPx/AP\n\nAfter 18 months of investigation and hearings, the House January 6 committee has confirmed the obvious: \"The central cause of January 6th was one man, former President Donald Trump, who many others followed. None of the events of January 6th would have happened without him.\" The committee cited this conclusion in a 161-page introduction to its forthcoming final report that was released on Monday. The full report is expected to be made public on Wednesday.\n\nThe committee had something of an odd assignment: prove what was already proved. Trump's disinformation crusade that advanced the lie that the 2020 election was fraudulent and his incitement of the insurrectionist violence both happened in plain sight. Yet the introduction notes, \"Millions of Americans believed that Trump was telling the truth on election night-that Trump actually had proof the election was stolen and that the ongoing counting of votes was an act of fraud.\" These Americans continued to believe Trump in the weeks after Election Day, and the committee notes it initially faced the challenge that \"millions of Americans still lack the information necessary to understand and evaluate what President Trump has told them about the election.\"\n\nHow to bring the light to these people? How to forge a national consensus about Trump's efforts to overturn the election that led to a seditious act of domestic terrorism? In this document, the committee shows that it thoroughly investigated and chronicled these events, and it explains its reasons for sending to the Justice Department a criminal referral of Trump on various charges: for obstructing an official proceeding (the counting of the electoral votes), for conspiring to defraud the United States, for conspiring to make false statements, and for inciting insurrection. But in the face of an unrelenting propaganda campaign from Trump and the right's attempts to dismiss or downplay January 6, to diminish the work of the committee, to distract from Trump's various plots to reverse the election, and to keep his Big Lie alive, it's unclear how far the committee has succeeded in enlightening those Americans who bought Trump's con.\n\nJudging from the introduction, the final report should do the trick for anyone who does not maintain a cult-like loyalty to Trump and his falsehoods. This preliminary portion is a thorough and easy-to-read document that effectively summarizes the committee's hearings and investigative digging and that chronicles all the elements of Trump's plot to destroy American democracy.\n\nAs the introduction notes, Trump, beginning on election night, purposefully disseminated \"false allegations of fraud...to aid his effort to overturn the election\" (and to solicit what would end up being about $250 million in political contributions). Even though he was repeatedly informed by senior advisers that there was no legitimate basis for alleging fraud, he refused to accept the results and \"plotted to overturn the election outcome.\" He \"sought to corrupt the U.S. Department of Justice by attempting to enlist Department officials to make purposely false statements and thereby aid his effort to overturn the Presidential election.\" (And when that effort failed, he tried to install as attorney general a Big Lie crony who intended to declare the election fraudulent and pressure officials in Georgia to renounce the state's election results.) Without \"any evidentiary basis and contrary to State and Federal law,\" Trump himself \"unlawfully pressured State officials and legislators to change the results.\"\n\nAnd there's more: Trump \"oversaw an effort to obtain and transmit false electoral certificates to Congress and the National Archives.\" He pressed members of Congress \"to object to valid slates of electors.\" He \"purposely verified false information filed in federal court\" to support bogus lawsuits alleging election fraud. He then \"corruptly pressured Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to count electoral votes\" during Congress' joint session on January 6. Finally, he \" summoned tens of thousands of supporters to Washington for January 6th,\" and though he knew some of these Trumpists were angry and armed, he instructed them to march to the Capitol. Once the violent attack was underway, he posted a tweet condemning Pence that further inflamed the mob. And while the riot proceeded, Trump \"refused repeated requests...to instruct his violent supporters to disperse and leave the Capitol.\" Instead, he \"watched the violent attack unfold on television.\"\n\nThe committee sums up: \"Each of these actions by Donald Trump was taken in support of a multi-part conspiracy to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 Presidential election.\"\n\nIt's a damning indictment of a man who had once sworn to uphold and defend the Constitution. Even though this is only an introductory document, it is loaded with details. It shows that many of his closest advisers repeatedly told him that there was no significant fraud and that his assorted schemes to stay in power were wrong or illegal-and Trump disregarded all this. Instead, he listened to a band of wackos led by lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell. (At one point in the post-election period, Bill Stepien, the Trump campaign manager, felt compelled to lock Giuliani out of Stepien's office.) Even after John Eastman, the right-wing legal scholar who had promoted the idea that Pence could block the electoral vote certification, told Trump on January 5 that his proposal would violate the law, Trump proceeded with this scheme: \"Trump nevertheless continued to exert immense pressure on Pence to refuse to count electoral votes.\" The report confirms that Trump called Pence a \"pussy\" for refusing to do so.  The committee notes that on January 6, as his marauders were ransacking the Capitol and blocking the peaceful transfer of power, Trump never ordered the deployment of the National Guard troops nor did he have a single phone call with any law enforcement or national security agency.\n\nIt wasn't Trump alone. The report covers the various co-conspirators. Republican Party chair Ronna McDaniel helped with the fake electors scheme. As did the offices of Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.). Numerous GOP members of Congress were involved in different facets of Trump's various plots, including Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, Jim Jordan of Ohio, and Andy Biggs of Arizona. The committee has referred Perry, Jordan, Biggs, and Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) \"for sanction by the House Ethics Committee for failure to comply with subpoenas\" to testify before the committee. The committee points out that Mark Meadows, in his memoir, published a false account of January 6 (as I've noted ).\n\nThe report documents that the extremists who assaulted the Capitol had been motivated and inspired by Trump's lies: \"President Trump's supporters believed the election was stolen because they listened to his words, and they knew what he had called them to do; stop the certification of the electoral count.\"\n\nThe committee also characterizes that horrific day as an intelligence failure: \"[D]ocumentation received by the Committee from the Secret Service demonstrates a growing number of warnings both that January 6th was likely to be violent, and specifically that the Capitol would likely be the target, including intelligence directly regarding the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers militia groups.\" Other agencies missed obvious signs. The problem was that the intelligence collected suggesting violence was possible-or likely-did not reach the appropriate authorities. But the Trump White House was in the know: \"After President Trump's signal, his supporters did not hide their plans for violence at the Capitol, and those threats made their way to national and local law enforcement agencies. As described in this report, the intelligence agencies did detect this planning, and they shared it with the White House and with the U.S. Secret Service.\"\n\nAccording to the committee report, days ahead of January 6 Trump planned to issue what would seem to be a spontaneous call to his supporters to march on the Capitol. (One piece of evidence for this: a text sent to Mike Lindell, the My Pillow guy and chief Trump conspiracy-monger.)  And the committee notes that when Trump was blocked by the Secret Service from accompanying the crowd, he was, according to the testimony of several witnesses, \"irate,\" \"furious,\" \"insistent,\" \"profane,\" and \"heated.\" (The introduction doesn't fully resolve the question of whether Trump got into a physical altercation with a Secret Service agent who refused to drive him toward Capitol Hill.)\n\nPerhaps the most disturbing portion of this document is the account of Trump's actions-or inaction-while the January 6 riot ensued. From a distance, he worked the crowd up with his tweet about Pence and he refused entreaties from aides, family members, and others to instruct the rioters to leave the Capitol. According to the report, at some point Ivanka Trump \"rushed down\" to see Trump in the Oval Office dining room to \"persuade her father to do the right thing... Although no one could convince President Trump to call for the violent rioters to leave the Capitol, Ivanka persuaded President Trump that a tweet could be issued to discourage violence against the police. \" (The committee, in this report, says Ivanka was not \"forthcoming\" in her testimony.)\n\nCuriously, the committee found a lack of White House records for that afternoon:\n\nNo photographs exist of the President for the remainder of the afternoon until after 4 p.m. President Trump appears to have instructed that the White House photographer was not to take any photographs. The Select Committee also was unable to locate any official records of President Trump's telephone calls that afternoon. And the President's official Daily Diary contains no information for this afternoon between the hours of 1:19 p.m. and 4:03 p.m., at the height of the worst attack on the seat of the United States Congress in over two centuries.\n\nBut Trump, according to his personal assistant, was placing \"lots of calls\" during that stretch.\n\nIn the committee's account, Trump on January 6 never displayed concern about the violence or any remorse:\n\nAt 6:27 p.m., President Trump retired to his residence for the night. As he did, he had one final comment to an employee who accompanied him to the residence. The one takeaway that the President expressed in that moment, following a horrific afternoon of violence and the worst attack against the U.S. Capitol building in over two centuries, was this: \"Mike Pence let me down.\"\n\nThis introduction indicates the final report will be thousands of pages. It will thoroughly document a day of infamy and a multi-level conspiracy mounted by a president to subvert the Constitution and grab the power of a tyrant. This truth may be too difficult for Trump and his followers to handle. But for the rest of the country-and for posterity-the committee has established a record of this assault on the nation's foundation. With this report, an important mission has been accomplished.\n\nIn testimony to the committee, Hope Hicks, a longtime Trump aide, recalled that when she told Trump during the post-election period that she believed his charges of fraud were \"damaging his legacy,\" Trump replied, \"Nobody will care about my legacy if I lose.\" That's not true. The committee's report seals what is now the most significant aspect of his legacy: Trump tried to illegally break the republic, and, fortunately, he failed.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Trump Incited the Terrorism of January 6, Investigations Further Show\n\nMother Jones illustration; Carol Guzy/Zuma\n\nThe ongoing series of hearings by the House committee investigating January 6 has produced numerous revelations about Donald Trump's attack on the peaceful transfer of presidential power. The most explosive evidence to date has come from Cassidy Hutchinson, a former top aide in the Trump White House, who described how Trump knowingly urged armed supporters to march on the Capitol and reportedly raged against Secret Service agents who prevented him from joining the mob bent on stopping the certification of Joe Biden's election victory.\n\nEven after all the chaos and drama of Trump's presidency, the mounting evidence of how he sought to menace Congress on Jan. 6, 2021, has been shocking-he reportedly even endorsed the potential murder of his own vice president that day. The evidence both underscores and adds context to Trump's most sinister legacy: his role as the leader of a domestic terrorism movement . The American public has continued to learn about his direct influence on extremists from the House hearings and from the ongoing prosecutions of hundreds of Jan. 6 participants by the Justice Department.\n\nIn the aftermath of the insurrection, the DOJ quickly uncovered broad evidence of how Trump had motivated the assault on the Capitol. The picture has since only grown more stark. The case of Guy Reffitt is illustrative: a Three Percenter militia member who had traveled from Texas, Reffitt was convicted by a jury in March on five counts, including weapons charges and obstruction of Congress. In a July 15 sentencing memo , prosecutors asked the court for 15 years in prison for Reffitt, who led a group of rioters against police in breaching the Capitol. The sentencing request is based on a terrorism enhancement , which prosecutors said was appropriate for a crime that \"was calculated to influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion, or to retaliate against government conduct.\"\n\nCase evidence showed that Reffitt came to Washington armed with multiple guns, wore heavy tactical gear, and recorded the siege with a helmet camera, whose footage included him declaring repeatedly to those around him how they would \"take\" the Capitol. \"We're all going to drag them motherfuckers out kicking and screaming...I just want to see Pelosi's head hit every fucking stair on the way out.\"\n\nHis statements included his belief that the rioters had \"the numbers to make it happen\" and indicated how the goal of purging Congress had been emboldened by Trump: \"We've got a fucking president, we don't need much more.\"\n\nIn a separate court filing from early July, the Justice Department further described a seditious conspiracy case involving groups of Oath Keepers from Florida, North Carolina, and elsewhere who had allegedly trained for \"unconventional warfare.\" The filing made public new details of anticipated trial evidence: In addition to an arsenal of firearms stashed in a hotel just outside of downtown DC on Jan. 6, various Oath Keepers involved in the conspiracy possessed bomb-making instructions and a \" death list \" targeting a Georgia election official, according to court records. An unindicted co-conspirator facing other charges allegedly transported explosives to Washington as part of plans to fight for Trump.\n\nDuring a July 12 hearing, the House committee laid out how Trump moved to light a fuse with far-right extremists beginning about three weeks before the siege. In a prolonged Oval Office confrontation the night of Dec. 18, 2020, Trump was thwarted by White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and other legal aides from using baseless conspiracy theories about voter fraud to make extreme moves to take over the US election system. Trump then began to focus on other means to achieve his goal of staying in power, sending out a now infamous tweet at 1:42 a.m. on Dec. 19: \"Big protest in D.C. on January 6th,\" he said, kicking off a series of efforts by him to draw a massive crowd of supporters to the nation's capital. \"Be there, will be wild!\"\n\n\"One of the most historic events in American history has just taken place,\" announced high-profile media agitator Alex Jones in a video posted later that day. President Trump, he said , \"is now calling on we the people to take action and to show our numbers.\"\n\nOther commentators took the theme further. \"Red wave, bitch. This is going to be a red wedding going down January 6,\" declared one pro-Trump YouTuber, referring to the well-known scene of mass slaughter from Game of Thrones . \"January 6, kick that fucking door open. There are gonna be a million-plus geeked up, armed Americans.\"\n\nThe House committee gave further examples of the subsequent deluge of online extremist activity-long since detailed in court documents and in news and government reports -showing how Trump supporters throughout the country armed and mobilized for violence.\n\nNone of that response should have come as a surprise. As I first reported in late 2020, leading national security experts began warning after Trump's election defeat that he was escalating his use of stochastic terrorism, a method of propagandizing that stirs extremist supporters to violent action. As president, Trump had honed the technique of couching the incitement in plausible deniability. He used ambiguous rhetoric and routinely hid behind claims to have been just \"joking\" -whether he was targeting the media as the \"enemy of the people,\" talking of \"some very fine people\" alongside neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, urging armed mobs to \"liberate\" state capitols over pandemic restrictions, or encouraging the Proud Boys to \"stand back and stand by\" in the run-up to the presidential election.\n\n\"He is promoting terrorism,\" Juliette Kayyem, a former assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security in the Obama administration, told me in December 2020. \"There is a reluctance to identify the kind of violence that Trump is propagating,\" she added, \"maybe because it seems too close to calling him a terrorist. You can call him whatever you want, but the tactics he's using are clearly a form of terrorism.\"\n\nElizabeth Neumann, a counterterrorism expert who served as an assistant secretary at DHS under Trump until early 2020, called out his \"coded support\" for violent extremists in a Washington Post op-ed that October. \"Language from campaign materials and Trump's extemporaneous speeches at rallies have been used as justification for acts of violence ,\" she wrote. Kori Schake, a former national security leader in the George W. Bush administration, described Trump that December as \"an arsonist of radicalization.\"\n\nBy the evening of January 5, 2021, Trump's elation about the next day was clear, according to testimony from former White House deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews. Tens of thousands of his supporters had converged on Washington, legions of them motivated by Trump's election lies. Many were armed . Many had gathered for a rally at Freedom Plaza close to the White House, taking in firebrand speeches from Trump backers including Roger Stone and Ali Alexander, who led the crowd in a chant of \"Victory or death!\"\n\nThat night, Trump had the door of the Oval Office opened to the Rose Garden, Matthews told the House committee. \"It was so loud that you could feel it shaking in the Oval. He was in a very good mood...he had not been in a good mood for weeks leading up to that. And then it seemed like he was in a fantastic mood that evening.\"\n\nTrump also put out a telling tweet that night. I included it in my reporting published on the morning of January 6, just hours before the assault on the Capitol, in a story headlined, \" Trump Is Inciting Violence Over His Election Defeat. \" Trump's message in the tweet corroborates Matthews' testimony:\n\nWashington is being inundated with people who don't want to see an election victory stolen by emboldened Radical Left Democrats. Our Country has had enough, they won't take it anymore! We hear you (and love you) from the Oval Office. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\n\nIn prime time on Thursday night, the House committee plans to hear live testimony from Matthews and former deputy national security adviser Matthew Pottinger, as the committee focuses on Trump's actions and communications while Congress was under siege. Little is yet known publicly about what Trump did inside the White House for more than three hours during the violence and mayhem. Trump's activity during a specific period of 187 minutes has essentially remained a black hole.\n\nAccording to Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger, who spoke on CBS News' Face the Nation on Sunday, the committee will show that Trump did very little other than \"gleefully watch television during this timeframe.\" The president should have been \"going ballistic to try to save the Capitol,\" Kinzinger said . \"He did quite the opposite.\"\n\nThe committee also plans to show outtakes from a speech Trump recorded and eventually put out on Jan. 7, after advisors had implored him to declare the election over, condemn the violence and call for accountability for those who stormed the Capitol. Trump resisted, according to the Washington Post , instead trying to call the rioters \"patriots.\"\n\nThat followed a short statement recorded on the White House lawn and posted late in the day on Jan. 6, in which Trump reiterated his election fraud lies and told the rioters to go home in the name of law and order. \"We love you. You're very special,\" he said, adding , \"I know how you feel.\"\n\n\"It's very clear that watching this violence was part of the plan,\" said Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria, another committee member, according to the Post . \"He wanted to see it unfold. And it wasn't until he realized that it was not going to be successful that he finally stood up and said something.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Republicans Will End the January 6 Committee. They May Also Investigate It.\n\nRepresentative Bennie Thompson, Chair of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the US Capitol. Jabin Botsford/Pool/CNP/Zuma\n\nRepublicans have won control of the House of Representatives, and that means the January 6 committee will be coming to an end. It might also lead to GOP efforts to exact revenge on the panel by attacking its work-and its members.\n\nThe committee is set to dissolve along with the current Congress on January 3. Had Democrats retained the House, however, they could have renewed the panel.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who hopes to become speaker, has made his hostility to the committee clear, attacking it as partisan. McCarthy has personal stake in the issue. The California Republican spoke to Donald Trump on January 6 and in the following days. Audio tapes later uncovered by New York Times reporters revealed that McCarthy had lied in public statements about his conversations with Trump and other lawmakers at the time. McCarthy is also among Republican lawmakers who the committee has subpoenaed. In a letter explaining McCarthy's refusal to comply with a subpoena, McCarthy's attorney accused the panel of using \"the full force of the federal government to attack perceived political rivals.\"\n\nThe Justice Department and special grand jury in Fulton Country, Ga., are still considering filing criminal charges related to the Trump's effort to retain power. But the congressional committee has a different mandate , in part to \"report upon the facts\" about the attack on Congress and \"interference with the peaceful transfer of power.\" The panel plans to issue a final report before it disbands. Its likely findings were previewed at the committee's last hearing on October 13, where members voted to subpoena former President Donald Trump. \"In staggering betrayal of his oath, Donald Trump attempted a plan that led to an attack on a pillar of our democracy,\" Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), the committee chair, said at the hearing.\n\nThe Associated Press reported last month that committee members and staff are strategizing over how to preserve access for prosecutors and eventually the public to material the committee has gathered, including \"transcripts of more than 1,000 interviews and millions of other documents.\" A committee spokesperson did not respond to an inquiry.\n\nSome Trump loyalists have already said that they want to attack the panel's findings and even its members. GOP lawmakers have reportedly discussed subpoenaing committee members or establishing a new select committee to investigate issues like their contention that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was at fault for lax security at the Capitol on January 6. They might also probe the DOJ's prosecution of rioters.\n\nIt's not clear if McCarthy will back such efforts. A spokesperson for McCarthy did not respond to questions. But given Republicans' narrow majority in the House, McCarthy needs support of the far right in his caucus, including members who have said they hope to target the January 6 committee.\n\nRepublicans are also likely to use subpoena power on other House committees to pursue investigations that they hope will counter the January 6 committee's findings. Rep. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.), the top Republican on the House Administration Committee, said in June that if Republicans win the House, \"one of our first priorities is going to be launching a full investigation into Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Select Committee's circus.\"\n\nDavis was defeated that month by a primary challenger. But the Republican next in line to head the administration committee, Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.), has himself been the subject of scrutiny from the January 6 committee, which sought to question him about a Capitol tour he personally led on January 5, 2021. Loudermilk previously told CNN he hoped to pursue the investigation Davis had announced.\n\nOther GOP members could launch investigations aimed at bolstering election fraud conspiracy theories. Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), who was subpoenaed by the January 6 committee due to his consultations with Trump about overturning the 2020 election results, is among the GOP members who signed a letter asking the House Oversight Committee to hold hearings on bogus election fraud claims made in the debunked movie \"2000 Mules.\"\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who was also subpoenaed after advising Trump in 2020 on his efforts to retain power, is in line to chair the House Judiciary Committee. Jordan, like the other GOP lawmakers subpoenaed, refused to comply. Jordan has already attacked the FBI and Justice Department for investigating Trump. He is expected to use the judiciary panel to try to undermine the department's investigation into the January 6 attack.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The Strongest Words in Joe Biden's January 6 Speech Were Donald Trump's\n\nRicky Fitchett/Zuma\n\nOn Friday , ahead of the third anniversary of the January 6 Capitol attack, President Joe Biden delivered an impassioned campaign speech on what he framed as an urgent matter: This year, \"democracy is on the ballot.\"\n\nMuch of the 30-minute speech-delivered near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, and available to watch in full here -stayed true to Biden's familiar brand of American patriotism. The president revisited the day we \"nearly lost America,\" condemned political violence, and praised the \"ordinary citizens, state election officials,\" and \"the American judicial system,\" which, he said, \"put the Constitution first\" in the fallout from the 2020 election.\n\n\"Because of them, because of you,\" he said, \"The will of the people prevailed.\"\n\nBut the address was also a searing indictment of Donald Trump-and a warning. Biden reminded viewers of Trump's plans if he wins the presidency in 2024, repeatedly invoking the former president's own words and actions. \"Trump's assault on democracy isn't just part of his past,\" Biden said. \"It's what he's promising for the future. He's been straightforward.\"\n\n\"His first rally for the 2024 campaign,\" Biden said of Trump, \"opened with a choir of January 6th insurrectionists singing from prison on a cellphone while images of the January 6th riot played on the big screen behind him at his rally.\"\n\n\"Can you believe that?\" Biden asked.\n\nBiden went on: \"The guy who claims law and order sows lawlessness and disorder...Trump is now promising a full-scale campaign of revenge and retribution , his words, for some years to come. They were his words, not mine.\" Biden also reminded the audience that Trump has said he'd be a dictator on \"day one \" and has called for \" the termination of rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution ,\" to overturn election results.\n\n\"It's really kind of hard to believe,\" Biden said.\n\n\"He calls those who oppose him vermin ,\" Biden continued. \"He talks about [how] the blood of America is being poisoned , echoing the same exact language used in Nazi Germany. He proudly posts on social media the words that best describe his 2024 campaign: Quote, revenge, quote, power, and quote, dictatorship. There's no confusion about who Trump is, what he intends do.\"\n\nIn 2023, Donald Trump posted a word cloud to Truth Social including words like \"power,\" \"revenge,\" and \"dictatorship.\" The Daily Mail produced the graphic to showcase words poll respondents associated with a second Trump term.\n\nTruth Social/Daily Mail\n\nThe message, of course, was that Biden offers a different path. Rather than authoritarian rule, Biden promised that \"the defense, protection, and preservation\" of democracy will remain \"the central cause\" of his presidency.\n\n\"We all know who Donald Trump is,\" he said. \"The question we have to answer is, who are we?\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Kash Patel Suddenly Can't Seem to Remember His Long Record of Extremism\n\nKash Patel evaded questions about his past extremism at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Thursday. J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nKash Patel, President Donald Trump's pick to head the FBI, published a book that included a list of political enemies he characterized as Deep Staters. He called for the prosecution of law enforcement officials who investigated President Donald Trump's effort to steal the 2020 election. He hailed January 6 rioters convicted of violence against police officers as \"political prisoners.\" On social media, he amplified a meme celebrating violence against Trump critics.\n\nYet when Patel appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday for his confirmation hearing, he refused to acknowledge many of the over-the-top statements he has made and actions he has taken as a fierce pro-Trump warrior. He was trying to hide the real Patel.\n\nOf all of Donald Trump's high-level appointments, Patel has the record most replete with remarks and actions in sync with MAGA extremism. Throughout the hearing, Democrats confronted him with examples of his far-right soldiering for Trump-social media posts, quotes from his media interviews, passages from his book-and he kept dodging the questions, claiming the comments were taken out of context or \"partial,\" insisting that he could not recall them, or pleading ignorance.\n\nWhen Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) questioned Patel, he cited a statement Patel made on Steve Bannon's podcast: \"We will go out and find the conspirators, not just in government but in the media...We're going to come after you.\" To this, Patel said, \"That's a partial quotation.\" (The intent of Patel's statement did not differ in the remark's f uller form .)\n\nWhitehouse pointed out that Patel had published in a book what has been widely characterized as an \"enemies list\" of 60 so-called Deep State figures who ought to be investigated and had reposted a video depicting him taking a chainsaw to Trump's political enemies (including former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney and Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff).\n\nAs an aide held up a photo of that particular social media post, Whitehouse asked, \"Is that you reposting that?\" Patel replied, \"Senator, I had nothing to do with the creation of that meme\"-a statement did not address his amplification of the violent imagery.\n\nWhen Whitehouse noted that Patel had pushed the conspiracy theory that FBI agents had instigated the January 6 riot, Patel replied, \"That's completely incorrect.\" ( He had .) And when the senator recounted that Patel once said judges who rule against Donald Turmp should be impeached because they are \"political terrorists,\" Patel just stared at him.\n\nSen Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) asked Patel to explain his support of Trump's lies about the 2020 election and referred to a 2023 interview: \"You said that Donald Trump has every right to tell the world that in 2020, 2016, and every other election in between was rigged by our government, because they were.\" Patel responded, \"I don't have that statement in front of me.\"\n\nWhen Klobuchar noted Trump's claims of election fraud had been rejected by numerous courts, Patel would not accept that. \"I don't have enough of the facts in front of me,\" he commented.\n\nKlobuchar queried Patel about a statement in which he had declared that after a Trump victory there would be prosecutions of Justice Department officials for rigging the 2020 presidential election. \"You're reading a partial statement so I'm unable to respond,\" Patel said.\n\nKlobuchar asked Patel to comment on his suggestion that the FBI headquarters should be shut down and \"reopened as a museum of the Deep State.\" Patel didn't explain this remark. Instead, he complained he was a victim of \"false accusations and gross mischaracterizations.\"\n\nSeveral Democrats pressed Patel on his work with the J6 Prison Choir, a group of January 6 rioters who recorded a version of the national anthem mashed up with Trump reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. The song became a mainstay at Trump's campaign rallies.\n\nPatel told Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) that he promoted the song to raise money for the families of January 6 attackers. But when Durbin asked \"who sings on this recording,\" Patel claimed that he didn't know. Asked if the singers were January 6 rioters, Patel said, \"I'm not aware of that.\" That was a ludicrous answer.\n\nIn fact, in a May 10, 2023 post on Trump's Truth Social platform, Patel said the song came from \"political prisoners still locked in jail without trial following the January 6th protest in 2021. J6 Prison Choir consists of individuals who have been incarcerated as a result of their involvement in the January 6, 2021 protest for election integrity.\"\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) asked Patel if the choir members were \"political prisoners,\" as Patel had described them. \"I don't know everyone in the J6 choir,\" Patel answered. The senator then asked Patel about specific members of the choir, including Ryan Nichols, who was convicted of spraying police officers with pepper spray on January 6, and James McGrew, who was imprisoned for crimes that included throwing a wooden handrail at police officers on January 6 after punching others. Patel said he wasn't familiar with them.\n\nBlumenthal cited another choir member: Ronald Sandlin, who pleaded guilty after he was accused of shouting \"you're going to die\" at police in the Capitol rotunda.\"\n\n\"I don't know who that is,\" Patel said.\n\nThroughout the hearing, Patel downplayed his association with the J6 Prison Choir members and did not acknowledge that his work promoting its song glorified these Trump supporters who had engaged in horrific violence.\n\nLate in the hearing, Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), honed in on Patel's claim that he \"didn't have anything to do with\" the creation of the J6 choir song. Schiff highlighted an interview with Bannon in which Patel, using the word \"we,\" claimed credit for producing the recording of the song. Patel said he had been using \"the proverbial we\" and maintained he had not helped arrange the recording.\n\nSchiff then asked if Patel had bothered to vet the members of the choir to determine if any of them had engaged in violence against police officers. He replied, \"I didn't record it myself.\"\n\nDemocratic senators questioned Patel about his promotion of a line of pills that supposedly would help people \"detox\" from Covid vaccines. \"Spike the Vax, order this homerun kit to rid your body of the harms of the vax,\" Patel wrote in one post, NBC News r eported . Did Patel, Klobuchar inquired, perform clinical trials before claiming the pills cured vaccine side effects? \"I'm not a doctor, so no,\" Patel said .\n\nSen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) asked Patel if he made money from the pills. Patel said she should consult his financial records. \"I don't have those statements in front of me,\" he said.\n\nIn one weird exchange, Durbin asked Patel if he was familiar with Stew Peters, a far-right and antisemitic podcaster known for false claims about Covid.\n\n\"Not off the top of my heard,\" Patel said.\n\n\"You made eight separate appearances on his podcast,\" Durbin responded. (This proved too much even for Peters. \"Clearly Kash Patel is lying,\" the host said after the hearing. \"He absolutely does know who I am.\")\n\nAntisemitic far-right broadcaster Stew Peters responds to Kash Patel claiming that he is not familiar with Peters, despite appearing on his show multiple times: \"Clearly, Kash Patel is lying. He absolutely does know who I am.\"\n\nAgain and again, Patel sidestepped his well-documented past as a Trump extremist who has advocated for vengeance against Trump's political foes. He insisted he would be a neutral enforcer of the law if confirmed as FBI director. The statements, tweets, and quotes that he refused to acknowledge told a different story.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Trump Gets the Peaceful Transfer of Power His Supporters Violently Refused Four Years Ago\n\nVice President Kamala Harris presided over the certification of Trump's Electoral College victory-and her own defeat-in Congress on Monday. Mother Jones illustration; Matt Rourke/AP, Mihoko Owada/STAR MAX/IPx/AP\n\nFour years to the day that Donald Trump incited a violent attack on the US Capitol in an attempt to overthrow the 2020 election results, Congress certified his Electoral College victory as the 47th president of the United States.\n\nAs required of her role presiding over the Senate, Vice President Kamala Harris oversaw the ceremony, which marked her own defeat . In doing so-and in a process rife with irony-Harris was addressed as \"Madam President,\" referring to her role as president of the Senate, as the electoral results of each state were announced. The final tally : 312 to 226.\n\nIn a video posted to X Monday morning, Harris drew an implicit contrast to Trump's approach to his election loss: \"This duty is a sacred obligation-one I will uphold guided by love of country, loyalty to our Constitution, and unwavering faith in the American people.\"\n\nSome Republicans appeared less high-minded, instead peddling revisionist history and suggestions that the label of \"insurrection\" to describe Jan. 6 was overblown. In an especially absurd example, Rep. Mike Collins (R-Ga.) falsely claimed in a post on X that the insurrectionists were made up of \"thousands of peaceful grandmothers\" who took \"a self-guided, albeit unauthorized, tour of the U.S. Capitol building.\" Adding to the misinformation was Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.,) who told a reporter: \"January 6th was not an insurrection. I'm completely sick and tired and fed up of the Democrats' narrative, the media narrative, and it's a total lie.\"\n\nAs my colleague Mark Follman has chronicled , January 6, 2021, was indeed a heavily armed insurrection that saw 140 police officers injured , the deaths of four participants , and five police officers who had been at the Capitol . More than 1,200 people have been charged for their actions on Jan. 6, according to the Department of Justice-and Trump has promised to pardon them .\n\nDemocrats on Monday went to great lengths to emphasize that they were doing what Trump and his allies did not: accepting an election loss and facilitating a peaceful transition of power. They also reminded Americans of what actually happened on Jan. 6.\n\n\"Today, Congress will do its constitutional duty once again to certify the election results-a great contrast from Republicans who sought to deny the election 4 years ago,\" Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) wrote on X Monday morning.\n\nSeveral Democratic members of Congress also shared photos of their destroyed offices and damage sustained to the Capitol four years ago. \"The horrific videos and images from the January 6th insurrection against our Capitol reaffirm as much as ever: The power of the people must always matter more than the people in power,\" Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) wrote , alongside photos of broken glass and overturned furniture.\n\n4 years ago. The horrific videos and images from the January 6th insurrection against our Capitol reaffirm as much as ever: The power of the people must always matter more than the people in power. pic.twitter.com/awY7Md49NI\n\nRep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.) shared a photo of what he said was Capitol Police barricading his office doors and windows \"to protect my staff and I from the violent mob that was just outside my window.\"\n\nIn an op-ed published in the Washington Post on Sunday, President Biden warned of the importance of preserving the facts of the \"assault\" of January 6 for the history books: \"An unrelenting effort has been underway to rewrite-even erase-the history of that day. To tell us we didn't see what we all saw with our own eyes. To dismiss concerns about it as some kind of partisan obsession. To explain it away as a protest that just got out of hand. This is not what happened...We cannot allow the truth to be lost.\"\n\nBiden also called for \"remembering Jan. 6, 2021, every year. To remember it as a day when our democracy was put to the test and prevailed. To remember that democracy-even in America-is never guaranteed.\"\n\nOf course, such warnings to remember what happened on January 6 were absent from Trump's communications. Early Monday morning, he wrote on Truth Social: \"CONGRESS CERTIFIES OUR GREAT ELECTION VICTORY TODAY - A BIG MOMENT IN HISTORY. MAGA!\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The January 6 Committee Gets Ready for Prime Time\n\nThe House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack meeting on December 1, 2021, to consider a criminal contempt charge for a prospective witness. Tom Williams/AP\n\nEditor's note: This column by David Corn first appeared in his newsletter, Our Land. But we wanted to make sure as many readers as possible have a chance to see it. Our Land is written by David twice a week and provides behind-the-scenes stories about politics and media; his unvarnished take on the events of the day; film, book, television, podcast, and music recommendations; interactive audience features; and more. Subscribing costs just $5 a month-but you can sign up for a free 30-day trial of Our Land here . Please check it out.\n\nThe House select committee investigating the January 6 attack is boldly going where congressional committees almost never go: prime time. Next month, the panel is set to hold a week or so of hearings, and to achieve maximum impact, it intends to put on its show in the evening, starting in the 8:00 hour on the East Coast, when there is potential for a large television audience. With this move, the committee could achieve what hasn't occurred in a long time: a congressional hearing that makes a difference.\n\nBlockbuster congressional hearings used to be a fixture in American life. The Army-McCarthy hearings. The Senate Vietnam War hearings (during which a young antiwar vet named John Kerry poignantly remarked, \"How do ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake?\"). The Watergate hearings. Iran-contra. Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill. These and other hearings riveted the nation. (The Thomas-Hill hearings included a dramatic evening session.) Occasionally hearings have made news that has defined issues or yielded significant change. The 1994 hearing that placed in the hot seat the chief executives of the top seven tobacco companies-who each testified that they did not believe cigarettes were addictive-was a landmark moment in the battle against Big Tobacco and corporate malfeasance. Hillary Clinton's marathon 11-hour appearance before a House Benghazi committee demonstrated that the Republicans' conspiratorial allegations were baseless.\n\nYet congressional hearings have generally not had the impact they once did. Overall, the quality of these sessions has decreased. There's usually too much jawboning by senators and representatives who are ill-prepared and interested mostly in producing a soundbite that may or may not be relevant to the subject of the hearing. The sessions can produce viral clips that bring attention to an important subject. (Democratic Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Katie Porter have demonstrated talent in this regard.) And they can still offer drama, as with the Brett Kavanaugh-Christine Blasey Ford showdown. But often they don't do much to alter narratives or the world.\n\nHouse Republicans turned the hearings for the first Donald Trump impeachment into a mess, with their constant braying about Deep State plots and conspiracy theories. It was Russian disinformation and other rigamarole designed to distract from Trump's wrongdoing. And remember the hearing with special counsel Robert Mueller after the release of his report on the Trump-Russia investigation? He was tentative and taciturn and did little to advance the story of Vladimir Putin's attack on the 2016 election and the Trump crew's interactions with Moscow operatives. It's been a while since there was a gangbuster hearing that captured the attention of the public for the right reasons.\n\nThe January 6 committee is trying to do better. Its members and staff have been thinking about how to stage a hearing that matters. They want to captivate the country and convey the full significance of the insurrectionist assault on Congress that prevented the peaceful transfer of power and that nearly caused a breakdown in the nation's constitutional order. To that end, they intend to ensure that each nightly installment contains new revelations, information that can generate headlines and command widespread interest-especially in the face of what will be an all-out campaign waged by Trump and his allies to downplay and denigrate the hearings.\n\nThey also aim to construct compelling and coherent narratives about the different aspects of their multifaceted investigation. The plan is not to only focus on the day of the assault but to show the public the full picture of Trump's efforts to subvert the election. There's a lot to probe here: Trump pressuring state officials to improperly overturn election results; fake electors; links between the Trump White House and right-wing agitators; Trump's attempt to lean on Justice Department officials; the involvement of congressional Republicans in schemes to undermine the vote count; the participation of far-right militias; and more.\n\nOne committee member, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), has displayed the ability to convey a strong narrative in such a setting. He was the lead House impeachment manager for the second Trump impeachment trial. As he notes in his memoir, Unthinkable: Trauma, Truth, and the Trials of American Democracy , when he pulled together the team of House managers for that proceeding, he told them,\n\nWe are not going to get up and make a series of disconnected speeches of great oratory that vanish into thin air. We are going to tell America and the Senate one single, unforgettable story with short, vivid chapters brought to life by you and by video, one spellbinding and appalling narrative about how Donald Trump became obsessed with denying the reality of his defeat and Joe Biden's victory and then set about using every means in the world, first lawful and nonviolent, then unlawful and criminal, and then, finally, violent and criminal, to overthrow the lawful presidential result and replace it what he called his \"continuation in office.\"\n\nAnd Raskin achieved that. The case he and his team presented in the Senate was well-crafted and engaging, featuring gripping and upsetting video that had not been previously seen. They managed to win 57 votes for conviction, including seven Republicans, racking up the first bipartisan conviction majority in an impeachment trial-though it fell ten votes shy of the two-thirds vote required for conviction. Raskin showed that legislators could apply a sense of showmanship and news to a well-constructed presentation. The January 6 committee will not be seeking to win a legal argument, though at the end of its deliberations it could well recommend prosecutions. Its main task is to inform the public, create a historical record, and to highlight the threat to democracy that has not yet been eradicated. But the committee has a better chance of accomplishing this mission, if it can present forceful storytelling with a dash of pizzazz.\n\nWith all hearings, a key component is witnesses. John Dean, the Nixon White House insider who spilled the beans, became the star of the Watergate hearings. The committee has yet to release a list, and we do know that a great many of the key participants have not been cooperating with the panel. The public deserves to hear the testimony of former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, former Vice President Mike Pence, Trump attorney John Eastman, crazy-man lawyer Rudy Giuliani, Ivanka Trump, and others, including the former guy himself. But crucial players are resisting, and the Justice Department has not been rapidly pursuing cases against those cited for contempt. On Thursday, the committee took the unprecedented step of subpoenaing five House Republicans: Kevin McCarthy, Jim Jordan, Scott Perry, Mo Brooks, and Andy Biggs. Each had been asked to provide voluntary testimony about their involvement in Trump's Big Lie schemes and had told the committee to get lost. It's unclear what will happen when they resist the subpoenas, but they won't be testifying at the hearings.\n\nCommittee members and staffers have been saying that they have been surprised by the amount of material their investigation has gathered, including documents and testimony. That suggests there could be surprises at the hearings in terms of witnesses and revelations. Will there be witnesses who saw Trump's actions on January 6? That could be must-see television.\n\nIn all societies, the fight to document history is a crucial endeavor. This is especially so in the face of creeping authoritarianism. Autocrats strive to control the narratives of the past and present to gain and preserve power. Trump and his gang want to diminish the January 6 assault and his attacks on constitutional government to remove the stench that hangs on the GOP and to clear the path for a possible Trump restoration. If they could, they would airbrush all this out of the picture. GOP leaders refused to support the establishment of a bipartisan commission to investigate January 6, which led House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to wisely set up a committee that would not include obstructionist Republicans eager to turn its proceedings into a shitshow. (The two Republicans on the committee are Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, who have broken with the Trump cult.)\n\nThe committee's job is to provide the public a full accounting of Trump's attempted coup and the resulting raid on the Capitol. The early signs are that it could well present a powerful and troubling story. After that, it will be up to the American public to decide what to do with this tale.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The 1/6 Committee Has Concluded Trump Broke the Law. But It May Not Urge DOJ to Charge Him.\n\nDonald Trump speaking on January 6. Shawn Thew/CNP via ZUMA Wire\n\nThe House panel investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol may not send the Justice Department criminal referrals against former President Donald Trump and some of his advisers, despite strong evidence they broke the law, members of the committee say.\n\n\"We have not made a decision on referrals on the committee,\" Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the committee's vice chair, said Sunday on CNN's State of the Union, while calling it \"absolutely clear\" that Trump and people around him knew that their efforts to help him retain power were illegal. \"What we have seen is a massive and well organized and well-planned effort that used multiple tools to try to overturn the election,\" Cheney said.\n\nThe New York Times reported Sunday that committee is divided over sending the Justice Department a referral of Trump. Some committee members and aides worry doing so would contribute to the appearance that any subsequent DOJ prosecution is politicized, according to the Times .\n\nIn a tweet Sunday, Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) argued committee members are not at odds over a Trump referral. \"There is no split,\" Kinzinger said.\n\nAn important factor in the committee's deliberations is that criminal referrals by Congress have no official influence on federal prosecutors. They are largely symbolic. The committee still plans to issue a report that is expected to include evidence that Trump and some of his advisers broke the law. The Justice Department will weigh that evidence regardless of whether the panel explicitly advocates prosecuting Trump. \"Maybe we will, maybe we won't,\" Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) told the Times , regarding a Trump referral. \"It doesn't have a legal impact.\"\n\nLofgren cited a recent ruling by David Carter, a federal district court judge in California, who said that it was \"more likely than not\" that Trump and John Eastman, a lawyer who advised Trump, had committed multiple crimes by plotting to obstruct a joint session of Congress on January 6 to certify the election results. Carter's finding came in an order compelling Eastman to comply with a subpoena for emails he wrote. But the ruling also serves as roadmap for charging Trump. And committee members believe it will carry more weight with Attorney General Merrick Garland, a former federal appeals court judge, than the panel's own referral, the Times reported.\n\nThe Justice Department's January 6 investigation has reportedly expanded, with a grand jury empaneled to help investigate Trump advisers and preparations for the rally that preceded the riot, according to multiple reports. On Friday, Ali Alexander, the founder of a Stop the Steal group who helped organize events on January 6, said he was complying with a grand jury subpoena that he received as part of that expanded probe.\n\nThe department's sprawling investigation into the attack also got a breakthrough Friday when Charles Donohoe, a Proud Boys leader from North Carolina, pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges related to January 6. In a court filing connected to his plea, prosecutors said Donohoe is prepared to testify that the Proud Boys planned on January 6 \"to obstruct, impede, or interfere with the certification of the Electoral College vote\" and that they would \"use of force and violence\" carry out that plan.\n\nCheney noted that the Proud Boys and other far right groups that took part in the January 6 attack had begun planning in earnest after Trump on December 19 tweeted : \"Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!\"\n\n\"They knew that they were going to attempt to use violence to try to stop the transfer of power,\" Cheney told CNN. \"That is the definition of an insurrection, and it is absolutely chilling.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Activate your online access\n\nTrump's lawyers are bizarrely trying to link me (yes, me) to January 6. It's a sign that the former president's case is less than airtight.\n\nA supporter holds a print depicting Donald Trump's mug shot as he waits for him to arrive at the Whiskey River bar on December 2, 2023, in Ankeny, Iowa.\n\nEvery American who is charged with a crime has the right to mount a robust defense. That includes Donald Trump. Unfortunately, Trump's attempt to defend himself from charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith in relation to his efforts to nullify the results of the 2020 election has taken a surreal turn.\n\nIn discovery documents filed in late November, Trump's lawyers revealed that the former president is apparently building his defense based on Internet conspiracy theories , including one involving... me.\n\nThe Washington Post reported Tuesday : \"In court filings last week, the former president revealed that he has been pressing the Justice Department for information on far-right claims often elevated in his speeches, on his social media feeds and by his conservative allies in Congress-further blurring the line between his campaign and his court battles.\"\n\nA letter from Trump's lawyers to the Justice Department makes dozens of requests for documents relating to actions by \"foreign actors, whether state or non-state, to 'undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process,'\" \"Antifa or persons or persons associated with law enforcement who encouraged or participated in any illegal activities on January 6,\" \"communications between [acting chief of the United States Capitol Police] Yogananda Pittman and Nancy Pelosi, Nancy Pelosi's staff, or representative of Nancy Pelosi,\" and \"John Nichols, or any similar persons who encouraged or participated in any illegal activities on January 6th.\" The Post 's piece explains that the last reference is not to some other John Nichols but to \"a liberal journalist in Wisconsin.\"\n\nI can't speak for Pelosi, but I have to think that my inclusion on this list, as someone who wasn't anywhere near the US Capitol, or even Washington, D.C., on January 6, is a sign that the former president's case is less than airtight.\n\nWhat's going on? As part of the effort to defend Trump's actions leading up to the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol, the likely 2024 Republican presidential nominee and his allies have intimated that federal agents and/or bad actors-presumably associated with \"the deep state\"-provoked trouble that day. These arguments have failed to gain traction even with many Republicans, because they frequently defy logic.\n\nFor instance, I'm a particularly odd person to associate with the intelligence community, \"deep\" or otherwise, as I've written extensively about the importance of preserving privacy rights in an era of mass surveillance, and I have argued against efforts to punish Julian Assange and Edward Snowden for revealing details of government wrongdoing. But, apparently, some of the more conspiracy-minded Trump supporters invented a scenario in which I was in D.C. on January 6 as an agent provocateur who climbed a scaffold outside the Capitol and urged protesters to move toward the building.\n\nOn top of that, as someone who has done hundreds of cable news interviews-including several on Tucker Carlson's old Fox News show-I'm not sure it makes much sense to suggest that I could have anonymously blended in with the hyper-political crowd that surrounded the Capitol on January 6.\n\nBut common sense does not always prevail.\n\nI first heard about this particular conspiracy theory a little over a year ago, from Caitlin Graf, who does publicity for The Nation. She sent over an online post that compared an old picture of me-from long before I got bifocals-with that of an alleged protester. The argument was that we might be the same person because we had similar glasses and facial features. I didn't know if the picture of the protester was legitimate, or if I have a doppelgänger. But I certainly knew that I hadn't been at the Capitol that day. So did Caitlin and other folks at The Nation who had helped edit and amplify the journalism that our staff produced on one of the busiest days in the magazine's history.\n\nI sent a DM to the person who was speculating about me and explained I wasn't in DC on the 6th. He responded politely, saying he'd note my clarification, and I didn't hear much more about the matter. Things would show up on Twitter now and again. But the references were rare and seemingly inconsequential. So that was that.\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nJeet Heer\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nUntil the other day, when I got a call from Rachel Weiner, an able reporter for the Post who was following Trump's D.C. case and had found the reference to me in the paperwork filed by his lawyers. I didn't know how it got there, but I was delighted to talk about what I was doing on January 6, 2021.\n\nTo clear up any confusion on the part of the former president or his lawyers, I was in Madison, Wis., the city where I've written about politics for The Nation for the past two decades. That morning, I was up early to check on the final results from the Georgia runoff elections that gave Democrats control of the US Senate. That was a big story but, as someone who had written a book on the contested election of 2000, along with dozens of articles on the Electoral College and the arcane processes by which the votes that choose the president are counted, I was also excited to settle in and watch C-SPAN's coverage of the congressional review of the electoral votes from across the country. But first I had to take my daughter to the orthodontist on the east side of Madison. That meant I missed Trump's rally on the Ellipse , but I wasn't bothered by that; I hadn't expected that it would turn into such a big deal.\n\nBy the time I got home, it was almost noon in Madison, and the count, with all its pomp and circumstance, was beginning. Like most Americans, I was initially confused when the process was interrupted and Vice President Mike Pence and members of Congress were swept out of the room. But it quickly became clear that this was not going to be a traditional review of reports from the states.\n\nMy first instinct was to start calling people in D.C. I had a long conversation with US Representative Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) who was in his office on Capitol Hill. Once we'd established that he was safe and could talk, we reviewed what had happened so far. By then, Pocan and I both knew the basics of what had happened and were already talking about potential consequences. I've written several books dealing with presidential accountability, including a popular history of the impeachment process , so I was interested in whether House members were talking about holding Trump to account for inciting an insurrection in the last days of his presidency. I got my answer quickly. Newly elected US Representative Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.) called for impeachment within minutes of the disruption of the count, and not long after that US Representative Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) signaled that she would be drawing up articles of impeachment. At about 1:30 my time, I reached out to US Representative Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who was sheltering in the Cannon House Office Building, and it became clear to me that members of Congress were already weighing questions of whether to censure or impeach, or perhaps encourage Trump's cabinet to invoke 25th Amendment's provisions for removing presidents.\n\nI pulled together the information I had gathered, started writing, and got a story filed to my then-editor, Anna Hiatt, by mid-afternoon. I also fit in an interview on Jeff Santos's syndicated radio show and various other media conversations. And I joined fellow Nation writers and editor Don Guttenplan in filing short takes for The Nation 's live blog , which Jeet Heer had pulled together.\n\nWhat I had to say that day about Donald Trump was tough, and it got tougher. In my columns, I wrote extensively about the impeachment power and other accountability tools. That probably didn't make Trump or his most ardent backers view me in a favorable light, which some folks have assumed is why Trump loyalists turned their attention to me. I don't know. But what I do know is that this is part of a very serious issue we face as a nation.\n\nThere's a growing tendency, by folks on the right and the left, to assume that people they disagree with are always out to wreck their rivals. In addition to harming the basic workings of democracy-which require us to respect that Americans can hold radically different views and still have faith in the process-this theory narrows political discourse in a way that undermines the development of the broad coalitions that have always been needed to challenge political and corporate elites in general, and the intelligence community and the military-industrial complex in particular.\n\nFor decades, I've written about people from across the political spectrum who seek to build those coalitions, including conservative and libertarian-leaning Republicans, such as Rand Paul and Justin Amash , who have defended privacy rights and challenged the military-industrial complex. I'll keep doing so, with the faith that people can disagree without despising or distrusting one another. I'd like to think that Donald Trump might even come to that conclusion, and if he did I'd be more than ready to write about it. Unfortunately for the former president, however, I'm not ready to be his alibi.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

This was the response after the race riots of 1919, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, President Kennedy's assassination, the race riots of the 1960s, 9/11, and other collective tragedies. A new volume has been added to the shelves that house this curious genre: the just-released report on the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. Although born of calamity, the thinking behind these reports is curiously optimistic: If you can just convene the right bipartisan team of experts, politicians, and dignitaries, you will arrive at a collective truth that can make sense of seemingly inexplicable events. The coherent narrative offered by these reports will help the nation solve its problems and avoid future catastrophes. If that's the theory, then it's never quite worked out. The Warren Commission famously never answered questions about the Kennedy assassination sufficient to quiet conspiracy theories. To this day the CIA, in defiance of congressional demands, refuses to release thousands of documents on the assassination, including information about what it knew about Lee Harvey Oswald prior to the presidential murder. Many lingering questions remain about the attacks on Pearl Harbor and the terrorism of 9/11 (where, again, much valuable material remains classified). In analyzing the Black urban uprisings of the 1960s, the Kerner Commission Report of 1967 offered a scathing indictment of systematic racism-that proved too radical for Lyndon Johnson. The Starr Report on the alleged corruption of Bill Clinton became the butt of endless lewd jokes on late-night TV thanks to the all-too-vivid details it provided about Oval Office oral sex. The January 6 report might not escape the same sorry long-term fate. To be sure, the commission that crafted the report has had some successes. The hearings drew a wide audience -and seem to have hardened public opinion against former president Donald Trump's continuing efforts to subvert American democracy. Republican candidates who denied the 2020 election did poorly in the midterms , especially those in key positions that could derail the 2024 election results. In general, the Democrats outperformed expectations in the 2022 midterms. All of this is surely due in no small part to the January 6 committee.

April 18, 2025 But the report issued by the committee also has a broader purpose: to establish a convincing account of the coup attempt that can shape public memory. Harvard historian Jill Lepore, writing in The New Yorker , offered a scathing critique of the report, convincingly portraying it as a narrowly focused indictment of Donald Trump that ignores broader political forces that created the coup. In 2016, Donald Trump ran on the boast \"I alone can fix it.\" The January 6 report merely flips the script by saying Trump alone can break it. The report concludes that \"the central cause of January 6th was one man, former President Donald Trump.\" It offers a detailed chronology of Trump's actions in the months before January 6. They show that as a candidate he was already casting doubt on the election results before the first votes were cast, that after the defeat he used every means available to undermine the determination of the results, and that he finally settled on a desperate constitutional theory that would throw the results to Congress. Current Issue View our current issue Where the Warren Commission blamed Oswald as the lone gunman, the January 6 report casts Trump as the lone coup plotter. As Lepore notes, \"In the January 6 report, Donald Trump acted alone and came out of nowhere. He has no past. Neither does the nation. The rest of the country doesn't even exist.\" Evaluating the report, Lepore concludes, \"As a brief for the prosecution, it's a start. As a book, it's essential if miserable reading. As history, it's a shambles.\" There is no need to contest the low grade that Lepore bestows upon the report. She has effectively hit on the fatal flaw of the enterprise: the inadequacy of a purely Trump-centric history. The problem is that the failures of the January 6 report are shared by Lepore's counternarrative, an incoherent litany of centrist complaints that oscillates between a dim awareness of Republican extremism and a more muddled attempt to lay blame on both sides. Lepore rightly rejects the idea that the \"Big Lie\" (the claim the 2020 election was stolen by Democrats) was just a Trump concoction. As she notes, It is an elaborate fiction, an artful story, with heroes and villains, exotic locales, and a sinister plot. The election was stolen by a cabal of Democrats, socialists, immigrants, criminals, Black people, and spies. This story is vicious and idiotic, and none of it is true, but it is not a Big Lie devised by an orange-haired supervillain born rich in 1946: it is the latest chapter in a fictive counter-history of the United States which has been told by the far right for decades and decades and wretched decades. This is spot-on and echoes the best recent scholarship on the American right done by historians such as Edward H. Miller and Nicole Hemmer -a body of work that emphasizes the deep roots of authoritarianism and conspiracy mongering in the GOP that goes back decades. But Lepore isn't comfortable with this focus on the dangers of just the right. She insists, in good centrist fashion, that both sides are to blame. To figure out the roots of January 6, she contends, requires a historical vantage on the decay of the party system, the celebration of political intolerance by both the right and the left, the contribution of social media to political extremism, and the predicament of American journalism. Calling the system rigged when you're losing is an old trick. At the end of the Cold War, American zealots turned their most ruthless ideological weapons on one another, Manicheans all. Lepore blames Newt Gingrich for cynically pushing the message of a stolen presidential election in 1992. Then she quotes Bernie Sanders in 2016 as saying, \"The system is rigged.\" Lepore offers this gloss on Sanders's message: \"primaries rigged against challengers, the economy rigged against working people. Suspecting that things like elections might be rigged, even when that's not true, isn't a crazy conspiracy theory; it is a political product routinely sold to voters in every city and state in the country.\" Related Articles January 6 Comes for Kevin McCarthy Joan Walsh The January 6 Report and Trump's Gospel of Success Chris Lehmann Jamie Raskin's Clear-Eyed View of the Mess House Republicans Are Making of Congress John Nichols Lepore draws an absurd equivalence between Gingrich and Trump on one side and Bernie Sanders on the other. But Sanders wasn't offering a conspiracy theory. He was pointing out real systemic problems in the economy and the political system: the inequality that gives an outsize voice to wealthy donors and drowns out popular discontent. This is undeniably true. In the 1930s in Germany, both the socialist party and the Nazis (or National Socialists) tried to harness popular anger at the very real grievances of ordinary voters. The socialists offered real solutions; the Nazis offered demagogic racism. What would we think of a historian who claimed that the 1930s showed \"the celebration of political intolerance by both the right and the left\"? Typical of centrists, Lepore prefers to focus on issues of style and rhetoric over substance. Thus, she decries harsh political language and the supposedly baneful effect of social media. But these matters of messaging are trivial. A truer account of the origins of January 6 that tried to move beyond Trump could find genuine bipartisan responsibility if it focused on shared policy failures. The Clintonian embrace of neoliberalism in the 1990s wreaked economic havoc on the working class that made Trump's demagoguery more persuasive. Bipartisan support for the Global War on Terror after 9/11 helped legitimize the xenophobia that Trump would come to exploit and created a nation fearful of the world. The failure of the Obama administration to push for a strong stimulus in 2009 and 2010 ensured a lost economic decade, again driving desperation. Lepore doesn't address any of these salient issues of policy. Her focus is on blaming partisan rhetoric and social media. Like the January 6 report, she offers a thin version of history, one that does nothing to get at the root causes of the current crisis. If we want to avoid another January 6, we need to move beyond the report-and also beyond shallow centrist criticism.\n\nA new volume has been added to the shelves that house this curious genre: the just-released report on the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.

What would we think of a historian who claimed that the 1930s showed \"the celebration of political intolerance by both the right and the left\"? Typical of centrists, Lepore prefers to focus on issues of style and rhetoric over substance. Thus, she decries harsh political language and the supposedly baneful effect of social media. But these matters of messaging are trivial. A truer account of the origins of January 6 that tried to move beyond Trump could find genuine bipartisan responsibility if it focused on shared policy failures. The Clintonian embrace of neoliberalism in the 1990s wreaked economic havoc on the working class that made Trump's demagoguery more persuasive. Bipartisan support for the Global War on Terror after 9/11 helped legitimize the xenophobia that Trump would come to exploit and created a nation fearful of the world. The failure of the Obama administration to push for a strong stimulus in 2009 and 2010 ensured a lost economic decade, again driving desperation. Lepore doesn't address any of these salient issues of policy. Her focus is on blaming partisan rhetoric and social media. Like the January 6 report, she offers a thin version of history, one that does nothing to get at the root causes of the current crisis. If we want to avoid another January 6, we need to move beyond the report-and also beyond shallow centrist criticism.\n\nThe January 6 report might not escape the same sorry long-term fate. To be sure, the commission that crafted the report has had some successes. The hearings drew a wide audience -and seem to have hardened public opinion against former president Donald Trump's continuing efforts to subvert American democracy. Republican candidates who denied the 2020 election did poorly in the midterms , especially those in key positions that could derail the 2024 election results. In general, the Democrats outperformed expectations in the 2022 midterms. All of this is surely due in no small part to the January 6 committee.

April 18, 2025 But the report issued by the committee also has a broader purpose: to establish a convincing account of the coup attempt that can shape public memory. Harvard historian Jill Lepore, writing in The New Yorker , offered a scathing critique of the report, convincingly portraying it as a narrowly focused indictment of Donald Trump that ignores broader political forces that created the coup. In 2016, Donald Trump ran on the boast \"I alone can fix it.\" The January 6 report merely flips the script by saying Trump alone can break it. The report concludes that \"the central cause of January 6th was one man, former President Donald Trump.\" It offers a detailed chronology of Trump's actions in the months before January 6. They show that as a candidate he was already casting doubt on the election results before the first votes were cast, that after the defeat he used every means available to undermine the determination of the results, and that he finally settled on a desperate constitutional theory that would throw the results to Congress. Current Issue View our current issue Where the Warren Commission blamed Oswald as the lone gunman, the January 6 report casts Trump as the lone coup plotter. As Lepore notes, \"In the January 6 report, Donald Trump acted alone and came out of nowhere. He has no past. Neither does the nation. The rest of the country doesn't even exist.\" Evaluating the report, Lepore concludes, \"As a brief for the prosecution, it's a start. As a book, it's essential if miserable reading. As history, it's a shambles.\" There is no need to contest the low grade that Lepore bestows upon the report. She has effectively hit on the fatal flaw of the enterprise: the inadequacy of a purely Trump-centric history. The problem is that the failures of the January 6 report are shared by Lepore's counternarrative, an incoherent litany of centrist complaints that oscillates between a dim awareness of Republican extremism and a more muddled attempt to lay blame on both sides. Lepore rightly rejects the idea that the \"Big Lie\" (the claim the 2020 election was stolen by Democrats) was just a Trump concoction. As she notes, It is an elaborate fiction, an artful story, with heroes and villains, exotic locales, and a sinister plot. The election was stolen by a cabal of Democrats, socialists, immigrants, criminals, Black people, and spies. This story is vicious and idiotic, and none of it is true, but it is not a Big Lie devised by an orange-haired supervillain born rich in 1946: it is the latest chapter in a fictive counter-history of the United States which has been told by the far right for decades and decades and wretched decades. This is spot-on and echoes the best recent scholarship on the American right done by historians such as Edward H. Miller and Nicole Hemmer -a body of work that emphasizes the deep roots of authoritarianism and conspiracy mongering in the GOP that goes back decades. But Lepore isn't comfortable with this focus on the dangers of just the right. She insists, in good centrist fashion, that both sides are to blame. To figure out the roots of January 6, she contends, requires a historical vantage on the decay of the party system, the celebration of political intolerance by both the right and the left, the contribution of social media to political extremism, and the predicament of American journalism. Calling the system rigged when you're losing is an old trick. At the end of the Cold War, American zealots turned their most ruthless ideological weapons on one another, Manicheans all. Lepore blames Newt Gingrich for cynically pushing the message of a stolen presidential election in 1992. Then she quotes Bernie Sanders in 2016 as saying, \"The system is rigged.\" Lepore offers this gloss on Sanders's message: \"primaries rigged against challengers, the economy rigged against working people. Suspecting that things like elections might be rigged, even when that's not true, isn't a crazy conspiracy theory; it is a political product routinely sold to voters in every city and state in the country.\" Related Articles January 6 Comes for Kevin McCarthy Joan Walsh The January 6 Report and Trump's Gospel of Success Chris Lehmann Jamie Raskin's Clear-Eyed View of the Mess House Republicans Are Making of Congress John Nichols Lepore draws an absurd equivalence between Gingrich and Trump on one side and Bernie Sanders on the other. But Sanders wasn't offering a conspiracy theory.

Lepore doesn't address any of these salient issues of policy. Her focus is on blaming partisan rhetoric and social media. Like the January 6 report, she offers a thin version of history, one that does nothing to get at the root causes of the current crisis. If we want to avoid another January 6, we need to move beyond the report-and also beyond shallow centrist criticism.\n\nIt is an elaborate fiction, an artful story, with heroes and villains, exotic locales, and a sinister plot. The election was stolen by a cabal of Democrats, socialists, immigrants, criminals, Black people, and spies. This story is vicious and idiotic, and none of it is true, but it is not a Big Lie devised by an orange-haired supervillain born rich in 1946: it is the latest chapter in a fictive counter-history of the United States which has been told by the far right for decades and decades and wretched decades.\n\nThis is spot-on and echoes the best recent scholarship on the American right done by historians such as Edward H. Miller and Nicole Hemmer -a body of work that emphasizes the deep roots of authoritarianism and conspiracy mongering in the GOP that goes back decades. But Lepore isn't comfortable with this focus on the dangers of just the right. She insists, in good centrist fashion, that both sides are to blame. To figure out the roots of January 6, she contends, requires a historical vantage on the decay of the party system, the celebration of political intolerance by both the right and the left, the contribution of social media to political extremism, and the predicament of American journalism. Calling the system rigged when you're losing is an old trick. At the end of the Cold War, American zealots turned their most ruthless ideological weapons on one another, Manicheans all. Lepore blames Newt Gingrich for cynically pushing the message of a stolen presidential election in 1992. Then she quotes Bernie Sanders in 2016 as saying, \"The system is rigged.\" Lepore offers this gloss on Sanders's message: \"primaries rigged against challengers, the economy rigged against working people. Suspecting that things like elections might be rigged, even when that's not true, isn't a crazy conspiracy theory; it is a political product routinely sold to voters in every city and state in the country.\" Related Articles January 6 Comes for Kevin McCarthy Joan Walsh The January 6 Report and Trump's Gospel of Success Chris Lehmann Jamie Raskin's Clear-Eyed View of the Mess House Republicans Are Making of Congress John Nichols Lepore draws an absurd equivalence between Gingrich and Trump on one side and Bernie Sanders on the other. But Sanders wasn't offering a conspiracy theory. He was pointing out real systemic problems in the economy and the political system: the inequality that gives an outsize voice to wealthy donors and drowns out popular discontent. This is undeniably true. In the 1930s in Germany, both the socialist party and the Nazis (or National Socialists) tried to harness popular anger at the very real grievances of ordinary voters. The socialists offered real solutions; the Nazis offered demagogic racism. What would we think of a historian who claimed that the 1930s showed \"the celebration of political intolerance by both the right and the left\"? Typical of centrists, Lepore prefers to focus on issues of style and rhetoric over substance. Thus, she decries harsh political language and the supposedly baneful effect of social media. But these matters of messaging are trivial. A truer account of the origins of January 6 that tried to move beyond Trump could find genuine bipartisan responsibility if it focused on shared policy failures. The Clintonian embrace of neoliberalism in the 1990s wreaked economic havoc on the working class that made Trump's demagoguery more persuasive.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

It is \"the offense of attempting by overt acts to overthrow the government of the state to which the offender owes allegiance.\" History provides a catalogue of illustrations of treasonous acts. But rarely have we gotten so precise a play-by-play of \"overt acts to overthrow the government\" as has been provided by the hearings of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the US Capitol. The evidence mounted Thursday evening, as the committee examined the more than three hours on January 6, 2021, during which Donald Trump actively aided and abetted the violent coup he had plotted to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election that confirmed the defeat of his bid for a second term. Thursday's prime-time hearing revealed a sitting president who refused to abide by his oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and instead facilitated the violence of armed insurrectionists whom he had called into action with a December 19, 2020, message to supporters-\"Come to D.C. January 6th; Will be Wild!\"-and with a \"Stop the Steal\" rally cry of \" Fight like hell! \" As the central figure in the conspiracy to initiate that fight, Trump knew exactly the significance of his actions when, in the words of January 6th Committee chair Bennie Thompson, he \" could not be moved \" to use the immense powers at his command to stop the deadly violence. \"For hours, Donald Trump chose not to answer the pleas from Congress, from his own party, and from all across the nation to do what his oath required,\" explained January 6th Committee vice chair Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.). \"He refused to defend our nation and our Constitution. He refused to do what every American president must.\" More From John Nichols The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" April 25, 2025 The Pope Who Decried the Savage Inequalities of Billionaire-Class Capitalism April 21, 2025 A Pope Who Prays for Palestine April 20, 2025 What explains Trump's failure to do his duty on January 6, 2021? Was he paralyzed by fear? Was he overwhelmed by the chaos? Was he uncertain of how to most effectively counter an insurrectionist mob's deadly assault on the Capitol? Was he getting mixed signals from aides such as Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and White House counsel Pat Cipollone? Or from family members such as Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner? Was there a technological barrier to Trump's issuing a call on the insurrectionists to stand down?

It was a landslide election and everyone knows it...\"-before finally saying, \"I know how you feel, but go home, and go home in peace.\" Current Issue View our current issue \"President Trump did not fail to act during the 187 minutes between leaving the Ellipse and telling the mob to go home,\" said Kinzinger. \"He chose not to act.\" Why? \"The mob was accomplishing President Trump's purpose so, of course, he didn't intervene,\" explained the congressman. The chaos in the Capitol bought Trump time to continue his project of overturning the election. Instead of intervening to stop the violence at the Capitol, the president was making calls to encourage senators to reject Electoral College votes from the battleground states that had handed the 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden. As the violence escalated, the president sent a 2:24 pm tweet that declared, \"Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done.\" With that tweet, Representative Elaine Luria (D-Va.) told the committee on Thursday night, \"President Trump...put a target on his own vice president's back.\" Trump was not a bystander. He was actively engaged in implementing the coup he had plotted. Thursday's hearing confirmed and amplified the dramatic June 28 testimony of former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson on the president's refusal to act on January 6. We now have, as journalist Carl Bernstein explained Thursday evening, the portrait of \"an out of control, criminal, seditious, mad president.\" What words should we use to describe Trump's criminality? After Thursday night's hearing, former federal prosecutor Glenn Kirschner described Trump's actions during those three hours on January 6 as \"treasonous.\" Referencing the Constitution's definition of treason, Kirschner said , \"What we know, based on all of the evidence in these public hearings is Donald Trump levied war, he waged war against the United States, against the democratic process.\" His was not an isolated assessment. \"It wasn't dereliction of duty, it was treason,\" declared former Republican Representative Joe Walsh on Thursday night. MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, another former Republican member of Congress, argued before the hearing, \"Donald Trump committed treason against the United States of America. If you're wondering what January 6th is about. It's about treason.\" \"Treason\" is a charged word. It should not be used casually. Yet what better word is there to describe the actions of a president who plotted a coup, urged it on, and then-as the violence flared-used the opening to renew an effort to overturn the results of an election in which he was defeated? It is unlikely that Trump will ever be formally charged with treason. Yet saying the word matters. It provides clarity as the discussion turns to the issue of accountability for Trump's crimes on what former White House aide Sarah Matthews said Thursday was \"one of the darkest days in American history.\" Representative Thompson began Thursday's hearing by declaring, \"If there is no accountability for January 6, for every part of this scheme, I fear that we will not overcome the ongoing threat to our democracy. There must be stiff consequences for those responsible.\" Those consequences will not be determined by the committee, or by a Congress that refused to convict an impeached Donald Trump for inciting insurrection. They will be determined by the Department of Justice, which has the authority to prosecute Trump, and by the judges and juries who may be asked to consider charges against the former president. Constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe says the January 6th Committee has \"made it much easier\" for Attorney General Merrick Garland to charge Trump with wrongdoing-up to and including charges of seditious conspiracy, which Tribe notes \"is just short of treason,\" and aiding and abetting a violent insurrection. Garland, who has faced criticism for what many see as a tepid approach to accountability issues, said Wednesday that the DOJ is engaged in \"the most wide-ranging investigation and the most important investigation that the Justice Department has ever entered into.\" That is good, because, as Tribe noted on Thursday, we now have evidence that Trump acted on January 6 as \"an arsonist [who] sets fire to a building and then watches while it burns-rather than turning on the hose.\" That's one way of saying it. Another way of saying it is that Donald Trump is an offender who attempted by overt acts to overthrow the government of the state to which he owed allegiance.\n\nHistory provides a catalogue of illustrations of treasonous acts.

It is unlikely that Trump will ever be formally charged with treason. Yet saying the word matters. It provides clarity as the discussion turns to the issue of accountability for Trump's crimes on what former White House aide Sarah Matthews said Thursday was \"one of the darkest days in American history.\" Representative Thompson began Thursday's hearing by declaring, \"If there is no accountability for January 6, for every part of this scheme, I fear that we will not overcome the ongoing threat to our democracy. There must be stiff consequences for those responsible.\" Those consequences will not be determined by the committee, or by a Congress that refused to convict an impeached Donald Trump for inciting insurrection. They will be determined by the Department of Justice, which has the authority to prosecute Trump, and by the judges and juries who may be asked to consider charges against the former president. Constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe says the January 6th Committee has \"made it much easier\" for Attorney General Merrick Garland to charge Trump with wrongdoing-up to and including charges of seditious conspiracy, which Tribe notes \"is just short of treason,\" and aiding and abetting a violent insurrection. Garland, who has faced criticism for what many see as a tepid approach to accountability issues, said Wednesday that the DOJ is engaged in \"the most wide-ranging investigation and the most important investigation that the Justice Department has ever entered into.\" That is good, because, as Tribe noted on Thursday, we now have evidence that Trump acted on January 6 as \"an arsonist [who] sets fire to a building and then watches while it burns-rather than turning on the hose.\" That's one way of saying it. Another way of saying it is that Donald Trump is an offender who attempted by overt acts to overthrow the government of the state to which he owed allegiance.\n\nThursday's prime-time hearing revealed a sitting president who refused to abide by his oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and instead facilitated the violence of armed insurrectionists whom he had called into action with a December 19, 2020, message to supporters-\"Come to D.C. January 6th; Will be Wild!\"-and with a \"Stop the Steal\" rally cry of \" Fight like hell! \" As the central figure in the conspiracy to initiate that fight, Trump knew exactly the significance of his actions when, in the words of January 6th Committee chair Bennie Thompson, he \" could not be moved \" to use the immense powers at his command to stop the deadly violence. \"For hours, Donald Trump chose not to answer the pleas from Congress, from his own party, and from all across the nation to do what his oath required,\" explained January 6th Committee vice chair Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.). \"He refused to defend our nation and our Constitution.

Constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe says the January 6th Committee has \"made it much easier\" for Attorney General Merrick Garland to charge Trump with wrongdoing-up to and including charges of seditious conspiracy, which Tribe notes \"is just short of treason,\" and aiding and abetting a violent insurrection. Garland, who has faced criticism for what many see as a tepid approach to accountability issues, said Wednesday that the DOJ is engaged in \"the most wide-ranging investigation and the most important investigation that the Justice Department has ever entered into.\" That is good, because, as Tribe noted on Thursday, we now have evidence that Trump acted on January 6 as \"an arsonist [who] sets fire to a building and then watches while it burns-rather than turning on the hose.\" That's one way of saying it. Another way of saying it is that Donald Trump is an offender who attempted by overt acts to overthrow the government of the state to which he owed allegiance.\n\nWhy? \"The mob was accomplishing President Trump's purpose so, of course, he didn't intervene,\" explained the congressman. The chaos in the Capitol bought Trump time to continue his project of overturning the election. Instead of intervening to stop the violence at the Capitol, the president was making calls to encourage senators to reject Electoral College votes from the battleground states that had handed the 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden. As the violence escalated, the president sent a 2:24 pm tweet that declared, \"Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done.\" With that tweet, Representative Elaine Luria (D-Va.) told the committee on Thursday night, \"President Trump...put a target on his own vice president's back.\" Trump was not a bystander. He was actively engaged in implementing the coup he had plotted. Thursday's hearing confirmed and amplified the dramatic June 28 testimony of former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson on the president's refusal to act on January 6. We now have, as journalist Carl Bernstein explained Thursday evening, the portrait of \"an out of control, criminal, seditious, mad president.\" What words should we use to describe Trump's criminality? After Thursday night's hearing, former federal prosecutor Glenn Kirschner described Trump's actions during those three hours on January 6 as \"treasonous.\" Referencing the Constitution's definition of treason, Kirschner said , \"What we know, based on all of the evidence in these public hearings is Donald Trump levied war, he waged war against the United States, against the democratic process.\" His was not an isolated assessment. \"It wasn't dereliction of duty, it was treason,\" declared former Republican Representative Joe Walsh on Thursday night. MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, another former Republican member of Congress, argued before the hearing, \"Donald Trump committed treason against the United States of America. If you're wondering what January 6th is about. It's about treason.\" \"Treason\" is a charged word. It should not be used casually. Yet what better word is there to describe the actions of a president who plotted a coup, urged it on, and then-as the violence flared-used the opening to renew an effort to overturn the results of an election in which he was defeated? It is unlikely that Trump will ever be formally charged with treason. Yet saying the word matters. It provides clarity as the discussion turns to the issue of accountability for Trump's crimes on what former White House aide Sarah Matthews said Thursday was \"one of the darkest days in American history.\" Representative Thompson began Thursday's hearing by declaring, \"If there is no accountability for January 6, for every part of this scheme, I fear that we will not overcome the ongoing threat to our democracy. There must be stiff consequences for those responsible.\" Those consequences will not be determined by the committee, or by a Congress that refused to convict an impeached Donald Trump for inciting insurrection.

Another way of saying it is that Donald Trump is an offender who attempted by overt acts to overthrow the government of the state to which he owed allegiance.\n\nGarland, who has faced criticism for what many see as a tepid approach to accountability issues, said Wednesday that the DOJ is engaged in \"the most wide-ranging investigation and the most important investigation that the Justice Department has ever entered into.\" That is good, because, as Tribe noted on Thursday, we now have evidence that Trump acted on January 6 as \"an arsonist [who] sets fire to a building and then watches while it burns-rather than turning on the hose.\" That's one way of saying it.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker / Getty Images)\n\nThe coup attempt that Donald Trump facilitated on January 6, 2021, was rooted in two threats to the fair functioning of democracy in the United States: Trump's refusal to accept his defeat at the hands of the American electorate, and the arcane mechanisms of the Electoral College that provide sore losers with multiple avenues for contesting election results. The Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol addressed the first threat when it referred charges against Trump to the US Department of Justice. But the committee's refusal to reckon with the second threat-that of the Electoral College-was a serious misstep in its quest to assure that the scenario that played out on January 6 \" can never happen again .\" In its final hearing on December 19, the committee focused on the actions of a dishonest individual, Trump, and his malignant coconspirators. That was understandable, as Trump's ongoing refusal to accept the results of the 2020 election demands accountability. But a narrow accountability that is obsessed with a powerful man, rather than with the systemic flaws that permitted him and his allies to steer the country off the rails, misses an opportunity to get the Congress and the country engaged with the work of eliminating future threats to democracy. The committee's 845-page final report , which was released a few days after the last hearing, featured a handful of policy recommendations-including calls for strengthening legislative tools for barring insurrectionists from holding office and for reform of the fundamentally flawed Electoral Count Act of 1887 . But, as a key committee member, Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin, has said , tinkering with the Electoral Count Act, while \"necessary,\" is \"not remotely sufficient.\" Raskin explained Sunday on CBS's Face the Nation , \"There are so many curving by-ways and nooks and crannies in the Electoral College that there are opportunities for a lot of strategic mischief.... The Electoral College doesn't fit [with the aspirations of American democracy] anymore.\" Related Articles The January 6 Committee Just Put Kevin McCarthy in Charge of an Investigation Into Kevin McCarthy John Nichols DOJ Lawyers Are Cowards if They Don't Indict Trump Elie Mystal If Merrick Garland Had the Courage of His Convictions... Ben Gerson Of course, the January 6 committee needed to outline its referrals for criminal charges against Trump. But it also needed to call for Congress and the states to begin the process of amending the US Constitution to do away with the Electoral College and ensure that future elections are decided by the popular will of the people. Like the prosecution of a former president, seeking to change the process by which presidents are chosen is a daunting task. Yet it has to be discussed, now that we know that conflicts over Electoral College results have led to incitement toward violence-and could do so again. The January 6 assault on the Capitol sought to disrupt Congress at the precise point when it was charged with certifying the Electoral College results from the 2020 presidential election. Trump's lawless actions following the election on November 3, 2020, and especially in the weeks prior to January 6, were all focused on creating a circumstance where it might be possible, in the words of Representative Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), to \"interfere with the proper conduct of the January 6th [certification process in Congress].\" Had there been no Electoral College, there would have been no critical juncture at which to interfere.

Because, according to media reports, Wyoming Representative Liz Cheney, the leading Republican on the bipartisan committee, had no interest in doing so. In early June, Axios reported , \"Nobody on the House select committee is more committed than Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) to pursuing Trump for inciting the attack on the Capitol. But she flatly opposes some of the more sweeping election law reforms backed by several committee Democrats.\" Specifically, reported Axios , \"Cheney thinks the committee will burn its credibility if it pushes for radical changes like abolishing the Electoral College, according to a source with direct knowledge. She also has joked to her colleagues on the committee that there's no way the single at-large representative for the tiny state of Wyoming would support abolishing the Electoral College, according to another source with direct knowledge of the internal committee deliberations.\" Cheney, whose reelection bid was overwhelmingly rejected by the voters of Wyoming in August, may have thought that abolishing the Electoral College was a joke. But her opposition to the idea proved to be a serious matter for the committee. Democrats knew they needed her support to send a bipartisan signal to the Department of Justice with regard to prosecuting Trump. So proposals to eliminate-or, at the least, to neutralize -the Electoral College were abandoned. That was a mistake, as the Electoral College is very likely to be at the center of future disputes over presidential elections. Trump lost the popular vote in 2020 by more than 7 million ballots, just as he lost it in 2016 by roughly 3 million ballots. In any other democratic republic, he wouldn't have gotten near the White House. And he certainly would not have been afforded an opportunity to cling to power. But because the Electoral College system allows the popular-vote loser to \"win,\" Trump made a big deal about close contests in a handful of battleground states-Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin, in particular-where electoral votes were up for grabs. Democrat Joe Biden clearly won those states, as canvasses, recounts, and court rulings confirmed. But Trump's contesting of relatively close contests framed his objection to the 2020 results, and his call to insurrection. Doing away with the Electoral College would end the tyranny of the battleground states and allow the United States to have nationwide elections in which every vote counts equally. Representative Raskin understands this. That's why he has long advocated for steps that would nullify the Electoral College. A constitutional amendment to abolish the Electoral College would do that. But amendments are a heavy lift. This is one of the reasons Raskin has backed the bipartisan National Popular Vote initiative , a multistate compact under which states pledge to assign their electoral votes to the winner of the popular vote nationwide. The compact takes effect only when states with a majority of the nation's electoral votes-270 or more-have signed on. So far, 15 states and the District of Columbia, with a combined 195 electoral votes , have agreed to the compact. The January 6 committee could have called on Congress to begin the process of amending the Constitution to abolish the Electoral College, while at the same time recognizing the difficulties involved in the amendment process. With that in mind, it also could have recommended the National Popular Vote Initiative and other strategies to address the threat posed by the Electoral College. Instead, the committee avoided the issue-an unwise choice, because, as Raskin reminds us , \"the Electoral College now, which has given us five popular vote losers as president in our history, twice in this century alone, has become a danger-not just to democracy, but to the American people.\"\n\nIn its final hearing on December 19, the committee focused on the actions of a dishonest individual, Trump, and his malignant coconspirators.

Because, according to media reports, Wyoming Representative Liz Cheney, the leading Republican on the bipartisan committee, had no interest in doing so. In early June, Axios reported , \"Nobody on the House select committee is more committed than Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) to pursuing Trump for inciting the attack on the Capitol. But she flatly opposes some of the more sweeping election law reforms backed by several committee Democrats.\" Specifically, reported Axios , \"Cheney thinks the committee will burn its credibility if it pushes for radical changes like abolishing the Electoral College, according to a source with direct knowledge. She also has joked to her colleagues on the committee that there's no way the single at-large representative for the tiny state of Wyoming would support abolishing the Electoral College, according to another source with direct knowledge of the internal committee deliberations.\" Cheney, whose reelection bid was overwhelmingly rejected by the voters of Wyoming in August, may have thought that abolishing the Electoral College was a joke. But her opposition to the idea proved to be a serious matter for the committee. Democrats knew they needed her support to send a bipartisan signal to the Department of Justice with regard to prosecuting Trump. So proposals to eliminate-or, at the least, to neutralize -the Electoral College were abandoned. That was a mistake, as the Electoral College is very likely to be at the center of future disputes over presidential elections. Trump lost the popular vote in 2020 by more than 7 million ballots, just as he lost it in 2016 by roughly 3 million ballots. In any other democratic republic, he wouldn't have gotten near the White House. And he certainly would not have been afforded an opportunity to cling to power. But because the Electoral College system allows the popular-vote loser to \"win,\" Trump made a big deal about close contests in a handful of battleground states-Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin, in particular-where electoral votes were up for grabs. Democrat Joe Biden clearly won those states, as canvasses, recounts, and court rulings confirmed. But Trump's contesting of relatively close contests framed his objection to the 2020 results, and his call to insurrection. Doing away with the Electoral College would end the tyranny of the battleground states and allow the United States to have nationwide elections in which every vote counts equally. Representative Raskin understands this. That's why he has long advocated for steps that would nullify the Electoral College. A constitutional amendment to abolish the Electoral College would do that. But amendments are a heavy lift. This is one of the reasons Raskin has backed the bipartisan National Popular Vote initiative , a multistate compact under which states pledge to assign their electoral votes to the winner of the popular vote nationwide. The compact takes effect only when states with a majority of the nation's electoral votes-270 or more-have signed on. So far, 15 states and the District of Columbia, with a combined 195 electoral votes , have agreed to the compact. The January 6 committee could have called on Congress to begin the process of amending the Constitution to abolish the Electoral College, while at the same time recognizing the difficulties involved in the amendment process. With that in mind, it also could have recommended the National Popular Vote Initiative and other strategies to address the threat posed by the Electoral College. Instead, the committee avoided the issue-an unwise choice, because, as Raskin reminds us , \"the Electoral College now, which has given us five popular vote losers as president in our history, twice in this century alone, has become a danger-not just to democracy, but to the American people.\"\n\nThe January 6 assault on the Capitol sought to disrupt Congress at the precise point when it was charged with certifying the Electoral College results from the 2020 presidential election.

And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Just this week, the Republican Party launched the new session of Congress with a once-in-a-century failure to designate a House speaker, as the hard-right Freedom Caucus blockaded basic procedural order in favor of raw nihilistic power plays. The right-wing mediasphere continues to light up with baseless, militantly confrontational conspiracy theories, involving everything from Hunter Biden's laptop to Anthony Fauci to Jewish world domination. Meanwhile, Donald Trump himself is once more dusting off the false election-theft narrative that sparked the January 6 attack, reviving disproven, plainly racist, allegations of election tampering targeting Georgia African American election worker Ruby Freeman. In other words, we are still very much living in the shadow of January 6. The select committee's published report patiently lays out how the delusive Trump-authored lies about the theft of the 2020 presidential election touched off a lethal assault on the Capitol, and by extension the rickety armature of our system of governance. It lays to rest the superficial impression that the 2021 insurrection was a peaceful civic protest that got out of hand and devolved into destructive chaos: It was, rather, scripted and directed by the 45th president, who supplied the bald fabrications about the election to foment mass outrage on the right while mounting a concerted legal and political effort to overturn it and restore himself to power in a violent coup. Rendering all this in plain language, the report's authors make an unanswerable case for Trump's legal and criminal responsibility for the horrors of January 6. There remains a mystery at the heart of the insurrection, though, that gets only glancing treatment in a document principally taken up with questions of legal culpability-namely, how did Trump come to embrace the stolen-election narrative in the first place? The report contends that it was a crude and desperate power grab-that as the Trump campaign was losing ground in the final stretch of the election, its lead strategists began flirting with the notion that the president might simply pronounce himself the victor and exploit the vast reach and resources of the presidency to make it so. \"Trump's going to say he's the winner,\" his former campaign manager Steve Bannon told a group of backers. \"That doesn't mean he's the winner.\" The committee's shorthand for this strategy is \"the Big Lie\"-an Americanized version of the Nazi propaganda tactic of building a message out of brazen untruths, repeated without qualification, apology, or remorse. This is certainly an apt characterization of how Trump and his operatives ginned up the stolen-election fable and unleashed it into the mediasphere. But it omits a key point: Unlike Hitler's propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, Trump was lying to himself as much as to the American public. The committee gives an impressive litany of the many times White House aides and Justice Department officials sought to talk Trump down from the deranged, kitchen-sink narrative of election theft that he and enablers such as John Eastman and Rudy Giuliani cobbled together on the fly. But the legal and moral brief here doesn't get to the heart of the matter: What sort of semi-functional adult buys into this sort of crap?

From his childhood on, Trump worshiped at clergyman and self-help author Norman Vincent Peale's Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan; Peale even presided over his first marriage. And the heart of Peale's gospel is the rote incantation of scripture-themed mantras of personal success that make personal and business conquest a virtual inevitability. Introspection and self-doubt are pure poison to aspiring positive thinkers, and the entire Peale-driven scheme of salvation pivots on the dogmatic denial of failure as a possibility. Trump's devotion to positive thinking was plainly manifest when his Atlantic City casino empire foundered on an ocean of debt; he deliberately staged press events that omitted all mention of the word \"bankruptcy,\" even though Trump was well and truly bankrupt (and not for the first time in his overhyped career as a lord of finance). Likewise, when Trump sued one of his biographers over the published claim that he was not, in fact, a billionaire, he explained in a deposition that he was a billionaire because he felt like one-or as he put it, in classic Peale-ese, \"I like to be as positive as I am with respect to my properties.\" With this sort of self-fabulizing gospel of wealth at the foundation of Trump's character, it's not hard to see why the notion of a one-term presidency was simply unthinkable. The committee's chronicle of the events leading up to January 6 is so comprehensive that Trump's own Peale-ist outlook does obtrude, albeit without editorial comment. At one point, Trump urged Acting Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen and his deputy Richard Donoghue to file a complaint alleging widespread election fraud before the Supreme Court; when the lawyers explained this was impossible, since the DOJ had no standing to sue, the report notes that \"President Trump became incredulous and 'very animated.' The President kept repeating the same question over and over, 'How is that possible?' 'How can that possibly be?'\" In the mind of Donald Trump, it can't-which is why he blew by not just Rosen and Donoghue but any and all messengers poised to remind him of the obvious mathematical truth of his defeat at Joe Biden's hands. It's also why he followed the chipper Constitution-shredding counsel of boyish New York lawyer Kenneth Chesebro, whose harebrained plan to create fake slates of Trump electors in pivotal swing states became the leading edge of the crusade to overturn the election. Cheseboro peppered his strategic correspondence with middle-school variations of Peale sloganeering such as \"Pretty simple!\" and \"Really awesome!\" In the same vein, Trump tried to inveigle state election officials into signing off on the stolen-election narrative by invoking the purest currency of Peale success-preaching: executive praise. He told Frances Watson, the chief investigator for Georgia's secretary of state, that he \"won Georgia...by a lot\" and tried to buck her up by assuring her that \"you have the most important job in the country right now\" and \"when the right answer comes out, you'll be praised.\" It's admittedly hard to square the sunny apothegms of positive thinking with a fascist formation in American politics steeped in racialized resentment and coup-plotting. But Peale himself was an ardent political reactionary; he composed The Power of Positive Thinking on a union-busting junket to Hawaii. And the ritualized togetherness of Trump rallies and Trump-driven social media is likewise a clear outgrowth of the Peale success gospel. Another small but telling detail from the January 6 report drives this home: Sycophantic Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows was also lobbying Georgia election workers on his boss's behalf, and at one point \"suggested that Trump send election workers Trump memorabilia like presidential challenge coins and autographed MAGA hats.\" Meadows's proposal was dropped, which is too bad: One sure sign that American democracy would be on the long road to recovery would be a line of apparel reading, \"I tried to overthrow our democracy and all I got was this lousy hat.\"\n\nIn other words, we are still very much living in the shadow of January 6.

Another small but telling detail from the January 6 report drives this home: Sycophantic Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows was also lobbying Georgia election workers on his boss's behalf, and at one point \"suggested that Trump send election workers Trump memorabilia like presidential challenge coins and autographed MAGA hats.\" Meadows's proposal was dropped, which is too bad: One sure sign that American democracy would be on the long road to recovery would be a line of apparel reading, \"I tried to overthrow our democracy and all I got was this lousy hat.\"\n\nWith this sort of self-fabulizing gospel of wealth at the foundation of Trump's character, it's not hard to see why the notion of a one-term presidency was simply unthinkable. The committee's chronicle of the events leading up to January 6 is so comprehensive that Trump's own Peale-ist outlook does obtrude, albeit without editorial comment. At one point, Trump urged Acting Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen and his deputy Richard Donoghue to file a complaint alleging widespread election fraud before the Supreme Court; when the lawyers explained this was impossible, since the DOJ had no standing to sue, the report notes that \"President Trump became incredulous and 'very animated.' The President kept repeating the same question over and over, 'How is that possible?' 'How can that possibly be?'\" In the mind of Donald Trump, it can't-which is why he blew by not just Rosen and Donoghue but any and all messengers poised to remind him of the obvious mathematical truth of his defeat at Joe Biden's hands. It's also why he followed the chipper Constitution-shredding counsel of boyish New York lawyer Kenneth Chesebro, whose harebrained plan to create fake slates of Trump electors in pivotal swing states became the leading edge of the crusade to overturn the election. Cheseboro peppered his strategic correspondence with middle-school variations of Peale sloganeering such as \"Pretty simple!\" and \"Really awesome!\" In the same vein, Trump tried to inveigle state election officials into signing off on the stolen-election narrative by invoking the purest currency of Peale success-preaching: executive praise. He told Frances Watson, the chief investigator for Georgia's secretary of state, that he \"won Georgia...by a lot\" and tried to buck her up by assuring her that \"you have the most important job in the country right now\" and \"when the right answer comes out, you'll be praised.\" It's admittedly hard to square the sunny apothegms of positive thinking with a fascist formation in American politics steeped in racialized resentment and coup-plotting.

(Photo by Alex Brandon / POOL / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the U.S. Capitol has established that Donald Trump was the central figure in a coup attempt that sought to install Trump as an illegitimate pretender president for a term he did not win. Set to hold what could be its final hearing on Thursday, the committee has done the meticulous work of placing the former president at the center of a conspiracy to upend democracy that involved not just Trump and his closest aides but also key figures in Congress and the states-a number of whom are seeking election on November 8. Yet Democrats seem to be wrestling with whether to focus on what happened on January 6, 2021, as a 2022 election issue. Throughout this challenging midterms season, we've seen reports that, as an August Politico headline put it, \"There's a Huge Divide Among Democrats Over How Hard to Campaign for Democracy.\" The article explained that \"Democrats competing in elections this year have not been pressing the issue anywhere near as hard as other concerns.\" In fact, political ads mentioning the insurrection accounted for less than 4 percent of all Democratic spending at the time, according to Politico . That's a misguided strategy that needs to be rethought as midterm voting begins. Of course, there are other issues candidates must address-abortion rights, price gouging and inflation, the lingering effects of the coronavirus pandemic, and an increasingly unstable international circumstance . But to neglect the role that Trump-aligned Republicans have already played in assaulting democracy is political malpractice. Even if viewership of the January 6 committee hearings has waned since they began in June, the threat to democracy that they have illustrated remains very real-and very potent as a political issue with the voters Democrats need to mobilize in advance of the November 8 election. What happened on January 6 was jarring in and of itself. But the shock to the system did not begin or end on that day. It pointed to threats to democracy that have only become more significant as the midterms approach. Dozens of insurrectionists -extreme right-wing activists who went to Washington at Trump's behest and who were at or near the Capitol when it was attacked by his supporters-are running as Republicans for top posts in states across the country. They all deserve to be called out for their embrace of lawlessness. The same goes for Republicans in office who refuse to break with Trump over his Big Lie about the 2020 election. Advocates for democracy should take every opportunity to remind voters about what's at stake if they lose and if Republican insurrectionists and their allies win on November 8. Related Article The January 6 Committee Can't Quit Before It Examines the Clarence Thomas Connection John Nichols US Representative Liz Cheney recognizes this duty. In an early October appearance organized by the John McCain Institute at Arizona State University, the Wyoming Republican who serves on the January 6 committee warned that the GOP has a growing \"Putin wing\" that refuses to defend democracy. \"In Arizona today you have a candidate for governor in Kari Lake, you have a candidate for secretary of state in Mark Finchem, both of whom have said-this isn't a surprise, it's not a secret-they both said that they will only honor the results of an election if they agree with it,\" Cheney told ASU students. \"They've looked at all of that, the law, the facts and the rulings, the courts, and they've said it doesn't matter to them.\" \"We all have to understand that we cannot give people power who have told us that they will not honor elections,\" Cheney bluntly added. Democrats should be just as blunt. It's the right thing to do. It's smart politics. And a few Democrats have provided a template for how to get it right, by recognizing that, at a time when Republicans are pouring millions of dollars into TV ads that falsely paint Democrats as soft on crime and anti-police, Republican insurrectionists and their allies are vulnerable on these issues. In Ohio, Representative Marcy Kaptur has used the issue to devastating effect against scandal-plagued Republican challenger J.R. Majewski, an incendiary extremist who was in D.C. on January 6 and who enjoyed enthusiastic support from House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). Kaptur hit Majewski hard in her first ad for the fall campaign, which described the Republican as an \"extremist candidate for Congress\" and made specific references to the Capitol attack. The Kaptur ad portrayed Majewski as someone who \"blames the police\" for violence on January 6, and Kaptur as the candidate who \"supports law enforcement.\" The message, and allegations that Majewski inflated his military record, look to have tipped the balance toward Kaptur. In Wisconsin, where US Senate candidate Mandela Barnes , a Democrat who has been one of the chief targets of Republican attack ads, has been trailing narrowly behind incumbent Republican Senator Ron Johnson in recent polls, Barnes focused on January 6 issues during a debate last week with the millionaire incumbent. After Johnson attacked Barnes for supporting cash-bail reform in order to assure that nonviolent offenders aren't jailed simply because they lack the money to pay for bail, the Democrat explained why the reform is a matter of equity. He said, \"Now, Senator Johnson may not have encountered a problem he could not buy his way out of, but that's not a reality for the majority of the people in this state.\" That threw the wealthy Republican for a loop and he tried to suggest that Barnes's policies were disrespectful toward the police. The Republican claimed he went out of the way to show that respect. Barnes replied, \"The senator, on the last question did mention police officers. Now, with that being said, I'm sure that he didn't have the same interaction with the 140 officers that were injured during the January 6 insurrection. One officer was stabbed with a metal stake. Another crushed in a revolving door. Another hit in the head with a fire extinguisher. So when we talk about respect for law enforcement, let's talk about the 140 officers that he left behind-because of an insurrection that he supported.\" That wasn't the only point at which Barnes reflected on the insurrection to hit back against the incumbent. When the senator-who tried to deliver slates of fake electors to Vice President Mike Pence- attempted to downplay the seriousness of the violence, Barnes was ready. \"He may not have noticed that an insurrection was happening because he called those people 'patriots.' He called them 'tourists.' These are the folks that he supported. This an act that he supported,\" said the Democrat. \"He can make whatever comparisons he wants to. But the reality is, this was an attempted overthrow of the government by trying to overturn a free and fair election.\" It was one of the most powerful moments of the debate for Barnes-so powerful that his campaign would be wise to make it part of the October advertising campaign that will be needed to close the gap with Johnson. Why? Because what Republicans like Johnson did on January 6, 2021, and what they have said and done since then, remains at the top of the list of issues concerning Democrats, according to a recent NBC poll . In a midterm election where mobilizing the base is essential, January 6 is an issue that can move voters-if Democratic candidates are prepared to talk about it.\n\nYet Democrats seem to be wrestling with whether to focus on what happened on January 6, 2021, as a 2022 election issue.

In a midterm election where mobilizing the base is essential, January 6 is an issue that can move voters-if Democratic candidates are prepared to talk about it.\n\nWhat happened on January 6 was jarring in and of itself. But the shock to the system did not begin or end on that day. It pointed to threats to democracy that have only become more significant as the midterms approach. Dozens of insurrectionists -extreme right-wing activists who went to Washington at Trump's behest and who were at or near the Capitol when it was attacked by his supporters-are running as Republicans for top posts in states across the country. They all deserve to be called out for their embrace of lawlessness. The same goes for Republicans in office who refuse to break with Trump over his Big Lie about the 2020 election. Advocates for democracy should take every opportunity to remind voters about what's at stake if they lose and if Republican insurrectionists and their allies win on November 8.

In an early October appearance organized by the John McCain Institute at Arizona State University, the Wyoming Republican who serves on the January 6 committee warned that the GOP has a growing \"Putin wing\" that refuses to defend democracy. \"In Arizona today you have a candidate for governor in Kari Lake, you have a candidate for secretary of state in Mark Finchem, both of whom have said-this isn't a surprise, it's not a secret-they both said that they will only honor the results of an election if they agree with it,\" Cheney told ASU students. \"They've looked at all of that, the law, the facts and the rulings, the courts, and they've said it doesn't matter to them.\" \"We all have to understand that we cannot give people power who have told us that they will not honor elections,\" Cheney bluntly added. Democrats should be just as blunt. It's the right thing to do. It's smart politics. And a few Democrats have provided a template for how to get it right, by recognizing that, at a time when Republicans are pouring millions of dollars into TV ads that falsely paint Democrats as soft on crime and anti-police, Republican insurrectionists and their allies are vulnerable on these issues. In Ohio, Representative Marcy Kaptur has used the issue to devastating effect against scandal-plagued Republican challenger J.R. Majewski, an incendiary extremist who was in D.C. on January 6 and who enjoyed enthusiastic support from House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). Kaptur hit Majewski hard in her first ad for the fall campaign, which described the Republican as an \"extremist candidate for Congress\" and made specific references to the Capitol attack. The Kaptur ad portrayed Majewski as someone who \"blames the police\" for violence on January 6, and Kaptur as the candidate who \"supports law enforcement.\" The message, and allegations that Majewski inflated his military record, look to have tipped the balance toward Kaptur. In Wisconsin, where US Senate candidate Mandela Barnes , a Democrat who has been one of the chief targets of Republican attack ads, has been trailing narrowly behind incumbent Republican Senator Ron Johnson in recent polls, Barnes focused on January 6 issues during a debate last week with the millionaire incumbent. After Johnson attacked Barnes for supporting cash-bail reform in order to assure that nonviolent offenders aren't jailed simply because they lack the money to pay for bail, the Democrat explained why the reform is a matter of equity. He said, \"Now, Senator Johnson may not have encountered a problem he could not buy his way out of, but that's not a reality for the majority of the people in this state.\" That threw the wealthy Republican for a loop and he tried to suggest that Barnes's policies were disrespectful toward the police. The Republican claimed he went out of the way to show that respect. Barnes replied, \"The senator, on the last question did mention police officers. Now, with that being said, I'm sure that he didn't have the same interaction with the 140 officers that were injured during the January 6 insurrection. One officer was stabbed with a metal stake. Another crushed in a revolving door. Another hit in the head with a fire extinguisher. So when we talk about respect for law enforcement, let's talk about the 140 officers that he left behind-because of an insurrection that he supported.\" That wasn't the only point at which Barnes reflected on the insurrection to hit back against the incumbent. When the senator-who tried to deliver slates of fake electors to Vice President Mike Pence- attempted to downplay the seriousness of the violence, Barnes was ready. \"He may not have noticed that an insurrection was happening because he called those people 'patriots.' He called them 'tourists.' These are the folks that he supported. This an act that he supported,\" said the Democrat. \"He can make whatever comparisons he wants to. But the reality is, this was an attempted overthrow of the government by trying to overturn a free and fair election.\" It was one of the most powerful moments of the debate for Barnes-so powerful that his campaign would be wise to make it part of the October advertising campaign that will be needed to close the gap with Johnson.

Activate your online access\n\nThe grim legacy of January 6 lives on in today's Republican Party.\n\nThe United States Capitol in Washington, D.C., being breached on January 6, 2021.\n\nThe failed coup of January 6, 2021, now marking its third anniversary, shows no sign of outgrowing the terrible twos. Thanks to America's overlapping chronic conditions of historical amnesia and rapid-fire revisionism, a landmark assault on the basic operations of government, with the explicit aim of overturning a free and fair election to install an authoritarian aspiring dictator into power for life, has become a litmus test for holding office among a militant Republican base. The imprint of January 6 revisionism is on display everywhere in American public life. There was the ominously strong plurality of election deniers seeking office in the 2022 midterms. There was the House GOP conference's decision to elevate eight election-denying candidates in a field of nine as it voted to appoint a new speaker last fall. (Needless to say, the eventual winner, Mike Johnson, both filed an amicus brief in support of the bogus Trump challenge to the 2020 results and voted to decertify them on January 6.) There was the relentless shilling of election lies in the right-wing media, with Tucker Carlson and Mike Liddell leading the initial charge, and Dinesh D'Souza and the Epoch Times peddling long-form fanciful, paranoid, blame-shifting accounts of how and why the failed putsch unfolded. This agitprop campaign has yielded impressive results: According to a new Washington Post /UMD poll, 25 percent of all Americans now believe that the FBI instigated the insurrection, with one-third of Republicans endorsing that lunatic claim.\n\nOne key tell in all this unhinged mythmaking was that, for all the heavy-breathing invocations of deep-state choreographing of the insurrection, neither Trump nor any of the lead MAGA propagandists on the case have named a single alleged Lux Luthor figure knitting all the threads of conspiracy together. To be sure, the right-wing grievance-sphere abounds with drive-by insinuations lobbed at prominent public figures such as President Joe Biden, Attorney General Merrick Garland, and FBI Director Chris Wray, but these are always blindingly vague and comically evidence-free. There's a simple reason for this, beyond the imaginary character of the whole crusade: Affixing actual names and practices to the litany of stab-in-the-back allegations creates dire legal exposure for the accusers. That lesson's been driven home in the sprawling industry of fallacious right-wing charges of election fraud that enabled the insurrection, in judgments that have so far cost Fox News $787 million and Trump attorney cum fascist carnival barker Rudy Giuliani $148 million .\n\nThe other first-order logical travesty of the January 6 truther movement is that, by some recondite miracle in an election cycle allegedly rife with dastardly voter fraud and fixing, all results that broke in favor of Republican candidates were preserved in an ethically immaculate state. This fabulist brand of ballot activism should have been laughed out of public discourse the moment that the Trump administration's own election fraud commission, led by Kansas MAGA legal mouthpiece Kris Kobach, disbanded in a massive crescendo of evidentiary face-planting . Yet, as we're now seeing in the GOP primary polls, legal, court-sanctioned refutations of MAGA social myth only feed the movement's martyrology and unappeasable sense of righteous grievance. The grim legacy of January 6 is that an entire fascist movement nestled in the heart of one of the nation's major parties is more determined than ever to seize state power in order to exact revenge in defense of a flagrant lie.\n\n\"Fascism is about the destruction of the rule of law,\" says Maryland Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin, the House manager for Trump's post-January 6 impeachment and a lead member of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th attack on the United States Capitol. \"And they are just demolishing the rule of law however they can. That's why Section 3 of the 14th Amendment is so important. Even Trump supporters seem to concede that the language of Section 3 is on point.\"\n\nSection 3, of course, forbids anyone found to have participated in an anti-government insurrection from holding office. It's almost never been enforced over the past 150 years, thanks to the collapse of Radical Reconstruction and the ensuing restoration of white herrenvolk democracy in the country. But as Raskin notes, the recent decisions in Maine and Colorado to revoke Trump's ballot entry under Section 3, however they might translate into long-term political strategy, supply a powerful reminder of just what actually did happen on January 6, and the ongoing existential threat the movement surrounding it represents to American democracy. \"I'd make the argument that Section 3 is all about fortifying and strengthening democracy,\" Raskin says. \"There are multiple ways of being disqualified from running for president. You can be too young-anybody under 35, like AOC or Maxwell Frost, isn't allowed to run. You could be not a native-born citizen, which takes out Arnold Schwarzenegger. And then you can be an insurrectionist. That disqualification affects probably fewer than a dozen officials, who were elected officials who swore an oath to uphold the Constitution. That's a category that's not morally arbitrary, like age or where you were born. You put yourself in that category-and that's exactly what Trump has done.\"\n\nAnother pronounced irony here is that the Section 3 cases, and the other court challenges to Trump's bid to overturn the election in D.C. district court and Fulton County, Ga., represent the very sort of legal remedy that a major contingent of Republican senators claimed to support when they fatally decided to vote against Trump's conviction in the post-January 6 Senate trial.\n\n\"The 6 Jan attack on the Capitol was far more dangerous than most realize,\" Sen. Marco Rubio wrote on Twitter just ahead of his vote to acquit. \"And we have a criminal justice system in place to address it.\" Texas Senator John Cornyn took up the same sententious and ultimately disingenuous cry, saying , \"Given that the Constitution makes legal offenses committed while in office subject to investigation and prosecution as warranted, after a President is no longer in office, I believe that is the Constitutional method of accountability.\" Predictably, Jack Smith's indictment of Trump in Washington elicited a resounding blast of silence from this same cohort-most notably Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, who delivered a speech blasting Trump for his role in fomenting the insurrection, only to fold like a cheap card table at the time of the impeachment vote. \"One has to believe that McConnell and the other Republicans who could not summon up the courage to do the right thing at trial are regretful,\" Raskin says. \"The Republican establishment keeps waiting for someone else to do the right thing.\"\n\nRaskin also stresses the urgency of the pending court proceedings against Trump on charges relating to January 6 and other matters. \"These cases have to go forward, especially the Jack Smith insurrection case,\" he says. \"Trump should not be allowed to run out the clock with a bunch of frivolous arguments. It's going to be important to see whether courts can do their job. I think that how the Supreme Court deals with Section 3 of the 14th Amendment is crucial. For a bunch of originalists and textualists, this should be an easy case. The text is unambiguous, and the original purpose was clear: to stop people who had held public office and engaged in insurrection from ever coming back into power.\"\n\nAt the same time, the courts-and this Supreme Court in particular-are hardly the cavalry you'd want to rely on in today's mounting conditions of democratic emergency. \"Really, it requires every institution in society to do its job,\" Raskin says. \"That includes the courts, the House and the Senate, and the state governments. But above all, it requires the people.\"\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

      "text": "The Devastating New History of the January 6th Insurrection\n\nThe New Yorker is publishing the full report of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack, in partnership with Celadon Books. The edition contains a foreword by the magazine's editor, David Remnick, which you'll find below, and an epilogue by Representative Jamie Raskin, a member of the committee. Order the full report .\n\nIn the weeks while the House select committee to investigate the insurrection at the Capitol was finishing its report, Donald Trump, the focus of its inquiry, betrayed no sense of alarm or self-awareness. At his country-club exile in Palm Beach, Trump ignored the failures of his favored candidates in the midterm elections and announced that he was running again for President. He dined cheerfully and unapologetically with a spiralling Kanye West and a young neo-fascist named Nick Fuentes. He mocked the government's insistence that he turn over all the classified documents that he'd hoarded as personal property. Finally, he declared that he had a \"major announcement,\" only to unveil the latest in a lifetime of grifts. In the old days, it was Trump University, Trump Steaks, Trump Ice. This time, he was hawking \"limited edition\" digital trading cards at ninety-nine dollars apiece, illustrated portraits of himself as an astronaut, a sheriff, a superhero. The pitch began with the usual hokum: \"Hello everyone, this is Donald Trump, hopefully your favorite President of all time, better than Lincoln, better than Washington.\"\n\nIn his career as a New York real-estate shyster and tabloid denizen, then as the forty-fifth President of the United States, Trump has been the most transparent of public figures. He does little to conceal his most distinctive characteristics: his racism, misogyny, dishonesty, narcissism, incompetence, cruelty, instability, and corruption. And yet what has kept Trump afloat for so long, what has helped him evade ruin and prosecution, is perhaps his most salient quality: he is shameless. That is the never-apologize-never-explain core of him. Trump is hardly the first dishonest President, the first incurious President, the first liar. But he is the most shameless. His contrition is impossible to conceive. He is insensible to disgrace.\n\nOn December 19, 2022, the committee spelled out a devastating set of accusations against Trump: obstruction of an official proceeding; conspiracy to defraud the nation; conspiracy to make false statements; and, most grave of all, inciting, assisting, aiding, or comforting an insurrection. For the first time in the history of the United States, Congress referred a former President to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution. The criminal referrals have no formal authority, though they could play some role in pushing Jack Smith, the special counsel appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland, to issue indictments. The report certainly adds immeasurably to the wealth of evidence describing Trump's actions and intentions. One telling example: The committee learned that Hope Hicks, the epitome of a loyal adviser, told Trump more than once in the days leading up to the protest to urge the demonstrators to keep things peaceful. \"I suggested it several times Monday and Tuesday and he refused,\" she wrote in a text to another adviser. When Hicks questioned Trump's behavior concerning the insurrection and the consequences for his legacy, he made his priorities clear: \"Nobody will care about my legacy if I lose. So, that won't matter. The only thing that matters is winning.\"\n\nTrump has been similarly dismissive of the committee's work, going on the radio to tell Dan Bongino, the host of \"The Dan Bongino Show,\" that he had been the victim of a \"kangaroo court.\" On Truth Social, his social-media platform, he appealed to the loyalty of his supporters: \"Republicans and Patriots all over the land must stand strong and united against the Thugs and Scoundrels of the Unselect Committee.... These folks don't get it that when they come after me, the people who love freedom rally around me. It strengthens me. What doesn't kill me makes me stronger.\"\n\nExperience makes it plain that Trump will just keep going on like this, deflecting, denying, lashing out at his accusers, even if it means that he will end his days howling in a bare and echoing room. It matters little that the report shows that even members of his innermost circle, from his Attorney General to his daughter, know the depths of his vainglorious delusions. He will not repent. He will not change. But the importance of the committee's report has far less to do with the spectacle of Trump's unravelling. Its importance resides in the establishment of a historical record, the depth of its evidence, the story it tells of a deliberate, coördinated assault on American democracy that could easily have ended with the kidnapping or assassination of senior elected officials, the emboldenment of extremist groups and militias, and, above all, a stolen election, a coup.\n\nThe committee was not alone in its investigation. Many journalists contributed to the steady accretion of facts. But, with the power of subpoena, the committee was able to uncover countless new illuminating details. One example: In mid-December, 2020, the Supreme Court threw out a lawsuit filed by the State of Texas that would have challenged the counting of millions of ballots. Trump, of course, supported the suit. He was furious when it, like dozens of similar suits, was dismissed. According to Cassidy Hutchinson, who worked directly for Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, Trump was \"raging\" about the decision: \"He had said something to the effect of, 'I don't want people to know we lost, Mark. This is embarrassing. Figure it out. We need to figure it out. I don't want people to know that we lost.'\"\n\nIn large measure, this report is the story of how Trump, humiliated by his loss to Joe Biden, conspired to obstruct Congress, defraud the country he was pledged to serve, and incite an insurrection to keep himself in power.\n\nThe origins of the committee and its work are plain: On January 6, 2021, thousands marched on the Capitol in support of Trump and his conspiratorial and wholly fabricated charge that the Presidential election the previous November had been stolen from him. Demonstrators breached police barricades, broke through windows and doors, and ran through the halls of Congress threatening to exact vengeance on the Vice-President, the Speaker of the House, and other officeholders. Seven people died as a result of the insurrection. About a hundred and fourteen law-enforcement officers were injured.\n\nHalf a year later, the House of Representatives voted to establish a panel charged with investigating every aspect of the insurrection-including the role of the former President. An earlier attempt in the Senate to convene an investigative panel had met with firm resistance from the Minority Leader, Mitch McConnell, who called it an \"extraneous\" project; despite support from six Republican senators, it failed to get the sixty votes required. It was left to the Democratic leadership in the House to form a committee. The vote, held on June 30, 2021, was largely along party lines, but the U.S. House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol officially came into existence.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi then asked the Republicans to name G.O.P. members to join the panel. The House Minority Leader, Kevin McCarthy, responded by proposing some of the most prominent election deniers in his caucus, including Jim Jordan, of Ohio, who had attended \"Stop the Steal\" demonstrations and was sure to behave as an ardent obstructionist. Pelosi, who had named Liz Cheney, of Wyoming, to the panel, rejected two of McCarthy's five recommendations, saying, \"The unprecedented nature of January 6th demands this unprecedented decision.\" After conferring with Trump, McCarthy refused to provide alternatives, and abruptly withdrew all of his proposals, gambling that doing so would derail or discredit the initiative. Pelosi, in turn, asked a second Republican who had, with Cheney, voted to impeach the President on a vote held on January 13th-Adam Kinzinger, of Illinois-to serve on the committee. Both Cheney and Kinzinger accepted.\n\nCheney, a firm conservative and the daughter of former Vice-President Dick Cheney, had made her judgment of Trump well known. \"The President of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack,\" she said not long after the insurrection. \"Everything that followed was his doing.\" She knew that by opposing Trump and joining Kinzinger and the Democrats on the committee she was almost sure to lose her seat in Congress. She didn't care, she said later, declaring her work on the panel, on which she served as vice-chair, the \"most important\" of her career. The G.O.P. leadership was unimpressed with this declaration of principle. In February, 2022, the Republican National Committee censured both Cheney and Kinzinger.\n\nIn deciding how to proceed with its investigation, the committee's chairman, Bennie G. Thompson, of Mississippi, along with Liz Cheney and the seven other members, looked to a range of similarly high-profile investigative panels of the past, including the so-called Kefauver Committee, which investigated organized crime, in 1950-51; the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, known as the Warren Commission, in 1963-64; the Senate Watergate hearings, in 1973; the Iran-Contra hearings, in 1987; and, particularly, the 9/11 Commission, in 2002-04. The committee hired staff investigators who had worked in the Department of Justice and in law enforcement, and they conducted more than a thousand interviews. Teams were color-coded and tasked with making \"deep dives\" into various aspects of January 6th. The division of labor included a \"blue team,\" which examined the preparation for and the reaction to events by law enforcement; a \"green team,\" which examined the financial backing for the plot; a \"purple team,\" which conducted an analysis of the extremist groups involved in the storming of the Capitol; a \"red team,\" which studied the rally on the Ellipse and the Stop the Steal movement; and a \"gold team,\" which looked specifically at Trump's role in the insurrection.\n\nCommittee members also insisted on inquiring into whether Trump planned to use emergency powers to overturn the vote, call out the National Guard, and invoke the Insurrection Act. Was Trump's inaction during the rioting on Capitol Hill merely a matter of miserable leadership, or was it a deliberate strategy of fomenting chaos in order to stay in the White House? \"That dereliction of duty causes us real concern,\" Thompson said. In this way, an inquiry into a specific episode broadened to encompass a topic of still greater significance: Had the President sought to undermine and circumvent the American system of electoral democracy?\n\nThe political urgency of the committee's work was geared to the calendar. Members had initially hoped to complete and publish a report before the 2022 midterm elections. But that proved impossible, such was the volume of evidence. Still, the committee members knew they could not go on indefinitely. The Republicans were likely to win back a majority in the House, in November, and McCarthy, who was the most likely to succeed Nancy Pelosi as Speaker, would almost certainly choose not to reauthorize the committee, effectively shutting it down; it was also quite possible, they knew, that McCarthy and the Republicans might generate \"counter\" hearings as an act of retribution.\n\nAs the committee began its work, it was soon clear that the Republican leadership in the House had made a tactical error in refusing to appoint any members to the panel. Even Republicans less vociferous than Jordan would have had the power to slow down the investigations, debate points with Democratic members, and appoint less aggressive staff members. Instead, the committee, with its seven Democrats and two anti-Trump Republicans, worked in relative harmony, taking full advantage of a sense of common purpose and the capacities of a congressional committee.\n\nStill, they faced predictable obstacles. Not only did many Trump loyalists refuse to testify; much of the American public was, after so many previous investigations, impeachments, scandals, and news alerts, weary of hearing about the unending saga of Donald Trump. Who would pay attention? What more was there to learn? In a polarized America, who was left to be persuaded? Committee members such as Jamie Raskin, of Maryland, insisted that the real purpose of the investigation was to establish the truth. What prosecutors and the electorate make of those facts is beyond the committee's authority.\n\nThe committee members determined that they could not go about the hearings in the old way, with day after day of interminable questioning of witnesses. Instead, they needed to produce discrete, well-produced, briskly paced multimedia \"episodes\" designed to highlight various aspects of the insurrection: its origins, its funding, the behavior of the President, the level of involvement by white nationalists, militias, and other menacing groups. The members agreed that, in an age of peak TV, they needed to present a kind of series, one that was dramatic, accessible, accurate, evidence-rich, and convincing. Ideally, they would provide a narrative that did not merely preach to the converted but reached the millions of Americans who were indifferent to or confused by the unending stream of noise, indirection, hysteria, lying, and chaos that had characterized the hyperpolarized era. The committee also recognized that only a minority would watch the full hearings, much less read every word of a long narrative report months later. They needed to produce the hearings in a way that could also be transmitted effectively in bits on social media and go viral. They needed memorable moments and characters. In the words of one staffer, \"We needed to bring things to life.\"\n\nTo help with that effort, the committee hired an adviser, the British-born television producer James Goldston, who had been a foreign correspondent for the BBC in Northern Ireland and Kosovo. Goldston had also covered the impeachment of Bill Clinton. In 2004, he moved to New York and went to work at ABC, where he ran \"Good Morning America\" and \"Nightline\"; between 2014 and 2021, he served as president of ABC News. The committee decided to videotape its depositions, and Goldston was among those who helped to select brief and particularly vivid moments from those long interviews, the way a journalist uses quotations or scenes to enliven a piece of narrative prose. The committee's presentations also employed everything from surveillance video to police radio traffic to the e-mails and tweets of government officials, right-wing media personalities, militia leaders, and the insurrectionists on Capitol Hill.\n\n\"We live in an era where, no matter how important the subject, it's competing for attention,\" Goldston told a reporter for TheWrap. \"People are distracted, people have got a lot going on. And so, the hope was, by bringing these new techniques to this format, that we could engage people in a way that perhaps they wouldn't otherwise have been.\" The second prime-time hearing brought in nearly eighteen million viewers, an audience comparable to NBC's \"Sunday Night Football.\" The Republican House leadership was predictably unimpressed with the committee's commitment to narrative, prompting Kevin McCarthy to say that the Democrats had hired Goldston to \"choreograph their Jan. 6 political theater.\"\n\nThe committee's published report does not have a single authorial voice. Rather, it is a collaborative effort written mainly by a team of investigators and staffers, with input from members of the committee. And, while it lacks a mediating, consistent voice, it is a startlingly rich narrative, thick with details of malevolent intent, political conspiracy, sickening violence, and human folly. There is no question that historians will feast on these pages; what the Department of Justice does with this evidence remains to be seen.\n\nAt times, there's comedy embedded in this tragic narrative. A figure such as Eric Herschmann, a Trump adviser, holds the stage long enough to recount telling the Trump lawyer John Eastman that his plan to overturn the election is \"completely crazy\": \"Are you out of your effing mind?\" And: \"Get a great effing criminal defense lawyer. You're gonna need it.\" Viewers of Herschmann's deliciously profane taped testimony were transfixed by at least two artifacts on the wall behind him: a baseball bat with the word \"Justice\" written on it and a print of \"Wild Thing,\" Rob Pruitt's image of a panda, which also makes an appearance in the erotic thriller \"Fifty Shades of Grey.\"\n\nAnyone who watched the hearings and who now reads this report will dwell at times on the outsized figures who emerge, either in their own testimony or as described by others: the neo-fascistic campaign strategist and onetime White House aide Steve Bannon; the blandly ambitious Mark Meadows, the chief of staff in the final year of the Trump Administration; and, of course, the oft-inebriated Rudy Giuliani, the onetime New York City mayor and Trump's personal lawyer.\n\nTime and again, senior figures in the drama refused to testify, hiding behind claims of executive privilege. The report includes many comical instances of would-be witnesses claiming their Fifth Amendment rights and refusing to answer questions as benign as where they went to college. And so it was often the junior staffers in the Administration, with far less to spend on legal fees and with their futures at risk, who stepped forward to describe what they had seen and heard. The most memorable such episode came on June 28th, when Cassidy Hutchinson, the earnest young aide to Meadows, testified live before the committee. Hutchinson had already been deposed four times, for a total of more than twenty hours. Liz Cheney, as the vice-chair, began the session by announcing that Hutchinson had received an ominous phone call from someone in Trump's circle saying, \"He wants me to let you know he's thinking about you. He knows you're loyal. And you're going to do the right thing when you go in for your deposition.\" Cheney bluntly referred to this as tantamount to witness tampering. When the report and its accompanying materials were finally released, we learned that Hutchinson told the committee that a former Trump White House lawyer named Stefan Passantino, who represented her early in the process, had instructed her to feign a faulty memory and \"focus on protecting the President.\" She said Passantino made it plain that he would help find her \"a really good job in Trump world\" so long as she protected \"the family.\" Hutchinson also testified that an aide to Meadows, Ben Williamson, had passed along a message from Meadows that he \"knows that you'll do the right thing tomorrow and that you're going to protect him and the boss.\"\n\nBut Hutchinson, who had been a loyal staffer in the Trump White House, privy to countless conversations in and around the offices of the President and the chief of staff, would not be intimidated. She found new counsel and thwarted the thuggish attempts to gain her silence, delivering some of the most damning testimony of the investigation. She described conversations, some secondhand, that made it plain that Trump knew full well that he had lost the election but would stop at nothing to keep power. Because of her preternatural calm before the microphone, the uninflected, more-in-sadness-than-in-anger tone of her delivery, Hutchinson was often compared to John Dean, the White House counsel under Richard Nixon, who emerged from the Watergate hearings as the most memorable and decisive witness.\n\nBut the nature of Hutchinson's testimony, in keeping with the era, was distinctly more lurid than Dean's. She recalled how Trump hurled his lunch against the wall, splattering ketchup everywhere, when he learned that Attorney General William Barr had publicly declared that there was, in fact, no evidence of election fraud. On other occasions, she said, the President pulled out \"the tablecloth to let all the contents of the table go onto the floor and likely break or go everywhere.\" She recounted the names of the many Trumpists-including Meadows, Giuliani, Matt Gaetz, and Louie Gohmert-who had requested that Trump grant them pardons in connection with the Capitol attack. She said that, three days before the insurrection, the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, told Trump that, if he carried out his plan to march to the Capitol with the crowds, \"we're going to get charged with every crime imaginable.\" Hutchinson testified that on January 6th Cipollone told Meadows, \"They're literally calling for the Vice President to be effing hung.\" As she recalled, \"Mark had responded something to the effect of 'You heard him, Pat. He thinks Mike deserves it. He doesn't think they're doing anything wrong.' \"\n\nFinally, Hutchinson made it clear just how much Trump had wanted to join the insurrectionists on Capitol Hill. Trump was so incensed with his Secret Service detail for refusing to take him there, she testified, that he lunged at the agent driving his car and struggled for the wheel. The report corroborates Hutchinson's testimony, saying that the \"vast majority\" of its law-enforcement sources described a \"furious interaction\" between the President and his security contingent in his S.U.V. The sources said that Trump was \"furious,\" \"insistent,\" \"profane,\" and \"heated.\" The committee concluded that Trump had hoped to lead the effort to overturn the election either from inside the House chamber or from a stage outside the building.\n\nHutchinson was equally forthright about Trump's disregard for public safety. Despite being told that many of the supporters who came out to see him speak on January 6th were armed, she said, Trump insisted that the Secret Service remove the \"mags\"-the metal detectors. He was not terribly concerned that someone might be killed or injured, so long as it wasn't him. \"I don't fucking care that they have weapons,\" he said, according to Hutchinson. \"They're not here to hurt me.\"\n\nThe insurrection at the Capitol was of such grave consequence for liberal democracy and the rule of law that commentators have struggled ever since to find some historical precedent to provide context and understanding to a nation in a state of continuing crisis. Some thought immediately of the sack of the Capitol, in 1814, though the perpetrators then were foreign, soldiers of the British crown. Others have pointed to contested Presidential elections of the past-1824, 1876, 1960, 2000-but those ballots were certified, peacefully and lawfully, by Congress. None of the losers sought to foment an uprising or create a national insurgency. Compare Trump's self-absorption and rage with Al Gore's graceful acceptance of the Supreme Court's decision handing the election to George W. Bush: \"Tonight, for the sake of our unity as a people and the strength of our democracy, I offer my concession.\"\n\nStill, there have been efforts to overturn the constitutional order, notably in the \"secession winter\" of 1860-61, when seven slaveholding states, having warned that they would never accept the election of Abraham Lincoln, declared themselves in opposition to the United States itself. As Lincoln prepared for his inauguration, to be held in March, he received a series of warnings that an army raised in Virginia might invade Washington, D.C. So prevalent were the rumors of a Confederate conspiracy that Congress assembled a committee to \"inquire whether a secret organization hostile to the government of the United States exists in the District of Columbia.\" Lincoln was particularly concerned about a potential plot to undermine the counting of electors, an event scheduled for February. In the end, John Breckinridge, James Buchanan's Vice-President and a loser in the 1860 Presidential race, obeyed the law. Although Breckinridge was sympathetic to the secessionist cause, he presided with \"Roman fidelity\" at the certification vote, according to Representative Henry Dawes, of Massachusetts, \"and the nation was saved.\" But only temporarily. On April 12, 1861, the South Carolina militia opened fire on the Union garrison at Fort Sumter and the Civil War began.\n\nA civil war, in the nineteenth-century understanding of the term, is not at hand. But what makes the events of January 6, 2021, so alarming is that they were inspired and incited by the President of the United States, Donald Trump, who remains popular among so many Republicans and a contender to return to the White House.\n\nThe events of January 6th were the culmination of a long campaign that Trump and members of his circle have led against the legitimacy of American elections. The campaign's most powerful weapon was the undermining of truth itself, the insidious deployment of conspiracy theories and \"alternative facts.\"\n\nTrump first announced his emergence from the worlds of New York real estate and reality-show television by declaring that Barack Obama, the first Black President, had been born in Kenya, not Hawaii, and was, therefore, ineligible to hold office. After joining the 2016 Presidential race, Trump continued to traffic in casual accusations and unfounded conspiracy theories: Ted Cruz's father was an associate of Lee Harvey Oswald. Antonin Scalia might have been murdered. Obama and Joe Biden might have staged the killing of Osama bin Laden with a body double. Trump welcomed the endorsement of the professional conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who had earlier claimed that Hillary Clinton had \"personally murdered and chopped up and raped\" children, and that the mass murder at Sandy Hook had been \"staged.\" The most consequential conspiracy theory of Trump's political career, however, charged that American elections were rigged.\n\nIn 2016, Trump, once he had a hold on the Republican Party nomination, began the process of undermining confidence in the entire electoral system. The reporter Jonathan Lemire, in his book, \"The Big Lie,\" recalls attending a rally, in Columbus, Ohio, at which Trump told his followers, weeks before the nominating Convention, \"I'm afraid the election is going to be rigged, I have to be honest.\" On Fox News, talking with Sean Hannity, Trump again expressed his doubts: \"I hope the Republicans are watching closely, or it's going to be taken away from us.\" Trump began to warn that he was not necessarily prepared to accede to the election results. At one of the Presidential debates, the moderator, Chris Wallace, asked Trump if he would make a commitment to accept the outcome, no matter what. Trump refused: \"I will look at it at the time. What I've seen is so bad.\"\n\nClinton won the popular vote by a margin of more than two per cent, but, because she fell well short in the Electoral College, there was no compulsion on Trump's part to consider extralegal action. But four years later, as Trump lagged behind Joe Biden in the polls, he revived the theme. \"MILLIONS OF MAIL-IN BALLOTS WILL BE PRINTED BY FOREIGN COUNTRIES, AND OTHERS,\" he tweeted. \"IT WILL BE THE SCANDAL OF OUR TIMES!\" Once more, Trump refused to promise a peaceful transfer of power. A month and a half before the election, he said, \"Get rid of the ballots and you'll have a very peaceful-there won't be a transfer, frankly. There will be a continuation.\"\n\nThis kind of rhetoric was of grave concern to Democrats, including Speaker Pelosi, who privately told confidants, \"He's going to try to steal it.\" And, not long after the voting ended, the tweets from Trump began:\n\nLast night I was leading, often solidly, in many key States, in almost all instances Democrat run & controlled. Then, one by one, they started to magically disappear as surprise ballot dumps were counted. VERY STRANGE, and the pollsters got it completely & historically wrong!\n\nThey are finding Biden votes all over the place-in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. So bad for our Country!\n\nOn November 7th, the Associated Press, Fox News, and, soon, all the other major news outlets called Pennsylvania, and the election, for Biden. The battleground states-Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, Arizona, and Wisconsin-all went Biden's way, and, in the end, he won 306 electoral votes to Trump's 232. In his victory speech, the President-elect said, \"It's time to put away the harsh rhetoric. To lower the temperature.\"\n\nThis was a vain hope. As the Trump White House emptied, a motley assemblage of satraps and third-raters-Giuliani; a former federal prosecutor, Sidney Powell; the MyPillow C.E.O., Mike Lindell; the former law professor and Federalist Society leader John Eastman-stayed behind to encourage Trump in his most conspiratorial fantasies and schemes. In their effort to challenge election results in various states, Trump's lawyers filed sixty-two federal and state lawsuits. They lost sixty-one of those suits, winning only on an inconsequential technical matter in Pennsylvania. By mid-December, even Mitch McConnell began referring to \"President-elect Joe Biden.\" When Trump called to berate him for conceding the ballot, McConnell, for once, stood up to him. \"The Electoral College has spoken,\" he said. \"You lost the election.\"\n\nThe only option Trump had left was to challenge the certification of the vote. With Eastman in the lead, his team concocted a plan that called on Vice-President Pence to declare that voting in seven states was still in dispute and to eliminate those electors. If the remaining forty-three states put forward their electors, Trump would win the election, 232-222. As part of that plan-what Chairman Thompson called, from the first day of the hearings, \"an attempted coup\"-Trump pressured government and election officials to coöperate. Former Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue testified that Trump did not conceal his intent, telling Donoghue, \"What I'm asking you to do is just say it was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.\" Once Trump unleashed his campaign of intimidation against local election officials, the death threats against those officials came from all directions. Ruby Freeman, an election worker in Georgia, testified, \"There is nowhere I feel safe. Nowhere. Do you know how it feels to have the President of the United States target you?\"\n\nAnother version of the plan had Pence calling for a ten-day-long recess and sending the slates back to the so-called \"disputed\" states. Eastman himself conceded that this plan would be rejected unanimously by the Supreme Court. Even so, the White House could surely be retained if Trump could convince Pence to \"do the right thing.\"\n\nOn the night of January 5th, the President met with Pence at the White House and tried to pressure him into adopting the scheme that Eastman had devised. For years, Pence had been the most loyal of deputies, never daring to challenge the falsehoods or the cruelties of his master. Trump, after all, had rescued him from political oblivion. But Pence would not go along with the plot. His job on January 6th, he told the President, was ceremonial. He was only there \"to open envelopes.\"\n\nTrump was outraged. \"You've betrayed us,\" he told Pence. \"I made you. You were nothing.\"\n\nThe committee's report is not a work of scholarship removed from its era. It was compiled by politicians and staff members and published at a moment of continuing peril and uncertainty. And the committee was formed in the contrails of the terrifying episode it was charged with investigating.\n\nAlthough an abundance of new details has surfaced, the contours of what happened have never been in doubt. The events on January 6, 2021, began with a well-planned rally on the Ellipse, the fifty-two-acre park south of the White House. Trump had tweeted in advance, \"Be there, will be wild!\" Katrina Pierson, a spokeswoman for Trump's 2016 campaign and one of the organizers of the rally, had texted another organizer saying that Trump \"likes the crazies,\" and wanted Alex Jones to be among the speakers. Jones did not speak, but Trump himself supplied the inflammatory rhetoric. In the seventy-minute-long speech he gave on the Ellipse, he told his followers they would \"save our democracy\" by rejecting \"a fake election,\" and warned them that \"if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.\" He taunted his Vice-President: \"Mike Pence, I hope you're going to stand up for the good of our Constitution and for the good of our country. And if you're not, I'm going to be very disappointed in you.\" He set a tone of combativeness, defiance, and eternal resistance. And he put the life of his own Vice-President in jeopardy. As Chairman Thompson put it at one hearing, \"Donald Trump turned the mob on him.\"\n\nEven though senior officials around Trump had told him that it was long past time to step aside-William Barr informed congressional investigators that he told Trump that reports of voting fraud were \"bullshit\"-Trump refused to listen. (\"I thought, boy, if he really believes this stuff, he has, you know, lost contact with, he's become detached from reality,\" Barr recalled.) Trump was unrelenting. \"We will never give up,\" he told the crowd on the Ellipse. \"We will never concede. It doesn't happen. You don't concede when there's theft involved. Our country has had enough. We will not take it anymore.\" After listening to the President's repeated calls to fight, and to march to the Capitol building-\"you'll never take back our country with weakness\"-thousands of his followers, some of them armed, some of them carrying Confederate symbols, some deploying flagpoles as spears, headed toward Capitol Hill.\n\nAs the march began, at around 1 p.m. , Representative Paul Gosar, of Arizona, and Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas, both conservative Republicans, rose in Congress to object to the counting of the electoral ballots from Arizona. But Pence had already told Trump he would not go along with his plot, and there was no sign that Gosar, Cruz, and Trump's loyalists in Congress had the numbers to succeed. McConnell, at that time the Senate Majority Leader, said, \"Voters, the courts, and the states have all spoken-they've all spoken. If we overrule them all, it would damage our republic forever.\"\n\nBy 2 p.m. , demonstrators began to overrun the Capitol Police, sometimes using improvised weapons. Caroline Edwards, of the Capitol Police, testified to the committee that there was \"carnage\" in the halls: \"I was slipping in people's blood.\" The insurrectionists kept coming, breaking through windows and doors, assaulting police officers, and, once inside, they went hunting for the Vice-President, the Speaker of the House, and other officials who refused to participate in the President's scheme to overturn the election. At around 2:20 p.m. , the Senate, and then the House, went into emergency recess, as Capitol Police officers rushed members of both chambers to safety. The two Democratic congressional leaders, Nancy Pelosi and Charles Schumer, fearing for their lives and the lives of their colleagues, were reduced to sequestering in a safe location. In the final session of the committee's investigation, we saw footage of Pelosi, enraged yet composed, deploying her cell phone to get someone to come to the aid of the legislative branch.\n\nTrump watched these events on television at the White House with scant sense of alarm. He refused to send additional police or troops to quell the violence. At 2:24 p.m. , he tweeted, \"Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution.\" By 3 p.m. , insurrectionists, some of them in cosplay battle gear, had swarmed into the Senate chamber. Trump's passivity was not passivity at all. As Adam Kinzinger put it, \"President Trump did not fail to act. He chose not to act.\" Liz Cheney was no less blunt. \"He refused to defend our nation and our Constitution,\" she said during the hearings. \"I say this to my Republican colleagues who are   defending the indefensible, there will come a day when Donald Trump is gone. But your dishonor will remain.\"\n\nFor Trump, the choice was simple. The insurrectionists were his people, his shock troops, there to do his bidding. Nothing about the spectacle seemed to disturb him: not the gallows erected outside the building, not the savage beatings, not threats to Pence and Pelosi, not graffiti like \"Murder the Media,\" not the chants of \"1776! 1776!\" And so he ignored calls to action even from his own party. At 3:11 p.m. , Mike Gallagher, a Republican from Wisconsin, tweeted, \"We are witnessing absolute banana republic crap in the United States Capitol right now. @realdonaldtrump you need to call this off.\" Trump would not tell his supporters to go home until the early evening, when the damage had been done.\n\nAnd though Trump and the insurrectionists failed to halt the certification of the ballot, they did get substantial support: a hundred and forty-seven Republicans in Congress voted to overturn the election results. At 3:42 a.m. on January 7th, Vice-President Pence, speaking to a joint session of Congress, certified the election of Joe Biden as the forty-sixth President of the United States. When, however, the midterms were held, two years later, dozens of Republican candidates continued to claim that his election was fraudulent. Those few Republicans, like Liz Cheney, who took a stand against Trump were swept out of office.\n\nJanuary 6th was a phenomenon rooted both in the degraded era of Trump and in the radicalization of a major political party during the past generation. The very power of these developments explains why many people may approach this congressional report with a sense of fatigue, even denial. Part of Trump's dark achievement has been to bludgeon the political attention of the country into submission.\n\nWhen a nation has been subjected to that degree of cynicism-what is politely called \"divisiveness\"-it can lose its ability to experience outrage. As a result, the prospect of engaging with this congressional inquiry into Trump's attempt to delegitimatize the machinery of electoral democracy is sometimes a challenge to the spirit. That is both understandable and a public danger. And yet a citizenry that can no longer bring itself to pay attention to such an investigation or to absorb its astonishing findings risks moving even farther toward a disturbing \"new normal\": a post-truth, post-democratic America.\n\nA republic is predicated on faith-not religious faith but a faith in the fundamental legitimacy of its political institutions and the decisions they issue. To concede the legitimacy of statutes, rulings, and election returns is not necessarily to favor them. It's simply to participate in the basic system that gives them form and force; citizens can, through democratic machinery, seek to defeat or contest candidates they deplore, initiatives that offend them, court opinions they consider misguided. By contrast, the campaign that culminated in the Capitol attack of January 6th was, fatefully, against democracy itself. It sought to instill profound mistrust in the process of voting-the mechanism through which, even in highly imperfect democracies, accountability is ultimately secured.\n\nThe committee and its work were far from apolitical, and yet to dismiss the report as merely political would be a perilous act of resignation and defeatism. The questions that hovered over the inquiry from the start-what more is there to learn? who is really listening?-persisted and loomed over the midterm elections. When the hearings began, the polling outfit FiveThirtyEight reported that Trump's approval rating was 41.9 per cent; when the hearings ended, it was 40.4 per cent, a minuscule dip. As Susan B. Glasser, of The New Yorker , wrote, \"All that damning evidence, and the polls were basically unchanged. The straight line in the former President's approval rating is the literal representation of the crisis in American democracy. There is an essentially immovable forty per cent of the country whose loyalty to Donald Trump cannot be shaken by anything.\" And yet the Republicans failed in their promise to produce a \"red wave\" in the midterms. The Democrats maintained their slender hold on the Senate and lost far fewer seats in the House than was expected. And while the reasons behind the Republican failure were many, ranging from the imperilment of abortion rights to the dismal quality of so many of the Party's candidates, it was clear that one of the principal reasons was a deep concern about the future of democracy.\n\nThe most urgent thing to learn is whether a two-and-a-half-century-old republic will resist future efforts to undercut its foundations-to steal, through concerted deception, the essential legitimacy of its constitutional order. The contents of the report insist that complacency is not an option. The report also insists on accountability, though that will ultimately be the responsibility of the Department of Justice and the American public. The report has provided the evidence, the truth. Now it remains to be seen if it will be acted upon.\n\nThe violation of January 6th was ultimately so brazen that many of Trump's own loyalists could not, in the end, bring themselves to defend him. Even some on the radical right have come to recognize the insurrection's implications for the future. Jason van Tatenhove was once the media spokesman for the militia group known as the Oath Keepers, which played a crucial role in the uprising. He left the group well before January 6th, but he remained well connected enough to know that the Oath Keepers were eager to take part in an \"armed revolution.\" Testifying before the committee, he expressed his sense of betrayal by Donald Trump, and a growing sense of alarm: \"If a President that's willing to try to instill and encourage, to whip up, a civil war among his followers uses lies and deceit and snake oil, regardless of the human impact, what else is he going to do?\"\n\nTrump is running again for President. Perhaps his decline is irreversible. But it would be foolish to count on that. Should he win back the White House, he will come to office with no sense of restraint. He will inevitably be an even more radical, more resentful, more chaotic, more authoritarian version of his earlier self. And he would hardly be an isolated figure in the capital. Following the results of the midterm elections, Congress is now populated with dozens of election deniers and many more who still dare not defy Trump. The stakes could not be higher. If you are reaching for optimism-and despair is not an option-the existence and the depth of the committee's project represents a kind of hope. It represents an insistence on truth and democratic principle. In the words of the man who tried and failed to overturn a Presidential election, you don't concede when there's theft involved. ♦\n\nWhen the Capitol was breached, a New Yorker reporter became the sole journalist in the Senate chamber to witness its desecration .\n\nInside the chamber, Luke Mogelson captured raw, visceral footage of the siege .\n\nShould Americans refer to the Sixth of January as a protest, an act of treason, or something else ?\n\nWhat the January 6th papers reveal .\n\nHow a mother of eight became one of the riot's biggest mysteries, and a fugitive from the F.B.I.\n\nThe violence was what Donald Trump wanted .\n\nIf America is to remain a democracy, Trump must be held accountable .\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New Yorker .\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The Ghost of January 6th Haunts 2024\n\nListen to this story.\n\nThe long shadow of January 6, 2021, hangs over this election. Three years after a mob of Americans stormed their own Capitol, seeking to block Joe Biden's victory and keep Donald Trump in the White House, Biden and Trump each began 2024 with plans to make the tragic events of that day the centerpiece of his campaign. For the incumbent, it's the rationale for his entire Presidency and the most compelling reason to give him a second term-a continuation of the \"battle for the soul of America\" that animated Biden's run in 2020. For Trump, it's the false battle cry around which he hopes to rally the MAGA mob once again. Already, he has proved that millions of his supporters are immune to the truth about January 6th. It will be an incredible act of political sorcery if he can ride his lies about the 2020 election and its violent aftermath back into the White House. And yet, as the year begins, his chances of doing so are better than even.\n\nOn Wednesday, in his first day back in the office this new year, the President hosted lunch for a group of American historians to advise him on how to frame the stakes of this election. One attendee, Heather Cox Richardson, a Civil War scholar whose latest book, \" Democracy Awakening ,\" was Biden's most conspicuous purchase during a day of post-Thanksgiving shopping, has called the visual of Trumpists parading the Confederate flag through Congress on January 6th \"a gut-punch larger than any other moment in history.\" Biden's first campaign ad of the year , released on Thursday, leans heavily on the history theme, interspersing violent images of January 6th with old footage of civil-rights and suffragist marches, of Martin Luther King, Jr., and American Marines raising the flag on Iwo Jima in the Second World War. \"I've made the preservation of American democracy the central issue of my Presidency,\" Biden says.\n\nThe challenge for Biden, though, is recapturing the visceral outrage of the insurrection-voters have, for years, been bombarded with horrific images of the riot and a steady drip of investigative revelations about how Trump helped conjure it into being-while imbuing it with new meaning and relevance. It is a necessary act of remembrance, but one that risks reminding Americans of how annoyed they are about a 2024 election that looks very likely to be a repeat of 2020. Is there anyone who truly relishes the prospect of Biden and Trump going at it once again, changing few minds while reinforcing for everyone how mired we remain in the division and rancor of that unpleasant year? No country would want to be stuck in such a doom loop.\n\nBut doom loop it looks to be. There is no moving on from that day so long as its instigator remains the leader of the Republican Party. In less than two weeks, Trump is on track to secure what could be the largest win in the history of the Iowa Republican caucuses. His lead is so wide that some expect him to sew up the Republican nomination by March. If and when Trump does, he will have accomplished it with a platform that doubles down on January 6th and his own sorry role in calling forth the mob. He is not denying the facts; he is outright rewriting them.\n\nTo his original Big Lie about the \"rigged election\" in 2020, Trump has added ever more lies. He now calls January 6th \"a beautiful day\" and the nearly thirteen hundred defendants arrested in connection with the attack on the Capitol martyrs and \"hostages .\" In recent months as he has campaigned for his return to the White House, he has dangled pardons for the insurrectionists, to be issued \"on Day 1\" of his second term, and threatened instead to lock up the police who tried to defend the Capitol that day. \"When people who love our country protest in Washington, they become hostages unfairly imprisoned for long portions of their life,\" he told a rally in Iowa last month.\n\nThis rhetoric is likely only to escalate in the course of the campaign, as Trump faces both a federal and a state trial on criminal charges connected with his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. In fourteen states, meanwhile, there is pending litigation to keep Trump off the ballot on the ground that his role in inciting the events of January 6th makes him an \"insurrectionist\" as defined by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution-a matter soon to make its way to the Supreme Court since both Colorado and Maine have already disqualified him from their ballots. Trump's legal team is also challenging the federal case against him, on the basis that his extraordinary post-2020-election acts were part of his official duties and thus covered by Presidential \"immunity.\" One thing we can pretty much say for sure about 2024 is that not a day will go by without the ghost of January 6th echoing loudly in our courtrooms and in our politics.\n\nAnother sad but inescapable truth is that Trump's January 6th revisionism has proved even more politically salient with the Republican electorate than anyone could have predicted on the day itself. Remember all those panicky texts to the White House, begging Trump to call off the mob? \"He is destroying his legacy,\" Laura Ingraham warned Mark Meadows , Trump's chief of staff. Even Don, Jr., begged Meadows to intervene: \"He's got to condemn this shit. Asap.\" But Trump, it turns out, knew better. A Washington Post /University of Maryland survey published this week found that, in the intervening three years, the number of Republicans who believe Trump's lies about a \"rigged election\" has, in fact, gone up. Today, only thirty-one per cent of Republicans believe that Biden is the \"legitimate\" President, down from thirty-nine per cent in late 2021. The number of Republicans, meanwhile, who believe that Trump personally bears  \"a great deal\" or \"a good amount\" of responsibility for the events of January 6th has gone down from twenty-seven per cent two years ago to just fourteen per cent today. The right-wing media ecosystem has been so effective in pumping out Trump's propaganda that the Post /Maryland poll found thirty-four per cent of Republicans now say they believe the bogus conspiracy theory that the F.B.I. itself was responsible for inciting the attack on the Capitol.\n\nIf there's one thing we've learned in recent years about Trump's hold over the G.O.P., it's this: where his voters go, eventually, even the Republican holdouts in Congress will follow. On Wednesday, Trump was endorsed by House Majority Whip Tom Emmer-barely two months after Trump sank Emmer's candidacy for the House Speakership, with a social-media post warning that Emmer would be a \"tragic mistake\" and calling him a \"Globalist RINO \" who was \"totally out-of-touch\" with Republican voters. One reason for Trump's animus? Emmer had voted to certify Biden's election on January 6th. \"They always bend the knee,\" the Times quoted Trump as saying of Emmer's act of self-abasement.\n\nLesson learned: there is no political future in the G.O.P. without bowing to even Trump's mightiest lies. The Republicans' modern-day political alchemist has, in just three years, made 2020-election denialism-and its corollary set of falsehoods about January 6th-a core tenet in the Republican catechism. Who's to say where this will all end up? The prospect of Trump restored as President, back in the Oval Office on January 20, 2025, pardoning himself and all the other \"hostages\" seems a lot more real than it did three years ago.\n\nUsually, it's the winning side that dictates how history will be written. No wonder Biden has started this campaign year by calling in the historians. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "What the January 6th Report Is Missing\n\nTrump is going to do some crazy shit.\n\n-Steve Bannon, October 31, 2020\n\nThe Government Publishing Office's eight-hundred-and-forty-five-page report of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol is divided into eight chapters, makes eleven recommendations, attaches four appendices, and includes four thousand two hundred and eighty-five endnotes. Its executive summary, which at nearly two hundred pages can hardly be called a summary, provides a numbered list of seventeen key findings, the first eleven of which have, as the subject of the predicate, the forty-fifth President of the United States:\n\n1. Donald Trump purposely disseminated false allegations of fraud. . . .\n\n2. Donald Trump refused to accept the lawful result of the 2020 election. . . .\n\n3. Donald Trump corruptly pressured Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to count electoral votes. . . .\n\n4. Donald Trump sought to corrupt the U.S. Department of Justice. . . .\n\n5. Donald Trump unlawfully pressured State officials and legislators. . . .\n\n6. Donald Trump oversaw an effort to transmit false electoral certificates. . . .\n\n7. Donald Trump pressured Members of Congress to object to valid slates of electors. . . .\n\n8. Donald Trump purposely verified false information filed in Federal court. . . .\n\n9. Donald Trump summoned tens of thousands of supporters to Washington for January 6th. . . .\n\n10. Donald Trump purposely sent a social media message publicly condemning Vice President Pence. . . .\n\n11. Donald Trump refused repeated requests over a multiple hour period that he instruct his violent supporters to disperse and leave the Capitol. . . .\n\nIn a foreword to the report, Bennie G. Thompson, the committee's chairman, stresses the importance of \"accountability at all levels,\" but although the word \"conspiracy\" appears both in finding No. 12-\"Each of these actions by Donald Trump was taken in support of a multi-part conspiracy to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 Presidential election\"-and more than a hundred times elsewhere in the document, the report is less an account of a conspiracy than a very long bill of indictment against a single man.\n\nRead David Remnick on the House select committee's devastating findings.\n\nTwo years ago, the President of the United States attempted to overturn an election for no reason other than that he had lost. A mere handful of Republican officeholders denounced him; for months, nationally prominent members of the G.O.P. refused to acknowledge that Joseph Biden had won the Presidency. On January 6, 2021, at Trump's urging, thousands of his supporters staged an armed, lethal, and yet somehow also inane insurrection at the Capitol , aimed at preventing a joint session of Congress from certifying the results of the election. They failed. Unless you count being temporarily banned from Twitter as punishment, the former President has suffered no consequences for his actions; Republicans have refused to hold him to account, not least because many Party leaders have been implicated in the attempted overthrow of the United States government. Days after the insurrection, the House voted to impeach the President, but the Senate then failed to convict him. Months later, the House voted to establish an independent, 9/11-style commission to investigate the insurrection, but the Senate blocked that by way of the filibuster. The House soon voted to hold its own investigation , under the aegis of a select committee composed of seven Democrats and six Republicans. Then Nancy Pelosi , the Democratic Speaker of the House, refused to seat on the committee two Republicans who had supported the insurrection, whereupon Kevin McCarthy , the Republican Minority Leader, denounced the committee and pulled his members from it, after which the G.O.P., declaring the attack on the Capitol to have been \"legitimate political discourse,\" censured the two Republicans who did serve on the committee, Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, both of whom left office this month. (Cheney lost her bid for reëlection, and Kinzinger declined to run.)\n\nCongress established the January 6th Committee on June 30, 2021. The committee's report is the fullest record yet of the conspiracy to overturn the results of the 2020 Presidential election , much of it deriving from the dauntless work of earlier reporters, much of it newly gathered by the committee itself. In the course of eighteen months, the committee reviewed thousands of pages of evidence and presented testimony from more than seventy witnesses during ten televised hearings produced with the aid of the former president of ABC News and illustrated with taped video interviews, Facebook posts, text messages, YouTube clips, and surveillance footage, all of it easily snipped and posted on social media. The hearings made for great television and, probably more important, great memes, the TikTokification of testimony. \"Like our hearings, this report is designed to deliver our findings in detail in a format that is accessible for all Americans,\" Liz Cheney, the committee's vice-chair, writes in a foreword to the written report. But the report, unlike the hearings, is dreary, repetitive, and exhausting. In that sense, it's like Trump himself. It's also surprisingly scanty in the key elements of storytelling-setting, character, and plot. It's as if the committee found itself unable to surmount Trump's madness and senselessness, trapped in his very plotlessness.\n\nThe report doesn't lack for details, which consist mainly of running down and debunking bogus claims about dead voters, shredded ballots, dumped votes, voting machines linked to Hugo Chávez, a faked water-main rupture, suitcases full of ballots, U.S.B. drives, truckloads of ballots in garbage bins, unmarked vans, a Dominion voting machine connected to China by way of a smart thermostat, and some guy meddling with the election from inside a prison in Italy. There are inconsequential but \"Veep\"-worthy revelations: an Oath Keeper calling followers of QAnon \"Q-tards,\" and Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, at the rally at the Ellipse on January 6th, asked whether he would march to the Capitol, answering, \"Hell, no. It's freezing.\" Antics abound: Rudy Giuliani (who is now facing disbarment) holding a press conference at Four Seasons Total Landscaping; Ivanka and Jared fretting, uselessly; a Proud Boys subcommittee calling itself the Ministry of Self-Defense entertaining a proposal from South Florida cryptocurrency investors that refers to the planned attack on the Capitol as operation Storm the Winter Palace, a reference to the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution (leading the report's authors to huff, \"No historical event has been less American\"). At one point, Trump supporters in Michigan plan to hide out in the state's capitol overnight, so that, in the morning, they can sign an elector certificate that, by law, has to be signed in that building. Not for nothing did William Barr, the Attorney General at the time, refer to Trump's legal team as the \"clown car.\" It's all so madcap and vaudevillian that, if the stakes weren't so high, and the matter at hand not so grave, it would be the Marx Brothers in \"Night at the White House.\"\n\nBut the stakes are high; they tower. Trump might get reëlected. Or he might get indicted. Both could happen. Even if he were to die tomorrow, the attempt to overturn the election would require an accounting of its deeper roots in American political behavior and discourse, of the anti-government takeover of the G.O.P., and of the role played by the hundred and forty-seven Republicans who, in the early morning of January 7, 2021, only hours after the Capitol had been cleared of rioters, voted against certifying the results of the election. The siege of the building is, in the end, the least of it. The Department of Justice has so far filed criminal charges against more than nine hundred people who participated in the insurrection, of whom nearly five hundred have either pleaded guilty or been convicted. The January 6th Report makes eight criminal referrals, recommending that the Department of Justice prosecute the former President (and in some cases other people) for crimes that include obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and incitement or assistance of insurrection, the charge for which Trump was impeached in January, 2021. Much turns on the reception of this report. As a brief for the prosecution, it's a start. As a book, it's essential if miserable reading. As history, it's a shambles.\n\nInvestigatory committees and commissions began to multiply about a century ago, with the rise of the administrative state and the extension of executive power. Their purpose is chiefly to hold bureaucrats and elected officials and, especially, the executive branch accountable for wrongdoing. It wasn't clear, at first, whether these commissions were constitutional. That question was resolved in 1927, when, in McGrain v. Daugherty, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a conviction for contempt of the brother of the Attorney General, who had refused to appear before a Senate committee investigating the Teapot Dome scandal. The investigatory commission proliferated during the Progressive Era, and has origins in \"race riot\" commissions like the Chicago Commission on Race Relations, established in 1919 by the governor of Illinois \"to get the facts and interpret them and to find a way out,\" or, as Lyndon B. Johnson put it, when charging the Kerner Commission with investigating \"civil disorders\" half a century later, \"What happened? Why did it happen? What can be done to prevent it from happening again and again?\"\n\nThese same questions animate the January 6th investigation, and a case can be made that the insurrection was, among other things, a race riot -a white race riot. But the committee has not taken as its model the race-riot report. Instead, the report is indebted to earlier investigations into attacks on the United States, a kinship suggested by the committee's preference for the word \"attack\" over the word \"insurrection,\" as if it came from without. \"I don't know if you want to use the word 'insurrection,' 'coup,' whatever,\" a White House staffer told the committee. The committee knew which word it wanted to use.\n\nCongress ordered the select committee to \"investigate and report upon the facts, circumstances, and causes\" of the attack on the Capitol. The charge borrows its language from investigations into earlier attacks on the United States. On December 18, 1941, eleven days after the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, F.D.R. appointed a commission \"to ascertain and report the facts relating to the attack.\" In 1963, after John F. Kennedy was assassinated, Lyndon B. Johnson directed the Warren Commission \"to evaluate all the facts and circumstances surrounding the assassination,\" which, at the time, many suspected to have been a covert operation coördinated by the K.G.B., given that Lee Harvey Oswald had defected to the Soviet Union in 1959. In 2002, Congress charged the 9/11 Commission with determining the \"facts and circumstances relating to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\" Each investigated failures within the federal government, especially failures of intelligence, but each looked, too, to foreign actors.\n\nIf you're going to report on the facts, circumstances, and causes of an event, the natural way to do it is to write a story that is both painstakingly researched and kept kissing-close to the evidence-a story, in other words, that is also a history. A history has to be true, to the best of your knowledge at the time of the writing, and it ought to be riveting. The Warren Commission Report (1964) reads like a mystery novel: \"In the corner house itself, Mrs. Barbara Jeanette Davis and her sister-in-law, Mrs. Virginia Davis, heard the shots and rushed to the door in time to see the man walk rapidly across the lawn shaking a revolver as if he were emptying it of cartridge cases.\" The Starr Report (1998), an investigation of a real-estate deal that ended up exposing Bill Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky, often reads like porn: \"In the course of flirting with him, she raised her jacket in the back and showed him the straps of her thong underwear, which extended above her pants.\" The 9/11 Commission Report (2004) reads like an international thriller: \"Tuesday, September 11, 2001, dawned temperate and nearly cloudless in the eastern United States. . . . In Sarasota, Florida, President George W. Bush went for an early morning run. For those heading to an airport, weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey. Among the travelers were Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al Omari, who arrived at the airport in Portland, Maine.\" The January 6th Report reads like a prosecuting attorney's statement to a jury: \"President Trump's decision to declare victory falsely on election night and, unlawfully, to call for the vote counting to stop, was not a spontaneous decision. It was premeditated.\" A page-turner it is not.\n\nThe reports of earlier investigatory commissions have been mixed successes. The Warren Report, which concluded that Oswald acted alone, is notorious, since it did little to halt the flowering of conspiracy theories involving everything from the Mafia to Martians. \"We are looking to you, not to approve our own notions, but to guide us and to guide the country through a thicket of tension, conflicting evidence, and extreme opinion,\" L.B.J. told the Kerner Commission. But, when the report came in, the President refused even to accept a copy. The Starr Report is just plain embarrassing.\n\nReports of investigatory commissions don't age well: as is the case with all historical analysis, more evidence always comes out later. Still, some reports are better than others. The 9/11 Commission Report was a finalist for the National Book Award. In an \"authorized\" edition published by W. W. Norton, the report was also an unexpected best-seller. As with the January 6th Report, which is available from several different publishers as a book- including an edition co-published by this magazine -you could get the 9/11 report free online, but people bought it anyway. Time described it as \"one of the most riveting, disturbing and revealing accounts of crime, espionage and the inner workings of government ever written.\" The Times Book Review called it \"an improbable literary triumph.\"\n\nFamilies of the victims, not members of Congress, had demanded the formation of the 9/11 Commission, which consisted of five Democrats and five Republicans (none of whom were current members of Congress). The architects of the report were two professors of history-the commission's executive director, Philip D. Zelikow, and a senior adviser, Ernest R. May-who had taught courses together and had also collaborated on a book, \"The Kennedy Tapes.\" May, a Harvard professor (and a colleague of mine until his death, in 2009), wanted to reinvent the genre. \"Typically, government reports focus on 'findings' and array the evidence accordingly,\" he explained. \"None, to our knowledge, had ever attempted simply to produce professional-quality narrative history.\" This is what May set out to do-he wanted to create \"enduringly readable history\"-and it's not only the report's narrative structure but also its sense of historical time that endows it with both immediacy and lastingness.\n\nThe historical narrative is the first eleven chapters of a thirteen-chapter report. There is no two-hundred-page executive summary. There is no executive summary at all, or any list of findings. There is, instead, a taut, three-page preface, and then the story begins, the \"story of eccentric and violent ideas sprouting in the fertile ground of political and social turmoil.\"\n\nThe 9/11 report has plenty of flaws, as May was the first to admit. \"For one thing, the report skirts the question of whether American policies and actions fed the anger that manifested itself on September 11,\" he wrote in The New Republic in 2005 . For another, because some members of the commission and its staff had worked at national-security agencies, \"collective drafting led to the introduction of passages that offset criticism of an agency with words of praise. Not all these words were deserved.\" Both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush got off even easier than the C.I.A., the F.B.I., and the N.S.A. What May was hinting at is illustrated in a thirty-one-page document declassified only this fall, a \"memorandum for the record\" of a meeting between Bush and the commissioners in which the commissioners repeatedly pressed Bush on whether he knew, in the summer of 2001, about the threat posed by Al Qaeda. Bush said he'd been briefed only about \"threats overseas.\" This was a lie. He'd been warned about specific threats to the United States. Nowhere in the commission's final report-released in July, 2004, less than four months before a Presidential election-is the President implicated. If he had been, he might not have been reëlected. \"Our aim has not been to assign individual blame,\" reads the preface, written by the bipartisan commission's co-chairs. Instead, they hoped to provide an explanation.\n\nMay wanted the 9/11 report to \"transcend the passions of the moment,\" and it did. He hoped it might serve as a model for future reports. \"In these perilous times, there will surely be other events that will require the principles of historiography allied to the resources of government, so that urgency will sometimes become the friend of truth.\" This is the bar that was set for members of the January 6th Committee. Their report does not clear that bar. Not because the report isn't accurate but because it hasn't achieved escape velocity from the leaden passions of the present.\n\nHere, radically reduced-forty gallons of sap to one gallon of maple syrup-is a very un-executive summary of the report. Donald Trump never said he'd abide by the outcome of the election. In May of 2020, fearing that Biden might win in November, he tweeted, \"It will be the greatest Rigged Election in history!\" He understood that he would likely lose but that, owing to an effect known as the Red Mirage, it would look, for a while, as if he had won: more Democrats than Republicans would vote by mail and, since mail-in ballots are often the last to be counted, early counting would favor Republicans. \"When that happens,\" Roger Stone advised him, \"the key thing to do is to claim victory. . . . No, we won. Fuck you, Sorry. Over.\"\n\nThat was Plan A. In September, The Atlantic published a bombshell article by Barton Gellman reporting that the Trump campaign had a scheme \"to bypass election results and appoint loyal electors in battleground states where Republicans hold the legislative majority.\" That was Plan B. Plan A (\"Fuck you\") was more Trump's style. \"He's gonna declare victory,\" Steve Bannon said. \"But that doesn't mean he's the winner. He's just gonna say he's a winner.\" On Election Night, November 3rd, Trump wanted to do just that, but his campaign team persuaded him not to. His patience didn't last long. \"This is a fraud on the American public,\" Trump said on November 4th. \"We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election.\" The next day, he tweeted, \" STOP THE COUNT! \" On November 7th, CNN, NBC, MSNBC, ABC, the Associated Press, and Fox News all declared that Joseph Biden had won. The election was not close. Counting the votes just took a while.\n\nAfter Biden won, Trump continued to insist that widespread fraud had been committed. Bill Stepien, Trump's campaign manager, told the January 6th Committee that the campaign became a \"truth telling squad,\" chasing allegations, discovering them to be unfounded, and telling the President, \"Yeah, that wasn't true.\" The Department of Homeland Security looked into allegations, most of which popped up online, and announced, \"There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.\" The Justice Department, too, investigated charges of fraud, but, as Barr informed the committee, he was left telling the President, repeatedly, \"They're not panning out.\"\n\nFor Plan C, the President turned to Rudy Giuliani and a group of lawyers that included Sidney Powell. They filed sixty-two lawsuits challenging election results, and lost all but one of these suits (and that one involved neither allegations of fraud nor any significant number of votes). Twenty-two of the judges who decided these cases had been appointed by Republicans, and ten had been appointed by Trump.\n\nOn December 11th, the Supreme Court rejected a suit that had challenged the results in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Trump had had every right to challenge the results of state elections, but at this point he had exhausted his legal options. He decided to fall back on Plan B, the fake-electors plan, which required hundreds of legislators across the country to set aside the popular vote in states won by Biden, claiming that the results were fraudulent, and appointing their own slate of electors, who would cast their Electoral College votes for Trump on December 14th. According to Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to Trump's chief of staff, Mark Meadows, the White House counsel determined that, since none of the fraud allegations had been upheld by any court, the fake-electors plan was illegal. But one deputy assistant to the President told Trump that it didn't matter whether there had been fraud or not, because \"state legislators 'have the constitutional right to substitute their judgment for a certified majority of their constituents' if that prevents socialism.\"\n\nPlan B required Trump to put pressure on a lot of people. The committee counted at least two hundred attempts he made to influence state or local officials by phone, text, posts, or public remarks. Instructing Trump supporters to join in, Giuliani said, \"Sometimes it even requires being threatened.\" A Trump-campaign spreadsheet documents efforts to contact more than a hundred and ninety Republican state legislators in Arizona, Georgia, and Michigan alone.\n\nBarr resigned. \"I didn't want to be part of it,\" he told the committee. Plenty of other people were happy to be part of it, though. Ronna McDaniel, the R.N.C. chair, participated and provided Trump with the assistance of R.N.C. staffers. On December 14th, certified electors met in every state. In seven states that Biden had won-Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin-fake electors also met and produced counterfeit Electoral College certificates for Trump. Five of these certificates were sent to Washington but were rejected because they lacked the required state seal; two arrived after the deadline. None were accepted.\n\nTrump then launched Plan D, which was not so much a plan as a pig's breakfast of a conspiracy, a coup, and a putsch. Everything turned on January 6th, the day a joint session of Congress was to certify the results of the Electoral College vote. To stop that from happening, Trump recruited members of Congress into a conspiracy to overturn the election by rejecting the certified votes and accepting the counterfeits; he asked the Vice-President to participate in a coup by simply declaring him the winner; and he incited his supporters to take over the Capitol by force, in a poorly planned putsch, which he intended to lead. On December 17th, Kayleigh McEnany said on Fox News, \"There has been an alternate slate of electors voted upon that Congress will decide in January.\" Two days later, Trump tweeted, \"Big protest in D.C. On January 6th. Be there, will be wild.\" The legal architect of the Pence part of the pig's breakfast-\"a coup in search of a legal theory,\" as one federal judge called it-was a lawyer named John Eastman. The Trump lawyer Eric Herschmann recalled a conversation he had with Eastman:\n\nYou're saying you believe the Vice President, acting as President of the Senate, can be the sole decisionmaker as to, under your theory, who becomes the next President of the United States? And he said, yes. And I said, are you out of your Fing mind?\n\nTrump pressed the acting Attorney General, Jeffrey Rosen, and other members of the Department of Justice to aid the conspiracy by declaring some of the voting to have been fraudulent. Rosen refused. \"The D.O.J. can't and won't snap its fingers and change the outcome of the election,\" he told Trump. Trump replied, \"I don't expect you to do that. Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican Congressmen.\" Trump tried to replace Rosen with a lackey named Jeffrey Clark, but, in a tense meeting at the White House on January 3rd, Rosen and others made clear to him that, if he did so, much of the department would resign. Trump and Eastman met repeatedly with Pence in the Oval Office and tried to recruit him into the conspiracy. Pence refused. At 11:20 a.m. on January 6th, Trump called Pence and again asked him, and again Pence refused, after which, according to Ivanka, the President called the Vice-President a pussy.\n\nTrump was slated to speak at his be-wild rally at the Ellipse at noon, but when he arrived he was unhappy about the size of the crowd. The Secret Service had set up magnetometers, known as mags, to screen for weapons. Twenty-eight thousand people went through the mags, from whom the Secret Service collected, among other banned items, \"269 knives or blades, 242 cannisters of pepper spray, 18 brass knuckles, 18 tasers, 6 pieces of body armor, 3 gas masks, 30 batons or blunt instruments.\" Some people had ditched their bags, and presumably their weapons, in trees or cars. In a crowd that included members of white-supremacist and far-right, anti-government extremist groups-including the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers, America First, and QAnon-another twenty-five thousand people simply refused to go through the mags. \"I don't fucking care that they have weapons,\" Trump shouted. \"They're not here to hurt me . Take the fucking mags away.\" The mags stayed. Trump took to the podium and fired up his followers for the march to the Capitol until 1:10 P.M., and then he walked to his motorcade, climbed into the Presidential S.U.V., which is known as the Beast, and demanded to be driven to the Capitol. Secret Service agents persuaded him to return to the White House.\n\nJust before the Joint Session was to begin, at one o'clock, Pence released a written statement: \"I do not believe that the Founders of our country intended to invest the Vice President with unilateral authority to decide which electoral votes should be counted during the Joint Session of Congress.\" The voting began. By 1:21, Trump had been informed that the Capitol was under attack. He spent the rest of the day watching it on television. For hours, his staff and his advisers begged him to order the mob to disperse or to call for military assistance; he refused. At 1:46, Representative Paul Gosar objected to the count from Arizona, after which Senator Ted Cruz endorsed that objection. Pence was evacuated at 2:12. Seconds later, Proud Boys achieved the first breach of the Capitol, smashing a window in the Senate wing. Eleven minutes later, the mob broke through the doors to the East Rotunda, and Trump tweeted, \"Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done.\" The mob chanted, \"Hang Mike Pence.\" Meadows told a colleague, \"He thinks Mike deserves it.\" Kevin McCarthy called the President. \"They literally just came through my office windows,\" he said. \"You need to call them off.\" Trump said, \"Well, Kevin, I guess they're just more upset about the election theft than you are.\" At 4:17 P . M ., the President released a video message in which he asked the insurrectionists to go home, and told them that he loved them.\n\nAnd that, in brief, is the report, which concludes that \"the central cause of January 6th was one man, former President Donald Trump.\" And that, in brief, is the problem: chasing Trump, never quite untethering itself from him, fluttering in the biting wind of his violent derangement, like a ribbon pinned to the tail of a kite during a tornado, and failing, entirely, to see the tornado.\n\nIn the January 6th Report, Donald Trump acted alone and came out of nowhere. He has no past. Neither does the nation. The rest of the country doesn't even exist. No one dies of Covid , no one loses a job, no one sinks to her knees in grief upon hearing on the radio the news that Americans- Americans -are staging an armed invasion of the Capitol. Among the many reasons this investigation ought to have been conducted by a body independent from the federal government is that there is very little suffering in Congress's January 6th Report, except that of members of Congress running for their lives that day.\n\nThe report is organized around the idea of the \"Big Lie,\" which is the title of the report's first chapter. \"The Big Lie\" is what Democratic politicians and many journalists call Trump's claim that he had won the election. (It is also an expression first notably used by Adolf Hitler.) It is an inept phrase: it turns an attempted coup d'état into something that sounds like a children's book written by Margaret Wise Brown. \"The Big Lie\" is so ham-handed that, unsurprisingly, it's an expression that Trump adores. \"The Fraudulent Presidential Election of 2020 will be, from this day forth, known as THE BIG LIE !\" he announced at one point. Playing \"You lie!\" \"No, you lie!\" with Donald Trump is a fool's game.\n\n\"The Big Lie\" is not a big lie. It is an elaborate fiction, an artful story, with heroes and villains, exotic locales, and a sinister plot. The election was stolen by a cabal of Democrats, socialists, immigrants, criminals, Black people, and spies . This story is vicious and idiotic, and none of it is true, but it is not a Big Lie devised by an orange-haired supervillain born rich in 1946: it is the latest chapter in a fictive counter-history of the United States which has been told by the far right for decades and decades and wretched decades. In 2020, it gained so much speed so fast that it acted something like a stampede. Unfortunately, reading the report is like being in the stampede. \"The stolen election narrative has proven to be remarkably durable precisely because it is a matter of belief-not evidence, or reason,\" the report states. It does not ask why this should be. Why believe? Two in five Americans and three in five Republicans still believe. Republicans who most fiercely believe hold the Party by the throat. The 9/11 Commission Report asked, \"How did Bin Ladin-with his call for indiscriminate killing of Americans-win thousands of followers and some degree of approval from millions more?\" The January 6th Committee Report, for all its weight and consequence, never asks why anyone believed Donald Trump, which is why it is unlikely to persuade anyone not to.\n\nWhy believe? Answering that question would have required a historical vantage on the decay of the party system, the celebration of political intolerance by both the right and the left, the contribution of social media to political extremism, and the predicament of American journalism. Calling the system rigged when you're losing is an old trick. At the end of the Cold War, American zealots turned their most ruthless ideological weapons on one another, Manicheans all. In 1992, Newt Gingrich told Republican candidates to get the message out that the Democrats were going to rig the Presidential election. It didn't matter to Gingrich that this wasn't true. \"They're going to buy registrations, they're going to buy votes,\" he warned. \"They're going to turn out votes, they're going to steal votes, they're going to do anything they can.\" After the contested Bush v. Gore election, of 2000, sowing doubt about elections became common practice for outsiders in both parties. \"The system is rigged\" was the watchword of Bernie Sanders's 2016 campaign: primaries rigged against challengers, the economy rigged against working people. Suspecting that things like elections might be rigged, even when that's not true, isn't a crazy conspiracy theory; it is a political product routinely sold to voters in every city and state in the country.\n\nWhy believe? In the past two decades, public approval of Congress has fallen from eighty per cent to twenty per cent. Might it be that Congress has lost any real grip on the American experience, and no longer speaks for a nation and a people that Richard Hofstadter once called a \"huge, inarticulate beast\"? The report lacks not only a sense of the past but also a meaningful sense of the present. A chronicle that runs from April, 2020, to January, 2021, it is a story told out of time. The \"facts, circumstances, and causes\" relating to the insurrection that it fails to investigate and, in most cases, even to note, include Covid -19 deaths, masks, lockdowns, joblessness, farm closures, guns and mass shootings, a national mental-health crisis, daily reports of devastating storms and fires, George Floyd, Black Lives Matter, and partisan, and especially congressional, eye-gouging over each and every one of the items in this list. Why believe? Was the election stolen? No. But was 2020 painful? Yes.\n\nWhy believe? Nowhere acknowledged in the report is the fact that November 3, 2020, really was a weird Election Day. In the middle of a pandemic, unprecedented numbers of people voted by mail and by absentee ballot, and, even if you trudged out to the polls, you were met with the general misery of masks and loneliness and loss and, for many people, a sense of impending doom. For the entire stretch of time chronicled in this report, it felt to many Americans, not always for the same reasons, as though a great deal was being stolen from them: their jobs, their co-workers, a sense of justice and fairness in the world, predictable weather, the idea of America, the people they love, human touch. The January 6th Report offers no shuddering sense, not even a little shiver, of the national mood of vulnerability, fear, and sorrow. \"The assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy on November 22, 1963, was a cruel and shocking act of violence directed against a man, a family, a nation, and against all mankind,\" the Warren Commission Report opens. Nothing in the January 6th report is stated so squarely.\n\nWhy believe? During the pandemic, more people spent more time online than ever before. The report fails to examine the way in which Facebook and Twitter profited by spreading misinformation about the election, providing the organizational architecture for the insurrection, and making possible the doxing and harassment of courageous and dedicated public servants who refused to participate in the conspiracy. When Trump staffers tell him that allegations of fraud are unfounded, he replies, \"You guys may not be following the internet the way I do.\" Nor did the committee.\n\nWhy believe? Every single television and news outlet that reported live on Election Day, 2020, knew about the Red Mirage, and although some news anchors regularly pointed out that the outcome would not be known for days, they were nevertheless complicit in promoting the fiction of a Trump victory: simply by reporting, second by second, on November 3, 2020, they endorsed the idea that the outcome could be known that night even though they knew it to be untrue. The committee does not remark on this. Nor does it indict the media-run polls and horse-race coverage-vastly greater in number, speed, and influence than ever before, or the growing partisanship of the press. Nor does it inquire into the consequences of an educated national élite of politicians, journalists, and academics increasingly living their lives in a Met Gala to Davos to White House Correspondents' Dinner world, or the degree to which so many of them appear to have so wholly given themselves over to Twitter-knowing the world through it, reporting from it, being ruled by it.\n\nWhy believe? The answer to that question-the knowledge of what has happened to America-will have to wait for another day. From beneath the Capitol dome, the January 6th Committee has issued its report. It blames Trump. It explains very little. Outside, the whirling wind heaves and twists and roars. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "J. D. Vance and the Failed Effort to Memory-Hole January 6th\n\nCall it the revenge of January 6th. Republicans have tried everything to make voters forget about that terrible day for American democracy. They have ignored it, downplayed it, or pretended nothing much happened. On the campaign trail this year, Donald Trump has opted for outright revisionism , rebranding the insurrectionists who tried to stop Congress from certifying his electoral defeat as peaceful protesters who have become jailed martyrs on his behalf. On Tuesday night, J. D. Vance, in the signature moment of his Vice-Presidential debate with Tim Walz, refused to acknowledge that Trump lost the 2020 election-an act of fealty to Trump's lies which underscored why Vance is on the G.O.P. ticket in the first place, because he has expressed a willingness to do what Mike Pence would not. \"Tim, I'm focussed on the future,\" Vance said dismissively. It was, Walz quickly retorted, \"a damning non-answer.\"\n\nSometimes, though, history shows up when summoned. The day after Vance's comments, a judge unsealed a brief from the special counsel Jack Smith , which contained a detailed account of the evidence that the prosecutor wants to present in court to document Trump's unprecedented effort to overturn the last election. If, in a little more than a month from now, Trump is reëlected to office, Smith's criminal case against the ex-President will almost certainly disappear. This brief means that at least the record will show more fully what Trump did on the day that a pro-Trump mob stormed the U.S. Capitol-and in the two months leading up to it. He can spin the past, but he cannot entirely bury it.\n\nOf the many revealing incidents disclosed in the brief, one in particular stood out to me: Trump, on Marine One, speaking to his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who were both official government employees in his White House. \"It doesn't matter if you won or lost the election,\" he told them, according to an unnamed White House aide's testimony. \"You still have to fight like hell.\" This, in all its nihilistic disregard for anything and anyone other than his own interests, is Trump's personal credo. There is not a more complicated rationale for January 6th, unfortunately, than that statement-it was not about \"election integrity\" or vote fraud or anything other than a rogue President putting himself above any other consideration. Trump was willing to defy the law and the Constitution, to flout the facts, and to reject the conclusion of his own Attorney General, his own Vice-President, his own White House counsel, and dozens of judges to stay in power. Does anyone doubt that, if need be, he would do it again?\n\nNo wonder, then, that Trump responded as he did to Smith's filing, immediately fulminating on social media about the \"falsehood-ridden, Unconstitutional, J6 brief\" and the \"Deranged\" prosecutor who submitted it. The goal, according to Trump, was to \"INTERFERE IN THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.\" It's such a tell-the facts are so damning about Trump and January 6th that bringing them up, even in the dry format of a hundred-and-sixty-five-page legal brief-in a court proceeding triggered by Trump's own appeals-is construed as electioneering against him. Fact-checking, in general, is now considered a partisan sport by the fact-challenged G.O.P. ticket. Pro-Trump commentators had a collective heart attack during Tuesday night's debate, when Margaret Brennan, one of the CBS News moderators, briefly strayed from the network's announced policy of not disputing the candidates' misstatements to correct Vance's assertion that \"illegal immigrants\" were overwhelming resources in Springfield, Ohio. \"The rules were that you guys weren't going to fact-check,\" Vance complained. Fox News pundits later labelled the moderators \"obnoxious\" and whined about their \"smug, arrogant bias.\"\n\nBut if anything, I'd say the debate's format boosted Vance by allowing him the pretense that his and Trump's campaign is something approximating a normal electoral clash over competing visions for the country, rooted in civilized policy differences, when that is emphatically not the case. Just days earlier, Trump had said at a rally that he'd like to unleash the police for \" one really violent day \" to stop a nonexistent crime wave. No one asked Vance about that. Nor, for that matter, did they mention that Trump himself is a convicted criminal. (Amazing-the guy is an actual felon at this point, and it doesn't even rate as an aside.) Both Vance and Trump have embraced extremist positions far outside the American mainstream, such as promising to round up illegal migrants and place them in camps and openly repeating Russian talking points about Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Those were never mentioned. The moderators spent more than an hour and a half questioning Vance and Walz before ever getting to the existential matter of American democracy. And even then, it was Walz who had to ask Vance about Trump's 2020 election lies.\n\nThis was not only an essential question but a belated glimpse into the essence of Vance as a politician. It should be noted that in refusing to answer Walz, Vance did not just obfuscate about who won in 2020; he actually tried to rewrite history to pretend that Trump, without whose incitement the attack on the Capitol never would have occurred, had simply given up power peacefully. On Thursday, Vance skipped the insincere excuses and simply came out and said directly what he had danced around on the debate stage. \"Who won the 2020 election? Did Donald Trump win?\" he was asked , this time by Jason Selvig, a co-host of the political-comedy podcast \"The Good Liars.\" \"Yes,\" Vance responded. When Selvig then pursued Vance into a narrow hallway, asking whether he would concede the election this time around if the Democrats won more votes, Vance stopped for a brief second. \"I really feel bad for you, man,\" he replied.\n\nIn a purely political sense, January 6th is at the heart of the case for the anti-Trump Republicans, a small but, in my perhaps unfashionable view, potentially mighty slice of the electorate. The ex-President's conduct in the aftermath of the 2020 election is the ultimate disqualifier for this group, the most straightforward possible justification for why it is necessary to break with their party even in this age of extreme partisanship.\n\nI have spent some time recently with two of the leading Republican apostates to have endorsed Kamala Harris over Trump- Liz Cheney , the former House Republican leader who co-chaired the House's January 6th select committee, and J. Michael Luttig , the conservative former federal judge who advised Pence to reject Trump's demands on January 6th. Both of them make the case that this is an election not between right and left, as Luttig memorably put it, but between right and wrong. On Thursday, Cheney campaigned in the swing state of Wisconsin, in the small town of Ripon, where the Republican Party was founded, in the mid-nineteenth century. Cheney made January 6th the center of her nonpartisan case against Trump. As if she was reciting from Jack Smith's brief, she kept the audience rapt by recounting Trump's actions, sitting alone in his White House dining room, tweeting while the Capitol was under siege. She even recounted one of the most stunning new details in Smith's filing-that Trump, upon being told that his Vice-President was in danger, had replied, \"So what?\" \"Putting patriotism ahead of partisanship is not an aspiration-it is our duty\" she concluded. \"Our institutions don't defend themselves.\"\n\nWhen J. D. Vance says never mind about January 6th, let me tell you about rampaging illegal immigrants, when Trump talks about \" Comrade Kamala \" and the \"radical-left Democrats,\" they are betting on the irresistible allure of the right-versus-left frame in our politics. But, if only a small number of the millions of Republicans who voted against Trump earlier this year in the primaries do so again, in November, he will likely lose the election.\n\nThe smug conventional wisdom has it that voters don't care much about abstractions like democracy or the rule of law. I'm sure it's true that, for most Americans, their own economic well-being or personal freedoms may well be top of mind in the election. That's understandable. \"We won't go back\" resonates as a slogan for Harris against Trump, because it's not just about keeping the man away from the White House but also about not returning to his retrograde policies. And yet there is both political salience-and powerful clarity-in reminding voters, of any party, about Trump's attack on democracy itself.\n\nDavid, a two-time Trump voter from Missouri, sums up this argument succinctly in a video testimonial , one of many collected by the group Republican Voters Against Trump. His reason for switching now, he says, \"all started on January 6th, when Trump tried to overthrow the government. I don't agree with everything that the Democrats want to do, but I know that they don't want to overthrow the government, and it's really that simple.\"\n\nOf course, J. D. Vance doesn't want to talk about it. Some things are complicated; some things are not. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "A Public Defender's Radical Approach to Representing the January 6th Rioters\n\nWatch \"Public Defender.\"\n\n\"You can see the Capitol from here,\" Heather Shaner, a criminal-defense lawyer, says as she walks with her client Jack Griffith, a.k.a. Juan Bibiano, a.k.a. Liberty Dragon, to his sentencing hearing at the E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse, in Washington, D.C. \"It's beautiful, right?\"\n\n\"It is beautiful,\" Griffith replies, as they pause to look at the vista, down one of D.C.'s wide streets. His hair is styled in a double-braided mohawk, half red and half blue. \"Not trying to be funny, but it's beautiful inside, too.\"\n\nGriffith had formed that opinion when he entered the Capitol on January 6, 2021. He was part of a mob that attacked the complex, after a rally at which Donald Trump claimed that the Presidential election was being stolen from him, in an effort to stop a joint session of Congress from tallying the Electoral College votes. Griffith had driven there from Tennessee. Footage from D.C. that day shows him wearing a MAGA hat and recording video selfies in which he chatters giddily about taking down the New World Order; at the time, he was twenty-five, and not even registered to vote. Shaner, who was assigned to defend him, after he was indicted on four federal charges, because he could not afford a lawyer, calls Griffith \"a unique individual.\" But one of the themes of \"Public Defender,\" a film about Shaner and the legal aftermath of January 6th, is that she sees all her clients that way, or tries to. The film was written and directed by Andrea Kalin, and produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center.\n\nKalin had been acquainted with Shaner for years, and, knowing that she was politically on the left-there is a faded decal from the Southern Poverty Law Center on the front window of Shaner's house, which is also her office-realized that there might be a story to tell about her representation of January 6th defendants. A point of connection that Shaner has with Griffith, who is one of two clients featured in the film, is that she, too, has a streak of blue in her hair. She started dyeing it that color, for fun, when she turned seventy, seven years ago. On the way to court, Griffith offers to carry her purple-sequinned backpack. Footage from the Capitol shows him inside the building for less than fifteen minutes. In her sentencing plea, Shaner portrayed him as an impulsive young man whose social-media habit made him susceptible to misinformation. He also created a video game in which Trump is the superhero.\n\nView the latest or submit your own film.\n\nShaner has represented forty-two January 6th defendants so far. That sounds like a lot, but the Department of Justice has brought close to fifteen hundred such cases . More than three hundred are still pending-including, of course, the case brought by Jack Smith, the special counsel, against Donald Trump, a.k.a. the former President, a.k.a. the Republican nominee in this year's election. Between Trump and Griffith are figures who were ringleaders or were instrumental in the violence, notably members of the Proud Boys. Shaner helped him to reach a plea deal on a single misdemeanor charge of parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a Capitol building. Trump, who still faces four felony counts, has been working with his own lawyers, with a boost from a pair of Supreme Court rulings .\n\nThe first of those decisions, Trump v. United States, gives ex-Presidents broad immunity from criminal prosecution for their official acts, and thus isn't much use to anyone who has never been President. However, in the second one, Fischer v. United States, the Court found that prosecutors had overreached in how they deployed one statute-obstruction of an official proceeding-which was used against hundreds of defendants, including Trump. (Griffith wasn't indicted on that charge.) Some of those cases have already been resolved one way or the other, but others may need to be adjusted in light of Fischer. That outcome is a reminder that the legal response to January 6th was in some ways an exercise in improvisation in the aftermath of an unprecedented event-what amounted to an attempted coup. Calibrating the response, and making sure, among other things, that the right precedents are set, is a project in which defense lawyers like Shaner play a necessary and important role.\n\nAs significant as the assault on the Capitol was for the country as a whole, it was also a deeply felt local event for people, including Shaner, who live in Washington. And it was a heavy load for the city's criminal-justice apparatus. \"You're talking about fifteen hundred cases coming into one courthouse,\" Shaner told me. She had long been one of the private lawyers whom the Office of the Federal Public Defender relied on to defend indigent clients. When she got the call after January 6th, though, she insisted on one condition: she would not represent anyone accused of assaulting a police officer. The problem wasn't really the nature or the severity of the crime; she's been a defense attorney for more than four decades, and has dealt with some rough characters. What stopped her, she said, was that she \"knew some of the police personally.\" After all, often enough, over the years, in cases big and small, they had testified against her clients. They were a part of her life. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "website": "https://www.newyorker.com",
      "text": "The Supreme Court Asks What Enron Has to Do with January 6th-and Trump\n\nOn Monday, October 15, 2001, an executive assistant arrived for work at the Houston office of Arthur Andersen, at the time one of the Big Five accounting firms, to find that the break room was a mess. \"There was food everywhere,\" she later said, \"like they had been there the whole weekend.\" Near the remnants of meals were bags stuffed with paper strips. This was the opening scene in what became-as Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind recount in \" The Smartest Guys in the Room: The Amazing Rise and Scandalous Fall of Enron \"-a bacchanalia of document shredding. Arthur Andersen executives had learned that their client Enron was likely being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission for what would prove to be egregious fraud. Subpoenas might arrive any day. They also knew, to varying degrees, that their own work on Enron's books would not hold up to scrutiny. Soon, \"files awaiting destruction spilled out into the hallways,\" McLean and Elkind write. The pretense was that the paper obliteration was just a reflection of the accounting firm's \"document-retention policy,\" and yet, in the space of about two weeks, the Houston office shredded more than it would in a year. At one point, Arthur Andersen, with its own machines at capacity, hired a mobile shredding truck from a company called Shred-It. Even the firm's London office got in on the shredding.\n\nThat sorry episode was revisited, repeatedly and somewhat incongruously, before the Supreme Court on Tuesday, in oral arguments for Joseph W. Fischer v. United States. Fischer was part of the mob that assaulted the Capitol on January 6, 2021. He, like hundreds of other January 6th defendants, has been charged with, among other things, violating the Sarbanes-Oxley Act , a law that Congress passed, as Justice Elena Kagan put it on Tuesday, when \"it had just gone through Enron\" and had wanted to be sure that people like the Arthur Andersen accountants could be punished. However, Jack Smith, the special counsel overseeing the Justice Department's investigations of Donald Trump , has used the same law for two of the four charges against the former President in the indictment that he brought in Washington, D.C. (Next week, the Court will also hear Trump's argument that he is immune to those charges; he is facing three other criminal cases, too, and denies all wrongdoing.) Fischer argued that the prosecutors overreached by using Sarbanes-Oxley this way. Unfortunately for Smith, judging from the questions, a majority of the Justices seem to agree.\n\nProsecuting Arthur Andersen for shredding the Enron documents had been surprisingly tricky. Owing to the way that the law was written then, it was a crime to corruptly direct someone to shred evidence in an investigation, but not to do the shredding oneself. This was, as Elizabeth Prelogar, the Solicitor General, who argued the government's case, said on Tuesday, \"a glaring loophole,\" which Sarbanes-Oxley closed. Section 1512(c)(1) of that law penalizes anyone who corruptly \"alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals a record, document, or other object\" so as to prevent it from being used in an \"official proceeding\"-such as the investigation of Enron-or attempts to do so. The following section, 1512(c)(2), refers to anyone who \"otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding.\"\n\nFischer, who pleaded not guilty, contends that the \"otherwise\" clause only covers other ways of interfering with evidence. (Jeffrey Green, Fischer's lawyer, suggested that it might, for example, cover new \"Information Age\" methods for storing and manipulating documents.) Although the definition of documents and records has become more elastic in recent years, this is pretty much how the statute was used before January 6th. The Department of Justice, though, contends that, thanks to the \"otherwise,\" it can encompass almost anything and everything a person might do to obstruct an official proceeding.\n\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson seemed skeptical of the prosecutors' position. \"It was in the wake of Enron, there was document destruction, and, you know, there was nothing as far as I can tell in the enactment history as it was recorded that suggests that Congress was thinking about obstruction more generally,\" she said. \"They had this particular problem.\" Prelogar countered by saying that \"the broader lesson Congress took away from Enron\" was that \"things will slip through the cracks\"-in other words, that it's handy for the government to have a catchall law. Justices Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, judging from their questions, had a similar view, but Chief Justice John Roberts decidedly did not. Roberts pointed to a unanimous Court decision last week (it involved Wonder Bread) as an example of how, under the Court's doctrines concerning interpretation, the words in the first section, about documents and records, would \"control and define\" the \"otherwise\" clause. And Prelogar's answer didn't quite satisfy Jackson, who said that she was still \"struggling with leaping from what's happening in (1)\"-destroying evidence-to \"all of obstruction in any form.\"\n\nOne reason for Jackson's struggle may be that the maximum penalty under the \"otherwise\" subsection is twenty years in prison-which seems high if it was really meant to cover a smorgasbord of ill-defined acts. Justice Neil Gorsuch, when asking Prelogar about \"the breadth of this statute,\" posed a number of hypotheticals-\"Would a sit-in that disrupts a trial or access to a federal courthouse qualify?\"-and a scenario that wasn't really a hypothetical at all. \"Would pulling a fire alarm before a vote qualify for twenty years in federal prison?\" Gorsuch said. This was, as everyone present surely knew, a reference to a misguided move by Representative Jamaal Bowman, of New York, last September, as Republicans were rushing to push through a spending bill. The fact that he has not been charged with disrupting an official proceeding has been cited by critics of the January 6th prosecutions as an example of D.O.J. hypocrisy. (Bowman pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and was censured by the House.)\n\nPrelogar initially tried to dodge the question by saying that she wasn't sure if, in those scenarios, prosecutors would be able to meet the other legal requirements, such as proving corrupt intent. (There was a separate argument about what \"corrupt\" might mean.) She also emphasized the violence of January 6th and the fact that, despite the seriousness of what happened that day, most sentences so far had been a fraction of those twenty years. But, when Justice Amy Coney Barrett pressed Prelogar on whether she was saying that \"there has to be some sort of violence,\" Prelogar said she was not. Barrett, in a further round of questions, asked about a scenario in which the Capitol had never been breached on January 6th, but the Stop the Steal rally outside nevertheless led to some sort of security alert and delay of the proceedings. Prelogar acknowledged that, under the government's theory, if intent could be proved, that \"probably would be chargeable.\"\n\nPrelogar's answer distills why, Trump notwithstanding, the government's position in this case is unsettling. Its reading of the statute is sweeping. Green, Fischer's lawyer, stressed in his rebuttal that Prelogar had said that 1512(c)(2) \"would cover peaceful protests.\" One needn't be Neil Gorsuch to imagine its use, and misuse, in contexts well beyond January 6th, especially if the Court endorsed that broad reading. Sit-ins and peaceful disruptions of official proceedings are basic tools of dissent, after all. And Prelogar's insistence that the government has exercised discretion in its use of the statute only seemed to cause the more conservative Justices, particularly Justice Samuel Alito, to stew about selective prosecution. \"For all the protests that have occurred in this Court, the Justice Department has not charged any serious offenses,\" Alito said. He also brought up the Gaza-related protest stopping traffic on the Golden Gate Bridge. What if such protesters were keeping someone from getting to an official proceeding? (Prelogar said that, among other things, they would have to have \"a specific proceeding in mind.\")\n\nBut, even if the Court limits the reach of the law, Joseph Fischer might not be in the clear. Donald Trump wouldn't be, either. Barrett asked Green if the government could still \"take a shot\" at prosecuting his client under the theory that he was indeed interfering with documents and evidence-by trying to keep the certificates of various states' electoral votes off of Vice-President Mike Pence's desk. (\"That's closer,\" Green conceded.) Similarly, Jackson asked Prelogar if the government would \"necessarily lose\" if the Court interpreted the law narrowly. (She, too, mentioned the electoral certificates.) Prelogar's answer was that the government would certainly still try to win.\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh mentioned that Fischer was charged with half a dozen other offenses, which didn't have the same legal hurdles, and asked, \"Why aren't those six counts good enough?\" (Prelogar said that they didn't reflect his full \"culpability.\") Trump, of course, has scores of felony charges pending against him across his four criminal cases. (The first seven jurors in his first trial, in New York, were chosen the same day Fischer was argued.) But it appears that, for two of those charges, the Court will at least require prosecutors to draw a clearer line connecting the accountants' trash-bag-filled break room in Houston to the ransacked Capitol Rotunda. For that matter, despite the loophole, Arthur Andersen paid a price; its complicity in Enron's fraud destroyed the company. Accounting's Big Five is now the Big Four. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "What Will Come of the January 6th Committee's Case Against Trump?\n\n\"I don't want to say, 'The election is over,' \" Donald Trump said on January 7, 2021. He'd been given a script for a video statement on the events of the previous day, when, at his prompting, a mob had assaulted the Capitol in an attempt to disrupt the electoral-vote tally. The video was meant to calm his supporters and to reassure the country that the election was, indeed, over. But, as indicated by outtakes from the filming which were shown last Thursday, at a hearing of the House Select Committee investigating the events of January 6th , Trump wasn't ready to send that message. All he was willing to say was that \"Congress has certified the results\"; it had done so at close to four o'clock that morning, in a building still littered with debris from the attack. He's still not ready: a week and a half before the hearing, Trump allegedly called Robin Vos, the speaker of the Wisconsin legislature, to demand that he retroactively take the state's electors away from Joe Biden.\n\nTrump's staff apparently saw the video as a sort of do-over of one he had released at 4:17 P.M. the previous day. In that video, he told his rioting supporters to go home, but he also said that the election had been \"stolen from us\" and that he loved them. By then, the assault had been going on for more than three hours; the Thursday hearing focussed on what he did during that time. The answer: he sat in a dining room near the Oval Office, watched Fox News, and called senators to tell them that they should object to the election results-in other words, they should concede to the mob's demands. (He called Rudy Giuliani , his lawyer, too.) He also fended off pleas from various officials to stop the violence, and instead put out what the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, described in videotaped testimony as a \"terrible tweet\" targeting Vice-President Mike Pence , who was being hunted by the mob.\n\nThe hearing was the eighth and final installment in a series that began on June 9th. (There are plans for a new series in September.) The testimony and documentary evidence presented in the hearings made clear that what Trump expected-and pressured-Pence to do was to take part in a coup by claiming that he had the power to reject states' electoral votes. (The last thing a staff member recalled Trump saying before he retreated to the White House residence on the evening of the sixth was \"Mike Pence let me down.\") The committee is still collecting evidence-including by enforcing subpoenas served on unwilling witnesses, such as Trump's former adviser Steve Bannon , who on Friday was convicted of contempt of Congress. It has already done much to establish Trump's personal culpability in an illegal scheme to disrupt the electoral tally and commit fraud, and possibly in witness tampering and other crimes. A greater area of contention is how he might be held accountable.\n\nThe committee itself cannot file criminal charges, though it can refer its findings to the Department of Justice. It's not news to the D.O.J., of course, that laws were broken. More than eight hundred and fifty people have been charged so far. In late June, the department issued subpoenas in connection with an investigation of the Trump team's \"fake electors\" scheme. (A related criminal investigation is under way in Georgia.) And yet there is some discontent among Democrats at the pace of the D.O.J.'s work; Representative Adam Schiff, a committee member, recently depicted the department as being woefully behind. That view is not quite fair. Last week, Attorney General Merrick Garland told reporters that \"no person is above the law in this country,\" a remark he repeated when asked if it applied to a former President. The real source of anxiety may be not Garland's tactics but Trump's. He is not done with the last election and is expected to declare his candidacy in the next one soon; polls indicate that, if the Republican primaries were held now, he would win the nomination.\n\nA criminal conviction in itself, though, would not block Trump from returning to the White House. There are good reasons that this is so: one can only imagine the mischief local prosecutors would get up to otherwise. In 1920, Eugene V. Debs , a Socialist, ran for President from a prison cell in Atlanta, after being convicted of violating the Espionage Act of 1917, for speaking against military recruitment efforts. He got nearly a million votes.\n\nSome Democrats and legal scholars have seized on Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment as a possible route to disqualifying Trump from taking office again. This provision, originally aimed at keeping Confederates who had been public officials before the Civil War from holding certain offices after it, refers rather broadly to engaging in \"insurrection or rebellion.\" The problems with applying it now are manifold. There are disputes about whether the Presidency counts as one of the offices in question; whether an 1872 amnesty law negates the clause; and how it all might be executed and adjudicated. (Trump's acquittal in his second impeachment trial, when he was charged with incitement of insurrection, might also be a factor.) The modern limits of the clause have been only partly tested, in lower courts, in suits brought by advocacy groups against Republican candidates who played some role in the events of January 6th. It is hard to imagine that the current Supreme Court would disqualify Trump from running.\n\nWhat's more, the only non-Civil War use of Section 3 was entirely disreputable. In 1919, the House of Representatives refused to seat Victor Berger, a Wisconsin Socialist, who, like Debs, had been convicted under the Espionage Act-in Berger's case, for publishing editorials saying that the First World War benefitted \"our plutocracy.\" There was a special election to fill the vacant seat-he won again, and the House rejected him again. He finally took his seat after winning yet another election, in 1922, by which point the war fever had cooled and the Supreme Court had overturned his conviction. \"From time immemorial, the Bird of Liberty was a jailbird,\" Berger told the congressmen considering his case.\n\nTrump, God knows, is no Berger or Debs. A reading of Section 3 capacious enough to disqualify him would nonetheless be highly destructive; it would turn the clause into an anti-democratic instrument that would inevitably be deployed against a broad range of candidates. There are simply no shortcuts here. That reality doesn't mean that Garland should hesitate to put Trump on trial. Indeed, if Trump is as able as anyone to run for the Presidency from a jail cell, a prosecution should be less vulnerable to the charge that it would deprive people of a chance to vote for (or against) him. And, as the committee has made clear, the evidence is there. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "What We Still Need to Learn About the January 6th Insurrection\n\nThis piece originally appeared in our Daily newsletter. Sign up to receive the best of The New Yorker every day in your in-box.\n\nThis week, Andrea Bernstein and Ilya Marritz write about the divergent paths and continued defiance of two participants in the January 6th insurrection at the Capitol, one recently convicted for his role, the other awaiting trial. As Congress holds its first prime-time hearings on the attack, their stories illustrate the consolidation of right-wing extremism in the United States. Bernstein and Marritz are the hosts of \" Will Be Wild ,\" from Pineapple Street Studios, Wondery, and Amazon Music, an eight-part podcast that explores what happened before, during, and after the attack.\n\nThe newsletter editor Ian Crouch asked Bernstein and Marritz to share what they learned during their reporting, and what they expect from Thursday night's hearing of the January 6th House select committee.\n\nThe two defendants in your story, Guy Reffitt and Jessica Watkins, are very different people, who took different paths to arrive at the Capitol on January 6th. What did their stories help you to understand about the insurrection?\n\nIlya Marritz : One of the things that surprised me the most in the course of our reporting was just learning that Reffitt and Watkins had become good friends in prison. We were already following each of their backstories. And they're pretty different. Watkins is an Army vet and a trans woman who had a hard time finding her way in life. Reffitt is more of a conventional family man, who worked his way up in the oil business, and an \"alpha male,\" according to his wife. And, yet, in jail, here's Watkins educating Reffitt about her pronouns, and forging a real bond. Reffitt's wife, Nicole, was impressed.\n\nOne of the through lines we saw among the rioters we researched is that people who were connected with militia movements felt called to patrol the streets during the racial-justice protests of 2020, in part because Donald Trump was describing the protesters as \"terrorists.\" So, a few months later, when Trump called his supporters to the Capitol to contest an election he falsely said was stolen, people like Reffitt and Watkins felt it was their duty to respond.\n\nYou write that \"polls show that the proportion of Americans who believe that violent attacks against the government can be justified is rising.\" One of the things you identify that has helped fuel violent conspiracism is the COVID pandemic . What about the pandemic do you think has contributed, and what other factors are at play?\n\nAndrea Bernstein : Very early on in our reporting, Elizabeth Neumann, the former Assistant Secretary for Counterterrorism and Threat Prevention at the Department of Homeland Security under Trump, spoke to us about COVID radicalization. She'd been working in the counterterrorism field almost since she was right out of college, in the early two-thousands, and over the years had studied the conditions that lead to radicalization, particularly under Osama bin Laden and ISIS . And there was a connection: individuals who had few resources to deal with social stressors were subject to radicalization. Those factors were almost always exacerbated by social isolation, and, as the years went by, social media. Neumann told us that when the pandemic hit, she was immediately on the alert for this and tried to warn her higher-ups. Neumann had described this pattern to us before we had spoken to Reffitt or Watkins, but as we traced their stories, and in particular Reffitt's, it struck us how Reffitt's wife, Nicole, described exactly that, how her husband spent more and more time online during the pandemic, becoming attracted to the Three Percenters militia group. As Neumann and other experts told us, the pandemic made people lose their bearings and increasingly open to online misinformation and disinformation.\n\nRepresentative Liz Cheney recently said she is convinced the attack on the Capitol was part of a \"well-organized\" and \"chilling\" conspiracy. You've been reporting on this for your podcast. What do you think most people misunderstand or perhaps underestimate about the scope of this?\n\nA.B. : One of the biggest reactions we've gotten as our reporting has progressed is \"I didn't know there was anything more to learn about January 6th.\" It's an event most Americans saw some or all of on television or via contemporaneous social media, and somehow believed they ingested. But we've learned so much since then. For example, there were quite a few Trump allies who conveyed some version, after the election, of, \"This is Trump just dealing with the drama of losing.\" But we now know that Trump tried to block the peaceful transfer of power, including by trying to get the Justice Department to investigate \"fraud\" and to stop the electoral-vote count; trying to change the vote count in Georgia; trying to influence state elected officials to reject the results; pondering having D.H.S. and/or the Department of Defense seize voting machines, etc. So that's one misunderstanding: that this was anything less than an almost-coup.\n\nAnother misunderstanding is that this is behind us. As our reporting shows, January 6th was the beginning of a consolidation of extremist views. As John Cohen, the former acting chief of intelligence for the D.H.S., told us for our story, \"I am really fucking concerned about where we are.\"\n\nI.M. : The Department of Justice has brought a number of conspiracy cases around the riot, including the seditious conspiracy case that Jessica Watkins is a part of. Just this week, the D.O.J. indicted the Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio and others for a second seditious-conspiracy case, and the indictment referenced the Oath Keepers. I'd really like to know more about connections between and among the alleged conspiracies, and more about their links to the White House and to Trump. We know Tarrio visited the White House in December, 2020. We know Stewart Rhodes, the founder of the Oath Keepers , allegedly tried to get Trump on the phone on the afternoon of January 6th. He called an intermediary, who did not connect them. But he thought he could get through, or might get through. Why? The answer to that question could be really telling. Also, who was the intermediary?\n\nDo you think that the prime-time congressional hearings beginning on Thursday will produce the kind of evidence or new information that could upend entrenched political priors about January 6th and what has followed? Or maybe it is a mistake to think about these legislative investigations in purely political terms. What other purposes do they serve?\n\nI.M. : I'm skeptical about the potential to move public opinion, or to shift the dynamic inside the Republican Party. We saw the riot on TV, and members of Congress experienced it in real life. Everyone has pretty much settled on the story they believe about why this happened and what it means.\n\nBut the House select committee's work is the only holistic, official government report we're likely to get about the riot. It's different from the 9/11 Commission in lots of ways, but, similarly, the committee has the opportunity to set down a record through testimony and documents. I will watch it closely as a journalist, and just as a citizen, because I want to understand the causes of this colossal failure.\n\nA.B. : These hearings will be distinct from any recent congressional hearing we've watched: there are seven Democrats and two renegade Republicans. We just won't see, inside the four corners of the hearings, the kind of misinformation and posturing we saw, for example, during the two Trump impeachment trials. There's the opportunity for a coherent, galvanizing narrative to emerge, some of that on prime-time television.\n\nThere's also the possibility that there will be truly alarming new information about what the former President or his allies did in the run-up to January 6th-more alarming than we already know, which is in itself pretty alarming. Without a doubt, there's a Hail Mary feeling here-here comes the pass, and maybe, just maybe, it can change the game. But say it doesn't. Is telling the story enough? Does it have its own power? This is something that we have thought about a lot, and grapple with in the eighth episode of \"Will Be Wild,\" which is why accountability is so important for history. As a journalist, I connect to this. We can get the truth out. It may not feel like a lot. But we do it. Because what other choice do we have?\n\nWhen the Capitol was breached, a New Yorker reporter became the sole journalist in the Senate chamber to witness its desecration .\n\nInside the chamber, Luke Mogelson captured raw, visceral footage of the siege .\n\nShould Americans refer to the Sixth of January as a protest, an act of treason, or something else ?\n\nWhat the January 6th papers reveal .\n\nHow a mother of eight became one of the riot's biggest mysteries, and a fugitive from the F.B.I.\n\nThe violence was what Donald Trump wanted .\n\nIf America is to remain a democracy, Trump must be held accountable .\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New Yorker .\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.
