      "text": "'Absolutely insane': Texas Governor Greg Abbott seeks pardon for man convicted of murdering BLM protester\n\nRepublican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott drew widespread condemnation from legal experts after he said Saturday that he is \"working as swiftly\" as the law allows to pardon a man who was convicted the previous day of murdering a racial justice protester in 2020.\n\nDaniel Perry, a U.S. Army sergeant, was convicted by an Austin jury on Friday of murder and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon for the fatal shooting of 28-year-old Garrett Foster, an armed Air Force veteran participating in a Black Lives Matter protest in the Texas capital following George Floyd's murder by Minneapolis police.\n\nAfter tweeting that he \"might have to kill a few people on my way to work\" as an Uber driver, Perry accelerated his car into a crowd of racial justice protesters in downtown Austin on July 25, 2020. As Foster, who was pushing his fiancée's wheelchair, approached Perry's vehicle carrying an AK-47 rifle in accordance with Texas law, Perry opened his window and shot Foster four times in the chest and abdomen with his .357 Magnum pistol. When asked by police if Foster had pointed his rifle at him, Perry admitted that he did not, but said that \"I didn't want to give him a chance to aim at me.\"\n\nAfter an eight-day trial and 17 hours of deliberation, the Austin jury rejected Perry's claim of self-defense. However, Abbott tweeted that \"Texas has one of the strongest 'stand your ground' laws of self-defense that cannot be nullified by a jury or a progressive district attorney,\" a reference to Travis County District Attorney José Garza, a Democrat.\n\n\"Unlike the president or some other states, the Texas Constitution limits the governor's pardon authority to only act on a recommendation by the Board of Pardons and Paroles,\" Abbott wrote. \"Texas law does allow the governor to request the Board of Pardons and Paroles to determine if a person should be granted a pardon. I have made that request and instructed the Board to expedite its review.\"\n\n\"I look forward to approving the board's pardon recommendation as soon as it hits my desk,\" he added.\n\nRick Cofer, a partner at the Austin law firm of Cofer & Connelly, noted that \"Garrett Foster was killed protesting the killing of George Floyd,\" and that \"in 2022, the Texas Board of Pardons unanimously recommended that Floyd be pardoned for a drug charge, in which a crooked cop planted drugs.\"\n\n\"Facing pressure, Abbott got the board to yank the recommendation,\" Cofer added. \"Now the man who killed Garrett Foster, while Foster protested George Floyd's murder, will be pardoned. George Floyd's pardon is still stuck with the Board of Pardons. If a fiction author wrote this, no one would believe it.\"\n\nDavid Wahlberg, a former Travis County criminal court judge, said he has never heard of a case in which a governor sought to pardon a convicted felon before their verdict was appealed.\n\n\"I think it's outrageously presumptuous for someone to make a judgment about the verdict of 12 unanimous jurors without actually hearing the evidence in person,\" Wahlberg told the Austin American-Statesman .\n\nWendy Davis, an attorney and former Texas state lawmaker and Fort Worth city councilmember, called Abbott's move \"nothing more than a craven political maneuver.\"\n\n\"Our democracy is imperiled when any branch of government moves to usurp another,\" Davis argued on Twitter. \"And it's happening all over this country on a regular basis.\"\n\nAbbott's announcement came less than 24 hours after Fox News opinion host Tucker Carlson sharply criticized the governor on his show, claiming that \"there is no right of self-defense in Texas.\"\n\nThe governor also faced pressure from right-wing figures including Kyle Rittenhouse , who was acquitted of murder and other charges after he shot dead two racial justice protesters and wounded a third in Kenosha, Wisconsin in 2020.\n\nAbbott has also threatened to \"exonerate\" 19 Austin police officers indicted for attacking and injuring Black Lives Matter protesters in 2020, asserting that \"those officers should be praised for their efforts, not prosecuted.\""

      "text": "Mehdi Hasan clobbers 'bigoted' Republicans for embracing 'odious' convicted murderer Daniel Perry\n\nOn Sunday's edition of his show, MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan tore into right-wing Republicans over their recent embrace of convicted murderer Daniel Perry, a now-former United States Army sergeant who proudly bragged about being a \"racist\" before he gunned down a Black Lives Matter protester Garrett Foster in 2020.\n\nHasan began:\n\nEarlier this month, on Friday, April the seventh, a US Army sergeant named Daniel Perry was found guilty of murdering Black Lives Matter protester Garrett Foster at a demonstration in Austin, Texas in the summer of 2020. Perry shot Foster multiple times and a jury of his peers deliberated for seventeen hours before coming to a unanimous guilty verdict. And yet the very next day after Fox's Tucker Carlson came to Daniel Perry's defense on his primetime show - the very next day - Texas GOP Governor Greg Abbott announced that he was working as swiftly as Texas law allows regarding the pardon of Sergeant Perry. The pardon.\n\nAcquitted Kenosha, Wisconsin shooter Kyle Rittenhouse was Carlson's guest on his April 7th broadcast and argued that Perry \"defended himself\" and that Perry \"knows what he did was right.\" Carlson then declared that \"George Soros can't pay for people to put his political opponents in jail and then have a Republican governor ignore it.\"\n\nContinuing on, Hasan condemned GOP lawmakers for latching onto Carlson and Abbott's clemency calls for Perry:\n\nMAGA Republicans like Marjorie Taylor Greene and Ronnie Jackson weighed in too, defending Perry and demanding he be let go. GOP Congressman Dan Crenshaw said, 'Thank God that Perry was on course for a pardon' and even said 'he should also be compensated.'\n\nDaniel Perry. New hero of the GOP. Their new cause celebre. The new Rittenhouse. Put aside the fact that unlike Kyle Rittenhouse, Daniel Perry was found guilty of murder in a case where the facts were pretty clear. He drove through a red light into a crowd of BLM protesters, and opened fire multiple times on a man who, yes, was legally and openly carrying an AK-47 but according to witnesses, didn't have it pointed at Perry. So Perry wasn't acting in self-defense. He wasn't standing his ground.\n\nHasan then recalled Perry's history of boastful bigotry:\n\nOh, and here's what we've learned about Daniel Perry since the guilty verdict; since Republicans have fallen over one another to defend him. According to seventy-six pages of documents unsealed by the judge last week and shared online by ' The Houston Chronicle ,' Perry sent private messages for years containing racist memes and defending the killing of protesters and Muslims. For example, in a 2019 message, Perry wrote, it was 'to [sic] bad we can't get paid for hunting Muslims in Europe.' In June, 2020, he referred to Black Lives Matter protesters as 'monkeys,' and said, 'I am a racist because I do not agree with people acting like animals at the zoo.'\n\nHasan's conclusion was that Perry's views are no longer an aberration for hardliners inside the Make America Great Again movement:\n\nNow, when these texts and social media posts came out last week, I initially thought to myself, silly, GOP. Maybe they should have waited a bit before turning this odious guy into their new hero, their new martyr. But now I'm thinking, sadly, these statements from Perry - this clear evidence of his racism and his violent hatred towards minorities - will just make him more popular in right-wing circles, not less, given the bigoted state of the modern GOP.\n\nWatch below or at this link ."

(Jay Janner/Austin American-Statesman via AP, Pool)\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) - A U.S. Army sergeant who fatally shot an armed protester at a Black Lives Matter march in Texas was sentenced to 25 years in prison Wednesday, after prosecutors used his social media history and text messages to portray him as a racist who may commit violence again.\n\nDaniel Perry's sentence now pushes the case toward a potentially thorny decision for Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has said he wants to issue a swift pardon.\n\nAbbott requested the state Board of Pardons and Paroles to send him a pardon recommendation for Perry shortly after he was convicted in April of killing Garrett Foster at the Austin march in July 2020.\n\nAbbott lauded Texas' tough Stand Your Ground self-defense laws and said Perry was railroaded by a liberal prosecutor. Since then, Perry's trail of texts and online posts, including shockingly racist images, have been made public and the governor has stayed silent on the matter.\n\nAbbott's office did not respond to an Associated Press request for comment on the sentence or whether he still intends to issue a pardon. Perry, 36, could have received up to life in prison.\n\nRice University political science professor Mark Jones said Abbott moved too soon on the call for a pardon.\n\n\"Abbott clearly boxed himself into a corner,\" when he appeared to respond to criticism from conservative former Fox News star Tucker Carlson, who demanded the governor act, Jones said.\n\n\"I suspect if Gov. Abbott had known all that he knows now, he would not have jumped the gun on pledging to pardon him,\" Jones said.\n\nThe Pardons and Parole board, which is appointed by Abbott, has already started reviewing Perry's case. State law requires the board to recommend a pardon before the governor can act.\n\nThe case has been embroiled in politics as it came amid widespread demonstrations against police killings and racial injustice, following the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer.\n\nPerry's attorneys on Wednesday called the case a \"political prosecution\" and the release of the texts and social media posts \"character assassination.\"\n\nAttorney Clinton Broden said the defense team would pursue both a pardon and a standard appeal in the court system.\n\n\"Those who claim that Governor Abbott's expressed intent is based on politics simply choose to ignore the fact that it was only the political machinations of a rogue district attorney which led to Sgt. Perry's prosecution,\" he said.\n\nTravis County District Attorney Jose Garza said it was Abbott \"who decided to insert politics in this case.\" Garza said he's been assured by the parole board that he and Foster's family will be given a chance to address the board in Perry's case.\n\nIn a statement, the board confirmed the investigation is ongoing and declined further comment.\n\n\"The entire history of the board, the board has been a careful steward of the power of clemency in this state,\" Garza said. \"Our criminal justice system is not perfect, but in this case it worked exactly as it should. The Travis County District Attorney's office is not done fighting for Garrett and the integrity of that process here.\"\n\nIn a brief statement before sentencing, state District Judge Clifford Brown said Perry received a fair trial. The jury's verdict \"deserves our honor and it deserves to be respected,\" Brown said, without mentioning the potential pardon.\n\nJones predicted the board will let Perry's legal appeals happen first, and that it would be years, if ever, before the board makes a recommendation in the case.\n\n\"The majority (of conservatives) will want to put it in the rearview mirror,\" Jones said. \"Conservatives have far better causes and individuals to support, far better than Daniel Perry.\"\n\nPerry, who is white, was stationed at Fort Hood, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) north of Austin, when the shooting happened. He was working as a ride-share driver and had just dropped off a customer when he turned onto a street filled with protesters. Foster, a 28-year-old Air Force veteran who was also white, was legally carrying an AK-47 rifle.\n\nPerry said he acted in self defense, claiming that he was trying to drive past the crowd and fired his pistol when Foster pointed a rifle at him. Witnesses testified that they did not see Foster raise his weapon, and prosecutors argued that Perry could have driven away without shooting.\n\nArmy spokesman Bryce Dubee has said Perry is classified as in \"civilian confinement\" pending separation from the military.\n\nAmong Perry's statements introduced Tuesday, he wrote on Facebook a month before the shooting: \"It is official I am a racist because I do not agree with people acting like animals at the zoo.\"\n\nFloyd was killed on May 25, 2020. A few days later as protests erupted, Perry sent a text message to an acquaintance: \"I might go to Dallas to shoot looters.\"\n\nFoster was with his girlfriend, Whitney Mitchell, who is Black and uses a wheelchair, when Perry gunned him down. Mitchell and several members of Foster's family were in the courtroom for sentencing Wednesday.\n\nFoster's mother, Sheila Foster, was allowed to address Perry after he was sentenced and still in the courtroom.\n\n\"After three long years we're finally getting justice for Garrett,\" she said. \"Mr. Perry, I pray to God that one day he will get rid of all this hate that is in your heart.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Who Really Protests, and Why?\n\nThe racial-justice and pro-reopening protests of 2020 had significant overlap in attendees.\n\nIn 2020, two major protest movements defined our political landscape: the racial-justice protests after the murder of George Floyd and the anti-lockdown protests pushing against COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nAt the time, these movements were seen by many as near-polar opposites and were often defined by their extremes. For the police-brutality protests, images of Minneapolis on fire and demands for total police abolition seemed to define the movement. For the anti-lockdown protests, militiamen with firearms in and around state capitols were among the most striking visuals. And an association with fringe right-wing groups marred the public-health protests with a sense of extremism.\n\nBut research from economist Nick Papageorge complicates these findings. Along with his co-authors, Papageorge ran surveys in the summer of 2020 that captured demographic and ideological information about the people who participated in these movements. Much to Papageorge's surprise, his findings revealed significant overlap between the BLM and anti-lockdown protest movements. And-on some metrics-the paper reveals that the protesters were not out of touch with the majority of Americans. Rather, they were more representative of the country than even the 2020 electorate.\n\nIn this episode of Good on Paper , I speak with Papageorge, a professor at Johns Hopkins University who largely works at the intersection of public health and economics.\n\n\"There has been this notion of, Maybe it's just fun. Protesting is the new brunch was one of the things that came out,\" Papageorge said. \"And I think that was one part of the caricaturization, right? That there are these gun-toting vigilantes protesting. And then there were these privileged leftist extremists going to these BLM protests. And that just wasn't in line with what we were finding. The median protester was not an extremist.\"\n\nListen to the conversation here:\n\nThe following is a transcript of the episode:\n\n[ Music ]\n\nJerusalem Demsas: This is Good on Paper , a policy show that questions what we really know about popular narratives.\n\nI'm your host, Jerusalem Demsas. I'm a staff writer here at The Atlantic, where much of my written work begins with seeing a new working paper come out and following it down a research rabbit hole.\n\nAn exciting, new finding is always great, but the most important work is figuring out how it sits in the context of the rest of our knowledge base. What is it adding? Where does it depart from consensus?\n\nAnd particularly when we're talking about new findings in economics-those often come from early versions of papers, before all the levels of review have been completed, so there's an extra, added level of scrutiny you have to have.\n\nThere's one such paper that's been stuck in my brain since I first saw it come into my inbox more than two years ago-one that upended much of my thinking around the protests in 2020.\n\nThe paper is called, \"Who Protests, What Do They Protest, and Why?\" and it focuses on the demographic and ideological characteristics of protesters in two major social movements: The BLM protests following the murder of George Floyd and the anti-lockdown protests that came in response to restrictive COVID-19 rules.\n\nThe paper finds that nearly 30 percent of protesters attended both a BLM and a lockdown protest, indicating significant overlap in the types of people attracted to both movements-and the research shows that these people are protestors, not counterprotesters. This finding really surprised me and made me question my priors about what kinds of people were attracted to these movements.\n\nNow, it's not possible to talk about protests without thinking about those that rocked college campuses this year. While this conversation doesn't touch on those protests, because we taped it in the spring, the research still has some lessons in it for those drawing large conclusions about who's protesting and why, and whether contemporaneous media reports can give us an accurate picture of chaotic events.\n\nThe stakes of misunderstanding the composition of protesters are high: Who we think is protesting drives how we respond to them. Who we think make up social movements affects whether our leaders react to them, and how. And, most importantly, for me, as a journalist, my own misunderstandings of what the 2020 protests were shaped my thinking about public-health restrictions and whether they had gone too far.\n\n[ Music ]\n\nI asked the lead author of that paper to come help me think through all of this. Nick Papageorge is an economist at Johns Hopkins University, where he mostly focuses on the intersection of public health and economics.\n\nLet's dive in.\n\nDemsas: All right. Nick, welcome to the show.\n\nNick Papageorge: Thank you. Thank you for having me.\n\nDemsas: So I want to take us back to spring of 2020. It was a really scary time. COVID-19 was in full swing. We were seeing caseloads rising. I remember just being terrified. I didn't really know what was the way to keep yourself or the people you cared about safe.\n\nI was lucky that I got to work from home the entire time. But at the same time, it was just like there was such different, changing informational environments. It just felt very chaotic. And the advice we were all getting was just stay away from other people, stay masked, and just limit contact as much as possible.\n\nAnd spring of 2020 is also when George Floyd is murdered. And in response, a nationwide movement erupted. Protests were happening in most American cities and even around the world. And all of a sudden, I have a vivid memory of seeing this open letter that's signed by over 1,200 people-public-health professionals, infectious-disease professionals-and it's a weird document from the time because you have them criticizing the \"heavily armed and predominantly white protesters\" for protesting stay-at-home orders, but then they say that, actually, the anti-racism protests were completely justifiable under public-health grounds.\n\nReading-quoting directly from it now-they say, \"Do not disband protests under the guise of maintaining public health for COVID-19 restrictions.\" And it just felt very weird to me. It felt very weird that you had public-health professionals who, ostensibly, were giving us advice about how to stay healthy now telling us that, Well, for certain things it was okay to break some of these guidelines . So what was your reaction to that letter?\n\nPapageorge: I think if I could start at a high level, one of the critiques coming from economists-and people have an idea of what economists do, and it has to do with banks and finance and interest rates. And it turns out that what we do is a lot closer to what maybe comes into your mind when you're thinking about what a sociologist does: We study people and behavior and factors that affect behavior, sources of inequality, and so on.\n\nAnd so one of the things that really frustrated economists was there seemed to be this implied hierarchy about what was important in these public-health debates. And, of course, we don't want people to die from a disease. At the same time, kids not going to school is really, really harmful. And I don't know where different people are going to land in that debate, because I could certainly see somebody saying, Look, preventing any death is just the most paramount thing . I could also hear somebody saying, We need kids to go to school. That's just the most important thing .\n\nI can't tell you which one of those two is the right one. What I don't think we did was recognize this really nasty trade-off-this really brutal trade-off-and have that conversation. And then there was this implied view about what's a worthy thing to do, and I guess it wasn't opening schools.\n\nDemsas: Like, what's worth risking COVID-19?\n\nPapageorge: Right, exactly. What's worth risking COVID-19? And we decided-or it was decided-that, Well, okay, but going to a BLM protest is okay . And I think that undermined some credibility of some of these decisions that were made on our behalf. And I think that maybe I agreed, in a way, with that trade-off. I decided to leave the house and join a big group to go to a BLM protest. But I could see why people might have thought, Hey, wait. You're telling me I can't take my kid to school but that I'm allowed to go to this protest? That doesn't seem right. Who decided that ?\n\nDemsas: I was rocked back to this. I remember vividly a couple years ago when-and I'm going to out myself as a weirdo for this, but-the National Bureau of Economic Research puts out this weekly rundown of studies, and I'll click through them. And I remember seeing your study in 2022, when it first came out, and seeing the findings that people who attended anti-public-health protests and people who attended BLM protests, that there was a lot of overlap over those people. Can you tell us about that? How did you find that? Like, what was the process of even doing that survey?\n\nPapageorge: It was a strange study for me. We were playing with data, and we found a pattern that didn't make sense. And so we had to come back and figure out: What's the question this is answering?\n\nDemsas: Yeah. Why were you doing the survey in the first place?\n\nPapageorge: The survey started pretty soon after the emergence of COVID-19. And Washington University got some outside funding to run a high-quality survey. I was asked to contribute some thoughts on what we might want to look at. That is because I've looked at infectious disease before in the economic context, in particular HIV, risky behavior, how it interacts with medication usage, and employment, and these kinds of things-these health-economic interactions.\n\nSo we started asking questions, and then the data set-we were going to go back for several rounds. And so by the time of the second round of questions, when they were asking whether we wanted to add more questions, the BLM protests had started. And so we thought, Well, we should probably collect data on whether or not people are attending them . And then-I don't know who in the group (it might have been me; I don't think it was)-somebody said, Well, there are these other protests going on for reopening . I don't want to quite call them anti-public health. I think that they were maybe pro-reopening. And so-\n\nDemsas: No, fair. That's probably a biased way of me talking about it.\n\nPapageorge: So there were these protests and, in my mind, there was still this caricature that these were, like, gun-toting vigilantes, and that we, Okay, sure, we should probably collect that data as well, because we're trying to be scientists here . And I thought, Why don't we see what's predicting protest attendance ? Obviously, you know, going to a BLM protest probably predicts not going to a reopening protest, just because that would make sense according to my bias, my priors.\n\nAnd we found the opposite. And then we checked it again, and we found the opposite again, and then we really started to kick the tires. But the result didn't go away, and so then we entered this period of thinking, Okay, maybe this is novel, and maybe we need to start to figure out why this might make sense . Economics, as a field, tries to be a little bit apolitical. I would say that one out of every five of my findings, I'm like, Oh man .\n\nDemsas: ( Laughs .) Didn't want to find that out .\n\nPapageorge: Didn't want to find that . But you shouldn't be able to tell my politics by reading my papers. But one thing I did think to myself was, I am getting frustrated by some of the public-health mandates that seem to me to be a little bit excessive .\n\nDemsas: More than just the closing schools or other stuff?\n\nPapageorge: Just the decisions that didn't make, to me, a whole lot of sense, like, Okay, we're gonna let some bars open, but we're gonna keep the schools closed .\n\nDemsas: Yeah, yeah.\n\nPapageorge: And I just was like, Okay, well, what are we waiting for here? What's the evidence, and where's the cost-benefit analysis here ?\n\nDemsas: Yeah.\n\nPapageorge: Like, at what point-\n\nDemsas: And whose values are being followed?\n\nPapageorge: Whose values are being used in that cost-benefit [analysis], right?\n\nAnd so I was getting more and more concerned that, throughout this entire period, you could still get stuff off of Amazon. There's all these people that had to still work. And they don't have the kind of job that I have, where I can telework. And I started thinking about just the mental-health burden. I started thinking about my own kid, who, you know-he has two parents who still have jobs, but I know that he's missing out on socialization at this critical period. These costs are starting to build up. And so I was getting frustrated, and I remember my husband saying to me, If it's shut down again in Baltimore city, I'm going to go to join a reopening protest .\n\nDemsas: Wow.\n\nPapageorge: And it was kind of joking, I think, or maybe he wasn't. I think he was serious. And we'd gone to BLM protests, and I thought that we were just really isolated in having that mixture of views. And so when I looked at the data, I thought, Oh, maybe we weren't .\n\nDemsas: But it's really interesting to me that you were surprised by these findings, even though they represented your own views.\n\nPapageorge: That's totally true. But that's one of the things also, I think-and maybe I'm just conditioned to be like this with science, to really remove myself from my science. And so I don't necessarily assume that folks-I think that's one of the biggest dangers in sciences, especially in the social sciences, is thinking that your views are representative, that your opinions are shared by others. I think a lot of good social science comes when you step back and listen to other people and make sure you're not speaking for them, but maybe elevating their voices.\n\nDemsas: Well, let's dig in a little bit into some of the findings here on the numbers. So, 33 percent of BLM protesters identified as Republicans, and 36 percent of reopening protesters as Democrats. I mean, just generally stepping back, if I think about how these were characterized, we think about BLM protests as a left-wing movement and the reopening protest as a right-wing movement. So when you actually look at who is involved in these protests, what are you actually seeing? Who are these people? And where is the overlap?\n\nPapageorge: Right. So, if you go to a BLM protest, or if you report having gone to a BLM protest, they tended to be a little more Democratic. And then the reopening protests tended to be a little bit more Republican. But then there was this mixture, right? There were plenty of Republicans at BLM protests, and there were plenty of Democrats at these reopening protests, which again, I thought was a little bit strange.\n\nBut I do remember in the early days of the BLM protests, it wasn't the same movement that it is today, which I think it's become much more politicized. You know, you remember Mitt Romney was joining in these protests. There was this outrage from a lot of different places that was collective. The other thing that we found interesting is that people who protested tended to be working in person and have children, which you would think, These are things that are going to make me not want to protest . We also found that people and different measures of well-being were higher.\n\nDemsas: Like higher well-being meant you were more likely to go to a protest?\n\nPapageorge: Yes.\n\nDemsas: Yeah, okay.\n\nPapageorge: Which again, you wonder, Isn't it frustration and anger that drives you to protest? But then there is precedent in earlier research saying that people might go to protests and then feel good. Maybe they feel like they have some say, they have some agency here. Maybe it was cathartic to go to the protest. Or we could just be thinking that people who are energetic and feeling good about themselves are the kinds of people who will go to a protest, as well.\n\nDemsas: Yeah.\n\nPapageorge: I think that if one reflects a little bit on it, it makes sense that folks who might've been really frustrated with the state of things were folks who were working and who were worried about losing their job. These are also parents who have lost their childcare arrangements, which was incredibly frustrating. But I can also imagine those same parents saying, I don't want my kid to grow up in a world where this kind of violence happens . And so that was another set of findings.\n\nOne thing that we found strange was that people who saw themselves at greater risk of COVID-19 were more likely to go to protests.\n\nDemsas: I found this super interesting. So first of all, you're just asking the question: How scared are you of dying, of getting sick ? Or how are you determining that?\n\nPapageorge: So you can do different things. One is kind of more objective, where you can just look at the county caseloads or county reports. And, if I remember correctly, we have a positive correlation with it, but a lot of that can just be, Hey, there were more protests available in places where there were higher rates , right? Maybe bigger cities or whatever.\n\nYou can also ask people about their beliefs. Now, doing that is always wacky, so we got sort of wacky answers there.\n\nDemsas: You got high numbers, right? Like, 30 percent chance of death?\n\nPapageorge: Exactly. But in our defense, anybody who looks to get beliefs data, it's really tricky to do that. And people answer in a very wacky way.\n\nDemsas: But also if you asked me in June 2020, what I thought the risk of death from COVID was-I remember my dad, who always, every year around June gets really bad allergies. My dad has really bad ones. I remember him calling me like, Hey, I feel kind of sick . And I just freaked out. I went to his apartment, and I just dropped off-I'd just been on Twitter, looking up random virologists and being like, Are they using Motrin? Are they using Tylenol? Are they using -you know what I mean? So there's a level where I think I would have said, Oh my gosh, I'm acting like I think my father's going to die , you know? And so I don't know how I would have evaluated that.\n\nPapageorge: Yeah, I think that's right. There is a whole lot of research on how to collect these kinds of data. And if you want to do it well, you have to do it really carefully, kind of anchoring people. For example, people are really bad at small probabilities. So maybe something that's, like, 0.1-percent chance, they'll think it's 10. And to them, it's the same number.\n\nDemsas: It just means small. Yeah.\n\nPapageorge: But I mean, these are massively different numbers. I think if I remember, on average, people thought there was a 30-percent chance that they would get COVID-19, which maybe that's not so bad. But then they think if you get COVID-19, there's a 30 percent chance of dying. And you're thinking, Okay .\n\nDemsas: And that's if they go to the protest?\n\nPapageorge: No, no. This is just in general. So you're thinking, Okay, this is really high . But we did find that people who saw themselves at greater risk of COVID-19 were more likely to go to the protests, which that in itself doesn't surprise me, because that could just be a recognition that, you know, I do risky things . And so, that actually checks out.\n\nDemsas: So, you find that 28 percent of protesters attended both a reopening protest and a BLM protest. One hypothesis raised when I first read this paper was: Maybe there are just certain kinds of people who like to protest, or not like it as an activity but have a high propensity to just protest if it's something that's available in their area.\n\nAnd I was looking into the literature on this, and there's a study by a sociologist at the University of South Carolina at Aiken. Her name is Michelle Petrie, and she looks at the determinants of protest participation. And one thing she brings up is this concept called biographical availability , which is basically whether someone has the time, particularly unstructured time, where they feel like they're less at risk of being surveilled or facing consequences for engaging in protest.\n\nAnd she cites Doug McAdam, who has this paper about the 1964 Mississippi Freedom Summer Project, and he finds that then the people who participated largely came from affluent families, where they were in their early 20s. It's summer, so they didn't have jobs. They were unemployed, unlikely to be married.\n\nI mean, in your sense, is it what's going on here? It feels like there's two potential hypotheses-and maybe they're both true. One is that there's a large overlap on these ideologies between people who were concerned about anti-police brutality and people who were worried about reopening and public-health restrictions. But it's also possible that a lot of people are just like, Maybe I'll just protest . You know what I mean? And so how do you tease that out?\n\nPapageorge: I think it's hard to tease out, is the first thing. And I think that there is this notion of biographical availability. Certain people are just going to be more likely to protest. And that's something that we spend a lot of time doing. That's why we look at these predictors. What are the factors that seem to predict protest attendance?\n\nAnd I think the story's a bit nuanced because, Okay, sure. Younger? That makes sense. That checks out. But having kids and also working in person? That does not . And then there was also and has been this notion of, you know, Maybe it's just fun . \"Protesting is the new brunch\" was one of the things that came out.\n\nAnd I think that was one part of the caricaturization, right? That there are these gun-toting vigilantes protesting. And then there were these privileged, leftist extremists going to these BLM protests. And that just wasn't in line with what we were finding. The median protester was not an extremist. The median protester was not somebody who had plenty of time on their hands or plenty of affluence, and so they don't even need to worry about working. People seem to be overcoming obstacles to get there. And so that's got to be at least part of the story.\n\nWe also were able to look at police shootings in the area where these folks were, and that seemed to be also predictive.\n\nDemsas: So if there were more police shootings, they're more likely-\n\nPapageorge: If there were more police shootings, you were more likely to go to BLM, exactly. And so that seems to suggest that this isn't just a leisure activity, but something that people are taking seriously.\n\n[ Music ]\n\nDemsas: Okay, we're going to take a quick break, but more with Nick when we get back.\n\n[ Break ]\n\nDemsas: This is something I find with economists a lot when I'm talking to them, that there's a lot of frustration that, in many ways, our official apparatuses don't take into account costs like fun-\n\nPapageorge: ( Laughs .)\n\nDemsas: Things that you like to do that make your life happy. The trade-off, of course: We wanted people to stop dying and, especially at the very beginning, when we had no information, it makes a lot of sense to shut down a lot of things.\n\nBut it's interesting to think back again to that letter we talked about at the beginning because, in many ways, that letter was actually the way you would want public-health officials to engage with trade-offs. Because they go into it, and they say, Yes, of course, there are concerns with catching COVID-19 in public spaces. But also, people have a legitimate concern about protesting and about anti-racism . Our goal, as public-health professionals, is to provide them the tools to do mitigation of that kind of damage . And it was like, Where is that trade-off thinking in any other space?\n\nPapageorge: Right. No, that's what I think was so-and to be fair to people in public health, and I work now with some epidemiologists, there is now this call, in general for, Okay, we need to figure out a way to think about these trade-offs more carefully .\n\nObviously, there are some folks who still think any one death is worth just infinity and therefore anything else is just secondary. Fine. That's what they think. I just don't. One reason: We know poverty is deadly, so you're not comparing apples to oranges.\n\nAnd so what it really comes down to is it's kind of, Whose life matters mor e ? And I think that's really hard when you're comparing, say, my somewhere-in-her-70s mom and a low-income kid in the city. And, you know, whose life matters? Well, both. But you're going to put a policy together that's going to probably harm one person less than the other. And I think it's really hard to think about that.\n\nDemsas: Yeah. And, to me, there were so many times during the pandemic where I felt the way that public-health professionals-the value system in place-was sort of what I later learned is called the precautionary principle . It is this idea-\"do no harm\" is the very simple way of doing it, of just saying, Okay, whatever you actually are going to do, make sure-99.999 percent sure, even 100 percent sure-that anything you do is not going to cause harm. And that means let's not approve tests if we're not 100 percent sure that they're going to be perfectly accurate or at a really high level of accuracy, even though the status quo is that we have no tests. People have no way of figuring out whether or not they might be infected .\n\nAnd I wonder, do you think that the finding that you're having in this paper, and also the research you've done in other spaces, is that pushing the public-health field to think differently? Or are you seeing any kind of changes at all in the public-health field in response to how many people felt that trade-offs weren't really adequately considered during 2020?\n\nPapageorge: So I absolutely think that this paper and other work I've done pushes against this idea that, in public-health contexts, health is the only thing to think about. I've made a whole career off of thinking about the way that health interacts with other factors that are important to us. We're not health maximizers. We might have been. I mean, you can imagine some creatures living in some other planet that the only thing they care about is their health.\n\nDemsas: They're living on Soylent.\n\nPapageorge: Longevity is the only thing you care about. I mean, just any decision we make on any given day shows that that's not true. We leave our house. We eat fried foods. We drink. We get into cars. We get on planes. We do all sorts of things that show that we are not health maximizers. We're lots-of-things maximizers. Health is one of them. We would rather be healthy than not healthy if it were for free. The thing is, it's not for free.\n\nAnd so I think that there has been some movement towards, How can we do this better and just recognize that there are these trade-offs? And I think the subtle point is to say that I don't really care where you come down on that trade-off or where I come down on the trade-off; I want to present that trade-off.\n\nDemsas: Yeah.\n\nPapageorge: And then politics can kind of decide-\n\nDemsas: Yeah.\n\nPapageorge: Where we go from there.\n\nDemsas: So, returning to politics then, because I think another part of your paper that really would be great to delve into is a finding that the protesters, on some axes, were more representative of the public than even the 2020 voting electorate. And it's not on all of them.\n\nSo you find on age and income, the protesters were younger-much younger-and then slightly more low-income than the voting population and the general public. But then on gender and race, the protesting population is more representative of the public than voters.\n\nSo, when you see this, why do you think those distinctions are happening? Why on gender and race is that happening versus age and income?\n\nPapageorge: I don't know why one versus the other, though I know that younger people might not be as trustful about traditional modes of expressing themselves.\n\nVoting: I think there's some disillusionment. We know that voting is on a certain day, and there are lots of requirements that are maybe easier to navigate if you have more income or more work flexibility, which oftentimes is going to correlate to higher income. I mean, if I leave for three hours from my job, no one's gonna really even ask me where I've gone, whereas that's just absolutely not the case with people who are working hourly.\n\nAnd so, if you then have these protests sprouting up, and the only thing you need to do-you don't have to bring your ID; you don't have to make sure you registered a few weeks ago or whatever-you just go.\n\nDemsas: But you outlined for us earlier that these were people who thought it was costly to protest. And, for them, you said it's more likely that they're working in person, and they're going. So I was surprised, right? Because, to me, it would indicate these are people who clearly feel like there is some value to protesting, whether it's just expressive, whether it's communal, whether it's actually trying to enact change, or some combination of those three. They were willing to overcome things that were, to themselves, costly. But then with voting, you don't see that happening.\n\nPapageorge: Right. And I think a lot of that is just because you have one day. Suppose I work four or five days a week at a restaurant, and the hours are a little bit wacky, and Tuesday's the day you got to work. And that's that, whereas-\n\nDemsas: The protests were kind of going on.\n\nPapageorge: The protests were going on. And so there's going to be a day when you can make it. And I think that this is probably a lesson that we should be thinking a little bit about, which is: Why do people like to mail-in vote? Because it means you don't have to do it on a certain day at a certain time. In general, what we were trying to show is these weren't, like, weirdos who just are entirely unrepresentative. These were really typical Americans. And I think that what we wanted to take away from that was that we don't get to ignore them by caricaturizing them.\n\nDemsas: Yeah.\n\nPapageorge: And I think that was something that some corners of the media did, and I think that was very unfortunate because it cheapened the message. It cheapened the will, the agency that people have.\n\nDemsas: I think this is actually the place where the stakes of this misunderstanding and caricature are really, really high. Because the BLM protests-I thought they were cross-racial. I saw a lot of white people participating in them, a lot of Black people, a lot of people from different backgrounds. I thought they were mostly young. But I saw a lot of men. I saw a lot of women. And I thought it was largely representative.\n\nBut I still had, you know, the image in my head of the Minneapolis police precinct on fire, or people talking about Seattle, where there was that kind of really radical zone of people. And then with the public-health protests, I thought it was even more biased. I think I saw, you know, militia members in state houses and assumed that's what's going on there.\n\nAnd the stakes of that are really bad because if you realize that these groups of people are actually representative and not just not your average person, then that changes how we talk about it as the media. It changes how politicians respond to it.\n\nAnd it's interesting. I mean, I haven't really worked through this myself, so maybe we can do it here. But in some ways-I mean, there's now a new paper by Amory Gethin and Vincent Pons. Their paper-it's an NBER working paper-that indicates that BLM protests in 2020 did actually really affect public opinion and made people more likely to oppose police brutality, become more quote-unquote liberal on racial-justice issues.\n\nBut they're finding that also BLM is one of the only protests in their sample that actually has a sustained effect. And I imagine it's because the other ones were not as widespread. And so, in that case, people did affect change despite these caricatures.\n\nAnd with reopening, I feel like it's harder to tell because obviously we reopened, but was it because of the protesters? How do you think about it? Because in some cases you can be pessimistic and say, These characters that exist really prevented these groups from getting what they wanted done . But there's some evidence that shows that despite the way that they were covered and maybe popularly understood, people still really were able to get certain policy things enacted.\n\nPapageorge: Yeah, I think both things can be true at the same time. I think BLM certainly did have an effect. It did morph a little bit into a different movement, and I think the idea of, like, defunding the police became much more prevalent. And I don't think that's where the original protests might have been, but I think that the original coalition of people-this very ideologically diverse set of people-would maybe say, Yeah, well, some things have happened. It's much more on the radar . The idea of police reform, I think, is much more reasonable to hear about in different corners, and when before, maybe that would've been a little bit more of an extreme view.\n\nIn terms of public health, I think it's really hard, like you said, to understand what were the effects of those protests. Because vaccines were coming around, and that was probably what was going to happen. This technology was going to just change. But at the same time, when I started getting into this idea of behavior and it being a really important part of epidemiological models-you know, when you're trying to follow a pathogen, you need to understand the interaction with human beings-that was controversial to people in those spaces. It was controversial to certain experts to say, Look, you don't necessarily need to shut down everything, because people are going to protect themselves . And I think these-\n\nDemsas: Yeah, wasn't there some data that people, before orders actually were in place, were already staying at home?\n\nPapageorge: Absolutely. Absolutely. And so the idea is, okay, How do you take account of that when you're deciding what you're going to close? So I think, in a way, that some of these-I don't know if it was the protests per se-but I would say that we've absolutely seen a change in some of the views that people hold. Not everybody, but I think that folks have said, Wow, we really didn't think about that trade-off. We didn't do behavior well. We didn't figure that out .\n\nDemsas: Well, how generalizable do you think your findings that you have about the BLM protests or the reopening protests are to protests writ large, right? Is it the case that like, you know, you're in June 2020, COVID-19 health precautions have sort of ensured that, in many ways, there's a large number of people who are doing self-limiting behaviors such that they're able to participate in protests? Or maybe the costs were just so high, at the time, to not engaging in protests that people were willing to do it.\n\nBut I feel like there's a lot of protests out there that are not like this. I feel like they are a really small group, and maybe no one's just done your analysis yet to figure out that they're very representative people, but I don't know. Sometimes I just see things, I'm like, That just seems like 20 people who are on this issue . Like, That does not feel like a regular thing . So, how do you think about why these ones felt this way versus what most protests look like?\n\nPapageorge: I think that if I'm a good scientist, I'm going to say, I don't know how generalizable this is, because that was a very unique moment in our history, where you have these movements occurring and data collected at just the right time.\n\nAnd so, in one sense, I would say it's not generalizable at all, but then you start to look. And I started to question this kind of received wisdom that we're just hopelessly at odds with one another, that there are these, like, extremists, and there's this polarization happening, and it's just relentlessly growing. And I started to think, Maybe that's not true , right? I mean, it sounds like it if you turn on the TV. But I started to question it. And I started to wonder, How much of this is manufactured polarization? How much of this is just not really necessarily there?\n\nAnd I think abortion is one of these issues, right, where the median American wants abortion rights with some restrictions. And I am very pro-choice in my views. I, for a long time, thought if anybody's not 100 percent pro-choice, then they're the enemy. And I, after all of this, started to think, Was that the right stance? If somebody said to me, Abortion's complicated for me. I think I'm a little pro-life. I understand that there should be different circum - whatever, whatever . Maybe I shouldn't have seen that as the enemy, but maybe I should have been thinking, Is there common ground?\n\nI think that there are certain areas in my life where I don't have a lot of room to budge. Like, if somebody says to me, Two gay men shouldn't have a kid , I'm like, There's nothing for me to say here, because it's my kid . And there's no room for me to be like, Oh, I guess it's okay if you take him away just a little bit .\n\nDemsas: ( Laughs .)\n\nPapageorge: I mean, that's just-we're done. But I think that on a lot of other issues, there's a lot more room to just recognize that we can do something together. And I wasn't ready for that before, and now I think I am.\n\nDemsas: Well, that feels like a great place to close out. Our last question is always the same: What is an idea that you thought was good on paper, but when it came to real life, maybe it didn't pan out the way you thought?\n\nPapageorge: Okay. I was trying to think of one that would be appropriate to say. ( Laughs .)\n\nDemsas: ( Laughs .) We've gotten a couple weird ones already.\n\nPapageorge: I don't want to lose my job or something.\n\nDemsas: No, yeah.\n\nPapageorge: No. I'm just kidding. So I was just thinking about parenting, and how I think I'm an okay parent. But I lack the instincts that my husband has. He is very nurturing and sweet and just gets it with kids.\n\nAnd so the kid was having trouble sleeping, even though he's a champion sleeper. So I am taking the kid home and singing the monkey-who-bumps-his-head song, and I thought it would be just brilliant to change the animals around. So we did bears and cats and dogs. And then I got to snakes, and my kid sang along with me until he got to two snakes. And then he just turns and starts crying and saying, I don't want snakes in my bed .\n\nAnd I just remember having to call my husband and tell him. He's like, What did you do? Because he's used to me being stupid.\n\nDemsas: Yeah.\n\nPapageorge: And his boss was there, and the phone was on speaker. And she's like, Now I'm afraid to go to sleep . I was just like, Wow, I'm really bad at this .\n\nDemsas: Well, does your kid sleep now?\n\nPapageorge: Yeah, he's fine.\n\nDemsas: Well, then, you know-\n\nPapageorge: It's all fine. ( Laughs .)\n\nDemsas: It's all fine. Well, thank you so much for coming on the show, Nick.

      "text": "Army Sergeant Who Shot Austin BLM Protester Dead Acted in 'Self Defense': Attorney\n\nSenior National Reporter\n\nThe active-duty U.S. Army sergeant who fatally shot Garrett Foster at a Black Lives Matter rally , did so in self defense, his attorney said Friday. Daniel Perry, who was identified by his attorney, was working as a ride-share driver at the time of the July 25 shooting. After dropping off a client, Perry went to a protest \"hot spot\" to wait for another passenger or a delivery notification when he found himself surrounded by a group of protesters, his lawyers said. Several people started to beat Perry's car before an \"individual carrying an assault rifle, now known to be Garrett Foster, quickly approached the car and then motioned with the assault rifle for Mr. Perry to lower his window,\" the statement said.\n\nPerry initially thought Foster was a cop so complied but, after rolling his window down, apparently realized he wasn't. \"It has now been confirmed by several witnesses that this individual with the assault rifle then began to raise the assault rifle toward Sgt. Perry. It was only then that Sgt. Perry, who carried a handgun in his car for his own protection while driving strangers in the ride share program, fired on the person to protect his own life.\"\n\nSenior National Reporter\n\nGot a tip?

After a jury found Daniel Perry, 35, guilty of murder in early April, Abbott took to Twitter vowing to urge the Board of Pardons and Paroles to pardon Perry, citing Texas' \"Stand Your Ground\" laws. Perry claimed self-defense, telling police that Air Force veteran Garrett Foster-who was legally carrying a semi-automatic rifle at the Austin demonstration-aimed the barrel at him before he shot Foster with a handgun. However, court filings revealed that Perry had fantasized about killing Black Lives Matter protesters, and had described himself in private messages and social media posts as a proud racist.

The septuagenarian, Martin Gugino, hit his head on the concrete and spent roughly a month in the hospital recovering from skull and brain injuries. On Sunday, local outlets the Buffalo News and Nexstar affiliate WIVB reported that Buffalo Police Department officers Aaron Torgalski and Robert McCabe wouldn't be facing any excessive-force charges over the incident. \"Upon review,\" arbitrator Jeffrey Selchick wrote in a Friday ruling, \"there is no evidence to sustain any claim that Respondents (police officers) had any other viable options other than to move Gugino out of the way of their forward movement.\" The arbitrator maintained that Gugino had been acting erratically and refusing to obey the officers, who were clearing the area of demonstrators, according to the Associated Press. The city's police commissioner said that Torgalski and McCabe, who were suspended without pay and arrested shortly after a video of the incident surfaced online, would be reinstated to duty on Monday.\n\nBreaking News Reporter\n\namanda.mcdougall@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

At the moment, the scales are unfairly balanced and I just want things to be fair for my children and my grandchildren.\"\n\nPolice said 113 people were arrested on Saturday, including a 28-year-old man detained on suspicion of urinating by a Westminster memorial dedicated to the murdered police officer Keith Palmer, after far-right activists organised a counter-protest to BLM groups. The Metropolitan police said its officers were injured after being kicked, punched or hit by missiles as they faced hundreds of angry demonstrators , who claimed they were protecting statues.\n\nHutchinson and his friends, who are security and martial arts experts, attended an anti-racist protest on Saturday to \"try and keep the peace\". When far-right groups began to clash with black protesters, Hutchinson said the man he helped had been caught alone and left by his friends.\n\nPierre Noah, a businessman and friend of Hutchinson's, said of the incident: \"It would have turned out really bad because someone's life would have been taken and you know what would have happened. Straight away - black boys have killed somebody, and they've killed a white man - it's just going to be worse. So we had to go out there. I couldn't sleep.\"\n\nDescribing his motivation to help the protester, Jamaine Facey, a personal trainer, said: \"I'm not protecting him, I'm protecting our kids. I was protecting their future, because I know the judge would not have saw what happened before. I was protecting their future.\"\n\nChris Otokito, a businessman, described the group's effort to de-escalate the situation. \"We were there to serve a purpose. We saw it escalating, we tried to get around the guy to try and stop it from happening. Patrick came in and assessed the situation straight away, picked him up and just tried to do what we could to get him back to a safer place.\"\n\nA photo of Hutchinson carrying the injured man went viral on Sunday, with people describing the BLM protester as a hero.\n\nClaudia Webbe, the Labour MP for Leicester East, tweeted : \"A national hero - this is what humanity looks like.\"\n\nDavid Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, shared the photo on Twitter , writing: \"Patrick Hutchinson carries an injured stranger to safety during yesterday's protests. It's easy to focus on the worst instincts of human behaviour. But it is vital we also celebrate the best.\"\n\nBoris Johnson condemned the \"racist thuggery\" of the rightwing protests in London, while the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, on Sunday described the scenes as \"shocking and disgusting\".\n\nSimilar demonstrations took place elsewhere in the country, including in Bolton and Bristol, but appeared to proceed mostly peacefully."

The Texas governor, Greg Abbott, has said he will sign a pardon once he has a recommendation from the Texas pardons and parole board, which is stacked with Abbott appointees.\n\nOn the governor's orders, the board is reviewing Perry's case. It is unclear when it will reach a decision.\n\nThe district judge, Clifford Brown, spoke during sentencing. He did not address the potential pardon directly. But he insisted Perry had a \"fair and impartial trial\" and the jury's decision \"deserves our honor and it deserves to be respected\".\n\nPerry was stationed at Fort Hood, about 70 miles north of Austin, when the shooting happened.\n\nPerry, who is white, was working as a ride-share driver on 25 July 2020 when he shot and killed 28-year-old Foster, an air force veteran, also white.\n\nFoster was legally carrying an AK-47 rifle as he participated in a demonstration against police killings and racial injustice following the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer.\n\nPerry dropped off a ride-share customer and turned on to a street filled with protesters. He said he was trying to get past the crowd and fired his pistol when Foster pointed the rifle at him. Witnesses testified they did not see Foster raise his weapon. Prosecutors argued that Perry could have driven away without shooting.\n\nPerry said he acted in self-defense. His lawyers asked the judge to consider his more than a decade-long military career and hand down a sentence of no more than 10 years. Perry has been classified as in \"civilian confinement\" and is pending separation from the military, said an army spokesman, Bryce Dubee.\n\nThe sentencing range for the murder conviction is five years to life. A prosecutor, Guillermo Gonzalez, urged Brown to issue a sentence of at least 25 years.\n\n\"This man is a loaded gun, ready to go off at any perceived threat,\" Gonzalez said. \"He's going to do it again.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, prosecutors submitted into evidence dozens of texts and social media posts Perry wrote, shared or liked, including some shockingly racist images.\n\nThey were excluded from Perry's trial but publicly released after his conviction and allowed into the sentencing phase by Brown.\n\nA month before the shooting, Perry wrote on Facebook: \"It is official I am a racist because I do not agree with people acting like animals at the zoo.\"\n\nFloyd was killed on 25 May 2020. A few days later, as protests erupted across the US, Perry sent a text to an acquaintance: \"I might go to Dallas to shoot looters.\"\n\nAn attorney for Perry, Douglas O'Connell, argued the texts and posts were presented out of context, and that Perry had a right to free speech.\n\n\"Some of those social media posts are frankly repugnant,\" O'Connell said, while classifying others as \"dark humor\".\n\nA forensic psychologist, Greg Hupp, testified that he believed Perry had post-traumatic stress disorder from his deployment to Afghanistan and being bullied as a child. Perry's mother, Rachel Perry, testified that he was ostracized as a child because of a speech impediment."

Perry is white, as was Foster.\n\nWhile the jury also found Perry not guilty of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, the murder conviction left him facing a maximum of life imprisonment. He could be sentenced as soon as next week, according to the local television news outlet KXAN.\n\nHowever, Texas's Republican extremist governor Greg Abbott said on Saturday on Twitter that he was already working on pardoning Perry from his conviction, which he called an attempted jury nullification of Texas's self-defense law.\n\nPerry was driving for Uber in downtown Austin where Foster was participating in a Black Lives Matter rally on the night of the shooting on 25 July 2020. According to police, Perry stopped and honked at the protesters as they walked through the streets before driving his car into the crowd, the Texas Tribune reported.\n\nPerry's attorneys argued their client was forced to shoot Foster five times in self-defense after Foster approached his car with an AK-47 rifle. Meanwhile, prosecutors contended Perry had other options during the situation, including driving away before he fired his own gun at Foster.\n\nThere were no passengers in Perry's car at the time of the shooting, which unfolded during nationwide demonstrations prompted by the murder of George Floyd by an on-duty police officer in Minneapolis.\n\nIn court, prosecutors brought up Facebook messages that Perry sent prior to Foster's killing.\n\nIn one message, Perry wrote: \"No protesters go near me or my car\" and \"I might go to Dallas to shoot looters,\" the Austin television news outlet KTBC reported .\n\nAnother message that Perry sent on 31 May 2020 said : \"I might have to kill a few people on my way to work they are rioting outside my apartment complex.\" A few days later, Perry commented on a Facebook post of a video titled Protesters Looters Get Shot San Antonio Texas, writing, \"glad someone finally did something\".\n\nDuring the trial, Austin police detective William Bursley testified about evidence found on Perry's cellphone. Part of the evidence included online searches for \"protest tonight\", \"protesters in Seattle gets shot\", \"riot shootouts\" and \"protests in Dallas live\".\n\n\"This is an age-old story about a man who couldn't keep his anger under control,\" said prosecutor Guillermo Gonzalez, according to the Austin American-Statesman . \"It's not about police, and it's not about protest marchers.\n\nSign up to Headlines US\n\nGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\n\"Garrett Foster had every right to go up to him and see what the heck was going on and he had every right to do it with a deadly weapon.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Perry's attorney, Doug O'Connell, argued that the protesters \"didn't know anything about Perry when they attacked the car and boxed it in\".\n\n\"Daniel had no choice, and that could have happened to anyone,\" O'Connell said .\n\nO'Connell's argument has a key ally in Abbott, with the governor saying he would not allow jurors to nullify Texas's self-defense law. Abbott said on Saturday that the self-defense law in Texas was one of the strongest in the US, and he said he would defend it by asking the state board which handles such matters to give a pardon to Perry and to expedite the process.\n\nAfter the verdict, Foster's father, Stephen Foster, said : \"We are happy with the verdict and also very sorry for [Perry's] family as well.\"\n\nTravis county's district attorney José Garza, for his part, said : \"Our hearts continue to break for the Foster family. We hope this verdict brings closure and peace to the victim's family.\""

But after viewing body-worn camera footage for the first time this was changed and accepted by Freund as an early plea warranting a reduced sentence.\n\nHe was given a 12-month conditional release order expiring in May 2022."

      "text": "Oregon Prison Limits Solitary to 90 Days. This BLM Protester Has Been in the Hole for 250.\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nMalik Muhammad, a disabled Army veteran with PTSD, received the harshest federal sentence for the George Floyd protests.\n\nThe man who received the harshest federal sentence in connection with 2020 protests against police brutality has been in solitary confinement for more than 250 days. Last Friday, Malik Muhammad ended a nine-day hunger strike undertaken in protest of his solitary confinement at Oregon State Penitentiary.\n\nAt the height of Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, Muhammad, a disabled Army combat veteran diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder , had traveled from Indiana to protests in Kentucky and Oregon.\n\nAccording to court documents, Muhammad participated in firearms training in Kentucky and later threw a Molotov cocktail at police in Oregon. In 2022, at 25 years old, he pleaded guilty to 14 felonies and received a 10-year prison sentence.\n\n\"We are talking about a conditions-of-confinement issue,\" said Muhammad's attorney, Lauren Regan, director of litigation and advocacy at the Civil Liberties Defense Center. The group advocates for civil liberties for political prisoners and took on Muhammad's case last month. \"Malik is designated 100 percent disabled as a combat veteran because of extreme PTSD. And the Department of Corrections knows that.\"\n\nDespite his conditions, Muhammad has been in solitary confinement for more than 250 days.\n\nOregon State Penitentiary public information officer Stephanie Lane said she could not comment on many details of Muhammad's hunger strike and other medical-related issues because of privacy laws, but added that for detainees with disabilities, the prison followed the Americans With Disabilities Act guidelines. She said Muhammad's detention designation had changed in July, though both units are in the prison's Special Management Housing.\n\nHis solitary confinement followed an incident where Regan said Muhammad asked to speak to a supervisor, and instead guards tased and beat him, then threw him in the hole.\n\nThe officers moved Muhammad to another housing unit known as the \"torture tier,\" Regan said. \"This is the tier where they put the screamers and the shit smearers.\"\n\nThe time in solitary has been part of Muhammad's concurrent 10-year federal and state terms in Oregon state prison. The only comparable sentence to come out of 2020 protests in Portland was for Alan Swinney , a member of the far-right Proud Boys gang who was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Swinney was convicted at trial for charges related to pulling a handgun on protesters and firing a paintball gun, injuring a demonstrator's eye.\n\nThe use of solitary confinement has been shown to exacerbate mental health issues. Human rights organizations and civil liberties groups widely consider the prolonged use of solitary confinement as a form of torture .\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nThe Oregon Department of Corrections limits consecutive solitary confinement to 90 days - which is long compared to other states like California, which has a 10-day maximum, or New York, which caps use of solitary at 15 days. At least 17 other states have recently considered limits between 10 to 15 days.\n\nThe Department of Corrections, however, restarts the clock when a person is transferred between different categories of housing, Regan said, which is why Muhammad has been kept in solitary for longer than the 90-day limit.\n\n\"The way that the DOC is attempting to sort of sneak this under the radar is that they have multiple different segregation designations,\" Regan said.\n\nLane, the prison spokesperson, said Muhammad is currently in the Behavioral Health Unit of Special Management Housing. \"The BHU is not the same as the Disciplinary Segregation Unit (DSU), although both units are within our Special Management Housing,\" she said. \"Muhammad was admitted to the BHU on 7/9/2024.\"\n\nThe sleight of hand is belied by Muhammad's actual location: His designation has jumped around from one segregated housing unit to another, Regan said, \"but he's literally staying in the same solitary confinement cell.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThough Oregon's Department of Corrections uses the term \"disciplinary segregation,\" not solitary confinement, the department has acknowledged the harms of the practice and encouraged using it as a last resort.\n\nA state report last year found an \"over-reliance on punitive sanctions\" and overuse of solitary at a women's prison in Wilsonville, Oregon, including locking people in their cells for 22 hours a day.\n\nState officials have since taken steps to address prison conditions, but the extreme duration of solitary confinement in Muhammad's case shows those efforts falling short, Regan said.\n\n\"Oregon is allegedly taking this seriously,\" she said, \"but it is basically business as usual, and basically hiding it from lawyers and the public.\"\n\nMuhammad's supporters announced in a blog post on Tuesday that he had ended his hunger strike late last week and that progress had been made toward his aim of returning to the prison's general population housing.\n\nMuhammad was first put in solitary confinement after an incident that led to prison staff tasing him through the door of his cell, Regan said.\n\nMuhammad was using the phone when a prison guard removed him so another detainee could use the phone. The guard put Muhammad back in his cell. After several rounds of Muhammad asking for explanations - the person placed on the phone after him was white, and Muhammad believes he was targeted on account of his race - Muhammad asked to speak to a superior officer.\n\nWhen the higher-ranking official person showed up, according to Regan's recollection of Muhammad's story, they told the detainee he had to pack up his things and move to a new cell.\n\n\"The next thing Malik knows is 10 corrections officers show up outside of his cell,\" Regan said. \"They stick two taser guns through the slot of the cell and start firing darts into the cell, and all of them strike him. He's got nowhere to go. And they then just start repeatedly cycling the electric shocks of the taser over and over.\"\n\n\"Even after he is on the ground and completely incapacitated because he's being electrocuted, they continue,\" Regan said. \"They kick and punch him.\"\n\nMuhammad began his first hunger strike in May. He started the latest strike last month, after being held in solitary confinement for more than eight months. Prison regulations require corrections staff to bring in the medical team to do a baseline evaluation within 48 hours of learning that someone has started a hunger strike, Regan said. Six days into the strike, no one had come to evaluate Muhammad's condition.\n\nAccording to Regan and Chris Kuttruff, another of Muhammad's supporters, at least eight incarcerated people filed grievances against corrections staff for their treatment of Muhammad during the incident.\n\n\"There are several cases that have kind of been a bit overblown when Black people actually engage in more radical forms of protest,\" Regan said. \"That's not to say it's not a crime, but when you compare the punishments those folks got to what he got, it's pretty stark and distinct.\"\n\nAs a veteran with PTSD, Muhammad's treatment in prison will make it harder for him to reenter society, Regan said.\n\n\"He served the country and he already really suffered through one episode of his life that has given him some of the mental health issues that may have contributed to the acts that he's actually been convicted of,\" she said.\n\n\"For the racist prison system to intentionally punish him in ways that are going to cause additional mental health impacts and just make it that much harder for him to come out and be a productive and lovely member of our community is the opposite of what the prison systems say they are doing.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Meet the Riot Squad: Right-Wing Reporters Whose Viral Videos Are Used to Smear BLM\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nIn the year since George Floyd's murder, conservative news outlets have endlessly hyped distorted stories about violence at Black Lives Matter protests. Key videos they used come from a tight-knit group of eight young journalists.\n\nWritten by Robert Mackey . Video by Robert Mackey and Travis Mannon .\n\nThe sound of glass breaking, on Inauguration Day in Portland, Oregon, was music to the ears of Julio Rosas, a young video journalist.\n\nThat's because Rosas, who works for the right-wing website Townhall, specializes in shooting viral video of mayhem at left-wing protests. On this day, black-clad, anti-capitalist protesters were attacking a Democratic Party office, and Rosas managed to record them from close range without being spotted.\n\nWithin minutes of the vandalism, by a handful of activists who broke off from a small #J20 march , Rosas posted his video on Twitter , where it racked up over 1 million views.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Julio_Rosas11/status/1352042522868998144\n\nWith his tweet, Rosas had also beaten his friend and rival, Jorge Ventura of the conservative Daily Caller, by six minutes.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/VenturaReport/status/1352044041131577345\n\nVentura, who went undercover to infiltrate the protest movement in Portland last summer, got less dramatic footage of this incident, but his 15-second clip, which showed that there were more people photographing the destruction in Portland than taking part in it, was still seen by more than 100,000 people.\n\nWhen Rosas joined Laura Ingraham on Fox News that night, giving national attention to what would have been, before the era of viral video, just a local news story , Ventura held the camera for the live shot.\n\nWe know that because a third member of the conservative protest paparazzi that descended on Portland that day, Newsmax contributor James Klüg, gave viewers of his video blog a behind-the-scenes look at how the viral video-to-Fox News pipeline works.\n\nOn the air, Ingraham attributed the destruction to \"antifa thugs,\" using the right-wing shorthand that lumps everyone with left-of-center politics into one undifferentiated mass. Rosas, who was standing in front of a Circle-A - a symbol for anarchism, not anti-fascism - that had been spray-painted beside the ruined front door of the Democratic Party office, made no effort to correct her.\n\n\"The antifa groups here, they do not like Biden just as much they don't like Trump,\" he said. \"They just hate America in general.\" (In fact, Rose City Antifa, the Portland group that helped revive the Nazi-era concept of anti-fascism in the United States, released a statement making clear that this attack on the Democratic office was not the work of anti-fascists but rather of anarchists and anti-capitalists. \"While many of the people involved may consider themselves antifascists in ideology,\" the activists said, \"we narrowly define antifascism as actions taken to oppose the insurgent right-wing.\")\n\nAs a reporter focused on protest movements, I've been studying video of chaotic events at demonstrations for more than a decade, since I live-blogged Iran's disputed election and then covered the Arab Spring and Occupy protests, from the United States to Brazil . And one thing I've learned is that, whether a clip was posted online by a witness in Cairo or Kenosha, it always helps to know who shot the video, and why.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nOver the past year, as I researched viral clips of contested incidents at protests against racist policing and far-right movements, I found that I was coming across the names of the same handful of videographers again and again. At protests in Minneapolis, Dallas, Seattle, Portland, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Washington, Louisville, Philadelphia, and Kenosha, Wisconsin, I discovered that many of the most viral clips were shot by a handful of field reporters for right-wing sites or freelancers with conservative politics.\n\nRosas and Ventura are not household names, but it's important to understand their reporting, because they are members of an informal club of right-wing video journalists who roam from city to city, feeding the conservative media's hunger for images of destruction and violence on the margins of left-wing protests.\n\nIn the year since George Floyd's murder by Derek Chauvin was documented in horrifying detail on the cellphone of a 17-year-old witness , Darnella Frazier, right-wing news outlets and politicians have been desperate to draw attention away from those unbearable images by focusing instead on viral videos of unrest at racial justice protests. That's been a boon for the careers of conservative video journalists like Rosas, Ventura, and a half-dozen of their friends, who jokingly call themselves the #RiotSquad in Instagram selfies and podcast banter .\n\nThe impact of their work is hard to overstate. Even as they remain relatively unknown, this tight-knit group has produced many of the most viral videos of Black Lives Matter protests over the past year. And those images have helped create the false impression, relentlessly driven home by Fox News and Republican politicians, that the nationwide wave of protests that erupted after George Floyd was killed was nothing but an excuse for mindless rioting.\n\nLast July, Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, screened video of violence at protests in Portland, Ore., to justify federal intervention in the city.\n\nThat's not to say that rioting never happens; it clearly does. And even if you believe that \" a riot is the language of the unheard ,\" it is undeniable that looting and arson did scar some communities where anger over racist policing spiraled out of control.\n\nBut the broader picture is that Black Lives Matter protests have been overwhelmingly peaceful .\n\nConservatives like to mock anyone who says that, usually by pointing to isolated images of chaos, like those recorded by the Riot Squad, or by cherry-picking misleading data. Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, recently cited data showing that more than 500 racial justice protests turned violent in the United States last year. But Johnson failed to let readers of his Wall Street Journal opinion piece know that the same researchers - from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project - counted nearly 10,000 more Black Lives Matter protests that were entirely peaceful. According to the researchers, there was no looting, arson, or violence of any kind at 94 percent of the protests associated with Black Lives Matter. And in many cases in which there was violence, it was inflicted on protesters, either by the police or right-wing vigilantes.\n\nA screenshot of data on 2020 protests in the United States from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project.\n\nThat's the wide-angle view of reality missed by conservatives obsessively viewing close-up images of violence, like those shot by the Riot Squad and played on a loop on Fox News and other outlets even further to the right.\n\n\"Since the George Floyd protests, conservative media outlets including Fox News (particularly Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity), One America News, Glenn Beck's BlazeTV, and right-wing YouTubers have been covering Black Lives Matter and other left-wing protests daily, specifically highlighting instances of violence, fighting, and property damage,\" media scholar Joan Donovan observed in the MIT Technology Review last summer. \"This coverage has come to dominate the right-wing narrative in a new way, flipping the script to suggest that Black protesters - demonstrating because they fear police violence - are themselves a threat to white people.\"\n\n\"By using riot porn to incite fear in white people,\" Donovan added, \"the right-wing media ecosystem converts the real pain experienced by Black Americans into fodder for deranged, paranoid fantasies that white vigilantes must take up the functions of the police.\"\n\nTo understand how this works - and how a group of just eight young journalists have had such an outsize impact on what millions of Americans know about the protests against police violence and systemic racism - it's useful to take a closer look at some of the most-watched clips posted online in the past year.\n\nThe first and most obvious way that some of the Riot Squad journalists distort reality is through selective, misleading edits of the footage they shoot.\n\nAt a protest in Dallas five days after George Floyd was killed, a core member of the Riot Squad, Elijah Schaffer of Beck's BlazeTV, posted a brief clip that showed the brutal beating of a white man by a group of mainly Black protesters.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ElijahSchaffer/status/1266925493384736769\n\nThe graphic, disturbing footage was viewed more than 35 million times on Twitter.\n\nWhat Schaffer knew, but concealed from viewers of his edited clip, was that the man he described as an innocent victim of the mob had, moments earlier, threatened protesters with a machete.\n\nVideo recorded by another witness showed that the protesters responded by hurling stones at the man, who then shrieked and charged at them , swinging the blade wildly and cutting one of them, before the others disarmed him and took bloody revenge.\n\nYoel Measho, a filmmaker who took part in the protest, posted that video of the man's wild charge on Snapchat, along with a second clip of a protester displaying the machete as protest medics gave the man first aid . (Measho later shared both clips with The Intercept.)\n\nAfter the other videos began to circulate, Schaffer made the rest of his footage available to broadcasters, which showed that he had recorded but edited out the man's aggressive behavior.\n\nA Dallas police spokesperson told me the day after the incident that the man had indeed confronted protesters with the machete before being assaulted. The owners of the nearby bar the man reportedly set out to defend confirmed in a phone interview that the business was not looted by the protesters or anyone else. (On a conservative podcast the following month, a man who said he was the victim of the beating confirmed that he did initiate the conflict by confronting the protesters with a carbon steel machete \"shaped like an old Roman gladius,\" which he had mentioned on Twitter before the incident.)\n\nAmong those misled by Schaffer's edit was then-President Donald Trump, who boosted it on Twitter and then echoed false claims that the man had died, as federal agents were unleashed on peaceful protesters outside the White House.\n\n\"Innocent people have been savagely beaten,\" Trump told reporters , \"like the young man in Dallas, Texas, who was left dying in the street.\" (On the night of the attack, Schaffer had passed on the false rumor that the man had died.)\n\nIn the months that followed, Schaffer's misleading clip was used again and again to smear Black Lives Matter. Johnson showed the video at a meeting of the Senate Homeland Security Committee he chaired last summer, presenting it as evidence of what he called \"the reality\" that protests against racist policing \"unleash anarchy.\" The clip was also included in a video prepared by Kyle Rittenhouse's legal team, and then screened by Trump's lawyers at his impeachment trial, as part of a misleading montage of protest violence , much of it recorded by Riot Squad videographers, which they falsely accused Democratic officials of having encouraged.\n\nAt the first post-election rally of Trump dead-enders in Washington in November, another Riot Squad videographer, Schaffer's friend and former roommate Kalen D'Almeida, used the same technique to mislead millions of viewers.\n\nThe viral clip D'Almeida posted on Twitter (where it was viewed over 3 million times before he deleted it) and Instagram (as the second clip in this slideshow ) showed an older white Trump supporter being punched in the face from behind by a young, Black counterprotester.\n\nThe video, which lingered on the man's bloody face , was quickly retweeted by Andy Ngo and shared by Trump , with the comment: \"Human Radical Left garbage did this.\"\n\nThat video was then edited into an attack ad against Democrats that Trump screened for his fans at a rally in Georgia on December 5, much to D'Almeida's delight .\n\nhttps://twitter.com/FromKalen/status/1335421455190863872\n\nBut footage of the same clash recorded by Ventura showed that D'Almeida had edited his clip to hide the fact that the Trump supporter had started the fight, by first violently shoving one anti-Trump protester to the ground and then pushing and threatening to punch several others.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/VenturaReport/status/1327728625723060224\n\nWhen D'Almeida later posted more of his own footage of the incident , it became clear that he had also recorded the start of the confrontation but chose to edit that out to make the white man look like an innocent victim of the Black protester.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/FromKalen/status/1327754319437946882\n\nLike the beating in Dallas that Elijah Schaffer witnessed, the punch that felled the Trump supporter in front of D'Almeida was obviously a vicious blow. But through selective, misleading editing, D'Almeida contributed in the same way to the sense of innocent victimhood and white resentment nurtured day and night by conservative media outlets and right-wing politicians like Trump.\n\nThree months earlier, D'Almeida had posted a meme on Instagram mocking the mainstream media for supposedly distorting protest coverage. The meme, which uses two panels from a comic strip by the right-wing Colombian cartoonist Jhon Alexander Guerra , shows a TV news reporter telling a cameraperson not to film while a protester is throwing a rock at a police officer. When the police officer then chases the protester with his nightstick raised, the reporter tells the cameraperson to start shooting, because \"now it's news.\"\n\nA screenshot of a meme adopted from panels by the right-wing, anti-feminist Colombian cartoonist Jhon Alexander Guerra, which was shared by Kalen D'Almeida on Instagram last August.\n\nIt was no accident that Rosas and Ventura chose to spend Inauguration Day this year in Portland. The liberal city's strong anti-fascist protest culture, in a metro area surrounded by ultraconservative exurbs, has for years provided right-wing video journalists with a steady stream of skirmishes to record and exaggerate.\n\nIn July, for instance, Ventura and the Riot Squad's Drew Hernandez, a right-wing YouTuber , both recorded an angry confrontation between Portland police officers and a Black, female protester who objected to being shoved forcefully by three officers.\n\nBLM PROTESTER TO PORTLAND COP: \"I hope someone kills your whole f*cken family\" pic.twitter.com/ocVU0mHyi1\n\n- Drew Hernandez (@DrewHLive) July 12, 2020\n\n\"God damn it! I'm disabled, I can't walk any faster!\" the woman could be heard saying in the viral clip Hernandez recorded.\n\n\"Go!\" one officer replied.\n\n\"I hope someone kills your whole fucking family,\" the enraged woman responded. \"I hope they kill you too. I hope someone burns down your whole precinct with all y'all inside. Can't wait to see it.\"\n\nHernandez's clip was immediately boosted on Twitter by Ngo and even screened for the White House press corps by press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, in a montage of Portland unrest intended to justify federal intervention in the city. (The montage also included video shot by Ventura and his boss, Richie McGinniss.)\n\nKayleigh McEnany White House Press Secretary just played two  videos from my reporting on the ground in #Portland @RichieMcGinniss reporting was also featured in today's briefing! pic.twitter.com/6aQiQ8GNGR\n\n- Jorge Ventura Media (@VenturaReport) July 24, 2020\n\nThe White House, however, edited the Hernandez clip for McEnany's presentation, removing the start of the confrontation to conceal from reporters that the protester's comments were in reaction to having been roughly treated.\n\nThe following month, D'Almeida recorded a shocking act of violence on a Portland street, five blocks from the main protest site.\n\nTypically dressed in black to blend in, D'Almeida describes himself on Instagram as an \" Undercover Exposé Artist ,\" making no secret that his aim in filming protests against police brutality is to capture footage that can be used to discredit anti-fascists or Black Lives Matter activists.\n\nWhile he began that effort in Seattle , D'Almeida finally hit the jackpot in August, when he recorded, on both his cellphone and body camera , graphic video of a white man being kicked in the face and knocked out by a Black man who provided security at Portland protests.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/FromKalen/status/1295242722240995328\n\nHernandez and Ventura were also on hand to capture gruesome video of the aftermath, as the injured man, who was accused by his attacker of trying to run people down with his truck, lay unconscious and bleeding.\n\nThe video of the victim shared by Hernandez, with a caption attributing the violence to \"BLM militants,\" went even more viral.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/DrewHLive/status/1295233180899790850\n\nThe incident got so much attention on Fox News that the culprit, Marquise Love, who was later jailed for the assault, became a symbol of Black Lives Matter for many of the network's viewers.\n\nThat this brutal attack had not taken place during a protest, but after one, and at another location, where a long series of confusing, overlapping arguments among people drinking and smoking outside a nearby 7-Eleven escalated to violence was not something D'Almeida tried to explain to viewers of his video.\n\nHernandez later tried to connect the attack to the protests by claiming that the victim, Adam Haner, had been assaulted for coming to the defense of a trans woman who was assaulted by \"Black Lives Matter protesters.\" In fact, a careful review of raw footage posted online later by Hernandez shows that the incident started after Love, the self-appointed security guard, left the site of a protest and encountered Haner drinking beer outside the 7-Eleven. The two men eventually took opposite sides in a nasty personal dispute there that had nothing to do with politics or the demonstrations.\n\nWhat Hernandez left out of the narrative he shared with Fox News is that his footage shows that the dispute between Love and the trans woman at the 7-Eleven only escalated after that person took out a baton and threatened the security guard with it.\n\nLast August, all eight Riot Squad videographers converged on Kenosha, Wisconsin, to cover protests that gave way to arson and destruction following the police shooting of Jacob Blake.\n\nThe unrest also prompted members of a libertarian militia to take to the streets.\n\nAlmost everything we know about how one member of that militia, Kyle Rittenhouse, ended up killing two men in Kenosha that week comes from the Riot Squad reporters, who were there to document violence by anti-police protesters but instead recorded video of a pro-police vigilante shooting demonstrators.\n\nOn the second night of protests in Kenosha, Ventura and Schaffer, who was disguised in a Black Lives Matter shirt, came across protesters arguing with a libertarian militia guarding a gas station.\n\nBoth recorded a tense political debate between a young, Black protester and a heavily armed militia leader wearing a tactical vest with an embroidered patch showing a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle and the slogan \"Cowabunga It Is,\" a reference to a Reddit meme .\n\n\"F*** you, you ain't with us\" woman yells at armed man who is attempting to stop the mob from looting and vandalizing #Kenosha businesses pic.twitter.com/FkDlqz9w4N\n\n- Jorge Ventura Media (@VenturaReport) August 25, 2020\n\n\"That attempted murder of that citizen was wrong,\" the white militia member said of the shooting of Blake. \"And I'm all for protests, but you can't be destroying your neighbor's houses and businesses,\" he added.\n\n\"This shit, the fucking value of property, has nothing to do with the value of life,\" the protester shouted at him. \"If you value this shit more than you value people, you're not with us! Fuck you! You're not with us!\"\n\nIn his Periscope livestream from the same location, Schaffer gushed over the vigilantes.\n\nKenosha Riots Night 2 https://t.co/dtg2rkIMwE\n\n- E (@ElijahSchaffer) August 25, 2020\n\n\"What do you think about vigilantism where the police are not able to protect businesses, so citizens are coming in, and they're protecting businesses themselves?\" Schaffer asked a bystander.\n\n\"I feel a hundred percent,\" the man replied.\n\n\"I'm with it too. I'm jiving with it,\" Schaffer agreed. \"I like that shit. That shit's tight. Hell, yeah. These people are like God, right here. They're protectors.\"\n\nTwo blocks away, Ventura and Schaffer joined Rosas in front of a burning office furniture store , which provided the perfect backdrop for all three to record dispatches from the scene.\n\nIn his stand-up report , Rosas credited the \"armed citizens\" for stopping the ransacking of a car dealership and threw in a dig at the MSNBC anchor Ali Velshi, who had been accused by conservatives of downplaying arson while reporting from Minneapolis on the first George Floyd protests.\n\n\"What's up everybody, so right now we're still here in Kenosha,\" Rosas said. \"Riots are still going on right now where the curfew is still technically in effect, but as you can see, a lot of the people are still out and about. Obviously a burning building behind me, or, as Ali Velshi would say, not an unruly protest.\"\n\nWhen it was Schaffer's turn to use the same burning building as a backdrop, he let viewers in on the secret that he was just pretending to sympathize with the protesters in order to expose them.\n\n\"My name's Elijah Schaffer, reporting for BlazeTV, undercover, here in Kenosha,\" he signed off. \"Thank you again so much for watching. Have a great rest of the night and may God bless the United States of America.\"\n\nWithin days, that stand-up was featured in a BlazeTV commercial for Schaffer's show. \"America's streets have become a war zone,\" a narrator intoned in the ad, \"and Elijah Schaffer is right in the middle of it.\" The ad copy promised that Schaffer would bring subscribers \"what the mainstream media won't show you\": endless images of fire and property damage, along with the young conservative's \"thought-provoking perspective.\"\n\nAs he reported on racial justice protests last summer, Schaffer's commentary on the movement against police brutality became increasingly unhinged. \"Ultimately,\" Schaffer tweeted in September, \"I believe BLM, if left unchecked, would eventually produce genocidal outcomes.\"\n\nThe next night, Schaffer and the Daily Caller's head of video, Richie McGinniss, both interviewed a 17-year-old who had joined the militia: Rittenhouse.\n\nI interviewed the alleged shooter before the violence started.\n\nFull video coming soon: pic.twitter.com/G3dVOJozN7\n\n- Richie?McG? (@RichieMcGinniss) August 26, 2020\n\nAs that night wore on, protesters eventually tired of being policed by vigilantes and let the militia know. As tensions between the two groups escalated, video shot by Rosas and the Daily Caller's Shelby Talcott showed the three men Rittenhouse would shoot that night - Gaige Grosskreutz, Joseph Rosenbaum, and Anthony Huber - in the middle of the heated dispute.\n\nRioters are getting into confrontations with armed citizens who are out here to prevent looting and destruction to businesses. pic.twitter.com/f65YkP24kG\n\n- Julio Rosas (@Julio_Rosas11) August 26, 2020\n\nAfter Schaffer interviewed Rittenhouse , he went to a nearby car dealership that was being vandalized. Moments later, Rittenhouse ran into that car lot , pursued by Rosenbaum, a protester enraged by the teenage vigilante's presence.\n\nVideo recorded by a protest livestreamer showed that McGinniss, who was following Rittenhouse when the chase began, was running just behind Rosenbaum with his iPhone pointed at the two men when Rittenhouse turned and fired four shots, striking the protester from point-blank range.\n\nBecause McGinniss was just a few feet behind Rosenbaum when Rittenhouse opened fire and appeared to be filming, the fact that he released no video of the shooting that night led some observers to wonder if he, or the Daily Caller, might have decided to suppress or delete footage that could be used to convict the young right-wing vigilante.\n\nHernandez captured the shooting from across the lot and then continued filming as he moved in closer.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/DrewHLive/status/1298484404918972417\n\nWhile McGinniss ripped off his Black Lives Matter T-shirt and tried to stop Rosenbaum's bleeding with it, Rittenhouse ran past Hernandez, calling a friend instead of 911.\n\nClose-up images of the scramble to save Rosenbaum, recorded by Hernandez and Schaffer, showed that McGinniss's cellphone, which was in his left hand as he administered first aid with his right, was in record mode at the time.\n\nThe phone's engaged red record button, the presence of a white shutter button on the screen's lower right, and the red block around the time code at the top are three signs that an iPhone is recording, and all are visible on McGinniss's phone in the video recorded by Schaffer and Hernandez.\n\nA screenshot from Drew Hernandez's video of Richie McGinniss holding his cellphone in his left hand while trying to give first aid to Joseph Rosenbaum, less than a minute after he was shot by Kyle Rittenhouse.\n\nThat fueled speculation that McGinniss might have withheld incriminating visual evidence to shield Rittenhouse, who quickly became a hero to many of the Daily Caller's far-right readers and was defended by the site's founder, Tucker Carlson.\n\nMcGinniss, however, told The Intercept that while he thought he had recorded video of the shooting, he discovered later that he had accidentally hit the wrong button on his iPhone and it did not start recording until after the shots were fired.\n\nAs Rittenhouse ran from the lot, Talcott filmed protesters shouting that he had shot someone. Moments later, Rittenhouse tripped and fell in front of Rosas , who recorded the teen vigilante shooting at the men who tried to disarm him.\n\nRosas, who is in the Marine Reserves, quickly took cover, but another young video journalist, Brendan Gutenschwager, ran past him and got the clearest images of Rittenhouse shooting Huber, who died of his wounds, and Grosskreutz, who was badly injured but survived.\n\nAs Rittenhouse rose to his feet, with Huber sprawled on the street in front of him and Grosskreutz retreating, Gutenschwager could be seen just behind the gunman, filming from the sidewalk.\n\nAfter shooting Anthony Huber, foreground, and Gaige Grosskreutz, left, Kyle Rittenhouse kneeled in the street in Kenosha, Wisconsin on Aug. 25, 2020 as Brendan Gutenschwager, right, recorded the scene on video from the sidewalk behind him.

Hernandez described Rosenbaum as a \"rioter,\" while Schaffer made the false claim that the man had been shot \" while looting a car shop .\"\n\nOn his BlazeTV show later that week, Schaffer continued to attack the victims , falsely accusing them of committing crimes and praising the right-wing vigilante for killing them.\n\n\"I really don't have sympathy for them. I just do not. They were rioters, they were vandalizing the place. And, do crimes, get rekt, that's what I have to say,\" Schaffer told his viewers. \"I think them attacking Kyle Rittenhouse, with a skateboard, a pistol, and trying to jump him is what makes them deserve to be shot. I think Kyle's been memed into history.\"\n\n\"Kyle is a hero in my eyes,\" Schaffer added. \"Next time commies come up on a patriot like that, watch out.\"\n\nGutenschwager is the only Riot Squad videographer who is not either employed by a conservative news site or openly right-wing. But before he started filming protests, Gutenschwager traveled the country as something of a Donald Trump groupie , attending at least 24 Trump rallies before the 2018 midterms and describing them as \"exhilarating\" on his video blog.\n\nGutenschwager's footage of left-wing protesters behaving badly has earned him invitations from Ingraham to appear on Fox News , but he promises fans of his Twitter feed who provide financial support that they can rely on him to report \"the unbiased truth from the ground.\" He also sells his footage through the news agency Storyful , which is owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., but licenses video from social media video to broadcasters across the political spectrum.\n\nEven so, Gutenschwager's video of mayhem at left-wing protests is frequently used by right-wing outlets and meme creators to smear demonstrators.\n\nFor instance, when Gutenschwager got viral video of a left-wing protester being set on fire by a Molotov cocktail in Portland last summer, it quickly turned into a right-wing meme mocking the protester's pain and was retweeted by Trump's social media caddy, Dan Scavino.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/BGOnTheScene/status/1302476141219905536\n\nPeaceful protestors in SE Portland this evening... https://t.co/2MIGuQkhNz https://t.co/nU2BVycLqX\n\n- Dan Scavino Jr.??? (@DanScavino) September 6, 2020\n\nWhen the Riot Squad rolled in to Louisville, Kentucky, in September to cover protests over the decision to not charge the police officer who shot Breonna Taylor with killing her, Gutenschwager was alongside Talcott and Rosas.\n\nAll three recorded a scene that quickly became the focus of huge attention on the right: protesters picking up banners and shields from a rented U-Haul truck.\n\nUnloading the riot shields from the Uhaul #Louisville #BreonnaTaylor pic.twitter.com/F9KqzRB5lM\n\n- Brendan Gutenschwager (@BGOnTheScene) September 23, 2020\n\nWhile the BLM crowd was marching in Louisville, a U Haul truck pulled up with shields and supplies for the group to use. pic.twitter.com/VestCPdyTk\n\n- Julio Rosas (@Julio_Rosas11) September 23, 2020\n\nThe fact that left-wing protesters prepare to demonstrate should hardly be surprising, but the Riot Squad video of the U-Haul reignited baseless right-wing conspiracy theories that Black Lives Matter protesters must be secretly employed by George Soros.\n\nAs the three video clips racked up more than 11 million total views on Twitter and flooded conservative networks , Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, and Ingraham all demanded to know who had rented the truck - as if only a billionaire could afford a U-Haul.\n\nSpeaking to Glenn Beck after Rittenhouse killed two protesters in Kenosha, Schaffer scoffed at the notion that the Riot Squad's reporting was biased and complained that Twitter, in its breaking news section, had featured reports from national newspapers whose writers did not witness the shootings instead of the conservative video journalists who did.\n\n\"The people who were there, I would say this: Even if you don't like their commentary, video evidence does not lie ,\" Schaffer said. Referring by name to Ventura, Rosas, Talcott, McGinniss, D'Almeida, and Hernandez, Schaffer told Beck that this group of people was \"just eager to show America what is actually happening.\"\n\nSchaffer, who was caught distorting video of the news event he witnessed in Dallas, was not the ideal spokesperson for the argument that the personal politics of a video journalist should be ignored. But it is true that several of the Riot Squad reporters are not as overtly partisan as Schaffer, D'Almeida, or Hernandez.\n\nMcGinniss, who appeared in a reality show about the 2016 election as an undecided voter, worked for the far-right pundit Mark Levin but says he campaigned for Obama in 2008. Talcott denounced the January 6 attack on the Capitol as a riot, and wrote on Instagram last June that she had witnessed \"incredible scenes of moving, peaceful protests as well as violent anarchy\" while \"reporting on a historic #BlackLivesMatter milestone.\" Then again, she also spoke at the far-right Conservative Political Action Conference this year, in conversation with Rosas.\n\nAnd while Gutenschwager once complained of anti-Trump comments in an official New York University publication after he dropped out of the school, his video of the Proud Boys burning a Black Lives Matter banner they stole from the Asbury United Methodist Church was even featured in an impassioned denunciation of the attack on the Black church from Chris Hayes on MSNBC.\n\nBut Joan Donovan, the media researcher, argues that the way footage of violence and disorder at left-wing protests is used by right-wing news outlets, and consumed by conservative viewers, is more important than the personal views of the journalists who hold the cameras.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nBy focusing on sensational, graphic images of violence on the margins of protests and entirely ignoring peaceful demonstrators, even members of the Riot Squad who are not as far right as Schaffer have contributed to a political project: the right-wing media's campaign to portray racial justice protests as anarchic and dangerous.\n\nWhat's more, as Donovan wrote last summer, viewing what she calls \"riot porn\" often \"enrages and traumatizes\" those who watch it. Being bombarded with viral videos of violence at left-wing protests might even have motivated some reactionaries to take to the streets, either in anti-anti-fascist fight clubs, like the Proud Boys, or armed militia groups, like the one Rittenhouse joined in Kenosha.\n\n\"Fed into a media ecosystem with an established bias toward highlighting violence and rioting, the videos have mobilized white militia and vigilante groups to take up arms against Black Lives Matter and 'antifa' protesters,\" Donovan wrote. \"This feedback circuit has created a self-fulfilling cycle where white vigilantes feel justified in menacing and physically attacking racial justice protesters - and inspire others to do the same.\"\n\nRittenhouse's legal team made a similar argument in a strange promotional video laying out his claim to have acted in self-defense. The video suggested that his thinking was influenced by episodes of violence at left-wing protests that he'd seen on video.\n\n\"Did Kyle Rittenhouse have reason to believe his life was in danger?\" the video's narrator asks at a key moment. That question is answered with a montage of viral videos of violence from earlier in the summer, including D'Almeida's video of the man being kicked in the face in Portland, Hernandez's video of a Black woman tackling a white woman just before that incident, and Schaffer's video of the man being pummeled in Dallas.\n\nThe sequence ends with video of Aaron \"Jay\" Danielson, a member of the far-right group Patriot Prayer who was gunned down by an avowed anti-fascist, Michael Reinoehl, in Portland. But the suggestion that Danielson's murder might have contributed to Rittenhouse's fear of left-wing violence is clearly false, since that killing, the first by a self-described anti-fascist in 27 years , took place on August 29, four days after Rittenhouse shot the three protesters in Kenosha, killing two of them.\n\nIn other words, even when the Riot Squad videographers accurately record unrest they witness, their selective focus on unrest after police shootings helps conservative outlets demonize Black Lives Matter protesters.\n\nFor a textbook example of how this works, look at how the Riot Squad covered a racial justice protest in Philadelphia last October, a week before the election.\n\nProtests erupted in West Philadelphia after a bystander filmed the fatal police shooting of Walter Wallace Jr., a Black man whose family said he was experiencing a mental health crisis.\n\nThat night, after the police clashed with protesters in the neighborhood, there was some vandalism and looting , which Wallace's family forcefully condemned .\n\nThe next night, Schaffer , Rosas , Ventura , Talcott , and McGinniss were all on hand to film protesters rallying peacefully at a park in West Philadelphia and then march to a police station. They filmed a tense face-off between protesters and a line of officers outside the station, but since there was no violence, only one of their clips got any traction on social media: video of a woman screaming a racial epithet at the police.\n\nLater that night, there were minor skirmishes in West Philadelphia, but by then the Riot Squad had left the protest and driven across the city to cover a more telegenic scene : the mass looting of a shopping center 10 miles away.\n\nBREAKING - Hundreds of looters break into stores on a strip mall on Aramingo Avenue in #Philadelphia pic.twitter.com/FnyEJwzReY\n\n- Jorge Ventura Media (@VenturaReport) October 28, 2020\n\nAs Talcott and Rosas filmed inside a ransacked Five Below discount store there, looters could be heard telling Schaffer to stop recording them and then seen punching him in the mouth.\n\nStores being looted in Philadelphia while police are guarding the Walmart that was looted earlier. pic.twitter.com/R84NUaPk4W\n\n- Julio Rosas (@Julio_Rosas11) October 28, 2020\n\nThat video of Schaffer being assaulted was viewed over 1 million times, as was a clip in which he wrongly identified his assailants as \"Black Lives Matter protesters.\"\n\nPHILADELPHIA: This is the footage I was recording when BLM assaulted me.\n\nOther journalists were filming but I was the only white person in the store\n\nI do believe I was targeted for being white as they accused me of being a white supremacist\n\n& did not attack people of color pic.twitter.com/Gji7uHq0gB\n\n- E (@ElijahSchaffer) October 28, 2020\n\n\"What happened,\" Schaffer told viewers, \"is I just went into the Five Below to see what was going on with some of the looting, and I was jumped by the Black Lives Matter protesters, who immediately started punching and kicking me.\"\n\nIn fact, as Talcott later acknowledged in an interview on \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" the videographers had to drive 30 minutes away from the protest by Wallace's neighbors, in West Philadelphia, to film at the retail center in another part of the city, where there were no protesters, only looters taking advantage of the overwhelmed police force.\n\nBut the viral video of the attack on Schaffer struck a nerve with conservative viewers and helped make the looting in one part of the city, not the peaceful protest in another, the focus of days of misleading, politicized coverage on Fox.\n\nFollowing Schaffer's lead, Carlson even referred to the looters in Philadelphia as \"more than a thousand BLM activists - Joe Biden voters.\"\n\nWhile their work is mainly used to undermine left-wing protesters, Kenosha isn't the only place Riot Squad videographers have captured images of right-wing political violence.\n\nAfter a pro-Trump rally in Washington in December, D'Almeida, Gutenschawger, and Talcott recorded a mob of Proud Boys ripping Black Lives Matter banners from Black churches and trashing or burning them.\n\nThis happened right in front of me. https://t.co/GWL0KwhYlw\n\n- Kalen D'Almeida (@fromkalen_old) December 14, 2020\n\nProud Boys tear down another Black Lives Matter board from the Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church #DC #MarchForTrump #DefendDC #ProudBoys pic.twitter.com/ml1TbhV98Q\n\n- Brendan Gutenschwager (@BGOnTheScene) December 13, 2020\n\nAnd on January 6, Gutenschwager's viral video of Proud Boys member Dominic Pezzola using a stolen police riot shield to break a window and gain entry into the Capitol was one of the iconic images of the day.

(@RichieMcGinniss) January 6, 2021\n\nStill, on Fox News and elsewhere inside the conservative media bubble, all this video evidence of right-wing violence was not used to vilify the rioters the way that clips of far less significant events at left-wing protests were last summer.\n\nWhile the Riot Squad video journalists are still mostly unknown to people who are not addicted to Fox News, some of their faces have become familiar to left-wing activists . That's led to the violent suppression of their reporting on more than one occasion in recent months.\n\nAt an anti-eviction protest in Detroit in April, several activists tried to stop Gutenschwager from filming, blocking his lens and ordering him to leave. As Gutenschwager objected, one of them, a man wearing a pin with an anti-fascist symbol on it, replied: \"Get out of here you fucking Nazi.\"\n\nhttps://twitter.com/BGOnTheScene/status/1380960195065614343\n\nWhen Gutenschwager asked what he had done, another activist, who was livestreaming the protest himself, replied: \"Dude, you were in the Capitol!\"\n\nhttps://twitter.com/BGOnTheScene/status/1380960195065614343\n\nMoments later, an activist photographer got in Gutenschwager's face and told him: \"You're not fucking welcome here.\"\n\n\"You're not f***ing welcome here.\" A man wearing a Press patch then accosts me and tries to force me to leave, as the crowd marched through Greektown in Detroit #Detroit #DetroitProtests pic.twitter.com/fIX7iAxM7L\n\n- Brendan Gutenschwager (@BGOnTheScene) April 10, 2021\n\nThe left-wing livestreamer then made it plain to his own viewers that he knew Gutenschwager's work by referring to him, imprecisely, by his Twitter handle. \"So this is BGOonTheScene. He's not welcome here,\" the man said, as he filmed Gutenschwager from close range. \"He's not welcome here and he continues to be here, 'cause this guy was in the Capitol building on the 6th.\"\n\nAccording to Gutenschwager, he was then slammed into a barrier by another man, who put him in a chokehold, bloodied his mouth, and hurled his camera over a fence.\n\nA man rammed me against a concrete fence and barricade, bloodying my mouth and elbow as well as putting me in a chokehold while stealing my camera.

You're not welcome here,\" a rally organizer with a bullhorn told D'Almeida. \"How about you leave. We don't want lying journalists like you. Get out of here, scum.\"\n\nD'Almeida, who had spent months posing as a supporter of left-wing protests in order to undermine them, tried to signal to this crowd that he was on their side. \"Does anyone want to look me up right now?\" he said. \"My name's Kalen D'Almeida, I'm a reporter. I've been retweeted by Donald Trump.\"\n\nWhen one right-wing protester asked who D'Almeida worked for, he named the news site he founded with two graduates of a Christian college outside Los Angeles. \"Scriberr News,\" D'Almeida said. \"We're out of Fountain Valley, we're nonpartisan.\"\n\n\"Nonpartisan? What does that mean?\" the man with the bullhorn asked skeptically.\n\nIn April, D'Almeida ran into more serious trouble when he was recognized by people on the left who are familiar with his work while livestreaming a Black Lives Matter march for Daunte Wright in Los Angeles.\n\nAfter one protester snatched D'Almedia's cellphone, video from a left-wing livestreamer showed that other marchers surrounded him and jeered at him to leave. \"Nazis go home! Nazis fuck off!\" protesters chanted as D'Almeida was surrounded. \"Get the fuck out of here you piece of shit!\"\n\nD'Almeida was then punched and briefly knocked out , before a female protester intervened. Another undercover right-wing videographer, Tomas Morales, showed that before the woman sent D'Almeida on his way, she scolded him for undermining the protest movement.\n\n\"Listen, people are fighting for their fucking lives, this is not a joke. Leave us the fuck alone! Look at my face. I saved you this time,\" the woman told D'Almeida .\n\nAs he rose uneasily to his feet and tried to get his bearings, the woman pushed D'Almeida away. \"Get the fuck out of here,\" she told him. \"'Cause this is your last chance. You're lucky. Get out of here.\"\n\nOne left-wing activist suggested later that D'Almeida had brought the attack on himself by acting more like an undercover political operative looking for dirt on the protesters than a truly nonpartisan journalist. \"Don't be a fucking fascist and this shit wouldn't happen, Kalen,\" the activist tweeted at D'Almeida . \"Fascism is an extremely poor life choice.\"\n\nThe next day, left-wing activists in Portland assaulted a well-regarded local video journalist - apparently for failing to accede to demands to \"protect\" protesters who wanted to conceal their identities from right-wing enemies. In Oakland that night, a left-wing blogger reported that he was harassed by protesters for just having a camera, and witnessed assaults on two other photographers.\n\nJfc man Oakland black bloc is way too touchy about cameras. Like, I get it, but if people are operating in good faith then maybe try talking to them first before just kicking their ass?

Unfortunately, videographers like D'Almeida have contributed to an atmosphere of paranoia and mistrust, making assaults on journalists more frequent. And this has also made the work of scrupulous and fair reporting on the politics that plays out on our streets much harder, and more dangerous.\n\nWAIT!

On June 7, 2020, amid the tumult of the global Black Lives Matter (BLM) uprising, a long-hated statue of the seventeenth-century slave trader Edward Colston was lassoed with ropes and pulled off its pedestal in Bristol by a crowd of hundreds of mostly young protesters.\n\nThe action made headlines around the world, but it mattered most of all to those people who were right there, in the midst of it: chanting for racial justice and then screaming with elation, exulting at the metallic clonk of the bronze statue finally hitting the ground, jeering as it was rolled along the ground, before the final giant splosh as it was dumped into the river Avon, where Colston's slave ships used to dock.\n\nThere was \"a rain of cheers\" as the statue came down, \"a standing ovation on the platform of [his] neck,\" wrote Bristolian poet Vanessa Kisuule the next day, in a poem titled \"Hollow.\" She was dazzled by the astonishing power of the crowd to achieve something they had been told repeatedly by the authorities should not and could not be done.\n\nIt was a moment of pure catharsis, generated by the righteous anger and action of the protesters, who had pulled off that magical trick of transmuting rage into joy, changing the physical fabric of Bristol, and with it themselves and the world they moved in. This is crowd alchemy, and you know it when you experience it. \"The air,\" wrote Kisuule, \"is gently throbbing with newness. Can you feel it?\"\n\nThe previous day in central London, along with squads of riot-suited, armed Territorial Support Group (TSG) officers, the Metropolitan Police had deployed the perversely antiquated military tactic of cavalry charges against the crowd of BLM protesters. The Met's mounted division select their horses for size and strength, and they can weigh up to a ton each.\n\nThey were spurred into the throng without warning - a cavalry unleashed during heavy rain, on the slippery Whitehall asphalt, against a crowd comprised largely of teenagers attending their first-ever protest. At one terrifying moment, a police horse that had unseated its rider bolted, confused, through the delicate human figures that scattered beneath it.\n\nOne protester, nineteen-year-old nursing student Jessie Tieti Mawutu, was knocked unconscious and then trampled by the horse. She was lucky to survive. The police did not offer any medical support to Mawutu, leaving that to the crowd.\n\nThe Met subsequently told her that they could not be held responsible and issued a statement blithely saying that \"the horse, which was uninjured, made its way back to the nearby stables.\" A subsequent Netpol report into the policing of the BLM protests that summer found that \"excessive use of force, including baton charges, horse charges, pepper spray and violent arrest were commonly reported and well-evidenced.\"\n\nIt was June 2020 in an uncanny Britain: the Covid-19 transmission rate was still very high, a vaccine was still six months away, and hundreds of people were still dying from the disease every day. Britain was still officially locked down - pubs and restaurants were closed, households were not allowed to mix, and offices, nonessential shops, and city centers were all deserted, as they had been for three months.\n\nAnd yet here were tens of thousands of young people on the streets of central London, bristling with righteous anger, protesting in solidarity with the murdered African American George Floyd, and denouncing Britain's own colonial history. Meanwhile far-right groups of self-appointed \"statue defenders\" gathered in equally fractious counterdemos, rucking with the police.\n\nMore often than the \"great men\" of statuary like Edward Colston, it is crowds of ordinary people who make history, although ordinary people are rarely represented on plinths in the public squares that are their natural home. The toppling of Colston's statue was a moment of intense relief that followed decades of patient local campaigning for the statue's removal, or at least its recontextualization.\n\n\"What about going through the official channels?!\" screamed the defenders of propriety and order in the aftermath of June 7, 2020. Wearied by this prevailing stupidity, campaigners explained that they had tried these official channels for years and found them to be unyielding. What they discovered instead was - and there's no way this won't sound corny, but it is undeniably true - their own collective power to effect political change.\n\nBarely a handful of people actively pulled down the statue, but they were able to do it with the support of the assembled crowd of thousands roaring them on. Over the following six months, almost seventy public tributes to slave owners and other traffickers in human misery, including plaques, statues, and street names, were modified or had explanatory plaques added.\n\nNot everyone shared the giddy joy and pride of the Bristol BLM crowd and their supporters. In response to the Colston action, anyone with any power seemed to be reading - as they always do - directly from Gustave Le Bon's nineteenth-century work The Crowd.\n\nWhat the Bristol protesters had done was \"sheer vandalism and disorder,\" said Home Secretary Priti Patel: \"mob rule, completely out of kilter with the rule of law.\" Policing Minister Kit Malthouse also called it \"mob rule.\" Prime Minister Boris Johnson declared the protests had been \"hijacked by extremists.\" Keir Starmer condemned the action as \"completely wrong.\"\n\nIn a rare but commendable outbreak of good sense from someone in his position, Avon and Somerset's (white) police chief, Andy Bennett, risked opprobrium from his paymasters and refrained from sending officers to intervene, saying he understood why it had happened: the statue had \"caused the black community quite a lot of angst.\"\n\nThe local paper got it too - the Bristol Post editor Mike Norton wrote that the city had \"been in denial for decades\" and \"brought upon itself\" the drama. In a poll of the paper's readers, 61 percent backed the protesters, with only 20 percent saying the statue should have stayed in place.\n\nFor the majority of the British press, however, this was undemocratic, unthinking thuggery. Even if you agreed with the (seemingly contentious) point that our cities should not uncritically glorify slave owners, this was the wrong way to go about it: \"LAWLESS & RECKLESS\" screamed the front page of the Daily Mail .\n\nWhen the four Colston protesters charged with criminal damage were eventually cleared by a jury of their peers, Transport Minister Grant Shapps described this due legal process as, you guessed it, \"mob rule.\" Boris Johnson said that statue-topplers should not \"change our history.\"\n\nTo Colston's heirs in the British establishment, the statue toppling was sinister, violent, and Stalinist in character, and even, apparently, a threat to freedom of speech, despite the fact it seemed to be bringing to the fore Bristolian voices that had never been heard before. \"You can't just cut history off at the mains. History is history. You can't edit or censor it,\" said former Conservative MP Nicholas Soames, the grandson of Winston Churchill, a man whose voice has never been in want of a microphone.\n\nColston's statue was sent to the bottom of the river Avon, just as tens of thousands of African people had ended up at the bottom of the Atlantic, dumped over the side of his boats. His company transported more than one hundred thousand people as slaves from West Africa to the Caribbean and the Americas, and more than twenty-thousand died along the way. Cities like Bristol, Liverpool, London, and Glasgow are garlanded with beautiful buildings, homes, and churches that were built with money made on the backs of enslaved people.\n\nThe 2020 Bristol crowd had done more than any reverential statue to educate the general public about Edward Colston's life, and about how the Britain we live in now came to be the way it is. I don't mind telling you I'd never heard of Colston or his crimes until the Bristol crowd intervened; all of their efforts were generating \"more history, not less,\" as a friend put it to me.\n\nThe actions of protest crowds have a tendency to draw out revealing opinions from pundits and politicians. What appears as an expression of \"people power\" to crowd members and supporters will be dismissed as shallow groupthink and thuggery by their enemies. To be a protester is to be smug and self-righteous, and uninterested in the serious business of political power.\n\nIndeed, the pejorative label ascribed to the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn by his detractors, notably Keir Starmer and Tony Blair, is that it consigned itself to being merely \"a party of protest,\" more interested in \"virtue signaling\" than realpolitik, and thus remained outside the norms of effective politics.\n\nThe crowd politics of public protest on the one hand, and the formal politics of bureaucracies and committee meetings on the other, are held to be in direct opposition to each other, and only the latter carries any legitimacy with the establishment.\n\nPolitical crowds are still regarded by those in power in the same way as they were in the nineteenth century. Le Bon's formative explanations of their behavior have persisted into our own age. The only real change to the narrative over time is that every politician, police commander, right-wing broadcaster, or newspaper will now pay lip service to the idea that \"of course, peaceful protest is a legitimate part of any functioning democracy. I've got no problem with peaceful protest!\"\n\nIt is a desultory caveat issued before the inevitable \"but\" screeches into the sentence like a van of riot police. Condemnation is never far away. To the enemies of the crowd, every peaceful protest crowd is liable to become a violent mob, composed of naive rubes who don't understand the issue at hand - particularly if the perennial folk devils of \"outside agitators,\" \"a minority of extremists,\" \"anarchists,\" \"vandals,\" \"yobs,\" or \"criminals hell-bent on violence\" infiltrate the crowd, \"masquerading\" as peaceful protesters and corrupting the guileless masses from within.\n\nThere are several recurring themes and motifs to the way that the police, political class, and media tend to respond to protest crowds. They will significantly lowball the size of a protest, because the greater the numbers on the streets, the greater the potential legitimacy of the argument. For all that the establishment now pays lip service to \"the vital role peaceful protest plays in a democracy\" (yadda yadda), its ideal would be a world without any protests at all, because that would vindicate the status quo over which it presides.\n\nThey will exaggerate the danger posed by the crowd, often inventing things out of whole cloth to do so. \"It is no exaggeration to say the sky was black with missiles,\" said the senior commanding officer at Orgreave, Assistant Chief Anthony Clements - exaggerating, and wildly, to justify sending horses charging into the crowd.\n\nAs part of his defamation of the 2010 student protesters, David Cameron told the public that police officers had been \"dragged off horses and beaten\" in Parliament Square. This was a flagrant lie, originating with the Met, who were later forced to pay £50,000 in compensation to the two protesters they had accused of doing so after it was finally disproved in court. Cameron has never retracted or apologized.\n\nThey will slander, hound, and maliciously prosecute the very protesters who have been hurt by wanton police violence - to muddy the waters, to troll and demoralize their victims, or some combination of the above. Take Eric Newbiggin, who was photographed with blood pouring down his face after the police assaulted him at Orgreave in 1984, before they charged him with rioting. He was later acquitted.\n\nIn the Parliament Square kettle in 2010 was a twenty-year-old student, Alfie Meadows: he was truncheoned in the head by a riot police officer and very nearly killed, and then, as he lay in hospital with brain damage, charged with violent disorder. He was prosecuted, tried, retried, and found not guilty in 2013.\n\nFinally, a full twelve years after the near-fatal assault, in 2023 the Met was forced to apologize and pay him substantial damages. The force informed Meadows that \"despite extensive inquiries,\" they just could not work out which officer had assaulted him, so none could be held accountable.\n\nIt is a process which repeats itself over and over. Six women who attended the 2021 candlelit vigil for Sarah Everard were aggressively arrested, handcuffed on the ground, and then charged; these charges were finally dropped a year later. Two of the women, Patsy Stevenson and Dania Al-Obeid, pursued counterclaims and were awarded substantial damages by the Met.\n\nIt happens so often, and the charges are so frequently and transparently vexatious, that one can only assume such prosecutions are not a systemic failure by the police and Crown Prosecution Service but in fact a conscious tactic and a key part of the propaganda battle against protesters. \"There's no smoke without fire\" is very far from being a central tenet of the English legal system, but if you are an institution like the Met, capable of fanning smoke around everywhere, having your obfuscations and lies taken up with zeal and repeated uncritically by large swaths of the media, it certainly makes the truth harder to discern.\n\nAs part of this, the police will also use what Professor Paul Gilroy has called \"the golden hour\" after an outrage of their own making, the short window available to fix the narrative in aspic and in their favor - a moment when credulous journalists will happily print whatever allegations they are fed, thanks to an excess of trust and an absence of time and energy to corroborate the police line.\n\nAny debunking in the weeks, months, or years that follow the event inevitably reaches far fewer people, so this approach always constitutes a net gain for the state, reputationally speaking. Lie first, have the record corrected months later, and shrug, because the press has stopped paying attention and the public has forgotten.\n\nOne final theme, regarding more militant protests or riots, is the establishment's refusal to accept that those involved might have had a legitimate reason - or any reason - to leave the house in the first place. Stephen Reicher has observed that opinion-formers are almost always willing to concede, and perhaps even applaud, the \"meaningful\" political motivations that explain historic rioting. Those motives could include racism, poverty, or gender inequality, but the event has to have taken place at least a few decades ago: anything similar but recent is mindless thuggery, which must be condemned completely and immediately.\n\nIn the past, goes the received wisdom, people protested against injustice with clear-eyed, righteous indignation; but not anymore. This time it's different - this time it's invalid, without context, without reason or morality. See, for example the Suffragettes - now sanitized in their behavior and held up as sweet, pious heroes in children's books and on coffee mugs. Both their misogynistic demonization at the time as deranged harpies and their extensive campaign of targeted arson and attacks on property have been forgotten.\n\nThe same goes for the sanitization and sanctification of the heroes and history of the American civil rights movement - now celebrated from a safe-enough distance, with any militancy or socialist principles airbrushed from the picture. This historic lag in the understanding of riots is no accident, and it has a clear political imperative.\n\nIn order to maintain the legitimacy of the established order, it is vital that the Le Bon version of events is repeated loud and clear, and no attempt is made to understand the motivations of rioters until the dust has long since settled and the government ministers, newspaper editors, and police chiefs are dozing gently in the House of Lords.\n\nDan Hancox is the author of Multitudes: How Crowds Made the Modern World and The Village Against the World .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Greg Abbott's pardon of a man convicted of murdering a Black Lives Matter protester deserves credit for \"thinking outside the box,\" but it's unlikely he will succeed, legal experts said Wednesday.\n\nThe request by Travis County District Attorney José Garza to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals for a writ of mandamus that would overturn Abbott's pardon of Daniel Perry appears to be unprecedented, they said.\n\nAnd the legal gambit by Garza, who is a Democrat, is going before a court that consists of nine elected judges who, like Abbott, are all Republicans.\n\n\"The choices for them are, 'I can do the right thing,' or 'I can save my job and side with Gov. Abbott,'\" said Charlie Baird, an Austin defense attorney and a retired state district court and Texas Court of Appeals associate judge.\n\nThat said, Baird added, he believes Garza's bid \"stands on solid legal ground.\"\n\n\"The pardon and parole process is designed to occur at the end of the criminal justice proceedings,\" Baird said. \"What the governor did was leapfrog the process and cut out the criminal justice appeals process for political purposes.\"\n\nAlan Bennett, a former Travis County assistant district attorney now in private practice, said he was less certain.\n\nBennett said he applauds Garza \"for his efforts to think outside the box in hopes of achieving what he truly believes is a just result.\"\n\n\"I'm sure his team has researched this and I'm sure his heart is in the right place,\" Bennett said. \"I'm just not sure if he is standing on firm legal ground.\"\n\n\"In Texas, the governor's authority to grant pardons is well established and I don't know it's subject to judicial review,\" he said.\n\nAsked if he's ever heard of another Texas prosecutor challenging a governor's pardon, Bennett said, \"This is the first I've heard of.\"\n\nSanford Levinson, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law, said he, too, had never heard of a prosecutor trying to overturn a governor's pardon.\n\n\"My hunch is no,\" he said.\n\nThe experts weighed in a day after Garza announced he would petition the state's highest court to overturn Abbott's pardon. He said the governor had violated the constitutional separation of powers doctrine by intervening in a court's actions.\n\n\"It's up to the legal system whether a person is guilty or innocent,\" Garza said at a news conference where he was joined by relatives of the slain protester, Garrett Foster, a 28-year-old former mechanic in the U.S. Air Force.\n\nFoster's mother, Sheila, said at the news conference that \"we had justice for Garrett\" for a short time before the governor's pardon.\n\n\"My own child was killed on American soil for doing nothing but practicing his First and Second Amendment rights,\" she said. \"And our governor just said that's OK, that's acceptable, as long as he doesn't like the victim or what the victim is saying.\"\n\nPerry was convicted last year of fatally shooting Foster on July 25, 2020, at a BLM protest in Austin and sentenced to 25 years in prison.\n\nThe same day, Abbott vowed to pardon Perry as fast as legally possible. And last month, Abbott's office announced the pardon , suggesting that Perry should have been exonerated under the state's \"Stand Your Ground\" laws.\n\nPerry was released from prison shortly afterward.\n\nUnder Texas law, people can open fire when human life or property, including homes and vehicles, are threatened with serious violence, kidnapping or robbery. And a shooter who is justified in using deadly force has no obligation to retreat.\n\nBut the law also requires that a defendant provide evidence they were in the right during such a confrontation.\n\nOn the day of the deadly shooting, Perry was a 30-year-old Army sergeant based at Ford Hood, around 70 miles north of Austin.\n\nHe was moonlighting as an Uber driver in downtown Austin when he encountered a BLM protest, one of the many that took place that summer in the wake of George Floyd's murder by Minneapolis police officers.\n\nUnder questioning by police, Perry said he was stopped at an intersection when Foster pointed a semiautomatic rifle at him. He said he opened fire from inside his vehicle in self-defense.\n\nFoster, police later said, was legally carrying the rifle.\n\nMore than a year later, a Travis County grand jury indicted Perry for murder.\n\nProsecutors said there was no evidence that Foster pointed his weapon at Perry. And, citing texts and social media posts, prosecutors attempted to portray Perry as a racist who could have simply driven away.\n\nOn April 7, 2023, Perry was convicted of murder. But the jury acquitted him of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.\n\nAbbott then sought and received a unanimous recommendation to pardon Perry from the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles.\n\nI am a general assignment reporter who covers a wide range of subjects.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

But today there's something more confrontational on the horizon. About 20 anti-police-violence activists are preparing to \"hold the line\"-with homemade protest signs as their shields-as a group of Blue Lives Matter supporters barrel toward them. Brittany Dawn Jeffrey is among the demonstrators. Over the course of the summer, the 30-year-old activist has become a recognizable figure throughout the state, known for her relentless organizing and social media presence. 2 In a video captured by a reporter, six large men can be seen striding directly toward Jeffrey and her fellow activists, followed by dozens of others. Leading them is Richard Fought, a home insulation salesman, who is wearing a muscle shirt and holding a large Thin Blue Line flag. Pummeling their way through, Fought and the other men crash into Jeffrey's group as police nearby stand and watch. Brawls break out. Fought would later brag on social media that he \"smashed a couple\" of activists, in one case with police assistance, though he later told us via text message that his violence was in self-defense. Some of the racial justice protesters were injured, according to a demonstrator who was there. 3 The Little Rock Police Department told us it never investigated Fought's actions; there's no evidence assaults by police supporters were ever investigated. Instead, police immediately confronted Jeffrey, part of a pattern that summer in which Black activists and their allies say they were singled out for surveillance and mistreatment. 4 More From Aaron Miguel Cantú Oakland Residents Respond as the Largest Police Training in the World Invades September 21, 2015 New Yorkers Surge Into the Streets, Demanding Justice for Eric Garner December 4, 2014 What Happens When A City Decides to Offer Addicts Services, Not Prison Sentences?

They show that police began monitoring Jeffrey and other protesters just days after Floyd's murder, apparently for participating in peaceful demonstrations. This surveillance continued for months. 6 It's not unusual for police to monitor and attend protests, but what's troubling, notes Holly Dickson, the executive director of the ACLU of Arkansas, is the level of surveillance that Jeffrey and her fellow activists were subjected to. \"Anytime we have seen this kind of overreaction by law enforcement officers\" in Little Rock, \"it's in response to racial justice movements and gatherings organized by members of the Black community,\" Dickson said. 7 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal Current Issue View our current issue As the protests escalated across the country, Jeffrey's frustrations mounted-fueled in part by what she saw as harassment by police-and her actions grew more confrontational. In December 2020, five months after the incident at the State Capitol, Jeffrey was arrested for attending a nighttime attack where others threw homemade Molotov cocktails at empty police cars. There's no evidence Jeffrey herself made or used incendiary devices, but she acknowledged planning to slash tires and break car windows with others. 8 Had Donald Trump not been president, Jeffrey might have escaped with comparatively lenient felony vandalism charges under Arkansas law. Instead she became a target of a historic federal crackdown that year against racial justice protesters and organizers. In building these cases, prosecutors throughout the country leaned on rarely used conspiracy charges to cast a wide net. In Jeffrey's case, that meant a potential prison sentence of 30 years or more. She has been incarcerated since June 2021. 9 The national crackdown in 2020 was far from the first time the federal government has responded to Black liberation movements with repressive force to disrupt activist organizations before they gain momentum. But the cases in Little Rock are especially illustrative of this dynamic, which now spans two presidential administrations. 10 Nationwide, the 2020 racial justice protests resulted in at least 326 federal cases, according to Princess Masilungan, a staff attorney at Creating Law Enforcement Accountability & Responsibility (CLEAR) at the City University of New York School of Law. She is a coauthor of a report published by the Movement for Black Lives that documents the Trump administration's broad crackdown on Black activists in 2020. Some of those activists are still incarcerated or awaiting trial. 11 \"You can make very clear through lines between the uprisings of summer 2020 for racial justice and COINTELPRO in the 1950s and 1960s,\" Masilungan told us, referring to the notorious FBI counterintelligence program against political movements. \"In both instances, the federal government had the same goal, and that goal is disruption.\" A key strategy of disruption includes \"impairing the operational capabilities of the key threat actor,\" she said. 12 In Little Rock, that meant Dawn Jeffrey. 13 Groundswell of support: Supporters of activist Dawn Jeffrey are crowd-funding to support her legal fees. (Illustration by Rumba Yambú) A t the time of George Floyd's death, the Little Rock Police Department had already been accused of racist violence. In 2012, Officer Josh Hastings, who was known to have attended a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan, shot and killed 15-year-old Bobby Moore during an attempted car robbery. In February 2019, Officer Charles Starks killed Bradley Blackshire, 30, during a traffic stop. Hastings was fired and found civilly liable; Starks resigned. Both killings incited local outrage. Jeffrey and other activists saw them as part of a pattern. 14 Related Articles Why We Don't Say \"Reform the Police\" Mariame Kaba and Andrea J. Ritchie Defund the Police Algorithms Michelle Chen Redefining Freedom With Robin Kelley Omari Weekes Jeffrey had been involved in community work and political watchdogging for years. She said she attended her first protest after the 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin, and friends paint a picture of a dedicated activist. An award she received in 2018 from a local lifestyle magazine honored her community outreach work empowering Black youth, homeless people, and others in need-values she said she learned from her mother. 15 \"I'm just someone who cared about my community, an organizer who cared about what was going on with Black people-to me, 'Black Lives Matter' is a slogan, but I'm Black, and my life matters,\" she told us from jail. 16 I n early 2020, Jeffrey organized a campaign for a seat in the state legislature for her friend Ryan Davis, a prison reform activist and the executive director of UA Little Rock Children International, a partnership between the University of Arkansas and a nonprofit organization that serves families in the area. Davis lost by a single vote. 17 \"There are folks who are very vocal about the fact that they think [Jeffrey] was too loud, that she was, in their words, doing too much,\" Davis said. But \"I don't find anybody out here right now as intrepid as her, because she was such a powerful voice.\" 18 In the weeks following Floyd's murder, Jeffrey started a statewide bail fund for protesters. It's now a permanent fund for people in Little Rock who can't afford bail. 19 In a video promoting the fund, Jeffrey laid out her theory of change. \"Protests disrupt daily lives as usual, so it's good to start disrupting business as usual for them,\" she says. \"When you start taking it to them and put it in their face, where they can't ignore it, then they start listening and say, 'Well, what are they talking about?'\" 20 Other Arkansas activists shared her approach. Demonstrations for racial justice in Little Rock were disruptive but peaceful. That soon changed. Police amped up their use of riot munitions. Protesters smashed the windows of downtown businesses late in the night, according to police incident reports sent to us in response to a records request. 21 Arkansas State Police began using a \"fusion center,\" a post-9/11 innovation that was meant to facilitate information sharing between local and federal police for anti-terrorism purposes, to track even peaceful protesters-endangering First Amendment rights to free speech and assembly. Records indicate that the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Arkansas State Police compiled lists of upcoming protest events, including some explicitly described as peaceful, echoing the War on Terror-era surveillance of Muslim gatherings. 22 \"There was a concerted effort by law enforcement to do cross-agency cooperation and communication in response to these protests,\" said the ACLU's Dickson regarding the sharing of tips between the city police and state fusion center. \"It was very clear it was happening, from [the use of] infiltrators to [carrying out] open and obvious surveillance.\" 23 Apart from tracking Jeffrey, local police were following false leads, including an unsubstantiated rumor that busloads of antifa activists were booking hotels in the city. Federal and state police tracked protests across Arkansas, while US Attorney General Bill Barr activated all 56 of the nation's FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces, which rely on deputized local law enforcement, to stop \"violent radical elements.\" 24 In July, Barr traveled to Little Rock to meet with local law enforcement officials. In public remarks, he said the FBI's terrorism task forces were working with local police to share intelligence \"and go after the people we think are ringleaders\" behind protest violence. 25 The Nation and Type Investigations, in partnership with the Arkansas Nonprofit News Network, sent public records requests to the Arkansas State Police and Little Rock Police Department for all documents related to protest activity, rioting activity, and the destruction of property in Little Rock from June through September 2020. The response included hundreds of pages of e-mail records between local police, state intelligence officers, and federal agents. Taken together, they show authorities zeroing in on Black activists, including Jeffrey, for protest activity-while largely dismissing the threat posed by counterprotesters. 26 In an e-mail dated May 30, 2020, Heath Helton, the assistant police chief in Little Rock, warned of an event \"which to my understanding is being organized by Dawn Jeffrey.... Our partners at ASP [Arkansas State Police] and the State Capital have been made aware of this event, which is supposed to be peaceful.\" A June 1 screenshot of Jeffrey's Facebook page about a die-in-when protesters simulate being dead-also appears to have originated from the Arkansas fusion center. 27 The state police did not respond to questions we sent about Jeffrey. The Little Rock Police Department defended its approach. \"As with any policing agency, the role of LRPD is to protect the citizens ... they serve. Ms. Jeffrey had/has a public page which means it is viewable,\" a spokesperson for the department said. \"Therefore, there can be no violation in looking at a public page.\" 28 Jeffrey is by far the most mentioned activist in the law enforcement e-mails we reviewed. In one instance, surveillance records line up with an arrest. On July 12, she was arrested by local police at a demonstration outside of a custard shop in nearby Conway. A video recorded by a reporter shows police calling Jeffrey by name and then immediately handcuffing her without a clear reason. The Conway Police Department said she was arrested for trespassing. Intelligence officers for the Arkansas State Police were aware that Jeffrey would be at the event because they were monitoring her Facebook page in the fusion center and sent out an e-mail with a link to a livestream of the protest. While it's not clear whether this monitoring led directly to her arrest that day, the e-mail was one of at least eight sent by senior intelligence officials in the fusion center that referred to Jeffrey's organizing or her participation in nonviolent protests. By comparison, out of hundreds of e-mails and other communications, we saw few that referred to counterprotest groups-and even when they were mentioned, law enforcement focused not on the threat of violence they might pose but on possible violence initiated by racial justice protesters. In one e-mail, an FBI agent dismissed a man's threats \"encouraging the destruction of African Americans' property\" as \"just talking online.\" 29 Center of the dragnet: BLM protester Benjamin Mujera Lung'aho faces criminal charges after being surveilled for months. (Thomas Metthe / Arkansas Democrat-Gazette) T he heavy surveillance of the protesters ultimately caught up with Jeffrey-thanks in part to a T-shirt. 30 One of her closest friends, Mujera Benjamin Lung'aho, was also at the July protest at the Capitol. The two first met in high school, where they played soccer together, and reconnected years later as the racial justice uprising in Ferguson, Mo., reverberated across the country. They eventually grew close enough that Jeffrey spoke at Lung'aho's father's funeral. 31 At the Capitol clash, Lung'aho had worn a distinctive shirt. According to a warrant later filed to search his phone, a detective claimed to have recognized Lung'aho's shirt and other specific features from surveillance video taken a few days earlier during a vandalism spree at a local Confederate cemetery, where several people were caught on camera destroying monuments. Officers showed up at Lung'aho's residence and arrested him after a foot chase. \"Under the current climate, I just was compelled to flee,\" Lung'aho recalled in a conversation with us. 32 When the police searched his phone, they found encrypted group chats and social media messages that they claim tied him to high-profile demonstrations in Little Rock throughout 2020. This turned out to be a key moment for law enforcement-and a big payoff after months of tracking Black activists. 33 According to the authorities, messages on Lung'aho's phone indicated that he participated in several attacks on police vehicles. After arresting him, the police reached out to another alleged participant, Emily Terry, who'd messaged with Lung'aho the morning after the most recent outing. According to police documents, Terry positively identified others who were involved. Although a criminal complaint alleged that Terry threw a Molotov cocktail, Terry was never indicted. Terry declined to speak with us when reached by phone. 34 On December 17, Jeffrey was arrested and charged. Federal prosecutors alleged that she was present when Molotov cocktails were made at her house and drove with friends who tried but failed to set an empty squad car on fire. Three other activists, Renea Goddard, Loba Espinosa-Villegas, and Emily Nowlin, were also arrested and agreed to plead guilty to lesser charges. In interviews, they said they were friends with Jeffrey and that her home had become a haven for activists that summer. None recalled her plotting illegal actions, and the police affidavit doesn't identify her by name when describing the more serious incidents that night. 35 Espinosa-Villegas told us that it seemed, based on police questioning, that prosecutors saw Jeffrey and Lung'aho, the only Black defendants charged, as the \"big fish.\" 36 \"Their intention was to try and figure out, was it [Jeffrey or Lung'aho] who was the leader?\" The actual leader, Espinosa-Villegas said, was another person whom prosecutors accused of illegal actions, according to a criminal complaint naming multiple defendants. The documents also show that prosecutors named two others, including Terry, who allegedly committed similar crimes. None were indicted. 37 In repeated interviews, Jeffrey denied she had ever possessed or used a Molotov cocktail. Under immense pressure given the charges against her, and fearful of her chances at trial, she accepted a plea deal in May. In her plea agreement, Jeffrey acknowledged being present during the attack and the mixing of Molotov cocktails and \"agreed with others to commit acts of vandalism on government buildings and damaging police cars by puncturing tires and/or breaking windows.\" 38 \"There's no way you can be an American citizen feeling like you're being attacked or at war with your own government,\" she said in an interview. \"When do the scales balance for justice?\" 39 Jeffrey's supporters present an image of a leader dispensing hard truths about political injustices in America, unfairly persecuted by the powerful entities she criticized. By contrast, those on the other side of the political spectrum see her as a provocateur who got what she deserved. 40 In a Facebook group called \"Make Little Rock Great Again,\" whose moderators have alluded to being local police officers, an administrator of the page posted a cartoon of a police officer shooting a Black woman in the head, mocking a post by Jeffrey. One person commented, \"Be a shame if she came up missing,\" and followed that with: \"Lemme rephrase that correctly...replace she with it.\" When asked about the page, a police department spokesperson said, \"There's no way to conclusively determine if this page is moderated by any member of the Little Rock Police Department.\" 41 Lung'aho, a spoken-word artist, told us that he and Jeffrey had both been targeted for their politics. He's accused of throwing Molotov cocktails on multiple occasions and faces more time in prison than anybody else. \"The entire reason why we were doing the activism that we were involved in is because we were doing something for Black people,\" Lung'aho said, speaking to us from jail. 42 N ot all of the jurisdictions that experienced unrest in the wake of George Floyd's murder-even when that unrest turned destructive-resorted to federal prosecutions. Our past reporting found that such prosecutions were especially likely in jurisdictions whose US attorneys were politically affiliated with the Trump administration. 43 In Little Rock, Trump had an ideological ally in Cody Hiland, then the US attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas. A former local prosecutor-and, before that, deputy chief of staff to former governor Mike Huckabee-Hiland showed an eagerness to pursue the Trump administration's political goals, once resurrecting an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. In Congress, GOP Senator Tom Cotton, who later called for federal troops to be deployed against racial justice protests, lauded Hiland's nomination by Trump. 44 In an op-ed published amid the protests, Hiland wrote, \"It is my prayer that the shrill cries of 'Defund the Police' always be muted by our nation's earnest declaration that we 'thank God for the Police.'\" 45 When police found messages and photos on Lung'aho's phone suggesting he was involved in the attacks, they sent the evidence to agents at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Hiland soon got personally involved in the case, inviting Lung'aho's attorney, Michael Kaiser, to meet with him at the police station where Lung'aho was being detained. 46 The US attorney hoped that he could persuade Lung'aho to provide information about other protesters, according to Kaiser. Hiland told Kaiser he had the authority to add several charges involving the use of a destructive device in a crime of violence that would carry sentences of 30 years to life. \"I hadn't ever seen that before,\" Kaiser said, adding that it was unusual for a US attorney to get so involved in a case that didn't involve charges like murder or drug trafficking. 47 Prosecutors' actions in the case align with findings from the Movement for Black Lives report. The authorities filed multiple and redundant charges against protesters, a technique critics say is meant to pressure defendants into accepting plea deals. The same technique was used by federal prosecutors against at least 84 racial justice protesters in 2020. One protester in Philadelphia was hit with four federal arson charges for burning two police cars, because the cars had benefited from federal funding and, the government claimed in a filing, had a role in interstate commerce. 48 Hiland resigned from his federal post in the final weeks of Trump's presidency and is now working on Sarah Huckabee Sanders's gubernatorial campaign; Sanders recently nominated him to be the next chair of the Arkansas Republican Party. Hiland didn't respond to our calls and texts regarding this story. 49 Meanwhile, local pro-Trump Facebook pages tracked Jeffrey's and Lung'aho's cases. During an early pretrial hearing for Lung'aho, over a dozen men wearing paramilitary clothing and carrying rifles loitered on street corners near the courthouse. 50 F or most of the past year, Jeffrey and Lung'aho were held in separate wings of the Greene County Detention Center in rural Arkansas. Judges revoked bond for both of them less than a year after they were arrested. The courts faulted them for failing tests for cannabis use, missing check-ins, and, in Lunga'ho's case, an arrest for public intoxication. Recently, after pleading guilty to a single count of conspiracy to possess a destructive device, Jeffrey was transferred back to a detention center in Little Rock. 51 As both cases have plodded along for nearly two years, Jeffrey's supporters have continued their efforts to raise awareness and funds. She eventually hired Phillip Hamilton, a New York City-based corporate lawyer, as her counsel. In a motion to appeal her ongoing detention, Hamilton described Jeffrey's distress: Her long separation from her 12-year-old daughter and her family had reached \"the point where it was making her mentally and emotionally sick,\" Hamilton wrote, adding that he had been unable to communicate regularly with Jeffrey because of staffing shortages at the Pulaski County Regional Detention Facility. 52 When Jeffrey spoke to us in January, she described the pain of the family separation, noting that she was her daughter's primary caregiver. In the messages she sends to her daughter, \"I'm always reflecting that I love her, and that she's my forever,\" Jeffrey said. \"It's really hard not being in her life, making her lunch and dinner, tucking her into bed.\" 53 Lung'aho is still fighting his case and hoping that his battle can help others in his position. In November 2021, Kaiser filed a motion urging the judge to consider whether prosecutors had stretched \"the reach of federal criminal law beyond its constitutional bounds.\" He argues that the Justice Department lacks jurisdiction in the case, pointing out that federal funding for the affected police agencies is minuscule. \"From minute one, we've said this is a state case charged federally because of politics,\" Kaiser said in an interview. 54 Almost a year later, US District Judge D.P. Marshal ruled that although the destroyed police cars were not federal property nor purchased with federal financial assistance, Lung'aho could still be federally charged with arson. But Marshal dismissed three of Lung'aho's 13 charges, each of which prescribed a 30-year mandatory minimum sentence, for using a destructive device during a crime of violence. \"Federal arson is not a crime of violence,\" Marshal wrote-at least in Lung'aho's case. 55 The ruling dropped Lung'aho's maximum prison sentence from more than 90 years to somewhere between 10 and 30, according to Kaiser. But federal prosecutors immediately filed an appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which could take up to eight months to issue a ruling-and Lung'aho would remain in jail the whole time. 56 If the ruling is upheld, he is considering going to trial, despite the risk of prison time and the extraordinarily low success rates of federal defendants. 57 \"Ten years is scary, but the 30-to-life is what they threatened at the beginning, and now it's all gone,\" Kaiser said the morning of the ruling. Lung'aho is more willing to face a jury \"now that the potential sentence for accepting a plea deal is only slightly better than what we'd face at trial.\" 58 Meanwhile, Jeffrey's incarceration has been a devastating coda to a summer that initially held so much hope for change. Since then, the GOP-controlled Arkansas legislature has passed a raft of regressive bills loosening checks on police and private militias and restricting public education under the guise of stopping \"critical race theory.\" 59 The surveillance and prosecutions \"crumbled the activist movement in Arkansas, because nobody can trust anybody,\" said Brooklen Mason, a Little Rock activist who knows Jeffrey and several other defendants. \"And part of the work is being able to trust people.\" 60 The ACLU's Dickson agrees, noting that Jeffrey's long incarceration has had a \"chilling effect\" on local activism. \"That's not a defect,\" she said. \"That's part of the design.\" 61\n\nThis story was reported in partnership with Type Investigations and produced with support from the Puffin Foundation and the Fund for Constitutional Government.\n\nBut today there's something more confrontational on the horizon. About 20 anti-police-violence activists are preparing to \"hold the line\"-with homemade protest signs as their shields-as a group of Blue Lives Matter supporters barrel toward them.

She said she attended her first protest after the 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin, and friends paint a picture of a dedicated activist. An award she received in 2018 from a local lifestyle magazine honored her community outreach work empowering Black youth, homeless people, and others in need-values she said she learned from her mother. 15 \"I'm just someone who cared about my community, an organizer who cared about what was going on with Black people-to me, 'Black Lives Matter' is a slogan, but I'm Black, and my life matters,\" she told us from jail. 16 I n early 2020, Jeffrey organized a campaign for a seat in the state legislature for her friend Ryan Davis, a prison reform activist and the executive director of UA Little Rock Children International, a partnership between the University of Arkansas and a nonprofit organization that serves families in the area. Davis lost by a single vote. 17 \"There are folks who are very vocal about the fact that they think [Jeffrey] was too loud, that she was, in their words, doing too much,\" Davis said. But \"I don't find anybody out here right now as intrepid as her, because she was such a powerful voice.\" 18 In the weeks following Floyd's murder, Jeffrey started a statewide bail fund for protesters. It's now a permanent fund for people in Little Rock who can't afford bail. 19 In a video promoting the fund, Jeffrey laid out her theory of change. \"Protests disrupt daily lives as usual, so it's good to start disrupting business as usual for them,\" she says. \"When you start taking it to them and put it in their face, where they can't ignore it, then they start listening and say, 'Well, what are they talking about?'\" 20 Other Arkansas activists shared her approach. Demonstrations for racial justice in Little Rock were disruptive but peaceful. That soon changed. Police amped up their use of riot munitions. Protesters smashed the windows of downtown businesses late in the night, according to police incident reports sent to us in response to a records request. 21 Arkansas State Police began using a \"fusion center,\" a post-9/11 innovation that was meant to facilitate information sharing between local and federal police for anti-terrorism purposes, to track even peaceful protesters-endangering First Amendment rights to free speech and assembly. Records indicate that the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Arkansas State Police compiled lists of upcoming protest events, including some explicitly described as peaceful, echoing the War on Terror-era surveillance of Muslim gatherings. 22 \"There was a concerted effort by law enforcement to do cross-agency cooperation and communication in response to these protests,\" said the ACLU's Dickson regarding the sharing of tips between the city police and state fusion center. \"It was very clear it was happening, from [the use of] infiltrators to [carrying out] open and obvious surveillance.\" 23 Apart from tracking Jeffrey, local police were following false leads, including an unsubstantiated rumor that busloads of antifa activists were booking hotels in the city. Federal and state police tracked protests across Arkansas, while US Attorney General Bill Barr activated all 56 of the nation's FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces, which rely on deputized local law enforcement, to stop \"violent radical elements.\" 24 In July, Barr traveled to Little Rock to meet with local law enforcement officials. In public remarks, he said the FBI's terrorism task forces were working with local police to share intelligence \"and go after the people we think are ringleaders\" behind protest violence. 25 The Nation and Type Investigations, in partnership with the Arkansas Nonprofit News Network, sent public records requests to the Arkansas State Police and Little Rock Police Department for all documents related to protest activity, rioting activity, and the destruction of property in Little Rock from June through September 2020. The response included hundreds of pages of e-mail records between local police, state intelligence officers, and federal agents. Taken together, they show authorities zeroing in on Black activists, including Jeffrey, for protest activity-while largely dismissing the threat posed by counterprotesters. 26 In an e-mail dated May 30, 2020, Heath Helton, the assistant police chief in Little Rock, warned of an event \"which to my understanding is being organized by Dawn Jeffrey.... Our partners at ASP [Arkansas State Police] and the State Capital have been made aware of this event, which is supposed to be peaceful.\" A June 1 screenshot of Jeffrey's Facebook page about a die-in-when protesters simulate being dead-also appears to have originated from the Arkansas fusion center. 27 The state police did not respond to questions we sent about Jeffrey. The Little Rock Police Department defended its approach. \"As with any policing agency, the role of LRPD is to protect the citizens ... they serve. Ms. Jeffrey had/has a public page which means it is viewable,\" a spokesperson for the department said. \"Therefore, there can be no violation in looking at a public page.\" 28 Jeffrey is by far the most mentioned activist in the law enforcement e-mails we reviewed. In one instance, surveillance records line up with an arrest. On July 12, she was arrested by local police at a demonstration outside of a custard shop in nearby Conway. A video recorded by a reporter shows police calling Jeffrey by name and then immediately handcuffing her without a clear reason. The Conway Police Department said she was arrested for trespassing. Intelligence officers for the Arkansas State Police were aware that Jeffrey would be at the event because they were monitoring her Facebook page in the fusion center and sent out an e-mail with a link to a livestream of the protest. While it's not clear whether this monitoring led directly to her arrest that day, the e-mail was one of at least eight sent by senior intelligence officials in the fusion center that referred to Jeffrey's organizing or her participation in nonviolent protests. By comparison, out of hundreds of e-mails and other communications, we saw few that referred to counterprotest groups-and even when they were mentioned, law enforcement focused not on the threat of violence they might pose but on possible violence initiated by racial justice protesters. In one e-mail, an FBI agent dismissed a man's threats \"encouraging the destruction of African Americans' property\" as \"just talking online.\" 29 Center of the dragnet: BLM protester Benjamin Mujera Lung'aho faces criminal charges after being surveilled for months. (Thomas Metthe / Arkansas Democrat-Gazette) T he heavy surveillance of the protesters ultimately caught up with Jeffrey-thanks in part to a T-shirt. 30 One of her closest friends, Mujera Benjamin Lung'aho, was also at the July protest at the Capitol. The two first met in high school, where they played soccer together, and reconnected years later as the racial justice uprising in Ferguson, Mo., reverberated across the country. They eventually grew close enough that Jeffrey spoke at Lung'aho's father's funeral. 31 At the Capitol clash, Lung'aho had worn a distinctive shirt. According to a warrant later filed to search his phone, a detective claimed to have recognized Lung'aho's shirt and other specific features from surveillance video taken a few days earlier during a vandalism spree at a local Confederate cemetery, where several people were caught on camera destroying monuments. Officers showed up at Lung'aho's residence and arrested him after a foot chase. \"Under the current climate, I just was compelled to flee,\" Lung'aho recalled in a conversation with us. 32 When the police searched his phone, they found encrypted group chats and social media messages that they claim tied him to high-profile demonstrations in Little Rock throughout 2020. This turned out to be a key moment for law enforcement-and a big payoff after months of tracking Black activists. 33 According to the authorities, messages on Lung'aho's phone indicated that he participated in several attacks on police vehicles. After arresting him, the police reached out to another alleged participant, Emily Terry, who'd messaged with Lung'aho the morning after the most recent outing. According to police documents, Terry positively identified others who were involved. Although a criminal complaint alleged that Terry threw a Molotov cocktail, Terry was never indicted. Terry declined to speak with us when reached by phone. 34 On December 17, Jeffrey was arrested and charged. Federal prosecutors alleged that she was present when Molotov cocktails were made at her house and drove with friends who tried but failed to set an empty squad car on fire. Three other activists, Renea Goddard, Loba Espinosa-Villegas, and Emily Nowlin, were also arrested and agreed to plead guilty to lesser charges. In interviews, they said they were friends with Jeffrey and that her home had become a haven for activists that summer. None recalled her plotting illegal actions, and the police affidavit doesn't identify her by name when describing the more serious incidents that night. 35 Espinosa-Villegas told us that it seemed, based on police questioning, that prosecutors saw Jeffrey and Lung'aho, the only Black defendants charged, as the \"big fish.\" 36 \"Their intention was to try and figure out, was it [Jeffrey or Lung'aho] who was the leader?\" The actual leader, Espinosa-Villegas said, was another person whom prosecutors accused of illegal actions, according to a criminal complaint naming multiple defendants. The documents also show that prosecutors named two others, including Terry, who allegedly committed similar crimes. None were indicted. 37 In repeated interviews, Jeffrey denied she had ever possessed or used a Molotov cocktail. Under immense pressure given the charges against her, and fearful of her chances at trial, she accepted a plea deal in May. In her plea agreement, Jeffrey acknowledged being present during the attack and the mixing of Molotov cocktails and \"agreed with others to commit acts of vandalism on government buildings and damaging police cars by puncturing tires and/or breaking windows.\" 38 \"There's no way you can be an American citizen feeling like you're being attacked or at war with your own government,\" she said in an interview. \"When do the scales balance for justice?\" 39 Jeffrey's supporters present an image of a leader dispensing hard truths about political injustices in America, unfairly persecuted by the powerful entities she criticized. By contrast, those on the other side of the political spectrum see her as a provocateur who got what she deserved. 40 In a Facebook group called \"Make Little Rock Great Again,\" whose moderators have alluded to being local police officers, an administrator of the page posted a cartoon of a police officer shooting a Black woman in the head, mocking a post by Jeffrey. One person commented, \"Be a shame if she came up missing,\" and followed that with: \"Lemme rephrase that correctly...replace she with it.\" When asked about the page, a police department spokesperson said, \"There's no way to conclusively determine if this page is moderated by any member of the Little Rock Police Department.\" 41 Lung'aho, a spoken-word artist, told us that he and Jeffrey had both been targeted for their politics. He's accused of throwing Molotov cocktails on multiple occasions and faces more time in prison than anybody else. \"The entire reason why we were doing the activism that we were involved in is because we were doing something for Black people,\" Lung'aho said, speaking to us from jail. 42 N ot all of the jurisdictions that experienced unrest in the wake of George Floyd's murder-even when that unrest turned destructive-resorted to federal prosecutions. Our past reporting found that such prosecutions were especially likely in jurisdictions whose US attorneys were politically affiliated with the Trump administration. 43 In Little Rock, Trump had an ideological ally in Cody Hiland, then the US attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas. A former local prosecutor-and, before that, deputy chief of staff to former governor Mike Huckabee-Hiland showed an eagerness to pursue the Trump administration's political goals, once resurrecting an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. In Congress, GOP Senator Tom Cotton, who later called for federal troops to be deployed against racial justice protests, lauded Hiland's nomination by Trump. 44 In an op-ed published amid the protests, Hiland wrote, \"It is my prayer that the shrill cries of 'Defund the Police' always be muted by our nation's earnest declaration that we 'thank God for the Police.'\" 45 When police found messages and photos on Lung'aho's phone suggesting he was involved in the attacks, they sent the evidence to agents at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Hiland soon got personally involved in the case, inviting Lung'aho's attorney, Michael Kaiser, to meet with him at the police station where Lung'aho was being detained. 46 The US attorney hoped that he could persuade Lung'aho to provide information about other protesters, according to Kaiser. Hiland told Kaiser he had the authority to add several charges involving the use of a destructive device in a crime of violence that would carry sentences of 30 years to life. \"I hadn't ever seen that before,\" Kaiser said, adding that it was unusual for a US attorney to get so involved in a case that didn't involve charges like murder or drug trafficking. 47 Prosecutors' actions in the case align with findings from the Movement for Black Lives report. The authorities filed multiple and redundant charges against protesters, a technique critics say is meant to pressure defendants into accepting plea deals. The same technique was used by federal prosecutors against at least 84 racial justice protesters in 2020. One protester in Philadelphia was hit with four federal arson charges for burning two police cars, because the cars had benefited from federal funding and, the government claimed in a filing, had a role in interstate commerce. 48 Hiland resigned from his federal post in the final weeks of Trump's presidency and is now working on Sarah Huckabee Sanders's gubernatorial campaign; Sanders recently nominated him to be the next chair of the Arkansas Republican Party. Hiland didn't respond to our calls and texts regarding this story. 49 Meanwhile, local pro-Trump Facebook pages tracked Jeffrey's and Lung'aho's cases. During an early pretrial hearing for Lung'aho, over a dozen men wearing paramilitary clothing and carrying rifles loitered on street corners near the courthouse. 50 F or most of the past year, Jeffrey and Lung'aho were held in separate wings of the Greene County Detention Center in rural Arkansas. Judges revoked bond for both of them less than a year after they were arrested. The courts faulted them for failing tests for cannabis use, missing check-ins, and, in Lunga'ho's case, an arrest for public intoxication. Recently, after pleading guilty to a single count of conspiracy to possess a destructive device, Jeffrey was transferred back to a detention center in Little Rock. 51 As both cases have plodded along for nearly two years, Jeffrey's supporters have continued their efforts to raise awareness and funds. She eventually hired Phillip Hamilton, a New York City-based corporate lawyer, as her counsel. In a motion to appeal her ongoing detention, Hamilton described Jeffrey's distress: Her long separation from her 12-year-old daughter and her family had reached \"the point where it was making her mentally and emotionally sick,\" Hamilton wrote, adding that he had been unable to communicate regularly with Jeffrey because of staffing shortages at the Pulaski County Regional Detention Facility. 52 When Jeffrey spoke to us in January, she described the pain of the family separation, noting that she was her daughter's primary caregiver. In the messages she sends to her daughter, \"I'm always reflecting that I love her, and that she's my forever,\" Jeffrey said. \"It's really hard not being in her life, making her lunch and dinner, tucking her into bed.\" 53 Lung'aho is still fighting his case and hoping that his battle can help others in his position. In November 2021, Kaiser filed a motion urging the judge to consider whether prosecutors had stretched \"the reach of federal criminal law beyond its constitutional bounds.\" He argues that the Justice Department lacks jurisdiction in the case, pointing out that federal funding for the affected police agencies is minuscule. \"From minute one, we've said this is a state case charged federally because of politics,\" Kaiser said in an interview. 54 Almost a year later, US District Judge D.P. Marshal ruled that although the destroyed police cars were not federal property nor purchased with federal financial assistance, Lung'aho could still be federally charged with arson. But Marshal dismissed three of Lung'aho's 13 charges, each of which prescribed a 30-year mandatory minimum sentence, for using a destructive device during a crime of violence. \"Federal arson is not a crime of violence,\" Marshal wrote-at least in Lung'aho's case. 55 The ruling dropped Lung'aho's maximum prison sentence from more than 90 years to somewhere between 10 and 30, according to Kaiser. But federal prosecutors immediately filed an appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which could take up to eight months to issue a ruling-and Lung'aho would remain in jail the whole time. 56 If the ruling is upheld, he is considering going to trial, despite the risk of prison time and the extraordinarily low success rates of federal defendants. 57 \"Ten years is scary, but the 30-to-life is what they threatened at the beginning, and now it's all gone,\" Kaiser said the morning of the ruling. Lung'aho is more willing to face a jury \"now that the potential sentence for accepting a plea deal is only slightly better than what we'd face at trial.\" 58 Meanwhile, Jeffrey's incarceration has been a devastating coda to a summer that initially held so much hope for change. Since then, the GOP-controlled Arkansas legislature has passed a raft of regressive bills loosening checks on police and private militias and restricting public education under the guise of stopping \"critical race theory.\" 59 The surveillance and prosecutions \"crumbled the activist movement in Arkansas, because nobody can trust anybody,\" said Brooklen Mason, a Little Rock activist who knows Jeffrey and several other defendants. \"And part of the work is being able to trust people.\" 60 The ACLU's Dickson agrees, noting that Jeffrey's long incarceration has had a \"chilling effect\" on local activism. \"That's not a defect,\" she said. \"That's part of the design.\" 61\n\nIn a video captured by a reporter, six large men can be seen striding directly toward Jeffrey and her fellow activists, followed by dozens of others. Leading them is Richard Fought, a home insulation salesman, who is wearing a muscle shirt and holding a large Thin Blue Line flag. Pummeling their way through, Fought and the other men crash into Jeffrey's group as police nearby stand and watch. Brawls break out. Fought would later brag on social media that he \"smashed a couple\" of activists, in one case with police assistance, though he later told us via text message that his violence was in self-defense. Some of the racial justice protesters were injured, according to a demonstrator who was there. 3 The Little Rock Police Department told us it never investigated Fought's actions; there's no evidence assaults by police supporters were ever investigated. Instead, police immediately confronted Jeffrey, part of a pattern that summer in which Black activists and their allies say they were singled out for surveillance and mistreatment. 4 More From Aaron Miguel Cantú Oakland Residents Respond as the Largest Police Training in the World Invades September 21, 2015 New Yorkers Surge Into the Streets, Demanding Justice for Eric Garner December 4, 2014 What Happens When A City Decides to Offer Addicts Services, Not Prison Sentences?

They show that police began monitoring Jeffrey and other protesters just days after Floyd's murder, apparently for participating in peaceful demonstrations. This surveillance continued for months. 6 It's not unusual for police to monitor and attend protests, but what's troubling, notes Holly Dickson, the executive director of the ACLU of Arkansas, is the level of surveillance that Jeffrey and her fellow activists were subjected to. \"Anytime we have seen this kind of overreaction by law enforcement officers\" in Little Rock, \"it's in response to racial justice movements and gatherings organized by members of the Black community,\" Dickson said. 7 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal Current Issue View our current issue As the protests escalated across the country, Jeffrey's frustrations mounted-fueled in part by what she saw as harassment by police-and her actions grew more confrontational. In December 2020, five months after the incident at the State Capitol, Jeffrey was arrested for attending a nighttime attack where others threw homemade Molotov cocktails at empty police cars. There's no evidence Jeffrey herself made or used incendiary devices, but she acknowledged planning to slash tires and break car windows with others. 8 Had Donald Trump not been president, Jeffrey might have escaped with comparatively lenient felony vandalism charges under Arkansas law. Instead she became a target of a historic federal crackdown that year against racial justice protesters and organizers. In building these cases, prosecutors throughout the country leaned on rarely used conspiracy charges to cast a wide net. In Jeffrey's case, that meant a potential prison sentence of 30 years or more. She has been incarcerated since June 2021. 9 The national crackdown in 2020 was far from the first time the federal government has responded to Black liberation movements with repressive force to disrupt activist organizations before they gain momentum. But the cases in Little Rock are especially illustrative of this dynamic, which now spans two presidential administrations. 10 Nationwide, the 2020 racial justice protests resulted in at least 326 federal cases, according to Princess Masilungan, a staff attorney at Creating Law Enforcement Accountability & Responsibility (CLEAR) at the City University of New York School of Law. She is a coauthor of a report published by the Movement for Black Lives that documents the Trump administration's broad crackdown on Black activists in 2020. Some of those activists are still incarcerated or awaiting trial. 11 \"You can make very clear through lines between the uprisings of summer 2020 for racial justice and COINTELPRO in the 1950s and 1960s,\" Masilungan told us, referring to the notorious FBI counterintelligence program against political movements. \"In both instances, the federal government had the same goal, and that goal is disruption.\" A key strategy of disruption includes \"impairing the operational capabilities of the key threat actor,\" she said. 12 In Little Rock, that meant Dawn Jeffrey. 13 Groundswell of support: Supporters of activist Dawn Jeffrey are crowd-funding to support her legal fees. (Illustration by Rumba Yambú) A t the time of George Floyd's death, the Little Rock Police Department had already been accused of racist violence. In 2012, Officer Josh Hastings, who was known to have attended a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan, shot and killed 15-year-old Bobby Moore during an attempted car robbery. In February 2019, Officer Charles Starks killed Bradley Blackshire, 30, during a traffic stop. Hastings was fired and found civilly liable; Starks resigned. Both killings incited local outrage.

Our past reporting found that such prosecutions were especially likely in jurisdictions whose US attorneys were politically affiliated with the Trump administration. 43 In Little Rock, Trump had an ideological ally in Cody Hiland, then the US attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas. A former local prosecutor-and, before that, deputy chief of staff to former governor Mike Huckabee-Hiland showed an eagerness to pursue the Trump administration's political goals, once resurrecting an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. In Congress, GOP Senator Tom Cotton, who later called for federal troops to be deployed against racial justice protests, lauded Hiland's nomination by Trump. 44 In an op-ed published amid the protests, Hiland wrote, \"It is my prayer that the shrill cries of 'Defund the Police' always be muted by our nation's earnest declaration that we 'thank God for the Police.'\" 45 When police found messages and photos on Lung'aho's phone suggesting he was involved in the attacks, they sent the evidence to agents at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Hiland soon got personally involved in the case, inviting Lung'aho's attorney, Michael Kaiser, to meet with him at the police station where Lung'aho was being detained. 46 The US attorney hoped that he could persuade Lung'aho to provide information about other protesters, according to Kaiser. Hiland told Kaiser he had the authority to add several charges involving the use of a destructive device in a crime of violence that would carry sentences of 30 years to life. \"I hadn't ever seen that before,\" Kaiser said, adding that it was unusual for a US attorney to get so involved in a case that didn't involve charges like murder or drug trafficking. 47 Prosecutors' actions in the case align with findings from the Movement for Black Lives report. The authorities filed multiple and redundant charges against protesters, a technique critics say is meant to pressure defendants into accepting plea deals. The same technique was used by federal prosecutors against at least 84 racial justice protesters in 2020. One protester in Philadelphia was hit with four federal arson charges for burning two police cars, because the cars had benefited from federal funding and, the government claimed in a filing, had a role in interstate commerce. 48 Hiland resigned from his federal post in the final weeks of Trump's presidency and is now working on Sarah Huckabee Sanders's gubernatorial campaign; Sanders recently nominated him to be the next chair of the Arkansas Republican Party. Hiland didn't respond to our calls and texts regarding this story. 49 Meanwhile, local pro-Trump Facebook pages tracked Jeffrey's and Lung'aho's cases. During an early pretrial hearing for Lung'aho, over a dozen men wearing paramilitary clothing and carrying rifles loitered on street corners near the courthouse. 50 F or most of the past year, Jeffrey and Lung'aho were held in separate wings of the Greene County Detention Center in rural Arkansas. Judges revoked bond for both of them less than a year after they were arrested. The courts faulted them for failing tests for cannabis use, missing check-ins, and, in Lunga'ho's case, an arrest for public intoxication. Recently, after pleading guilty to a single count of conspiracy to possess a destructive device, Jeffrey was transferred back to a detention center in Little Rock. 51 As both cases have plodded along for nearly two years, Jeffrey's supporters have continued their efforts to raise awareness and funds. She eventually hired Phillip Hamilton, a New York City-based corporate lawyer, as her counsel. In a motion to appeal her ongoing detention, Hamilton described Jeffrey's distress: Her long separation from her 12-year-old daughter and her family had reached \"the point where it was making her mentally and emotionally sick,\" Hamilton wrote, adding that he had been unable to communicate regularly with Jeffrey because of staffing shortages at the Pulaski County Regional Detention Facility. 52 When Jeffrey spoke to us in January, she described the pain of the family separation, noting that she was her daughter's primary caregiver. In the messages she sends to her daughter, \"I'm always reflecting that I love her, and that she's my forever,\" Jeffrey said. \"It's really hard not being in her life, making her lunch and dinner, tucking her into bed.\" 53 Lung'aho is still fighting his case and hoping that his battle can help others in his position. In November 2021, Kaiser filed a motion urging the judge to consider whether prosecutors had stretched \"the reach of federal criminal law beyond its constitutional bounds.\" He argues that the Justice Department lacks jurisdiction in the case, pointing out that federal funding for the affected police agencies is minuscule. \"From minute one, we've said this is a state case charged federally because of politics,\" Kaiser said in an interview. 54 Almost a year later, US District Judge D.P. Marshal ruled that although the destroyed police cars were not federal property nor purchased with federal financial assistance, Lung'aho could still be federally charged with arson. But Marshal dismissed three of Lung'aho's 13 charges, each of which prescribed a 30-year mandatory minimum sentence, for using a destructive device during a crime of violence. \"Federal arson is not a crime of violence,\" Marshal wrote-at least in Lung'aho's case. 55 The ruling dropped Lung'aho's maximum prison sentence from more than 90 years to somewhere between 10 and 30, according to Kaiser. But federal prosecutors immediately filed an appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which could take up to eight months to issue a ruling-and Lung'aho would remain in jail the whole time. 56 If the ruling is upheld, he is considering going to trial, despite the risk of prison time and the extraordinarily low success rates of federal defendants. 57 \"Ten years is scary, but the 30-to-life is what they threatened at the beginning, and now it's all gone,\" Kaiser said the morning of the ruling. Lung'aho is more willing to face a jury \"now that the potential sentence for accepting a plea deal is only slightly better than what we'd face at trial.\" 58 Meanwhile, Jeffrey's incarceration has been a devastating coda to a summer that initially held so much hope for change. Since then, the GOP-controlled Arkansas legislature has passed a raft of regressive bills loosening checks on police and private militias and restricting public education under the guise of stopping \"critical race theory.\" 59 The surveillance and prosecutions \"crumbled the activist movement in Arkansas, because nobody can trust anybody,\" said Brooklen Mason, a Little Rock activist who knows Jeffrey and several other defendants. \"And part of the work is being able to trust people.\" 60 The ACLU's Dickson agrees, noting that Jeffrey's long incarceration has had a \"chilling effect\" on local activism. \"That's not a defect,\" she said. \"That's part of the design.\" 61\n\nThe Little Rock Police Department told us it never investigated Fought's actions; there's no evidence assaults by police supporters were ever investigated. Instead, police immediately confronted Jeffrey, part of a pattern that summer in which Black activists and their allies say they were singled out for surveillance and mistreatment. 4 More From Aaron Miguel Cantú Oakland Residents Respond as the Largest Police Training in the World Invades September 21, 2015 New Yorkers Surge Into the Streets, Demanding Justice for Eric Garner December 4, 2014 What Happens When A City Decides to Offer Addicts Services, Not Prison Sentences?

In December 2020, five months after the incident at the State Capitol, Jeffrey was arrested for attending a nighttime attack where others threw homemade Molotov cocktails at empty police cars. There's no evidence Jeffrey herself made or used incendiary devices, but she acknowledged planning to slash tires and break car windows with others. 8 Had Donald Trump not been president, Jeffrey might have escaped with comparatively lenient felony vandalism charges under Arkansas law. Instead she became a target of a historic federal crackdown that year against racial justice protesters and organizers. In building these cases, prosecutors throughout the country leaned on rarely used conspiracy charges to cast a wide net. In Jeffrey's case, that meant a potential prison sentence of 30 years or more. She has been incarcerated since June 2021. 9 The national crackdown in 2020 was far from the first time the federal government has responded to Black liberation movements with repressive force to disrupt activist organizations before they gain momentum. But the cases in Little Rock are especially illustrative of this dynamic, which now spans two presidential administrations. 10 Nationwide, the 2020 racial justice protests resulted in at least 326 federal cases, according to Princess Masilungan, a staff attorney at Creating Law Enforcement Accountability & Responsibility (CLEAR) at the City University of New York School of Law. She is a coauthor of a report published by the Movement for Black Lives that documents the Trump administration's broad crackdown on Black activists in 2020. Some of those activists are still incarcerated or awaiting trial. 11 \"You can make very clear through lines between the uprisings of summer 2020 for racial justice and COINTELPRO in the 1950s and 1960s,\" Masilungan told us, referring to the notorious FBI counterintelligence program against political movements. \"In both instances, the federal government had the same goal, and that goal is disruption.\" A key strategy of disruption includes \"impairing the operational capabilities of the key threat actor,\" she said. 12 In Little Rock, that meant Dawn Jeffrey. 13 Groundswell of support: Supporters of activist Dawn Jeffrey are crowd-funding to support her legal fees. (Illustration by Rumba Yambú) A t the time of George Floyd's death, the Little Rock Police Department had already been accused of racist violence. In 2012, Officer Josh Hastings, who was known to have attended a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan, shot and killed 15-year-old Bobby Moore during an attempted car robbery. In February 2019, Officer Charles Starks killed Bradley Blackshire, 30, during a traffic stop. Hastings was fired and found civilly liable; Starks resigned. Both killings incited local outrage. Jeffrey and other activists saw them as part of a pattern. 14 Related Articles Why We Don't Say \"Reform the Police\" Mariame Kaba and Andrea J. Ritchie Defund the Police Algorithms Michelle Chen Redefining Freedom With Robin Kelley Omari Weekes Jeffrey had been involved in community work and political watchdogging for years. She said she attended her first protest after the 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin, and friends paint a picture of a dedicated activist. An award she received in 2018 from a local lifestyle magazine honored her community outreach work empowering Black youth, homeless people, and others in need-values she said she learned from her mother. 15 \"I'm just someone who cared about my community, an organizer who cared about what was going on with Black people-to me, 'Black Lives Matter' is a slogan, but I'm Black, and my life matters,\" she told us from jail. 16 I n early 2020, Jeffrey organized a campaign for a seat in the state legislature for her friend Ryan Davis, a prison reform activist and the executive director of UA Little Rock Children International, a partnership between the University of Arkansas and a nonprofit organization that serves families in the area. Davis lost by a single vote. 17 \"There are folks who are very vocal about the fact that they think [Jeffrey] was too loud, that she was, in their words, doing too much,\" Davis said. But \"I don't find anybody out here right now as intrepid as her, because she was such a powerful voice.\" 18 In the weeks following Floyd's murder, Jeffrey started a statewide bail fund for protesters. It's now a permanent fund for people in Little Rock who can't afford bail. 19 In a video promoting the fund, Jeffrey laid out her theory of change. \"Protests disrupt daily lives as usual, so it's good to start disrupting business as usual for them,\" she says. \"When you start taking it to them and put it in their face, where they can't ignore it, then they start listening and say, 'Well, what are they talking about?'\" 20 Other Arkansas activists shared her approach. Demonstrations for racial justice in Little Rock were disruptive but peaceful. That soon changed. Police amped up their use of riot munitions. Protesters smashed the windows of downtown businesses late in the night, according to police incident reports sent to us in response to a records request. 21 Arkansas State Police began using a \"fusion center,\" a post-9/11 innovation that was meant to facilitate information sharing between local and federal police for anti-terrorism purposes, to track even peaceful protesters-endangering First Amendment rights to free speech and assembly. Records indicate that the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Arkansas State Police compiled lists of upcoming protest events, including some explicitly described as peaceful, echoing the War on Terror-era surveillance of Muslim gatherings. 22 \"There was a concerted effort by law enforcement to do cross-agency cooperation and communication in response to these protests,\" said the ACLU's Dickson regarding the sharing of tips between the city police and state fusion center. \"It was very clear it was happening, from [the use of] infiltrators to [carrying out] open and obvious surveillance.\" 23 Apart from tracking Jeffrey, local police were following false leads, including an unsubstantiated rumor that busloads of antifa activists were booking hotels in the city. Federal and state police tracked protests across Arkansas, while US Attorney General Bill Barr activated all 56 of the nation's FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces, which rely on deputized local law enforcement, to stop \"violent radical elements.\" 24 In July, Barr traveled to Little Rock to meet with local law enforcement officials. In public remarks, he said the FBI's terrorism task forces were working with local police to share intelligence \"and go after the people we think are ringleaders\" behind protest violence. 25 The Nation and Type Investigations, in partnership with the Arkansas Nonprofit News Network, sent public records requests to the Arkansas State Police and Little Rock Police Department for all documents related to protest activity, rioting activity, and the destruction of property in Little Rock from June through September 2020. The response included hundreds of pages of e-mail records between local police, state intelligence officers, and federal agents. Taken together, they show authorities zeroing in on Black activists, including Jeffrey, for protest activity-while largely dismissing the threat posed by counterprotesters. 26 In an e-mail dated May 30, 2020, Heath Helton, the assistant police chief in Little Rock, warned of an event \"which to my understanding is being organized by Dawn Jeffrey.... Our partners at ASP [Arkansas State Police] and the State Capital have been made aware of this event, which is supposed to be peaceful.\" A June 1 screenshot of Jeffrey's Facebook page about a die-in-when protesters simulate being dead-also appears to have originated from the Arkansas fusion center. 27 The state police did not respond to questions we sent about Jeffrey. The Little Rock Police Department defended its approach. \"As with any policing agency, the role of LRPD is to protect the citizens ... they serve. Ms. Jeffrey had/has a public page which means it is viewable,\" a spokesperson for the department said. \"Therefore, there can be no violation in looking at a public page.\" 28 Jeffrey is by far the most mentioned activist in the law enforcement e-mails we reviewed. In one instance, surveillance records line up with an arrest. On July 12, she was arrested by local police at a demonstration outside of a custard shop in nearby Conway. A video recorded by a reporter shows police calling Jeffrey by name and then immediately handcuffing her without a clear reason. The Conway Police Department said she was arrested for trespassing. Intelligence officers for the Arkansas State Police were aware that Jeffrey would be at the event because they were monitoring her Facebook page in the fusion center and sent out an e-mail with a link to a livestream of the protest. While it's not clear whether this monitoring led directly to her arrest that day, the e-mail was one of at least eight sent by senior intelligence officials in the fusion center that referred to Jeffrey's organizing or her participation in nonviolent protests. By comparison, out of hundreds of e-mails and other communications, we saw few that referred to counterprotest groups-and even when they were mentioned, law enforcement focused not on the threat of violence they might pose but on possible violence initiated by racial justice protesters. In one e-mail, an FBI agent dismissed a man's threats \"encouraging the destruction of African Americans' property\" as \"just talking online.\" 29 Center of the dragnet: BLM protester Benjamin Mujera Lung'aho faces criminal charges after being surveilled for months. (Thomas Metthe / Arkansas Democrat-Gazette) T he heavy surveillance of the protesters ultimately caught up with Jeffrey-thanks in part to a T-shirt. 30 One of her closest friends, Mujera Benjamin Lung'aho, was also at the July protest at the Capitol. The two first met in high school, where they played soccer together, and reconnected years later as the racial justice uprising in Ferguson, Mo., reverberated across the country. They eventually grew close enough that Jeffrey spoke at Lung'aho's father's funeral. 31 At the Capitol clash, Lung'aho had worn a distinctive shirt. According to a warrant later filed to search his phone, a detective claimed to have recognized Lung'aho's shirt and other specific features from surveillance video taken a few days earlier during a vandalism spree at a local Confederate cemetery, where several people were caught on camera destroying monuments. Officers showed up at Lung'aho's residence and arrested him after a foot chase. \"Under the current climate, I just was compelled to flee,\" Lung'aho recalled in a conversation with us. 32 When the police searched his phone, they found encrypted group chats and social media messages that they claim tied him to high-profile demonstrations in Little Rock throughout 2020. This turned out to be a key moment for law enforcement-and a big payoff after months of tracking Black activists. 33 According to the authorities, messages on Lung'aho's phone indicated that he participated in several attacks on police vehicles. After arresting him, the police reached out to another alleged participant, Emily Terry, who'd messaged with Lung'aho the morning after the most recent outing. According to police documents, Terry positively identified others who were involved. Although a criminal complaint alleged that Terry threw a Molotov cocktail, Terry was never indicted. Terry declined to speak with us when reached by phone. 34 On December 17, Jeffrey was arrested and charged. Federal prosecutors alleged that she was present when Molotov cocktails were made at her house and drove with friends who tried but failed to set an empty squad car on fire. Three other activists, Renea Goddard, Loba Espinosa-Villegas, and Emily Nowlin, were also arrested and agreed to plead guilty to lesser charges. In interviews, they said they were friends with Jeffrey and that her home had become a haven for activists that summer. None recalled her plotting illegal actions, and the police affidavit doesn't identify her by name when describing the more serious incidents that night. 35 Espinosa-Villegas told us that it seemed, based on police questioning, that prosecutors saw Jeffrey and Lung'aho, the only Black defendants charged, as the \"big fish.\" 36 \"Their intention was to try and figure out, was it [Jeffrey or Lung'aho] who was the leader?\" The actual leader, Espinosa-Villegas said, was another person whom prosecutors accused of illegal actions, according to a criminal complaint naming multiple defendants. The documents also show that prosecutors named two others, including Terry, who allegedly committed similar crimes. None were indicted. 37 In repeated interviews, Jeffrey denied she had ever possessed or used a Molotov cocktail. Under immense pressure given the charges against her, and fearful of her chances at trial, she accepted a plea deal in May. In her plea agreement, Jeffrey acknowledged being present during the attack and the mixing of Molotov cocktails and \"agreed with others to commit acts of vandalism on government buildings and damaging police cars by puncturing tires and/or breaking windows.\" 38 \"There's no way you can be an American citizen feeling like you're being attacked or at war with your own government,\" she said in an interview. \"When do the scales balance for justice?\" 39 Jeffrey's supporters present an image of a leader dispensing hard truths about political injustices in America, unfairly persecuted by the powerful entities she criticized. By contrast, those on the other side of the political spectrum see her as a provocateur who got what she deserved. 40 In a Facebook group called \"Make Little Rock Great Again,\" whose moderators have alluded to being local police officers, an administrator of the page posted a cartoon of a police officer shooting a Black woman in the head, mocking a post by Jeffrey. One person commented, \"Be a shame if she came up missing,\" and followed that with: \"Lemme rephrase that correctly...replace she with it.\" When asked about the page, a police department spokesperson said, \"There's no way to conclusively determine if this page is moderated by any member of the Little Rock Police Department.\" 41 Lung'aho, a spoken-word artist, told us that he and Jeffrey had both been targeted for their politics. He's accused of throwing Molotov cocktails on multiple occasions and faces more time in prison than anybody else. \"The entire reason why we were doing the activism that we were involved in is because we were doing something for Black people,\" Lung'aho said, speaking to us from jail. 42 N ot all of the jurisdictions that experienced unrest in the wake of George Floyd's murder-even when that unrest turned destructive-resorted to federal prosecutions.

In 2012, Officer Josh Hastings, who was known to have attended a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan, shot and killed 15-year-old Bobby Moore during an attempted car robbery. In February 2019, Officer Charles Starks killed Bradley Blackshire, 30, during a traffic stop. Hastings was fired and found civilly liable; Starks resigned. Both killings incited local outrage. Jeffrey and other activists saw them as part of a pattern. 14 Related Articles Why We Don't Say \"Reform the Police\" Mariame Kaba and Andrea J. Ritchie Defund the Police Algorithms Michelle Chen Redefining Freedom With Robin Kelley Omari Weekes Jeffrey had been involved in community work and political watchdogging for years. She said she attended her first protest after the 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin, and friends paint a picture of a dedicated activist. An award she received in 2018 from a local lifestyle magazine honored her community outreach work empowering Black youth, homeless people, and others in need-values she said she learned from her mother. 15 \"I'm just someone who cared about my community, an organizer who cared about what was going on with Black people-to me, 'Black Lives Matter' is a slogan, but I'm Black, and my life matters,\" she told us from jail. 16 I n early 2020, Jeffrey organized a campaign for a seat in the state legislature for her friend Ryan Davis, a prison reform activist and the executive director of UA Little Rock Children International, a partnership between the University of Arkansas and a nonprofit organization that serves families in the area. Davis lost by a single vote. 17 \"There are folks who are very vocal about the fact that they think [Jeffrey] was too loud, that she was, in their words, doing too much,\" Davis said. But \"I don't find anybody out here right now as intrepid as her, because she was such a powerful voice.\" 18 In the weeks following Floyd's murder, Jeffrey started a statewide bail fund for protesters. It's now a permanent fund for people in Little Rock who can't afford bail. 19 In a video promoting the fund, Jeffrey laid out her theory of change. \"Protests disrupt daily lives as usual, so it's good to start disrupting business as usual for them,\" she says. \"When you start taking it to them and put it in their face, where they can't ignore it, then they start listening and say, 'Well, what are they talking about?'\" 20 Other Arkansas activists shared her approach. Demonstrations for racial justice in Little Rock were disruptive but peaceful. That soon changed. Police amped up their use of riot munitions. Protesters smashed the windows of downtown businesses late in the night, according to police incident reports sent to us in response to a records request. 21 Arkansas State Police began using a \"fusion center,\" a post-9/11 innovation that was meant to facilitate information sharing between local and federal police for anti-terrorism purposes, to track even peaceful protesters-endangering First Amendment rights to free speech and assembly. Records indicate that the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Arkansas State Police compiled lists of upcoming protest events, including some explicitly described as peaceful, echoing the War on Terror-era surveillance of Muslim gatherings. 22 \"There was a concerted effort by law enforcement to do cross-agency cooperation and communication in response to these protests,\" said the ACLU's Dickson regarding the sharing of tips between the city police and state fusion center. \"It was very clear it was happening, from [the use of] infiltrators to [carrying out] open and obvious surveillance.\" 23 Apart from tracking Jeffrey, local police were following false leads, including an unsubstantiated rumor that busloads of antifa activists were booking hotels in the city. Federal and state police tracked protests across Arkansas, while US Attorney General Bill Barr activated all 56 of the nation's FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces, which rely on deputized local law enforcement, to stop \"violent radical elements.\" 24 In July, Barr traveled to Little Rock to meet with local law enforcement officials. In public remarks, he said the FBI's terrorism task forces were working with local police to share intelligence \"and go after the people we think are ringleaders\" behind protest violence. 25 The Nation and Type Investigations, in partnership with the Arkansas Nonprofit News Network, sent public records requests to the Arkansas State Police and Little Rock Police Department for all documents related to protest activity, rioting activity, and the destruction of property in Little Rock from June through September 2020. The response included hundreds of pages of e-mail records between local police, state intelligence officers, and federal agents. Taken together, they show authorities zeroing in on Black activists, including Jeffrey, for protest activity-while largely dismissing the threat posed by counterprotesters. 26 In an e-mail dated May 30, 2020, Heath Helton, the assistant police chief in Little Rock, warned of an event \"which to my understanding is being organized by Dawn Jeffrey.... Our partners at ASP [Arkansas State Police] and the State Capital have been made aware of this event, which is supposed to be peaceful.\" A June 1 screenshot of Jeffrey's Facebook page about a die-in-when protesters simulate being dead-also appears to have originated from the Arkansas fusion center. 27 The state police did not respond to questions we sent about Jeffrey. The Little Rock Police Department defended its approach. \"As with any policing agency, the role of LRPD is to protect the citizens ... they serve. Ms. Jeffrey had/has a public page which means it is viewable,\" a spokesperson for the department said. \"Therefore, there can be no violation in looking at a public page.\" 28 Jeffrey is by far the most mentioned activist in the law enforcement e-mails we reviewed. In one instance, surveillance records line up with an arrest. On July 12, she was arrested by local police at a demonstration outside of a custard shop in nearby Conway. A video recorded by a reporter shows police calling Jeffrey by name and then immediately handcuffing her without a clear reason. The Conway Police Department said she was arrested for trespassing. Intelligence officers for the Arkansas State Police were aware that Jeffrey would be at the event because they were monitoring her Facebook page in the fusion center and sent out an e-mail with a link to a livestream of the protest. While it's not clear whether this monitoring led directly to her arrest that day, the e-mail was one of at least eight sent by senior intelligence officials in the fusion center that referred to Jeffrey's organizing or her participation in nonviolent protests. By comparison, out of hundreds of e-mails and other communications, we saw few that referred to counterprotest groups-and even when they were mentioned, law enforcement focused not on the threat of violence they might pose but on possible violence initiated by racial justice protesters. In one e-mail, an FBI agent dismissed a man's threats \"encouraging the destruction of African Americans' property\" as \"just talking online.\" 29 Center of the dragnet: BLM protester Benjamin Mujera Lung'aho faces criminal charges after being surveilled for months. (Thomas Metthe / Arkansas Democrat-Gazette) T he heavy surveillance of the protesters ultimately caught up with Jeffrey-thanks in part to a T-shirt. 30 One of her closest friends, Mujera Benjamin Lung'aho, was also at the July protest at the Capitol. The two first met in high school, where they played soccer together, and reconnected years later as the racial justice uprising in Ferguson, Mo., reverberated across the country. They eventually grew close enough that Jeffrey spoke at Lung'aho's father's funeral. 31 At the Capitol clash, Lung'aho had worn a distinctive shirt. According to a warrant later filed to search his phone, a detective claimed to have recognized Lung'aho's shirt and other specific features from surveillance video taken a few days earlier during a vandalism spree at a local Confederate cemetery, where several people were caught on camera destroying monuments. Officers showed up at Lung'aho's residence and arrested him after a foot chase. \"Under the current climate, I just was compelled to flee,\" Lung'aho recalled in a conversation with us. 32 When the police searched his phone, they found encrypted group chats and social media messages that they claim tied him to high-profile demonstrations in Little Rock throughout 2020. This turned out to be a key moment for law enforcement-and a big payoff after months of tracking Black activists. 33 According to the authorities, messages on Lung'aho's phone indicated that he participated in several attacks on police vehicles. After arresting him, the police reached out to another alleged participant, Emily Terry, who'd messaged with Lung'aho the morning after the most recent outing. According to police documents, Terry positively identified others who were involved. Although a criminal complaint alleged that Terry threw a Molotov cocktail, Terry was never indicted. Terry declined to speak with us when reached by phone. 34 On December 17, Jeffrey was arrested and charged. Federal prosecutors alleged that she was present when Molotov cocktails were made at her house and drove with friends who tried but failed to set an empty squad car on fire. Three other activists, Renea Goddard, Loba Espinosa-Villegas, and Emily Nowlin, were also arrested and agreed to plead guilty to lesser charges. In interviews, they said they were friends with Jeffrey and that her home had become a haven for activists that summer. None recalled her plotting illegal actions, and the police affidavit doesn't identify her by name when describing the more serious incidents that night. 35 Espinosa-Villegas told us that it seemed, based on police questioning, that prosecutors saw Jeffrey and Lung'aho, the only Black defendants charged, as the \"big fish.\" 36 \"Their intention was to try and figure out, was it [Jeffrey or Lung'aho] who was the leader?\" The actual leader, Espinosa-Villegas said, was another person whom prosecutors accused of illegal actions, according to a criminal complaint naming multiple defendants. The documents also show that prosecutors named two others, including Terry, who allegedly committed similar crimes. None were indicted. 37 In repeated interviews, Jeffrey denied she had ever possessed or used a Molotov cocktail. Under immense pressure given the charges against her, and fearful of her chances at trial, she accepted a plea deal in May. In her plea agreement, Jeffrey acknowledged being present during the attack and the mixing of Molotov cocktails and \"agreed with others to commit acts of vandalism on government buildings and damaging police cars by puncturing tires and/or breaking windows.\" 38 \"There's no way you can be an American citizen feeling like you're being attacked or at war with your own government,\" she said in an interview. \"When do the scales balance for justice?\" 39 Jeffrey's supporters present an image of a leader dispensing hard truths about political injustices in America, unfairly persecuted by the powerful entities she criticized. By contrast, those on the other side of the political spectrum see her as a provocateur who got what she deserved. 40 In a Facebook group called \"Make Little Rock Great Again,\" whose moderators have alluded to being local police officers, an administrator of the page posted a cartoon of a police officer shooting a Black woman in the head, mocking a post by Jeffrey. One person commented, \"Be a shame if she came up missing,\" and followed that with: \"Lemme rephrase that correctly...replace she with it.\" When asked about the page, a police department spokesperson said, \"There's no way to conclusively determine if this page is moderated by any member of the Little Rock Police Department.\" 41 Lung'aho, a spoken-word artist, told us that he and Jeffrey had both been targeted for their politics. He's accused of throwing Molotov cocktails on multiple occasions and faces more time in prison than anybody else. \"The entire reason why we were doing the activism that we were involved in is because we were doing something for Black people,\" Lung'aho said, speaking to us from jail. 42 N ot all of the jurisdictions that experienced unrest in the wake of George Floyd's murder-even when that unrest turned destructive-resorted to federal prosecutions. Our past reporting found that such prosecutions were especially likely in jurisdictions whose US attorneys were politically affiliated with the Trump administration. 43 In Little Rock, Trump had an ideological ally in Cody Hiland, then the US attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas. A former local prosecutor-and, before that, deputy chief of staff to former governor Mike Huckabee-Hiland showed an eagerness to pursue the Trump administration's political goals, once resurrecting an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. In Congress, GOP Senator Tom Cotton, who later called for federal troops to be deployed against racial justice protests, lauded Hiland's nomination by Trump. 44 In an op-ed published amid the protests, Hiland wrote, \"It is my prayer that the shrill cries of 'Defund the Police' always be muted by our nation's earnest declaration that we 'thank God for the Police.'\" 45 When police found messages and photos on Lung'aho's phone suggesting he was involved in the attacks, they sent the evidence to agents at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Hiland soon got personally involved in the case, inviting Lung'aho's attorney, Michael Kaiser, to meet with him at the police station where Lung'aho was being detained. 46 The US attorney hoped that he could persuade Lung'aho to provide information about other protesters, according to Kaiser. Hiland told Kaiser he had the authority to add several charges involving the use of a destructive device in a crime of violence that would carry sentences of 30 years to life. \"I hadn't ever seen that before,\" Kaiser said, adding that it was unusual for a US attorney to get so involved in a case that didn't involve charges like murder or drug trafficking. 47 Prosecutors' actions in the case align with findings from the Movement for Black Lives report. The authorities filed multiple and redundant charges against protesters, a technique critics say is meant to pressure defendants into accepting plea deals. The same technique was used by federal prosecutors against at least 84 racial justice protesters in 2020. One protester in Philadelphia was hit with four federal arson charges for burning two police cars, because the cars had benefited from federal funding and, the government claimed in a filing, had a role in interstate commerce. 48 Hiland resigned from his federal post in the final weeks of Trump's presidency and is now working on Sarah Huckabee Sanders's gubernatorial campaign; Sanders recently nominated him to be the next chair of the Arkansas Republican Party. Hiland didn't respond to our calls and texts regarding this story. 49 Meanwhile, local pro-Trump Facebook pages tracked Jeffrey's and Lung'aho's cases. During an early pretrial hearing for Lung'aho, over a dozen men wearing paramilitary clothing and carrying rifles loitered on street corners near the courthouse. 50 F or most of the past year, Jeffrey and Lung'aho were held in separate wings of the Greene County Detention Center in rural Arkansas. Judges revoked bond for both of them less than a year after they were arrested. The courts faulted them for failing tests for cannabis use, missing check-ins, and, in Lunga'ho's case, an arrest for public intoxication. Recently, after pleading guilty to a single count of conspiracy to possess a destructive device, Jeffrey was transferred back to a detention center in Little Rock. 51 As both cases have plodded along for nearly two years, Jeffrey's supporters have continued their efforts to raise awareness and funds. She eventually hired Phillip Hamilton, a New York City-based corporate lawyer, as her counsel. In a motion to appeal her ongoing detention, Hamilton described Jeffrey's distress: Her long separation from her 12-year-old daughter and her family had reached \"the point where it was making her mentally and emotionally sick,\" Hamilton wrote, adding that he had been unable to communicate regularly with Jeffrey because of staffing shortages at the Pulaski County Regional Detention Facility. 52 When Jeffrey spoke to us in January, she described the pain of the family separation, noting that she was her daughter's primary caregiver. In the messages she sends to her daughter, \"I'm always reflecting that I love her, and that she's my forever,\" Jeffrey said. \"It's really hard not being in her life, making her lunch and dinner, tucking her into bed.\" 53 Lung'aho is still fighting his case and hoping that his battle can help others in his position. In November 2021, Kaiser filed a motion urging the judge to consider whether prosecutors had stretched \"the reach of federal criminal law beyond its constitutional bounds.\" He argues that the Justice Department lacks jurisdiction in the case, pointing out that federal funding for the affected police agencies is minuscule. \"From minute one, we've said this is a state case charged federally because of politics,\" Kaiser said in an interview. 54 Almost a year later, US District Judge D.P. Marshal ruled that although the destroyed police cars were not federal property nor purchased with federal financial assistance, Lung'aho could still be federally charged with arson. But Marshal dismissed three of Lung'aho's 13 charges, each of which prescribed a 30-year mandatory minimum sentence, for using a destructive device during a crime of violence. \"Federal arson is not a crime of violence,\" Marshal wrote-at least in Lung'aho's case. 55 The ruling dropped Lung'aho's maximum prison sentence from more than 90 years to somewhere between 10 and 30, according to Kaiser. But federal prosecutors immediately filed an appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which could take up to eight months to issue a ruling-and Lung'aho would remain in jail the whole time. 56 If the ruling is upheld, he is considering going to trial, despite the risk of prison time and the extraordinarily low success rates of federal defendants. 57 \"Ten years is scary, but the 30-to-life is what they threatened at the beginning, and now it's all gone,\" Kaiser said the morning of the ruling. Lung'aho is more willing to face a jury \"now that the potential sentence for accepting a plea deal is only slightly better than what we'd face at trial.\" 58 Meanwhile, Jeffrey's incarceration has been a devastating coda to a summer that initially held so much hope for change. Since then, the GOP-controlled Arkansas legislature has passed a raft of regressive bills loosening checks on police and private militias and restricting public education under the guise of stopping \"critical race theory.\" 59 The surveillance and prosecutions \"crumbled the activist movement in Arkansas, because nobody can trust anybody,\" said Brooklen Mason, a Little Rock activist who knows Jeffrey and several other defendants. \"And part of the work is being able to trust people.\" 60 The ACLU's Dickson agrees, noting that Jeffrey's long incarceration has had a \"chilling effect\" on local activism. \"That's not a defect,\" she said. \"That's part of the design.\" 61\n\nThe Nation and Type Investigations reviewed hundreds of law enforcement e-mails obtained through records requests. They show that police began monitoring Jeffrey and other protesters just days after Floyd's murder, apparently for participating in peaceful demonstrations. This surveillance continued for months. 6 It's not unusual for police to monitor and attend protests, but what's troubling, notes Holly Dickson, the executive director of the ACLU of Arkansas, is the level of surveillance that Jeffrey and her fellow activists were subjected to. \"Anytime we have seen this kind of overreaction by law enforcement officers\" in Little Rock, \"it's in response to racial justice movements and gatherings organized by members of the Black community,\" Dickson said. 7 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal Current Issue View our current issue As the protests escalated across the country, Jeffrey's frustrations mounted-fueled in part by what she saw as harassment by police-and her actions grew more confrontational. In December 2020, five months after the incident at the State Capitol, Jeffrey was arrested for attending a nighttime attack where others threw homemade Molotov cocktails at empty police cars. There's no evidence Jeffrey herself made or used incendiary devices, but she acknowledged planning to slash tires and break car windows with others. 8 Had Donald Trump not been president, Jeffrey might have escaped with comparatively lenient felony vandalism charges under Arkansas law. Instead she became a target of a historic federal crackdown that year against racial justice protesters and organizers. In building these cases, prosecutors throughout the country leaned on rarely used conspiracy charges to cast a wide net. In Jeffrey's case, that meant a potential prison sentence of 30 years or more. She has been incarcerated since June 2021. 9 The national crackdown in 2020 was far from the first time the federal government has responded to Black liberation movements with repressive force to disrupt activist organizations before they gain momentum. But the cases in Little Rock are especially illustrative of this dynamic, which now spans two presidential administrations. 10 Nationwide, the 2020 racial justice protests resulted in at least 326 federal cases, according to Princess Masilungan, a staff attorney at Creating Law Enforcement Accountability & Responsibility (CLEAR) at the City University of New York School of Law. She is a coauthor of a report published by the Movement for Black Lives that documents the Trump administration's broad crackdown on Black activists in 2020. Some of those activists are still incarcerated or awaiting trial. 11 \"You can make very clear through lines between the uprisings of summer 2020 for racial justice and COINTELPRO in the 1950s and 1960s,\" Masilungan told us, referring to the notorious FBI counterintelligence program against political movements. \"In both instances, the federal government had the same goal, and that goal is disruption.\" A key strategy of disruption includes \"impairing the operational capabilities of the key threat actor,\" she said. 12 In Little Rock, that meant Dawn Jeffrey. 13 Groundswell of support: Supporters of activist Dawn Jeffrey are crowd-funding to support her legal fees.

In Congress, GOP Senator Tom Cotton, who later called for federal troops to be deployed against racial justice protests, lauded Hiland's nomination by Trump. 44 In an op-ed published amid the protests, Hiland wrote, \"It is my prayer that the shrill cries of 'Defund the Police' always be muted by our nation's earnest declaration that we 'thank God for the Police.'\" 45 When police found messages and photos on Lung'aho's phone suggesting he was involved in the attacks, they sent the evidence to agents at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Hiland soon got personally involved in the case, inviting Lung'aho's attorney, Michael Kaiser, to meet with him at the police station where Lung'aho was being detained. 46 The US attorney hoped that he could persuade Lung'aho to provide information about other protesters, according to Kaiser. Hiland told Kaiser he had the authority to add several charges involving the use of a destructive device in a crime of violence that would carry sentences of 30 years to life. \"I hadn't ever seen that before,\" Kaiser said, adding that it was unusual for a US attorney to get so involved in a case that didn't involve charges like murder or drug trafficking. 47 Prosecutors' actions in the case align with findings from the Movement for Black Lives report. The authorities filed multiple and redundant charges against protesters, a technique critics say is meant to pressure defendants into accepting plea deals. The same technique was used by federal prosecutors against at least 84 racial justice protesters in 2020. One protester in Philadelphia was hit with four federal arson charges for burning two police cars, because the cars had benefited from federal funding and, the government claimed in a filing, had a role in interstate commerce. 48 Hiland resigned from his federal post in the final weeks of Trump's presidency and is now working on Sarah Huckabee Sanders's gubernatorial campaign; Sanders recently nominated him to be the next chair of the Arkansas Republican Party. Hiland didn't respond to our calls and texts regarding this story. 49 Meanwhile, local pro-Trump Facebook pages tracked Jeffrey's and Lung'aho's cases. During an early pretrial hearing for Lung'aho, over a dozen men wearing paramilitary clothing and carrying rifles loitered on street corners near the courthouse. 50 F or most of the past year, Jeffrey and Lung'aho were held in separate wings of the Greene County Detention Center in rural Arkansas. Judges revoked bond for both of them less than a year after they were arrested. The courts faulted them for failing tests for cannabis use, missing check-ins, and, in Lunga'ho's case, an arrest for public intoxication. Recently, after pleading guilty to a single count of conspiracy to possess a destructive device, Jeffrey was transferred back to a detention center in Little Rock. 51 As both cases have plodded along for nearly two years, Jeffrey's supporters have continued their efforts to raise awareness and funds. She eventually hired Phillip Hamilton, a New York City-based corporate lawyer, as her counsel. In a motion to appeal her ongoing detention, Hamilton described Jeffrey's distress: Her long separation from her 12-year-old daughter and her family had reached \"the point where it was making her mentally and emotionally sick,\" Hamilton wrote, adding that he had been unable to communicate regularly with Jeffrey because of staffing shortages at the Pulaski County Regional Detention Facility. 52 When Jeffrey spoke to us in January, she described the pain of the family separation, noting that she was her daughter's primary caregiver. In the messages she sends to her daughter, \"I'm always reflecting that I love her, and that she's my forever,\" Jeffrey said. \"It's really hard not being in her life, making her lunch and dinner, tucking her into bed.\" 53 Lung'aho is still fighting his case and hoping that his battle can help others in his position. In November 2021, Kaiser filed a motion urging the judge to consider whether prosecutors had stretched \"the reach of federal criminal law beyond its constitutional bounds.\" He argues that the Justice Department lacks jurisdiction in the case, pointing out that federal funding for the affected police agencies is minuscule. \"From minute one, we've said this is a state case charged federally because of politics,\" Kaiser said in an interview. 54 Almost a year later, US District Judge D.P. Marshal ruled that although the destroyed police cars were not federal property nor purchased with federal financial assistance, Lung'aho could still be federally charged with arson. But Marshal dismissed three of Lung'aho's 13 charges, each of which prescribed a 30-year mandatory minimum sentence, for using a destructive device during a crime of violence. \"Federal arson is not a crime of violence,\" Marshal wrote-at least in Lung'aho's case. 55 The ruling dropped Lung'aho's maximum prison sentence from more than 90 years to somewhere between 10 and 30, according to Kaiser. But federal prosecutors immediately filed an appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which could take up to eight months to issue a ruling-and Lung'aho would remain in jail the whole time. 56 If the ruling is upheld, he is considering going to trial, despite the risk of prison time and the extraordinarily low success rates of federal defendants. 57 \"Ten years is scary, but the 30-to-life is what they threatened at the beginning, and now it's all gone,\" Kaiser said the morning of the ruling. Lung'aho is more willing to face a jury \"now that the potential sentence for accepting a plea deal is only slightly better than what we'd face at trial.\" 58 Meanwhile, Jeffrey's incarceration has been a devastating coda to a summer that initially held so much hope for change. Since then, the GOP-controlled Arkansas legislature has passed a raft of regressive bills loosening checks on police and private militias and restricting public education under the guise of stopping \"critical race theory.\" 59 The surveillance and prosecutions \"crumbled the activist movement in Arkansas, because nobody can trust anybody,\" said Brooklen Mason, a Little Rock activist who knows Jeffrey and several other defendants. \"And part of the work is being able to trust people.\" 60 The ACLU's Dickson agrees, noting that Jeffrey's long incarceration has had a \"chilling effect\" on local activism. \"That's not a defect,\" she said. \"That's part of the design.\" 61\n\nIt's not unusual for police to monitor and attend protests, but what's troubling, notes Holly Dickson, the executive director of the ACLU of Arkansas, is the level of surveillance that Jeffrey and her fellow activists were subjected to. \"Anytime we have seen this kind of overreaction by law enforcement officers\" in Little Rock, \"it's in response to racial justice movements and gatherings organized by members of the Black community,\" Dickson said. 7 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal Current Issue View our current issue As the protests escalated across the country, Jeffrey's frustrations mounted-fueled in part by what she saw as harassment by police-and her actions grew more confrontational. In December 2020, five months after the incident at the State Capitol, Jeffrey was arrested for attending a nighttime attack where others threw homemade Molotov cocktails at empty police cars. There's no evidence Jeffrey herself made or used incendiary devices, but she acknowledged planning to slash tires and break car windows with others. 8 Had Donald Trump not been president, Jeffrey might have escaped with comparatively lenient felony vandalism charges under Arkansas law. Instead she became a target of a historic federal crackdown that year against racial justice protesters and organizers. In building these cases, prosecutors throughout the country leaned on rarely used conspiracy charges to cast a wide net. In Jeffrey's case, that meant a potential prison sentence of 30 years or more. She has been incarcerated since June 2021. 9 The national crackdown in 2020 was far from the first time the federal government has responded to Black liberation movements with repressive force to disrupt activist organizations before they gain momentum. But the cases in Little Rock are especially illustrative of this dynamic, which now spans two presidential administrations. 10 Nationwide, the 2020 racial justice protests resulted in at least 326 federal cases, according to Princess Masilungan, a staff attorney at Creating Law Enforcement Accountability & Responsibility (CLEAR) at the City University of New York School of Law. She is a coauthor of a report published by the Movement for Black Lives that documents the Trump administration's broad crackdown on Black activists in 2020. Some of those activists are still incarcerated or awaiting trial. 11 \"You can make very clear through lines between the uprisings of summer 2020 for racial justice and COINTELPRO in the 1950s and 1960s,\" Masilungan told us, referring to the notorious FBI counterintelligence program against political movements. \"In both instances, the federal government had the same goal, and that goal is disruption.\" A key strategy of disruption includes \"impairing the operational capabilities of the key threat actor,\" she said. 12 In Little Rock, that meant Dawn Jeffrey. 13 Groundswell of support: Supporters of activist Dawn Jeffrey are crowd-funding to support her legal fees. (Illustration by Rumba Yambú) A t the time of George Floyd's death, the Little Rock Police Department had already been accused of racist violence. In 2012, Officer Josh Hastings, who was known to have attended a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan, shot and killed 15-year-old Bobby Moore during an attempted car robbery. In February 2019, Officer Charles Starks killed Bradley Blackshire, 30, during a traffic stop. Hastings was fired and found civilly liable; Starks resigned. Both killings incited local outrage. Jeffrey and other activists saw them as part of a pattern. 14 Related Articles Why We Don't Say \"Reform the Police\" Mariame Kaba and Andrea J. Ritchie Defund the Police Algorithms Michelle Chen Redefining Freedom With Robin Kelley Omari Weekes Jeffrey had been involved in community work and political watchdogging for years. She said she attended her first protest after the 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin, and friends paint a picture of a dedicated activist. An award she received in 2018 from a local lifestyle magazine honored her community outreach work empowering Black youth, homeless people, and others in need-values she said she learned from her mother. 15 \"I'm just someone who cared about my community, an organizer who cared about what was going on with Black people-to me, 'Black Lives Matter' is a slogan, but I'm Black, and my life matters,\" she told us from jail. 16 I n early 2020, Jeffrey organized a campaign for a seat in the state legislature for her friend Ryan Davis, a prison reform activist and the executive director of UA Little Rock Children International, a partnership between the University of Arkansas and a nonprofit organization that serves families in the area. Davis lost by a single vote. 17 \"There are folks who are very vocal about the fact that they think [Jeffrey] was too loud, that she was, in their words, doing too much,\" Davis said. But \"I don't find anybody out here right now as intrepid as her, because she was such a powerful voice.\" 18 In the weeks following Floyd's murder, Jeffrey started a statewide bail fund for protesters. It's now a permanent fund for people in Little Rock who can't afford bail. 19 In a video promoting the fund, Jeffrey laid out her theory of change. \"Protests disrupt daily lives as usual, so it's good to start disrupting business as usual for them,\" she says. \"When you start taking it to them and put it in their face, where they can't ignore it, then they start listening and say, 'Well, what are they talking about?'\" 20 Other Arkansas activists shared her approach. Demonstrations for racial justice in Little Rock were disruptive but peaceful. That soon changed. Police amped up their use of riot munitions. Protesters smashed the windows of downtown businesses late in the night, according to police incident reports sent to us in response to a records request. 21 Arkansas State Police began using a \"fusion center,\" a post-9/11 innovation that was meant to facilitate information sharing between local and federal police for anti-terrorism purposes, to track even peaceful protesters-endangering First Amendment rights to free speech and assembly. Records indicate that the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Arkansas State Police compiled lists of upcoming protest events, including some explicitly described as peaceful, echoing the War on Terror-era surveillance of Muslim gatherings. 22 \"There was a concerted effort by law enforcement to do cross-agency cooperation and communication in response to these protests,\" said the ACLU's Dickson regarding the sharing of tips between the city police and state fusion center. \"It was very clear it was happening, from [the use of] infiltrators to [carrying out] open and obvious surveillance.\" 23 Apart from tracking Jeffrey, local police were following false leads, including an unsubstantiated rumor that busloads of antifa activists were booking hotels in the city. Federal and state police tracked protests across Arkansas, while US Attorney General Bill Barr activated all 56 of the nation's FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces, which rely on deputized local law enforcement, to stop \"violent radical elements.\" 24 In July, Barr traveled to Little Rock to meet with local law enforcement officials. In public remarks, he said the FBI's terrorism task forces were working with local police to share intelligence \"and go after the people we think are ringleaders\" behind protest violence. 25 The Nation and Type Investigations, in partnership with the Arkansas Nonprofit News Network, sent public records requests to the Arkansas State Police and Little Rock Police Department for all documents related to protest activity, rioting activity, and the destruction of property in Little Rock from June through September 2020. The response included hundreds of pages of e-mail records between local police, state intelligence officers, and federal agents. Taken together, they show authorities zeroing in on Black activists, including Jeffrey, for protest activity-while largely dismissing the threat posed by counterprotesters. 26 In an e-mail dated May 30, 2020, Heath Helton, the assistant police chief in Little Rock, warned of an event \"which to my understanding is being organized by Dawn Jeffrey.... Our partners at ASP [Arkansas State Police] and the State Capital have been made aware of this event, which is supposed to be peaceful.\" A June 1 screenshot of Jeffrey's Facebook page about a die-in-when protesters simulate being dead-also appears to have originated from the Arkansas fusion center. 27 The state police did not respond to questions we sent about Jeffrey. The Little Rock Police Department defended its approach. \"As with any policing agency, the role of LRPD is to protect the citizens ... they serve. Ms. Jeffrey had/has a public page which means it is viewable,\" a spokesperson for the department said. \"Therefore, there can be no violation in looking at a public page.\" 28 Jeffrey is by far the most mentioned activist in the law enforcement e-mails we reviewed. In one instance, surveillance records line up with an arrest. On July 12, she was arrested by local police at a demonstration outside of a custard shop in nearby Conway. A video recorded by a reporter shows police calling Jeffrey by name and then immediately handcuffing her without a clear reason. The Conway Police Department said she was arrested for trespassing. Intelligence officers for the Arkansas State Police were aware that Jeffrey would be at the event because they were monitoring her Facebook page in the fusion center and sent out an e-mail with a link to a livestream of the protest. While it's not clear whether this monitoring led directly to her arrest that day, the e-mail was one of at least eight sent by senior intelligence officials in the fusion center that referred to Jeffrey's organizing or her participation in nonviolent protests. By comparison, out of hundreds of e-mails and other communications, we saw few that referred to counterprotest groups-and even when they were mentioned, law enforcement focused not on the threat of violence they might pose but on possible violence initiated by racial justice protesters. In one e-mail, an FBI agent dismissed a man's threats \"encouraging the destruction of African Americans' property\" as \"just talking online.\" 29 Center of the dragnet: BLM protester Benjamin Mujera Lung'aho faces criminal charges after being surveilled for months. (Thomas Metthe / Arkansas Democrat-Gazette) T he heavy surveillance of the protesters ultimately caught up with Jeffrey-thanks in part to a T-shirt. 30 One of her closest friends, Mujera Benjamin Lung'aho, was also at the July protest at the Capitol. The two first met in high school, where they played soccer together, and reconnected years later as the racial justice uprising in Ferguson, Mo., reverberated across the country. They eventually grew close enough that Jeffrey spoke at Lung'aho's father's funeral. 31 At the Capitol clash, Lung'aho had worn a distinctive shirt. According to a warrant later filed to search his phone, a detective claimed to have recognized Lung'aho's shirt and other specific features from surveillance video taken a few days earlier during a vandalism spree at a local Confederate cemetery, where several people were caught on camera destroying monuments. Officers showed up at Lung'aho's residence and arrested him after a foot chase. \"Under the current climate, I just was compelled to flee,\" Lung'aho recalled in a conversation with us. 32 When the police searched his phone, they found encrypted group chats and social media messages that they claim tied him to high-profile demonstrations in Little Rock throughout 2020. This turned out to be a key moment for law enforcement-and a big payoff after months of tracking Black activists. 33 According to the authorities, messages on Lung'aho's phone indicated that he participated in several attacks on police vehicles. After arresting him, the police reached out to another alleged participant, Emily Terry, who'd messaged with Lung'aho the morning after the most recent outing. According to police documents, Terry positively identified others who were involved. Although a criminal complaint alleged that Terry threw a Molotov cocktail, Terry was never indicted. Terry declined to speak with us when reached by phone. 34 On December 17, Jeffrey was arrested and charged. Federal prosecutors alleged that she was present when Molotov cocktails were made at her house and drove with friends who tried but failed to set an empty squad car on fire. Three other activists, Renea Goddard, Loba Espinosa-Villegas, and Emily Nowlin, were also arrested and agreed to plead guilty to lesser charges. In interviews, they said they were friends with Jeffrey and that her home had become a haven for activists that summer. None recalled her plotting illegal actions, and the police affidavit doesn't identify her by name when describing the more serious incidents that night. 35 Espinosa-Villegas told us that it seemed, based on police questioning, that prosecutors saw Jeffrey and Lung'aho, the only Black defendants charged, as the \"big fish.\" 36 \"Their intention was to try and figure out, was it [Jeffrey or Lung'aho] who was the leader?\" The actual leader, Espinosa-Villegas said, was another person whom prosecutors accused of illegal actions, according to a criminal complaint naming multiple defendants. The documents also show that prosecutors named two others, including Terry, who allegedly committed similar crimes. None were indicted. 37 In repeated interviews, Jeffrey denied she had ever possessed or used a Molotov cocktail. Under immense pressure given the charges against her, and fearful of her chances at trial, she accepted a plea deal in May. In her plea agreement, Jeffrey acknowledged being present during the attack and the mixing of Molotov cocktails and \"agreed with others to commit acts of vandalism on government buildings and damaging police cars by puncturing tires and/or breaking windows.\" 38 \"There's no way you can be an American citizen feeling like you're being attacked or at war with your own government,\" she said in an interview. \"When do the scales balance for justice?\" 39 Jeffrey's supporters present an image of a leader dispensing hard truths about political injustices in America, unfairly persecuted by the powerful entities she criticized. By contrast, those on the other side of the political spectrum see her as a provocateur who got what she deserved. 40 In a Facebook group called \"Make Little Rock Great Again,\" whose moderators have alluded to being local police officers, an administrator of the page posted a cartoon of a police officer shooting a Black woman in the head, mocking a post by Jeffrey. One person commented, \"Be a shame if she came up missing,\" and followed that with: \"Lemme rephrase that correctly...replace she with it.\" When asked about the page, a police department spokesperson said, \"There's no way to conclusively determine if this page is moderated by any member of the Little Rock Police Department.\" 41 Lung'aho, a spoken-word artist, told us that he and Jeffrey had both been targeted for their politics. He's accused of throwing Molotov cocktails on multiple occasions and faces more time in prison than anybody else. \"The entire reason why we were doing the activism that we were involved in is because we were doing something for Black people,\" Lung'aho said, speaking to us from jail. 42 N ot all of the jurisdictions that experienced unrest in the wake of George Floyd's murder-even when that unrest turned destructive-resorted to federal prosecutions.

Federal and state police tracked protests across Arkansas, while US Attorney General Bill Barr activated all 56 of the nation's FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces, which rely on deputized local law enforcement, to stop \"violent radical elements.\" 24 In July, Barr traveled to Little Rock to meet with local law enforcement officials. In public remarks, he said the FBI's terrorism task forces were working with local police to share intelligence \"and go after the people we think are ringleaders\" behind protest violence. 25 The Nation and Type Investigations, in partnership with the Arkansas Nonprofit News Network, sent public records requests to the Arkansas State Police and Little Rock Police Department for all documents related to protest activity, rioting activity, and the destruction of property in Little Rock from June through September 2020. The response included hundreds of pages of e-mail records between local police, state intelligence officers, and federal agents. Taken together, they show authorities zeroing in on Black activists, including Jeffrey, for protest activity-while largely dismissing the threat posed by counterprotesters. 26 In an e-mail dated May 30, 2020, Heath Helton, the assistant police chief in Little Rock, warned of an event \"which to my understanding is being organized by Dawn Jeffrey.... Our partners at ASP [Arkansas State Police] and the State Capital have been made aware of this event, which is supposed to be peaceful.\" A June 1 screenshot of Jeffrey's Facebook page about a die-in-when protesters simulate being dead-also appears to have originated from the Arkansas fusion center. 27 The state police did not respond to questions we sent about Jeffrey. The Little Rock Police Department defended its approach. \"As with any policing agency, the role of LRPD is to protect the citizens ... they serve. Ms. Jeffrey had/has a public page which means it is viewable,\" a spokesperson for the department said. \"Therefore, there can be no violation in looking at a public page.\" 28 Jeffrey is by far the most mentioned activist in the law enforcement e-mails we reviewed. In one instance, surveillance records line up with an arrest. On July 12, she was arrested by local police at a demonstration outside of a custard shop in nearby Conway. A video recorded by a reporter shows police calling Jeffrey by name and then immediately handcuffing her without a clear reason. The Conway Police Department said she was arrested for trespassing. Intelligence officers for the Arkansas State Police were aware that Jeffrey would be at the event because they were monitoring her Facebook page in the fusion center and sent out an e-mail with a link to a livestream of the protest. While it's not clear whether this monitoring led directly to her arrest that day, the e-mail was one of at least eight sent by senior intelligence officials in the fusion center that referred to Jeffrey's organizing or her participation in nonviolent protests. By comparison, out of hundreds of e-mails and other communications, we saw few that referred to counterprotest groups-and even when they were mentioned, law enforcement focused not on the threat of violence they might pose but on possible violence initiated by racial justice protesters. In one e-mail, an FBI agent dismissed a man's threats \"encouraging the destruction of African Americans' property\" as \"just talking online.\" 29 Center of the dragnet: BLM protester Benjamin Mujera Lung'aho faces criminal charges after being surveilled for months. (Thomas Metthe / Arkansas Democrat-Gazette) T he heavy surveillance of the protesters ultimately caught up with Jeffrey-thanks in part to a T-shirt. 30 One of her closest friends, Mujera Benjamin Lung'aho, was also at the July protest at the Capitol. The two first met in high school, where they played soccer together, and reconnected years later as the racial justice uprising in Ferguson, Mo., reverberated across the country. They eventually grew close enough that Jeffrey spoke at Lung'aho's father's funeral. 31 At the Capitol clash, Lung'aho had worn a distinctive shirt. According to a warrant later filed to search his phone, a detective claimed to have recognized Lung'aho's shirt and other specific features from surveillance video taken a few days earlier during a vandalism spree at a local Confederate cemetery, where several people were caught on camera destroying monuments. Officers showed up at Lung'aho's residence and arrested him after a foot chase. \"Under the current climate, I just was compelled to flee,\" Lung'aho recalled in a conversation with us. 32 When the police searched his phone, they found encrypted group chats and social media messages that they claim tied him to high-profile demonstrations in Little Rock throughout 2020. This turned out to be a key moment for law enforcement-and a big payoff after months of tracking Black activists. 33 According to the authorities, messages on Lung'aho's phone indicated that he participated in several attacks on police vehicles. After arresting him, the police reached out to another alleged participant, Emily Terry, who'd messaged with Lung'aho the morning after the most recent outing. According to police documents, Terry positively identified others who were involved. Although a criminal complaint alleged that Terry threw a Molotov cocktail, Terry was never indicted. Terry declined to speak with us when reached by phone. 34 On December 17, Jeffrey was arrested and charged. Federal prosecutors alleged that she was present when Molotov cocktails were made at her house and drove with friends who tried but failed to set an empty squad car on fire. Three other activists, Renea Goddard, Loba Espinosa-Villegas, and Emily Nowlin, were also arrested and agreed to plead guilty to lesser charges. In interviews, they said they were friends with Jeffrey and that her home had become a haven for activists that summer. None recalled her plotting illegal actions, and the police affidavit doesn't identify her by name when describing the more serious incidents that night. 35 Espinosa-Villegas told us that it seemed, based on police questioning, that prosecutors saw Jeffrey and Lung'aho, the only Black defendants charged, as the \"big fish.\" 36 \"Their intention was to try and figure out, was it [Jeffrey or Lung'aho] who was the leader?\" The actual leader, Espinosa-Villegas said, was another person whom prosecutors accused of illegal actions, according to a criminal complaint naming multiple defendants. The documents also show that prosecutors named two others, including Terry, who allegedly committed similar crimes. None were indicted. 37 In repeated interviews, Jeffrey denied she had ever possessed or used a Molotov cocktail. Under immense pressure given the charges against her, and fearful of her chances at trial, she accepted a plea deal in May. In her plea agreement, Jeffrey acknowledged being present during the attack and the mixing of Molotov cocktails and \"agreed with others to commit acts of vandalism on government buildings and damaging police cars by puncturing tires and/or breaking windows.\" 38 \"There's no way you can be an American citizen feeling like you're being attacked or at war with your own government,\" she said in an interview. \"When do the scales balance for justice?\" 39 Jeffrey's supporters present an image of a leader dispensing hard truths about political injustices in America, unfairly persecuted by the powerful entities she criticized. By contrast, those on the other side of the political spectrum see her as a provocateur who got what she deserved. 40 In a Facebook group called \"Make Little Rock Great Again,\" whose moderators have alluded to being local police officers, an administrator of the page posted a cartoon of a police officer shooting a Black woman in the head, mocking a post by Jeffrey. One person commented, \"Be a shame if she came up missing,\" and followed that with: \"Lemme rephrase that correctly...replace she with it.\" When asked about the page, a police department spokesperson said, \"There's no way to conclusively determine if this page is moderated by any member of the Little Rock Police Department.\" 41 Lung'aho, a spoken-word artist, told us that he and Jeffrey had both been targeted for their politics. He's accused of throwing Molotov cocktails on multiple occasions and faces more time in prison than anybody else. \"The entire reason why we were doing the activism that we were involved in is because we were doing something for Black people,\" Lung'aho said, speaking to us from jail. 42 N ot all of the jurisdictions that experienced unrest in the wake of George Floyd's murder-even when that unrest turned destructive-resorted to federal prosecutions. Our past reporting found that such prosecutions were especially likely in jurisdictions whose US attorneys were politically affiliated with the Trump administration. 43 In Little Rock, Trump had an ideological ally in Cody Hiland, then the US attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas. A former local prosecutor-and, before that, deputy chief of staff to former governor Mike Huckabee-Hiland showed an eagerness to pursue the Trump administration's political goals, once resurrecting an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. In Congress, GOP Senator Tom Cotton, who later called for federal troops to be deployed against racial justice protests, lauded Hiland's nomination by Trump. 44 In an op-ed published amid the protests, Hiland wrote, \"It is my prayer that the shrill cries of 'Defund the Police' always be muted by our nation's earnest declaration that we 'thank God for the Police.'\" 45 When police found messages and photos on Lung'aho's phone suggesting he was involved in the attacks, they sent the evidence to agents at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Hiland soon got personally involved in the case, inviting Lung'aho's attorney, Michael Kaiser, to meet with him at the police station where Lung'aho was being detained. 46 The US attorney hoped that he could persuade Lung'aho to provide information about other protesters, according to Kaiser. Hiland told Kaiser he had the authority to add several charges involving the use of a destructive device in a crime of violence that would carry sentences of 30 years to life. \"I hadn't ever seen that before,\" Kaiser said, adding that it was unusual for a US attorney to get so involved in a case that didn't involve charges like murder or drug trafficking. 47 Prosecutors' actions in the case align with findings from the Movement for Black Lives report. The authorities filed multiple and redundant charges against protesters, a technique critics say is meant to pressure defendants into accepting plea deals. The same technique was used by federal prosecutors against at least 84 racial justice protesters in 2020. One protester in Philadelphia was hit with four federal arson charges for burning two police cars, because the cars had benefited from federal funding and, the government claimed in a filing, had a role in interstate commerce. 48 Hiland resigned from his federal post in the final weeks of Trump's presidency and is now working on Sarah Huckabee Sanders's gubernatorial campaign; Sanders recently nominated him to be the next chair of the Arkansas Republican Party. Hiland didn't respond to our calls and texts regarding this story. 49 Meanwhile, local pro-Trump Facebook pages tracked Jeffrey's and Lung'aho's cases. During an early pretrial hearing for Lung'aho, over a dozen men wearing paramilitary clothing and carrying rifles loitered on street corners near the courthouse. 50 F or most of the past year, Jeffrey and Lung'aho were held in separate wings of the Greene County Detention Center in rural Arkansas. Judges revoked bond for both of them less than a year after they were arrested. The courts faulted them for failing tests for cannabis use, missing check-ins, and, in Lunga'ho's case, an arrest for public intoxication. Recently, after pleading guilty to a single count of conspiracy to possess a destructive device, Jeffrey was transferred back to a detention center in Little Rock. 51 As both cases have plodded along for nearly two years, Jeffrey's supporters have continued their efforts to raise awareness and funds. She eventually hired Phillip Hamilton, a New York City-based corporate lawyer, as her counsel. In a motion to appeal her ongoing detention, Hamilton described Jeffrey's distress: Her long separation from her 12-year-old daughter and her family had reached \"the point where it was making her mentally and emotionally sick,\" Hamilton wrote, adding that he had been unable to communicate regularly with Jeffrey because of staffing shortages at the Pulaski County Regional Detention Facility. 52 When Jeffrey spoke to us in January, she described the pain of the family separation, noting that she was her daughter's primary caregiver. In the messages she sends to her daughter, \"I'm always reflecting that I love her, and that she's my forever,\" Jeffrey said. \"It's really hard not being in her life, making her lunch and dinner, tucking her into bed.\" 53 Lung'aho is still fighting his case and hoping that his battle can help others in his position. In November 2021, Kaiser filed a motion urging the judge to consider whether prosecutors had stretched \"the reach of federal criminal law beyond its constitutional bounds.\" He argues that the Justice Department lacks jurisdiction in the case, pointing out that federal funding for the affected police agencies is minuscule. \"From minute one, we've said this is a state case charged federally because of politics,\" Kaiser said in an interview. 54 Almost a year later, US District Judge D.P. Marshal ruled that although the destroyed police cars were not federal property nor purchased with federal financial assistance, Lung'aho could still be federally charged with arson. But Marshal dismissed three of Lung'aho's 13 charges, each of which prescribed a 30-year mandatory minimum sentence, for using a destructive device during a crime of violence. \"Federal arson is not a crime of violence,\" Marshal wrote-at least in Lung'aho's case. 55 The ruling dropped Lung'aho's maximum prison sentence from more than 90 years to somewhere between 10 and 30, according to Kaiser. But federal prosecutors immediately filed an appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which could take up to eight months to issue a ruling-and Lung'aho would remain in jail the whole time. 56 If the ruling is upheld, he is considering going to trial, despite the risk of prison time and the extraordinarily low success rates of federal defendants. 57 \"Ten years is scary, but the 30-to-life is what they threatened at the beginning, and now it's all gone,\" Kaiser said the morning of the ruling. Lung'aho is more willing to face a jury \"now that the potential sentence for accepting a plea deal is only slightly better than what we'd face at trial.\" 58 Meanwhile, Jeffrey's incarceration has been a devastating coda to a summer that initially held so much hope for change. Since then, the GOP-controlled Arkansas legislature has passed a raft of regressive bills loosening checks on police and private militias and restricting public education under the guise of stopping \"critical race theory.\" 59 The surveillance and prosecutions \"crumbled the activist movement in Arkansas, because nobody can trust anybody,\" said Brooklen Mason, a Little Rock activist who knows Jeffrey and several other defendants. \"And part of the work is being able to trust people.\" 60 The ACLU's Dickson agrees, noting that Jeffrey's long incarceration has had a \"chilling effect\" on local activism. \"That's not a defect,\" she said. \"That's part of the design.\" 61\n\nHad Donald Trump not been president, Jeffrey might have escaped with comparatively lenient felony vandalism charges under Arkansas law. Instead she became a target of a historic federal crackdown that year against racial justice protesters and organizers. In building these cases, prosecutors throughout the country leaned on rarely used conspiracy charges to cast a wide net. In Jeffrey's case, that meant a potential prison sentence of 30 years or more. She has been incarcerated since June 2021. 9 The national crackdown in 2020 was far from the first time the federal government has responded to Black liberation movements with repressive force to disrupt activist organizations before they gain momentum. But the cases in Little Rock are especially illustrative of this dynamic, which now spans two presidential administrations. 10 Nationwide, the 2020 racial justice protests resulted in at least 326 federal cases, according to Princess Masilungan, a staff attorney at Creating Law Enforcement Accountability & Responsibility (CLEAR) at the City University of New York School of Law. She is a coauthor of a report published by the Movement for Black Lives that documents the Trump administration's broad crackdown on Black activists in 2020. Some of those activists are still incarcerated or awaiting trial. 11 \"You can make very clear through lines between the uprisings of summer 2020 for racial justice and COINTELPRO in the 1950s and 1960s,\" Masilungan told us, referring to the notorious FBI counterintelligence program against political movements. \"In both instances, the federal government had the same goal, and that goal is disruption.\" A key strategy of disruption includes \"impairing the operational capabilities of the key threat actor,\" she said. 12 In Little Rock, that meant Dawn Jeffrey. 13 Groundswell of support: Supporters of activist Dawn Jeffrey are crowd-funding to support her legal fees. (Illustration by Rumba Yambú) A t the time of George Floyd's death, the Little Rock Police Department had already been accused of racist violence. In 2012, Officer Josh Hastings, who was known to have attended a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan, shot and killed 15-year-old Bobby Moore during an attempted car robbery. In February 2019, Officer Charles Starks killed Bradley Blackshire, 30, during a traffic stop. Hastings was fired and found civilly liable; Starks resigned. Both killings incited local outrage. Jeffrey and other activists saw them as part of a pattern. 14 Related Articles Why We Don't Say \"Reform the Police\" Mariame Kaba and Andrea J. Ritchie Defund the Police Algorithms Michelle Chen Redefining Freedom With Robin Kelley Omari Weekes Jeffrey had been involved in community work and political watchdogging for years. She said she attended her first protest after the 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin, and friends paint a picture of a dedicated activist. An award she received in 2018 from a local lifestyle magazine honored her community outreach work empowering Black youth, homeless people, and others in need-values she said she learned from her mother. 15 \"I'm just someone who cared about my community, an organizer who cared about what was going on with Black people-to me, 'Black Lives Matter' is a slogan, but I'm Black, and my life matters,\" she told us from jail. 16 I n early 2020, Jeffrey organized a campaign for a seat in the state legislature for her friend Ryan Davis, a prison reform activist and the executive director of UA Little Rock Children International, a partnership between the University of Arkansas and a nonprofit organization that serves families in the area. Davis lost by a single vote. 17 \"There are folks who are very vocal about the fact that they think [Jeffrey] was too loud, that she was, in their words, doing too much,\" Davis said. But \"I don't find anybody out here right now as intrepid as her, because she was such a powerful voice.\" 18 In the weeks following Floyd's murder, Jeffrey started a statewide bail fund for protesters. It's now a permanent fund for people in Little Rock who can't afford bail. 19 In a video promoting the fund, Jeffrey laid out her theory of change. \"Protests disrupt daily lives as usual, so it's good to start disrupting business as usual for them,\" she says. \"When you start taking it to them and put it in their face, where they can't ignore it, then they start listening and say, 'Well, what are they talking about?'\" 20 Other Arkansas activists shared her approach. Demonstrations for racial justice in Little Rock were disruptive but peaceful. That soon changed. Police amped up their use of riot munitions. Protesters smashed the windows of downtown businesses late in the night, according to police incident reports sent to us in response to a records request. 21 Arkansas State Police began using a \"fusion center,\" a post-9/11 innovation that was meant to facilitate information sharing between local and federal police for anti-terrorism purposes, to track even peaceful protesters-endangering First Amendment rights to free speech and assembly.

Since then, the GOP-controlled Arkansas legislature has passed a raft of regressive bills loosening checks on police and private militias and restricting public education under the guise of stopping \"critical race theory.\" 59 The surveillance and prosecutions \"crumbled the activist movement in Arkansas, because nobody can trust anybody,\" said Brooklen Mason, a Little Rock activist who knows Jeffrey and several other defendants. \"And part of the work is being able to trust people.\" 60 The ACLU's Dickson agrees, noting that Jeffrey's long incarceration has had a \"chilling effect\" on local activism. \"That's not a defect,\" she said. \"That's part of the design.\" 61\n\nThe national crackdown in 2020 was far from the first time the federal government has responded to Black liberation movements with repressive force to disrupt activist organizations before they gain momentum. But the cases in Little Rock are especially illustrative of this dynamic, which now spans two presidential administrations. 10 Nationwide, the 2020 racial justice protests resulted in at least 326 federal cases, according to Princess Masilungan, a staff attorney at Creating Law Enforcement Accountability & Responsibility (CLEAR) at the City University of New York School of Law. She is a coauthor of a report published by the Movement for Black Lives that documents the Trump administration's broad crackdown on Black activists in 2020. Some of those activists are still incarcerated or awaiting trial. 11 \"You can make very clear through lines between the uprisings of summer 2020 for racial justice and COINTELPRO in the 1950s and 1960s,\" Masilungan told us, referring to the notorious FBI counterintelligence program against political movements. \"In both instances, the federal government had the same goal, and that goal is disruption.\" A key strategy of disruption includes \"impairing the operational capabilities of the key threat actor,\" she said. 12 In Little Rock, that meant Dawn Jeffrey. 13 Groundswell of support: Supporters of activist Dawn Jeffrey are crowd-funding to support her legal fees. (Illustration by Rumba Yambú) A t the time of George Floyd's death, the Little Rock Police Department had already been accused of racist violence. In 2012, Officer Josh Hastings, who was known to have attended a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan, shot and killed 15-year-old Bobby Moore during an attempted car robbery. In February 2019, Officer Charles Starks killed Bradley Blackshire, 30, during a traffic stop. Hastings was fired and found civilly liable; Starks resigned. Both killings incited local outrage. Jeffrey and other activists saw them as part of a pattern. 14 Related Articles Why We Don't Say \"Reform the Police\" Mariame Kaba and Andrea J. Ritchie Defund the Police Algorithms Michelle Chen Redefining Freedom With Robin Kelley Omari Weekes Jeffrey had been involved in community work and political watchdogging for years. She said she attended her first protest after the 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin, and friends paint a picture of a dedicated activist. An award she received in 2018 from a local lifestyle magazine honored her community outreach work empowering Black youth, homeless people, and others in need-values she said she learned from her mother. 15 \"I'm just someone who cared about my community, an organizer who cared about what was going on with Black people-to me, 'Black Lives Matter' is a slogan, but I'm Black, and my life matters,\" she told us from jail. 16 I n early 2020, Jeffrey organized a campaign for a seat in the state legislature for her friend Ryan Davis, a prison reform activist and the executive director of UA Little Rock Children International, a partnership between the University of Arkansas and a nonprofit organization that serves families in the area. Davis lost by a single vote. 17 \"There are folks who are very vocal about the fact that they think [Jeffrey] was too loud, that she was, in their words, doing too much,\" Davis said. But \"I don't find anybody out here right now as intrepid as her, because she was such a powerful voice.\" 18 In the weeks following Floyd's murder, Jeffrey started a statewide bail fund for protesters. It's now a permanent fund for people in Little Rock who can't afford bail. 19 In a video promoting the fund, Jeffrey laid out her theory of change. \"Protests disrupt daily lives as usual, so it's good to start disrupting business as usual for them,\" she says. \"When you start taking it to them and put it in their face, where they can't ignore it, then they start listening and say, 'Well, what are they talking about?'\" 20 Other Arkansas activists shared her approach. Demonstrations for racial justice in Little Rock were disruptive but peaceful. That soon changed. Police amped up their use of riot munitions. Protesters smashed the windows of downtown businesses late in the night, according to police incident reports sent to us in response to a records request. 21 Arkansas State Police began using a \"fusion center,\" a post-9/11 innovation that was meant to facilitate information sharing between local and federal police for anti-terrorism purposes, to track even peaceful protesters-endangering First Amendment rights to free speech and assembly. Records indicate that the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Arkansas State Police compiled lists of upcoming protest events, including some explicitly described as peaceful, echoing the War on Terror-era surveillance of Muslim gatherings. 22 \"There was a concerted effort by law enforcement to do cross-agency cooperation and communication in response to these protests,\" said the ACLU's Dickson regarding the sharing of tips between the city police and state fusion center. \"It was very clear it was happening, from [the use of] infiltrators to [carrying out] open and obvious surveillance.\" 23 Apart from tracking Jeffrey, local police were following false leads, including an unsubstantiated rumor that busloads of antifa activists were booking hotels in the city. Federal and state police tracked protests across Arkansas, while US Attorney General Bill Barr activated all 56 of the nation's FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces, which rely on deputized local law enforcement, to stop \"violent radical elements.\" 24 In July, Barr traveled to Little Rock to meet with local law enforcement officials. In public remarks, he said the FBI's terrorism task forces were working with local police to share intelligence \"and go after the people we think are ringleaders\" behind protest violence. 25 The Nation and Type Investigations, in partnership with the Arkansas Nonprofit News Network, sent public records requests to the Arkansas State Police and Little Rock Police Department for all documents related to protest activity, rioting activity, and the destruction of property in Little Rock from June through September 2020. The response included hundreds of pages of e-mail records between local police, state intelligence officers, and federal agents. Taken together, they show authorities zeroing in on Black activists, including Jeffrey, for protest activity-while largely dismissing the threat posed by counterprotesters. 26 In an e-mail dated May 30, 2020, Heath Helton, the assistant police chief in Little Rock, warned of an event \"which to my understanding is being organized by Dawn Jeffrey.... Our partners at ASP [Arkansas State Police] and the State Capital have been made aware of this event, which is supposed to be peaceful.\" A June 1 screenshot of Jeffrey's Facebook page about a die-in-when protesters simulate being dead-also appears to have originated from the Arkansas fusion center. 27 The state police did not respond to questions we sent about Jeffrey. The Little Rock Police Department defended its approach. \"As with any policing agency, the role of LRPD is to protect the citizens ... they serve. Ms. Jeffrey had/has a public page which means it is viewable,\" a spokesperson for the department said. \"Therefore, there can be no violation in looking at a public page.\" 28 Jeffrey is by far the most mentioned activist in the law enforcement e-mails we reviewed. In one instance, surveillance records line up with an arrest. On July 12, she was arrested by local police at a demonstration outside of a custard shop in nearby Conway. A video recorded by a reporter shows police calling Jeffrey by name and then immediately handcuffing her without a clear reason. The Conway Police Department said she was arrested for trespassing. Intelligence officers for the Arkansas State Police were aware that Jeffrey would be at the event because they were monitoring her Facebook page in the fusion center and sent out an e-mail with a link to a livestream of the protest. While it's not clear whether this monitoring led directly to her arrest that day, the e-mail was one of at least eight sent by senior intelligence officials in the fusion center that referred to Jeffrey's organizing or her participation in nonviolent protests. By comparison, out of hundreds of e-mails and other communications, we saw few that referred to counterprotest groups-and even when they were mentioned, law enforcement focused not on the threat of violence they might pose but on possible violence initiated by racial justice protesters. In one e-mail, an FBI agent dismissed a man's threats \"encouraging the destruction of African Americans' property\" as \"just talking online.\" 29 Center of the dragnet: BLM protester Benjamin Mujera Lung'aho faces criminal charges after being surveilled for months. (Thomas Metthe / Arkansas Democrat-Gazette) T he heavy surveillance of the protesters ultimately caught up with Jeffrey-thanks in part to a T-shirt. 30 One of her closest friends, Mujera Benjamin Lung'aho, was also at the July protest at the Capitol. The two first met in high school, where they played soccer together, and reconnected years later as the racial justice uprising in Ferguson, Mo., reverberated across the country. They eventually grew close enough that Jeffrey spoke at Lung'aho's father's funeral. 31 At the Capitol clash, Lung'aho had worn a distinctive shirt. According to a warrant later filed to search his phone, a detective claimed to have recognized Lung'aho's shirt and other specific features from surveillance video taken a few days earlier during a vandalism spree at a local Confederate cemetery, where several people were caught on camera destroying monuments. Officers showed up at Lung'aho's residence and arrested him after a foot chase. \"Under the current climate, I just was compelled to flee,\" Lung'aho recalled in a conversation with us. 32 When the police searched his phone, they found encrypted group chats and social media messages that they claim tied him to high-profile demonstrations in Little Rock throughout 2020. This turned out to be a key moment for law enforcement-and a big payoff after months of tracking Black activists. 33 According to the authorities, messages on Lung'aho's phone indicated that he participated in several attacks on police vehicles. After arresting him, the police reached out to another alleged participant, Emily Terry, who'd messaged with Lung'aho the morning after the most recent outing. According to police documents, Terry positively identified others who were involved. Although a criminal complaint alleged that Terry threw a Molotov cocktail, Terry was never indicted. Terry declined to speak with us when reached by phone. 34 On December 17, Jeffrey was arrested and charged. Federal prosecutors alleged that she was present when Molotov cocktails were made at her house and drove with friends who tried but failed to set an empty squad car on fire. Three other activists, Renea Goddard, Loba Espinosa-Villegas, and Emily Nowlin, were also arrested and agreed to plead guilty to lesser charges. In interviews, they said they were friends with Jeffrey and that her home had become a haven for activists that summer. None recalled her plotting illegal actions, and the police affidavit doesn't identify her by name when describing the more serious incidents that night. 35 Espinosa-Villegas told us that it seemed, based on police questioning, that prosecutors saw Jeffrey and Lung'aho, the only Black defendants charged, as the \"big fish.\" 36 \"Their intention was to try and figure out, was it [Jeffrey or Lung'aho] who was the leader?\" The actual leader, Espinosa-Villegas said, was another person whom prosecutors accused of illegal actions, according to a criminal complaint naming multiple defendants. The documents also show that prosecutors named two others, including Terry, who allegedly committed similar crimes. None were indicted. 37 In repeated interviews, Jeffrey denied she had ever possessed or used a Molotov cocktail. Under immense pressure given the charges against her, and fearful of her chances at trial, she accepted a plea deal in May. In her plea agreement, Jeffrey acknowledged being present during the attack and the mixing of Molotov cocktails and \"agreed with others to commit acts of vandalism on government buildings and damaging police cars by puncturing tires and/or breaking windows.\" 38 \"There's no way you can be an American citizen feeling like you're being attacked or at war with your own government,\" she said in an interview. \"When do the scales balance for justice?\" 39 Jeffrey's supporters present an image of a leader dispensing hard truths about political injustices in America, unfairly persecuted by the powerful entities she criticized. By contrast, those on the other side of the political spectrum see her as a provocateur who got what she deserved. 40 In a Facebook group called \"Make Little Rock Great Again,\" whose moderators have alluded to being local police officers, an administrator of the page posted a cartoon of a police officer shooting a Black woman in the head, mocking a post by Jeffrey. One person commented, \"Be a shame if she came up missing,\" and followed that with: \"Lemme rephrase that correctly...replace she with it.\" When asked about the page, a police department spokesperson said, \"There's no way to conclusively determine if this page is moderated by any member of the Little Rock Police Department.\" 41 Lung'aho, a spoken-word artist, told us that he and Jeffrey had both been targeted for their politics. He's accused of throwing Molotov cocktails on multiple occasions and faces more time in prison than anybody else. \"The entire reason why we were doing the activism that we were involved in is because we were doing something for Black people,\" Lung'aho said, speaking to us from jail. 42 N ot all of the jurisdictions that experienced unrest in the wake of George Floyd's murder-even when that unrest turned destructive-resorted to federal prosecutions. Our past reporting found that such prosecutions were especially likely in jurisdictions whose US attorneys were politically affiliated with the Trump administration. 43 In Little Rock, Trump had an ideological ally in Cody Hiland, then the US attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas. A former local prosecutor-and, before that, deputy chief of staff to former governor Mike Huckabee-Hiland showed an eagerness to pursue the Trump administration's political goals, once resurrecting an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. In Congress, GOP Senator Tom Cotton, who later called for federal troops to be deployed against racial justice protests, lauded Hiland's nomination by Trump. 44 In an op-ed published amid the protests, Hiland wrote, \"It is my prayer that the shrill cries of 'Defund the Police' always be muted by our nation's earnest declaration that we 'thank God for the Police.'\" 45 When police found messages and photos on Lung'aho's phone suggesting he was involved in the attacks, they sent the evidence to agents at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Hiland soon got personally involved in the case, inviting Lung'aho's attorney, Michael Kaiser, to meet with him at the police station where Lung'aho was being detained. 46 The US attorney hoped that he could persuade Lung'aho to provide information about other protesters, according to Kaiser. Hiland told Kaiser he had the authority to add several charges involving the use of a destructive device in a crime of violence that would carry sentences of 30 years to life. \"I hadn't ever seen that before,\" Kaiser said, adding that it was unusual for a US attorney to get so involved in a case that didn't involve charges like murder or drug trafficking. 47 Prosecutors' actions in the case align with findings from the Movement for Black Lives report. The authorities filed multiple and redundant charges against protesters, a technique critics say is meant to pressure defendants into accepting plea deals. The same technique was used by federal prosecutors against at least 84 racial justice protesters in 2020. One protester in Philadelphia was hit with four federal arson charges for burning two police cars, because the cars had benefited from federal funding and, the government claimed in a filing, had a role in interstate commerce. 48 Hiland resigned from his federal post in the final weeks of Trump's presidency and is now working on Sarah Huckabee Sanders's gubernatorial campaign; Sanders recently nominated him to be the next chair of the Arkansas Republican Party. Hiland didn't respond to our calls and texts regarding this story. 49 Meanwhile, local pro-Trump Facebook pages tracked Jeffrey's and Lung'aho's cases. During an early pretrial hearing for Lung'aho, over a dozen men wearing paramilitary clothing and carrying rifles loitered on street corners near the courthouse. 50 F or most of the past year, Jeffrey and Lung'aho were held in separate wings of the Greene County Detention Center in rural Arkansas. Judges revoked bond for both of them less than a year after they were arrested. The courts faulted them for failing tests for cannabis use, missing check-ins, and, in Lunga'ho's case, an arrest for public intoxication. Recently, after pleading guilty to a single count of conspiracy to possess a destructive device, Jeffrey was transferred back to a detention center in Little Rock. 51 As both cases have plodded along for nearly two years, Jeffrey's supporters have continued their efforts to raise awareness and funds. She eventually hired Phillip Hamilton, a New York City-based corporate lawyer, as her counsel. In a motion to appeal her ongoing detention, Hamilton described Jeffrey's distress: Her long separation from her 12-year-old daughter and her family had reached \"the point where it was making her mentally and emotionally sick,\" Hamilton wrote, adding that he had been unable to communicate regularly with Jeffrey because of staffing shortages at the Pulaski County Regional Detention Facility. 52 When Jeffrey spoke to us in January, she described the pain of the family separation, noting that she was her daughter's primary caregiver. In the messages she sends to her daughter, \"I'm always reflecting that I love her, and that she's my forever,\" Jeffrey said. \"It's really hard not being in her life, making her lunch and dinner, tucking her into bed.\" 53 Lung'aho is still fighting his case and hoping that his battle can help others in his position. In November 2021, Kaiser filed a motion urging the judge to consider whether prosecutors had stretched \"the reach of federal criminal law beyond its constitutional bounds.\" He argues that the Justice Department lacks jurisdiction in the case, pointing out that federal funding for the affected police agencies is minuscule. \"From minute one, we've said this is a state case charged federally because of politics,\" Kaiser said in an interview. 54 Almost a year later, US District Judge D.P. Marshal ruled that although the destroyed police cars were not federal property nor purchased with federal financial assistance, Lung'aho could still be federally charged with arson. But Marshal dismissed three of Lung'aho's 13 charges, each of which prescribed a 30-year mandatory minimum sentence, for using a destructive device during a crime of violence. \"Federal arson is not a crime of violence,\" Marshal wrote-at least in Lung'aho's case. 55 The ruling dropped Lung'aho's maximum prison sentence from more than 90 years to somewhere between 10 and 30, according to Kaiser. But federal prosecutors immediately filed an appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which could take up to eight months to issue a ruling-and Lung'aho would remain in jail the whole time. 56 If the ruling is upheld, he is considering going to trial, despite the risk of prison time and the extraordinarily low success rates of federal defendants. 57 \"Ten years is scary, but the 30-to-life is what they threatened at the beginning, and now it's all gone,\" Kaiser said the morning of the ruling. Lung'aho is more willing to face a jury \"now that the potential sentence for accepting a plea deal is only slightly better than what we'd face at trial.\" 58 Meanwhile, Jeffrey's incarceration has been a devastating coda to a summer that initially held so much hope for change. Since then, the GOP-controlled Arkansas legislature has passed a raft of regressive bills loosening checks on police and private militias and restricting public education under the guise of stopping \"critical race theory.\" 59 The surveillance and prosecutions \"crumbled the activist movement in Arkansas, because nobody can trust anybody,\" said Brooklen Mason, a Little Rock activist who knows Jeffrey and several other defendants. \"And part of the work is being able to trust people.\" 60 The ACLU's Dickson agrees, noting that Jeffrey's long incarceration has had a \"chilling effect\" on local activism. \"That's not a defect,\" she said. \"That's part of the design.\" 61\n\nNationwide, the 2020 racial justice protests resulted in at least 326 federal cases, according to Princess Masilungan, a staff attorney at Creating Law Enforcement Accountability & Responsibility (CLEAR) at the City University of New York School of Law.

Hiland told Kaiser he had the authority to add several charges involving the use of a destructive device in a crime of violence that would carry sentences of 30 years to life. \"I hadn't ever seen that before,\" Kaiser said, adding that it was unusual for a US attorney to get so involved in a case that didn't involve charges like murder or drug trafficking. 47 Prosecutors' actions in the case align with findings from the Movement for Black Lives report. The authorities filed multiple and redundant charges against protesters, a technique critics say is meant to pressure defendants into accepting plea deals. The same technique was used by federal prosecutors against at least 84 racial justice protesters in 2020. One protester in Philadelphia was hit with four federal arson charges for burning two police cars, because the cars had benefited from federal funding and, the government claimed in a filing, had a role in interstate commerce. 48 Hiland resigned from his federal post in the final weeks of Trump's presidency and is now working on Sarah Huckabee Sanders's gubernatorial campaign; Sanders recently nominated him to be the next chair of the Arkansas Republican Party. Hiland didn't respond to our calls and texts regarding this story. 49 Meanwhile, local pro-Trump Facebook pages tracked Jeffrey's and Lung'aho's cases. During an early pretrial hearing for Lung'aho, over a dozen men wearing paramilitary clothing and carrying rifles loitered on street corners near the courthouse. 50 F or most of the past year, Jeffrey and Lung'aho were held in separate wings of the Greene County Detention Center in rural Arkansas. Judges revoked bond for both of them less than a year after they were arrested. The courts faulted them for failing tests for cannabis use, missing check-ins, and, in Lunga'ho's case, an arrest for public intoxication. Recently, after pleading guilty to a single count of conspiracy to possess a destructive device, Jeffrey was transferred back to a detention center in Little Rock. 51 As both cases have plodded along for nearly two years, Jeffrey's supporters have continued their efforts to raise awareness and funds. She eventually hired Phillip Hamilton, a New York City-based corporate lawyer, as her counsel. In a motion to appeal her ongoing detention, Hamilton described Jeffrey's distress: Her long separation from her 12-year-old daughter and her family had reached \"the point where it was making her mentally and emotionally sick,\" Hamilton wrote, adding that he had been unable to communicate regularly with Jeffrey because of staffing shortages at the Pulaski County Regional Detention Facility. 52 When Jeffrey spoke to us in January, she described the pain of the family separation, noting that she was her daughter's primary caregiver. In the messages she sends to her daughter, \"I'm always reflecting that I love her, and that she's my forever,\" Jeffrey said. \"It's really hard not being in her life, making her lunch and dinner, tucking her into bed.\" 53 Lung'aho is still fighting his case and hoping that his battle can help others in his position. In November 2021, Kaiser filed a motion urging the judge to consider whether prosecutors had stretched \"the reach of federal criminal law beyond its constitutional bounds.\" He argues that the Justice Department lacks jurisdiction in the case, pointing out that federal funding for the affected police agencies is minuscule. \"From minute one, we've said this is a state case charged federally because of politics,\" Kaiser said in an interview. 54 Almost a year later, US District Judge D.P. Marshal ruled that although the destroyed police cars were not federal property nor purchased with federal financial assistance, Lung'aho could still be federally charged with arson. But Marshal dismissed three of Lung'aho's 13 charges, each of which prescribed a 30-year mandatory minimum sentence, for using a destructive device during a crime of violence. \"Federal arson is not a crime of violence,\" Marshal wrote-at least in Lung'aho's case. 55 The ruling dropped Lung'aho's maximum prison sentence from more than 90 years to somewhere between 10 and 30, according to Kaiser. But federal prosecutors immediately filed an appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which could take up to eight months to issue a ruling-and Lung'aho would remain in jail the whole time. 56 If the ruling is upheld, he is considering going to trial, despite the risk of prison time and the extraordinarily low success rates of federal defendants. 57 \"Ten years is scary, but the 30-to-life is what they threatened at the beginning, and now it's all gone,\" Kaiser said the morning of the ruling. Lung'aho is more willing to face a jury \"now that the potential sentence for accepting a plea deal is only slightly better than what we'd face at trial.\" 58 Meanwhile, Jeffrey's incarceration has been a devastating coda to a summer that initially held so much hope for change. Since then, the GOP-controlled Arkansas legislature has passed a raft of regressive bills loosening checks on police and private militias and restricting public education under the guise of stopping \"critical race theory.\" 59 The surveillance and prosecutions \"crumbled the activist movement in Arkansas, because nobody can trust anybody,\" said Brooklen Mason, a Little Rock activist who knows Jeffrey and several other defendants. \"And part of the work is being able to trust people.\" 60 The ACLU's Dickson agrees, noting that Jeffrey's long incarceration has had a \"chilling effect\" on local activism. \"That's not a defect,\" she said. \"That's part of the design.\" 61\n\n\"You can make very clear through lines between the uprisings of summer 2020 for racial justice and COINTELPRO in the 1950s and 1960s,\" Masilungan told us, referring to the notorious FBI counterintelligence program against political movements. \"In both instances, the federal government had the same goal, and that goal is disruption.\" A key strategy of disruption includes \"impairing the operational capabilities of the key threat actor,\" she said. 12 In Little Rock, that meant Dawn Jeffrey. 13 Groundswell of support: Supporters of activist Dawn Jeffrey are crowd-funding to support her legal fees. (Illustration by Rumba Yambú) A t the time of George Floyd's death, the Little Rock Police Department had already been accused of racist violence. In 2012, Officer Josh Hastings, who was known to have attended a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan, shot and killed 15-year-old Bobby Moore during an attempted car robbery. In February 2019, Officer Charles Starks killed Bradley Blackshire, 30, during a traffic stop. Hastings was fired and found civilly liable; Starks resigned. Both killings incited local outrage. Jeffrey and other activists saw them as part of a pattern. 14 Related Articles Why We Don't Say \"Reform the Police\" Mariame Kaba and Andrea J. Ritchie Defund the Police Algorithms Michelle Chen Redefining Freedom With Robin Kelley Omari Weekes Jeffrey had been involved in community work and political watchdogging for years. She said she attended her first protest after the 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin, and friends paint a picture of a dedicated activist. An award she received in 2018 from a local lifestyle magazine honored her community outreach work empowering Black youth, homeless people, and others in need-values she said she learned from her mother. 15 \"I'm just someone who cared about my community, an organizer who cared about what was going on with Black people-to me, 'Black Lives Matter' is a slogan, but I'm Black, and my life matters,\" she told us from jail. 16 I n early 2020, Jeffrey organized a campaign for a seat in the state legislature for her friend Ryan Davis, a prison reform activist and the executive director of UA Little Rock Children International, a partnership between the University of Arkansas and a nonprofit organization that serves families in the area. Davis lost by a single vote. 17 \"There are folks who are very vocal about the fact that they think [Jeffrey] was too loud, that she was, in their words, doing too much,\" Davis said. But \"I don't find anybody out here right now as intrepid as her, because she was such a powerful voice.\" 18 In the weeks following Floyd's murder, Jeffrey started a statewide bail fund for protesters. It's now a permanent fund for people in Little Rock who can't afford bail. 19 In a video promoting the fund, Jeffrey laid out her theory of change. \"Protests disrupt daily lives as usual, so it's good to start disrupting business as usual for them,\" she says. \"When you start taking it to them and put it in their face, where they can't ignore it, then they start listening and say, 'Well, what are they talking about?'\" 20 Other Arkansas activists shared her approach. Demonstrations for racial justice in Little Rock were disruptive but peaceful. That soon changed. Police amped up their use of riot munitions. Protesters smashed the windows of downtown businesses late in the night, according to police incident reports sent to us in response to a records request. 21 Arkansas State Police began using a \"fusion center,\" a post-9/11 innovation that was meant to facilitate information sharing between local and federal police for anti-terrorism purposes, to track even peaceful protesters-endangering First Amendment rights to free speech and assembly. Records indicate that the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Arkansas State Police compiled lists of upcoming protest events, including some explicitly described as peaceful, echoing the War on Terror-era surveillance of Muslim gatherings. 22 \"There was a concerted effort by law enforcement to do cross-agency cooperation and communication in response to these protests,\" said the ACLU's Dickson regarding the sharing of tips between the city police and state fusion center. \"It was very clear it was happening, from [the use of] infiltrators to [carrying out] open and obvious surveillance.\" 23 Apart from tracking Jeffrey, local police were following false leads, including an unsubstantiated rumor that busloads of antifa activists were booking hotels in the city. Federal and state police tracked protests across Arkansas, while US Attorney General Bill Barr activated all 56 of the nation's FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces, which rely on deputized local law enforcement, to stop \"violent radical elements.\" 24 In July, Barr traveled to Little Rock to meet with local law enforcement officials. In public remarks, he said the FBI's terrorism task forces were working with local police to share intelligence \"and go after the people we think are ringleaders\" behind protest violence. 25 The Nation and Type Investigations, in partnership with the Arkansas Nonprofit News Network, sent public records requests to the Arkansas State Police and Little Rock Police Department for all documents related to protest activity, rioting activity, and the destruction of property in Little Rock from June through September 2020. The response included hundreds of pages of e-mail records between local police, state intelligence officers, and federal agents. Taken together, they show authorities zeroing in on Black activists, including Jeffrey, for protest activity-while largely dismissing the threat posed by counterprotesters. 26 In an e-mail dated May 30, 2020, Heath Helton, the assistant police chief in Little Rock, warned of an event \"which to my understanding is being organized by Dawn Jeffrey.... Our partners at ASP [Arkansas State Police] and the State Capital have been made aware of this event, which is supposed to be peaceful.\" A June 1 screenshot of Jeffrey's Facebook page about a die-in-when protesters simulate being dead-also appears to have originated from the Arkansas fusion center. 27 The state police did not respond to questions we sent about Jeffrey. The Little Rock Police Department defended its approach. \"As with any policing agency, the role of LRPD is to protect the citizens ... they serve. Ms. Jeffrey had/has a public page which means it is viewable,\" a spokesperson for the department said. \"Therefore, there can be no violation in looking at a public page.\" 28 Jeffrey is by far the most mentioned activist in the law enforcement e-mails we reviewed. In one instance, surveillance records line up with an arrest. On July 12, she was arrested by local police at a demonstration outside of a custard shop in nearby Conway. A video recorded by a reporter shows police calling Jeffrey by name and then immediately handcuffing her without a clear reason. The Conway Police Department said she was arrested for trespassing. Intelligence officers for the Arkansas State Police were aware that Jeffrey would be at the event because they were monitoring her Facebook page in the fusion center and sent out an e-mail with a link to a livestream of the protest. While it's not clear whether this monitoring led directly to her arrest that day, the e-mail was one of at least eight sent by senior intelligence officials in the fusion center that referred to Jeffrey's organizing or her participation in nonviolent protests. By comparison, out of hundreds of e-mails and other communications, we saw few that referred to counterprotest groups-and even when they were mentioned, law enforcement focused not on the threat of violence they might pose but on possible violence initiated by racial justice protesters. In one e-mail, an FBI agent dismissed a man's threats \"encouraging the destruction of African Americans' property\" as \"just talking online.\" 29 Center of the dragnet: BLM protester Benjamin Mujera Lung'aho faces criminal charges after being surveilled for months. (Thomas Metthe / Arkansas Democrat-Gazette) T he heavy surveillance of the protesters ultimately caught up with Jeffrey-thanks in part to a T-shirt. 30 One of her closest friends, Mujera Benjamin Lung'aho, was also at the July protest at the Capitol. The two first met in high school, where they played soccer together, and reconnected years later as the racial justice uprising in Ferguson, Mo., reverberated across the country. They eventually grew close enough that Jeffrey spoke at Lung'aho's father's funeral. 31 At the Capitol clash, Lung'aho had worn a distinctive shirt. According to a warrant later filed to search his phone, a detective claimed to have recognized Lung'aho's shirt and other specific features from surveillance video taken a few days earlier during a vandalism spree at a local Confederate cemetery, where several people were caught on camera destroying monuments. Officers showed up at Lung'aho's residence and arrested him after a foot chase. \"Under the current climate, I just was compelled to flee,\" Lung'aho recalled in a conversation with us. 32 When the police searched his phone, they found encrypted group chats and social media messages that they claim tied him to high-profile demonstrations in Little Rock throughout 2020. This turned out to be a key moment for law enforcement-and a big payoff after months of tracking Black activists. 33 According to the authorities, messages on Lung'aho's phone indicated that he participated in several attacks on police vehicles. After arresting him, the police reached out to another alleged participant, Emily Terry, who'd messaged with Lung'aho the morning after the most recent outing. According to police documents, Terry positively identified others who were involved. Although a criminal complaint alleged that Terry threw a Molotov cocktail, Terry was never indicted. Terry declined to speak with us when reached by phone. 34 On December 17, Jeffrey was arrested and charged. Federal prosecutors alleged that she was present when Molotov cocktails were made at her house and drove with friends who tried but failed to set an empty squad car on fire. Three other activists, Renea Goddard, Loba Espinosa-Villegas, and Emily Nowlin, were also arrested and agreed to plead guilty to lesser charges. In interviews, they said they were friends with Jeffrey and that her home had become a haven for activists that summer. None recalled her plotting illegal actions, and the police affidavit doesn't identify her by name when describing the more serious incidents that night. 35 Espinosa-Villegas told us that it seemed, based on police questioning, that prosecutors saw Jeffrey and Lung'aho, the only Black defendants charged, as the \"big fish.\" 36 \"Their intention was to try and figure out, was it [Jeffrey or Lung'aho] who was the leader?\" The actual leader, Espinosa-Villegas said, was another person whom prosecutors accused of illegal actions, according to a criminal complaint naming multiple defendants. The documents also show that prosecutors named two others, including Terry, who allegedly committed similar crimes. None were indicted. 37 In repeated interviews, Jeffrey denied she had ever possessed or used a Molotov cocktail. Under immense pressure given the charges against her, and fearful of her chances at trial, she accepted a plea deal in May. In her plea agreement, Jeffrey acknowledged being present during the attack and the mixing of Molotov cocktails and \"agreed with others to commit acts of vandalism on government buildings and damaging police cars by puncturing tires and/or breaking windows.\" 38 \"There's no way you can be an American citizen feeling like you're being attacked or at war with your own government,\" she said in an interview. \"When do the scales balance for justice?\" 39 Jeffrey's supporters present an image of a leader dispensing hard truths about political injustices in America, unfairly persecuted by the powerful entities she criticized. By contrast, those on the other side of the political spectrum see her as a provocateur who got what she deserved. 40 In a Facebook group called \"Make Little Rock Great Again,\" whose moderators have alluded to being local police officers, an administrator of the page posted a cartoon of a police officer shooting a Black woman in the head, mocking a post by Jeffrey. One person commented, \"Be a shame if she came up missing,\" and followed that with: \"Lemme rephrase that correctly...replace she with it.\" When asked about the page, a police department spokesperson said, \"There's no way to conclusively determine if this page is moderated by any member of the Little Rock Police Department.\" 41 Lung'aho, a spoken-word artist, told us that he and Jeffrey had both been targeted for their politics. He's accused of throwing Molotov cocktails on multiple occasions and faces more time in prison than anybody else. \"The entire reason why we were doing the activism that we were involved in is because we were doing something for Black people,\" Lung'aho said, speaking to us from jail. 42 N ot all of the jurisdictions that experienced unrest in the wake of George Floyd's murder-even when that unrest turned destructive-resorted to federal prosecutions. Our past reporting found that such prosecutions were especially likely in jurisdictions whose US attorneys were politically affiliated with the Trump administration. 43 In Little Rock, Trump had an ideological ally in Cody Hiland, then the US attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas. A former local prosecutor-and, before that, deputy chief of staff to former governor Mike Huckabee-Hiland showed an eagerness to pursue the Trump administration's political goals, once resurrecting an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. In Congress, GOP Senator Tom Cotton, who later called for federal troops to be deployed against racial justice protests, lauded Hiland's nomination by Trump. 44 In an op-ed published amid the protests, Hiland wrote, \"It is my prayer that the shrill cries of 'Defund the Police' always be muted by our nation's earnest declaration that we 'thank God for the Police.'\" 45 When police found messages and photos on Lung'aho's phone suggesting he was involved in the attacks, they sent the evidence to agents at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Hiland soon got personally involved in the case, inviting Lung'aho's attorney, Michael Kaiser, to meet with him at the police station where Lung'aho was being detained. 46 The US attorney hoped that he could persuade Lung'aho to provide information about other protesters, according to Kaiser.

Under immense pressure given the charges against her, and fearful of her chances at trial, she accepted a plea deal in May. In her plea agreement, Jeffrey acknowledged being present during the attack and the mixing of Molotov cocktails and \"agreed with others to commit acts of vandalism on government buildings and damaging police cars by puncturing tires and/or breaking windows.\" 38 \"There's no way you can be an American citizen feeling like you're being attacked or at war with your own government,\" she said in an interview. \"When do the scales balance for justice?\" 39 Jeffrey's supporters present an image of a leader dispensing hard truths about political injustices in America, unfairly persecuted by the powerful entities she criticized. By contrast, those on the other side of the political spectrum see her as a provocateur who got what she deserved. 40 In a Facebook group called \"Make Little Rock Great Again,\" whose moderators have alluded to being local police officers, an administrator of the page posted a cartoon of a police officer shooting a Black woman in the head, mocking a post by Jeffrey. One person commented, \"Be a shame if she came up missing,\" and followed that with: \"Lemme rephrase that correctly...replace she with it.\" When asked about the page, a police department spokesperson said, \"There's no way to conclusively determine if this page is moderated by any member of the Little Rock Police Department.\" 41 Lung'aho, a spoken-word artist, told us that he and Jeffrey had both been targeted for their politics. He's accused of throwing Molotov cocktails on multiple occasions and faces more time in prison than anybody else. \"The entire reason why we were doing the activism that we were involved in is because we were doing something for Black people,\" Lung'aho said, speaking to us from jail. 42 N ot all of the jurisdictions that experienced unrest in the wake of George Floyd's murder-even when that unrest turned destructive-resorted to federal prosecutions. Our past reporting found that such prosecutions were especially likely in jurisdictions whose US attorneys were politically affiliated with the Trump administration. 43 In Little Rock, Trump had an ideological ally in Cody Hiland, then the US attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas. A former local prosecutor-and, before that, deputy chief of staff to former governor Mike Huckabee-Hiland showed an eagerness to pursue the Trump administration's political goals, once resurrecting an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. In Congress, GOP Senator Tom Cotton, who later called for federal troops to be deployed against racial justice protests, lauded Hiland's nomination by Trump. 44 In an op-ed published amid the protests, Hiland wrote, \"It is my prayer that the shrill cries of 'Defund the Police' always be muted by our nation's earnest declaration that we 'thank God for the Police.'\" 45 When police found messages and photos on Lung'aho's phone suggesting he was involved in the attacks, they sent the evidence to agents at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Hiland soon got personally involved in the case, inviting Lung'aho's attorney, Michael Kaiser, to meet with him at the police station where Lung'aho was being detained. 46 The US attorney hoped that he could persuade Lung'aho to provide information about other protesters, according to Kaiser. Hiland told Kaiser he had the authority to add several charges involving the use of a destructive device in a crime of violence that would carry sentences of 30 years to life. \"I hadn't ever seen that before,\" Kaiser said, adding that it was unusual for a US attorney to get so involved in a case that didn't involve charges like murder or drug trafficking. 47 Prosecutors' actions in the case align with findings from the Movement for Black Lives report. The authorities filed multiple and redundant charges against protesters, a technique critics say is meant to pressure defendants into accepting plea deals. The same technique was used by federal prosecutors against at least 84 racial justice protesters in 2020. One protester in Philadelphia was hit with four federal arson charges for burning two police cars, because the cars had benefited from federal funding and, the government claimed in a filing, had a role in interstate commerce. 48 Hiland resigned from his federal post in the final weeks of Trump's presidency and is now working on Sarah Huckabee Sanders's gubernatorial campaign; Sanders recently nominated him to be the next chair of the Arkansas Republican Party. Hiland didn't respond to our calls and texts regarding this story. 49 Meanwhile, local pro-Trump Facebook pages tracked Jeffrey's and Lung'aho's cases. During an early pretrial hearing for Lung'aho, over a dozen men wearing paramilitary clothing and carrying rifles loitered on street corners near the courthouse. 50 F or most of the past year, Jeffrey and Lung'aho were held in separate wings of the Greene County Detention Center in rural Arkansas. Judges revoked bond for both of them less than a year after they were arrested. The courts faulted them for failing tests for cannabis use, missing check-ins, and, in Lunga'ho's case, an arrest for public intoxication. Recently, after pleading guilty to a single count of conspiracy to possess a destructive device, Jeffrey was transferred back to a detention center in Little Rock. 51 As both cases have plodded along for nearly two years, Jeffrey's supporters have continued their efforts to raise awareness and funds. She eventually hired Phillip Hamilton, a New York City-based corporate lawyer, as her counsel. In a motion to appeal her ongoing detention, Hamilton described Jeffrey's distress: Her long separation from her 12-year-old daughter and her family had reached \"the point where it was making her mentally and emotionally sick,\" Hamilton wrote, adding that he had been unable to communicate regularly with Jeffrey because of staffing shortages at the Pulaski County Regional Detention Facility. 52 When Jeffrey spoke to us in January, she described the pain of the family separation, noting that she was her daughter's primary caregiver. In the messages she sends to her daughter, \"I'm always reflecting that I love her, and that she's my forever,\" Jeffrey said. \"It's really hard not being in her life, making her lunch and dinner, tucking her into bed.\" 53 Lung'aho is still fighting his case and hoping that his battle can help others in his position. In November 2021, Kaiser filed a motion urging the judge to consider whether prosecutors had stretched \"the reach of federal criminal law beyond its constitutional bounds.\" He argues that the Justice Department lacks jurisdiction in the case, pointing out that federal funding for the affected police agencies is minuscule. \"From minute one, we've said this is a state case charged federally because of politics,\" Kaiser said in an interview. 54 Almost a year later, US District Judge D.P. Marshal ruled that although the destroyed police cars were not federal property nor purchased with federal financial assistance, Lung'aho could still be federally charged with arson. But Marshal dismissed three of Lung'aho's 13 charges, each of which prescribed a 30-year mandatory minimum sentence, for using a destructive device during a crime of violence. \"Federal arson is not a crime of violence,\" Marshal wrote-at least in Lung'aho's case. 55 The ruling dropped Lung'aho's maximum prison sentence from more than 90 years to somewhere between 10 and 30, according to Kaiser. But federal prosecutors immediately filed an appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which could take up to eight months to issue a ruling-and Lung'aho would remain in jail the whole time. 56 If the ruling is upheld, he is considering going to trial, despite the risk of prison time and the extraordinarily low success rates of federal defendants. 57 \"Ten years is scary, but the 30-to-life is what they threatened at the beginning, and now it's all gone,\" Kaiser said the morning of the ruling. Lung'aho is more willing to face a jury \"now that the potential sentence for accepting a plea deal is only slightly better than what we'd face at trial.\" 58 Meanwhile, Jeffrey's incarceration has been a devastating coda to a summer that initially held so much hope for change. Since then, the GOP-controlled Arkansas legislature has passed a raft of regressive bills loosening checks on police and private militias and restricting public education under the guise of stopping \"critical race theory.\" 59 The surveillance and prosecutions \"crumbled the activist movement in Arkansas, because nobody can trust anybody,\" said Brooklen Mason, a Little Rock activist who knows Jeffrey and several other defendants. \"And part of the work is being able to trust people.\" 60 The ACLU's Dickson agrees, noting that Jeffrey's long incarceration has had a \"chilling effect\" on local activism. \"That's not a defect,\" she said. \"That's part of the design.\" 61\n\nGroundswell of support: Supporters of activist Dawn Jeffrey are crowd-funding to support her legal fees. (Illustration by Rumba Yambú)\n\nA t the time of George Floyd's death, the Little Rock Police Department had already been accused of racist violence. In 2012, Officer Josh Hastings, who was known to have attended a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan, shot and killed 15-year-old Bobby Moore during an attempted car robbery. In February 2019, Officer Charles Starks killed Bradley Blackshire, 30, during a traffic stop. Hastings was fired and found civilly liable; Starks resigned. Both killings incited local outrage. Jeffrey and other activists saw them as part of a pattern. 14 Related Articles Why We Don't Say \"Reform the Police\" Mariame Kaba and Andrea J. Ritchie Defund the Police Algorithms Michelle Chen Redefining Freedom With Robin Kelley Omari Weekes Jeffrey had been involved in community work and political watchdogging for years. She said she attended her first protest after the 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin, and friends paint a picture of a dedicated activist. An award she received in 2018 from a local lifestyle magazine honored her community outreach work empowering Black youth, homeless people, and others in need-values she said she learned from her mother. 15 \"I'm just someone who cared about my community, an organizer who cared about what was going on with Black people-to me, 'Black Lives Matter' is a slogan, but I'm Black, and my life matters,\" she told us from jail. 16 I n early 2020, Jeffrey organized a campaign for a seat in the state legislature for her friend Ryan Davis, a prison reform activist and the executive director of UA Little Rock Children International, a partnership between the University of Arkansas and a nonprofit organization that serves families in the area. Davis lost by a single vote. 17 \"There are folks who are very vocal about the fact that they think [Jeffrey] was too loud, that she was, in their words, doing too much,\" Davis said. But \"I don't find anybody out here right now as intrepid as her, because she was such a powerful voice.\" 18 In the weeks following Floyd's murder, Jeffrey started a statewide bail fund for protesters. It's now a permanent fund for people in Little Rock who can't afford bail. 19 In a video promoting the fund, Jeffrey laid out her theory of change. \"Protests disrupt daily lives as usual, so it's good to start disrupting business as usual for them,\" she says. \"When you start taking it to them and put it in their face, where they can't ignore it, then they start listening and say, 'Well, what are they talking about?'\" 20 Other Arkansas activists shared her approach. Demonstrations for racial justice in Little Rock were disruptive but peaceful. That soon changed. Police amped up their use of riot munitions. Protesters smashed the windows of downtown businesses late in the night, according to police incident reports sent to us in response to a records request. 21 Arkansas State Police began using a \"fusion center,\" a post-9/11 innovation that was meant to facilitate information sharing between local and federal police for anti-terrorism purposes, to track even peaceful protesters-endangering First Amendment rights to free speech and assembly. Records indicate that the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Arkansas State Police compiled lists of upcoming protest events, including some explicitly described as peaceful, echoing the War on Terror-era surveillance of Muslim gatherings. 22 \"There was a concerted effort by law enforcement to do cross-agency cooperation and communication in response to these protests,\" said the ACLU's Dickson regarding the sharing of tips between the city police and state fusion center. \"It was very clear it was happening, from [the use of] infiltrators to [carrying out] open and obvious surveillance.\" 23 Apart from tracking Jeffrey, local police were following false leads, including an unsubstantiated rumor that busloads of antifa activists were booking hotels in the city. Federal and state police tracked protests across Arkansas, while US Attorney General Bill Barr activated all 56 of the nation's FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces, which rely on deputized local law enforcement, to stop \"violent radical elements.\" 24 In July, Barr traveled to Little Rock to meet with local law enforcement officials. In public remarks, he said the FBI's terrorism task forces were working with local police to share intelligence \"and go after the people we think are ringleaders\" behind protest violence. 25 The Nation and Type Investigations, in partnership with the Arkansas Nonprofit News Network, sent public records requests to the Arkansas State Police and Little Rock Police Department for all documents related to protest activity, rioting activity, and the destruction of property in Little Rock from June through September 2020. The response included hundreds of pages of e-mail records between local police, state intelligence officers, and federal agents. Taken together, they show authorities zeroing in on Black activists, including Jeffrey, for protest activity-while largely dismissing the threat posed by counterprotesters. 26 In an e-mail dated May 30, 2020, Heath Helton, the assistant police chief in Little Rock, warned of an event \"which to my understanding is being organized by Dawn Jeffrey.... Our partners at ASP [Arkansas State Police] and the State Capital have been made aware of this event, which is supposed to be peaceful.\" A June 1 screenshot of Jeffrey's Facebook page about a die-in-when protesters simulate being dead-also appears to have originated from the Arkansas fusion center. 27 The state police did not respond to questions we sent about Jeffrey. The Little Rock Police Department defended its approach. \"As with any policing agency, the role of LRPD is to protect the citizens ... they serve. Ms. Jeffrey had/has a public page which means it is viewable,\" a spokesperson for the department said. \"Therefore, there can be no violation in looking at a public page.\" 28 Jeffrey is by far the most mentioned activist in the law enforcement e-mails we reviewed. In one instance, surveillance records line up with an arrest. On July 12, she was arrested by local police at a demonstration outside of a custard shop in nearby Conway. A video recorded by a reporter shows police calling Jeffrey by name and then immediately handcuffing her without a clear reason. The Conway Police Department said she was arrested for trespassing. Intelligence officers for the Arkansas State Police were aware that Jeffrey would be at the event because they were monitoring her Facebook page in the fusion center and sent out an e-mail with a link to a livestream of the protest. While it's not clear whether this monitoring led directly to her arrest that day, the e-mail was one of at least eight sent by senior intelligence officials in the fusion center that referred to Jeffrey's organizing or her participation in nonviolent protests. By comparison, out of hundreds of e-mails and other communications, we saw few that referred to counterprotest groups-and even when they were mentioned, law enforcement focused not on the threat of violence they might pose but on possible violence initiated by racial justice protesters. In one e-mail, an FBI agent dismissed a man's threats \"encouraging the destruction of African Americans' property\" as \"just talking online.\" 29 Center of the dragnet: BLM protester Benjamin Mujera Lung'aho faces criminal charges after being surveilled for months. (Thomas Metthe / Arkansas Democrat-Gazette) T he heavy surveillance of the protesters ultimately caught up with Jeffrey-thanks in part to a T-shirt. 30 One of her closest friends, Mujera Benjamin Lung'aho, was also at the July protest at the Capitol. The two first met in high school, where they played soccer together, and reconnected years later as the racial justice uprising in Ferguson, Mo., reverberated across the country. They eventually grew close enough that Jeffrey spoke at Lung'aho's father's funeral. 31 At the Capitol clash, Lung'aho had worn a distinctive shirt. According to a warrant later filed to search his phone, a detective claimed to have recognized Lung'aho's shirt and other specific features from surveillance video taken a few days earlier during a vandalism spree at a local Confederate cemetery, where several people were caught on camera destroying monuments. Officers showed up at Lung'aho's residence and arrested him after a foot chase. \"Under the current climate, I just was compelled to flee,\" Lung'aho recalled in a conversation with us. 32 When the police searched his phone, they found encrypted group chats and social media messages that they claim tied him to high-profile demonstrations in Little Rock throughout 2020. This turned out to be a key moment for law enforcement-and a big payoff after months of tracking Black activists. 33 According to the authorities, messages on Lung'aho's phone indicated that he participated in several attacks on police vehicles. After arresting him, the police reached out to another alleged participant, Emily Terry, who'd messaged with Lung'aho the morning after the most recent outing. According to police documents, Terry positively identified others who were involved. Although a criminal complaint alleged that Terry threw a Molotov cocktail, Terry was never indicted. Terry declined to speak with us when reached by phone. 34 On December 17, Jeffrey was arrested and charged. Federal prosecutors alleged that she was present when Molotov cocktails were made at her house and drove with friends who tried but failed to set an empty squad car on fire. Three other activists, Renea Goddard, Loba Espinosa-Villegas, and Emily Nowlin, were also arrested and agreed to plead guilty to lesser charges. In interviews, they said they were friends with Jeffrey and that her home had become a haven for activists that summer. None recalled her plotting illegal actions, and the police affidavit doesn't identify her by name when describing the more serious incidents that night. 35 Espinosa-Villegas told us that it seemed, based on police questioning, that prosecutors saw Jeffrey and Lung'aho, the only Black defendants charged, as the \"big fish.\" 36 \"Their intention was to try and figure out, was it [Jeffrey or Lung'aho] who was the leader?\" The actual leader, Espinosa-Villegas said, was another person whom prosecutors accused of illegal actions, according to a criminal complaint naming multiple defendants. The documents also show that prosecutors named two others, including Terry, who allegedly committed similar crimes. None were indicted. 37 In repeated interviews, Jeffrey denied she had ever possessed or used a Molotov cocktail. Under immense pressure given the charges against her, and fearful of her chances at trial, she accepted a plea deal in May. In her plea agreement, Jeffrey acknowledged being present during the attack and the mixing of Molotov cocktails and \"agreed with others to commit acts of vandalism on government buildings and damaging police cars by puncturing tires and/or breaking windows.\" 38 \"There's no way you can be an American citizen feeling like you're being attacked or at war with your own government,\" she said in an interview. \"When do the scales balance for justice?\" 39 Jeffrey's supporters present an image of a leader dispensing hard truths about political injustices in America, unfairly persecuted by the powerful entities she criticized.

Federal prosecutors alleged that she was present when Molotov cocktails were made at her house and drove with friends who tried but failed to set an empty squad car on fire. Three other activists, Renea Goddard, Loba Espinosa-Villegas, and Emily Nowlin, were also arrested and agreed to plead guilty to lesser charges. In interviews, they said they were friends with Jeffrey and that her home had become a haven for activists that summer. None recalled her plotting illegal actions, and the police affidavit doesn't identify her by name when describing the more serious incidents that night. 35 Espinosa-Villegas told us that it seemed, based on police questioning, that prosecutors saw Jeffrey and Lung'aho, the only Black defendants charged, as the \"big fish.\" 36 \"Their intention was to try and figure out, was it [Jeffrey or Lung'aho] who was the leader?\" The actual leader, Espinosa-Villegas said, was another person whom prosecutors accused of illegal actions, according to a criminal complaint naming multiple defendants. The documents also show that prosecutors named two others, including Terry, who allegedly committed similar crimes. None were indicted. 37 In repeated interviews, Jeffrey denied she had ever possessed or used a Molotov cocktail. Under immense pressure given the charges against her, and fearful of her chances at trial, she accepted a plea deal in May. In her plea agreement, Jeffrey acknowledged being present during the attack and the mixing of Molotov cocktails and \"agreed with others to commit acts of vandalism on government buildings and damaging police cars by puncturing tires and/or breaking windows.\" 38 \"There's no way you can be an American citizen feeling like you're being attacked or at war with your own government,\" she said in an interview. \"When do the scales balance for justice?\" 39 Jeffrey's supporters present an image of a leader dispensing hard truths about political injustices in America, unfairly persecuted by the powerful entities she criticized. By contrast, those on the other side of the political spectrum see her as a provocateur who got what she deserved. 40 In a Facebook group called \"Make Little Rock Great Again,\" whose moderators have alluded to being local police officers, an administrator of the page posted a cartoon of a police officer shooting a Black woman in the head, mocking a post by Jeffrey. One person commented, \"Be a shame if she came up missing,\" and followed that with: \"Lemme rephrase that correctly...replace she with it.\" When asked about the page, a police department spokesperson said, \"There's no way to conclusively determine if this page is moderated by any member of the Little Rock Police Department.\" 41 Lung'aho, a spoken-word artist, told us that he and Jeffrey had both been targeted for their politics. He's accused of throwing Molotov cocktails on multiple occasions and faces more time in prison than anybody else. \"The entire reason why we were doing the activism that we were involved in is because we were doing something for Black people,\" Lung'aho said, speaking to us from jail. 42 N ot all of the jurisdictions that experienced unrest in the wake of George Floyd's murder-even when that unrest turned destructive-resorted to federal prosecutions. Our past reporting found that such prosecutions were especially likely in jurisdictions whose US attorneys were politically affiliated with the Trump administration. 43 In Little Rock, Trump had an ideological ally in Cody Hiland, then the US attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas. A former local prosecutor-and, before that, deputy chief of staff to former governor Mike Huckabee-Hiland showed an eagerness to pursue the Trump administration's political goals, once resurrecting an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. In Congress, GOP Senator Tom Cotton, who later called for federal troops to be deployed against racial justice protests, lauded Hiland's nomination by Trump. 44 In an op-ed published amid the protests, Hiland wrote, \"It is my prayer that the shrill cries of 'Defund the Police' always be muted by our nation's earnest declaration that we 'thank God for the Police.'\" 45 When police found messages and photos on Lung'aho's phone suggesting he was involved in the attacks, they sent the evidence to agents at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Hiland soon got personally involved in the case, inviting Lung'aho's attorney, Michael Kaiser, to meet with him at the police station where Lung'aho was being detained. 46 The US attorney hoped that he could persuade Lung'aho to provide information about other protesters, according to Kaiser. Hiland told Kaiser he had the authority to add several charges involving the use of a destructive device in a crime of violence that would carry sentences of 30 years to life. \"I hadn't ever seen that before,\" Kaiser said, adding that it was unusual for a US attorney to get so involved in a case that didn't involve charges like murder or drug trafficking. 47 Prosecutors' actions in the case align with findings from the Movement for Black Lives report. The authorities filed multiple and redundant charges against protesters, a technique critics say is meant to pressure defendants into accepting plea deals. The same technique was used by federal prosecutors against at least 84 racial justice protesters in 2020. One protester in Philadelphia was hit with four federal arson charges for burning two police cars, because the cars had benefited from federal funding and, the government claimed in a filing, had a role in interstate commerce. 48 Hiland resigned from his federal post in the final weeks of Trump's presidency and is now working on Sarah Huckabee Sanders's gubernatorial campaign; Sanders recently nominated him to be the next chair of the Arkansas Republican Party. Hiland didn't respond to our calls and texts regarding this story. 49 Meanwhile, local pro-Trump Facebook pages tracked Jeffrey's and Lung'aho's cases. During an early pretrial hearing for Lung'aho, over a dozen men wearing paramilitary clothing and carrying rifles loitered on street corners near the courthouse. 50 F or most of the past year, Jeffrey and Lung'aho were held in separate wings of the Greene County Detention Center in rural Arkansas. Judges revoked bond for both of them less than a year after they were arrested. The courts faulted them for failing tests for cannabis use, missing check-ins, and, in Lunga'ho's case, an arrest for public intoxication. Recently, after pleading guilty to a single count of conspiracy to possess a destructive device, Jeffrey was transferred back to a detention center in Little Rock. 51 As both cases have plodded along for nearly two years, Jeffrey's supporters have continued their efforts to raise awareness and funds. She eventually hired Phillip Hamilton, a New York City-based corporate lawyer, as her counsel. In a motion to appeal her ongoing detention, Hamilton described Jeffrey's distress: Her long separation from her 12-year-old daughter and her family had reached \"the point where it was making her mentally and emotionally sick,\" Hamilton wrote, adding that he had been unable to communicate regularly with Jeffrey because of staffing shortages at the Pulaski County Regional Detention Facility. 52 When Jeffrey spoke to us in January, she described the pain of the family separation, noting that she was her daughter's primary caregiver. In the messages she sends to her daughter, \"I'm always reflecting that I love her, and that she's my forever,\" Jeffrey said. \"It's really hard not being in her life, making her lunch and dinner, tucking her into bed.\" 53 Lung'aho is still fighting his case and hoping that his battle can help others in his position. In November 2021, Kaiser filed a motion urging the judge to consider whether prosecutors had stretched \"the reach of federal criminal law beyond its constitutional bounds.\" He argues that the Justice Department lacks jurisdiction in the case, pointing out that federal funding for the affected police agencies is minuscule. \"From minute one, we've said this is a state case charged federally because of politics,\" Kaiser said in an interview. 54 Almost a year later, US District Judge D.P. Marshal ruled that although the destroyed police cars were not federal property nor purchased with federal financial assistance, Lung'aho could still be federally charged with arson. But Marshal dismissed three of Lung'aho's 13 charges, each of which prescribed a 30-year mandatory minimum sentence, for using a destructive device during a crime of violence. \"Federal arson is not a crime of violence,\" Marshal wrote-at least in Lung'aho's case. 55 The ruling dropped Lung'aho's maximum prison sentence from more than 90 years to somewhere between 10 and 30, according to Kaiser. But federal prosecutors immediately filed an appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which could take up to eight months to issue a ruling-and Lung'aho would remain in jail the whole time. 56 If the ruling is upheld, he is considering going to trial, despite the risk of prison time and the extraordinarily low success rates of federal defendants. 57 \"Ten years is scary, but the 30-to-life is what they threatened at the beginning, and now it's all gone,\" Kaiser said the morning of the ruling. Lung'aho is more willing to face a jury \"now that the potential sentence for accepting a plea deal is only slightly better than what we'd face at trial.\" 58 Meanwhile, Jeffrey's incarceration has been a devastating coda to a summer that initially held so much hope for change. Since then, the GOP-controlled Arkansas legislature has passed a raft of regressive bills loosening checks on police and private militias and restricting public education under the guise of stopping \"critical race theory.\" 59 The surveillance and prosecutions \"crumbled the activist movement in Arkansas, because nobody can trust anybody,\" said Brooklen Mason, a Little Rock activist who knows Jeffrey and several other defendants. \"And part of the work is being able to trust people.\" 60 The ACLU's Dickson agrees, noting that Jeffrey's long incarceration has had a \"chilling effect\" on local activism. \"That's not a defect,\" she said. \"That's part of the design.\" 61\n\n\"I'm just someone who cared about my community, an organizer who cared about what was going on with Black people-to me, 'Black Lives Matter' is a slogan, but I'm Black, and my life matters,\" she told us from jail. 16 I n early 2020, Jeffrey organized a campaign for a seat in the state legislature for her friend Ryan Davis, a prison reform activist and the executive director of UA Little Rock Children International, a partnership between the University of Arkansas and a nonprofit organization that serves families in the area. Davis lost by a single vote. 17 \"There are folks who are very vocal about the fact that they think [Jeffrey] was too loud, that she was, in their words, doing too much,\" Davis said. But \"I don't find anybody out here right now as intrepid as her, because she was such a powerful voice.\" 18 In the weeks following Floyd's murder, Jeffrey started a statewide bail fund for protesters. It's now a permanent fund for people in Little Rock who can't afford bail. 19 In a video promoting the fund, Jeffrey laid out her theory of change. \"Protests disrupt daily lives as usual, so it's good to start disrupting business as usual for them,\" she says. \"When you start taking it to them and put it in their face, where they can't ignore it, then they start listening and say, 'Well, what are they talking about?'\" 20 Other Arkansas activists shared her approach. Demonstrations for racial justice in Little Rock were disruptive but peaceful. That soon changed. Police amped up their use of riot munitions. Protesters smashed the windows of downtown businesses late in the night, according to police incident reports sent to us in response to a records request. 21 Arkansas State Police began using a \"fusion center,\" a post-9/11 innovation that was meant to facilitate information sharing between local and federal police for anti-terrorism purposes, to track even peaceful protesters-endangering First Amendment rights to free speech and assembly. Records indicate that the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Arkansas State Police compiled lists of upcoming protest events, including some explicitly described as peaceful, echoing the War on Terror-era surveillance of Muslim gatherings. 22 \"There was a concerted effort by law enforcement to do cross-agency cooperation and communication in response to these protests,\" said the ACLU's Dickson regarding the sharing of tips between the city police and state fusion center. \"It was very clear it was happening, from [the use of] infiltrators to [carrying out] open and obvious surveillance.\" 23 Apart from tracking Jeffrey, local police were following false leads, including an unsubstantiated rumor that busloads of antifa activists were booking hotels in the city. Federal and state police tracked protests across Arkansas, while US Attorney General Bill Barr activated all 56 of the nation's FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces, which rely on deputized local law enforcement, to stop \"violent radical elements.\" 24 In July, Barr traveled to Little Rock to meet with local law enforcement officials. In public remarks, he said the FBI's terrorism task forces were working with local police to share intelligence \"and go after the people we think are ringleaders\" behind protest violence. 25 The Nation and Type Investigations, in partnership with the Arkansas Nonprofit News Network, sent public records requests to the Arkansas State Police and Little Rock Police Department for all documents related to protest activity, rioting activity, and the destruction of property in Little Rock from June through September 2020. The response included hundreds of pages of e-mail records between local police, state intelligence officers, and federal agents. Taken together, they show authorities zeroing in on Black activists, including Jeffrey, for protest activity-while largely dismissing the threat posed by counterprotesters. 26 In an e-mail dated May 30, 2020, Heath Helton, the assistant police chief in Little Rock, warned of an event \"which to my understanding is being organized by Dawn Jeffrey.... Our partners at ASP [Arkansas State Police] and the State Capital have been made aware of this event, which is supposed to be peaceful.\" A June 1 screenshot of Jeffrey's Facebook page about a die-in-when protesters simulate being dead-also appears to have originated from the Arkansas fusion center. 27 The state police did not respond to questions we sent about Jeffrey. The Little Rock Police Department defended its approach. \"As with any policing agency, the role of LRPD is to protect the citizens ... they serve. Ms. Jeffrey had/has a public page which means it is viewable,\" a spokesperson for the department said. \"Therefore, there can be no violation in looking at a public page.\" 28 Jeffrey is by far the most mentioned activist in the law enforcement e-mails we reviewed. In one instance, surveillance records line up with an arrest. On July 12, she was arrested by local police at a demonstration outside of a custard shop in nearby Conway. A video recorded by a reporter shows police calling Jeffrey by name and then immediately handcuffing her without a clear reason. The Conway Police Department said she was arrested for trespassing. Intelligence officers for the Arkansas State Police were aware that Jeffrey would be at the event because they were monitoring her Facebook page in the fusion center and sent out an e-mail with a link to a livestream of the protest. While it's not clear whether this monitoring led directly to her arrest that day, the e-mail was one of at least eight sent by senior intelligence officials in the fusion center that referred to Jeffrey's organizing or her participation in nonviolent protests. By comparison, out of hundreds of e-mails and other communications, we saw few that referred to counterprotest groups-and even when they were mentioned, law enforcement focused not on the threat of violence they might pose but on possible violence initiated by racial justice protesters. In one e-mail, an FBI agent dismissed a man's threats \"encouraging the destruction of African Americans' property\" as \"just talking online.\" 29 Center of the dragnet: BLM protester Benjamin Mujera Lung'aho faces criminal charges after being surveilled for months. (Thomas Metthe / Arkansas Democrat-Gazette) T he heavy surveillance of the protesters ultimately caught up with Jeffrey-thanks in part to a T-shirt. 30 One of her closest friends, Mujera Benjamin Lung'aho, was also at the July protest at the Capitol. The two first met in high school, where they played soccer together, and reconnected years later as the racial justice uprising in Ferguson, Mo., reverberated across the country. They eventually grew close enough that Jeffrey spoke at Lung'aho's father's funeral. 31 At the Capitol clash, Lung'aho had worn a distinctive shirt. According to a warrant later filed to search his phone, a detective claimed to have recognized Lung'aho's shirt and other specific features from surveillance video taken a few days earlier during a vandalism spree at a local Confederate cemetery, where several people were caught on camera destroying monuments. Officers showed up at Lung'aho's residence and arrested him after a foot chase. \"Under the current climate, I just was compelled to flee,\" Lung'aho recalled in a conversation with us. 32 When the police searched his phone, they found encrypted group chats and social media messages that they claim tied him to high-profile demonstrations in Little Rock throughout 2020. This turned out to be a key moment for law enforcement-and a big payoff after months of tracking Black activists. 33 According to the authorities, messages on Lung'aho's phone indicated that he participated in several attacks on police vehicles. After arresting him, the police reached out to another alleged participant, Emily Terry, who'd messaged with Lung'aho the morning after the most recent outing. According to police documents, Terry positively identified others who were involved. Although a criminal complaint alleged that Terry threw a Molotov cocktail, Terry was never indicted.

None recalled her plotting illegal actions, and the police affidavit doesn't identify her by name when describing the more serious incidents that night. 35 Espinosa-Villegas told us that it seemed, based on police questioning, that prosecutors saw Jeffrey and Lung'aho, the only Black defendants charged, as the \"big fish.\" 36 \"Their intention was to try and figure out, was it [Jeffrey or Lung'aho] who was the leader?\" The actual leader, Espinosa-Villegas said, was another person whom prosecutors accused of illegal actions, according to a criminal complaint naming multiple defendants. The documents also show that prosecutors named two others, including Terry, who allegedly committed similar crimes. None were indicted. 37 In repeated interviews, Jeffrey denied she had ever possessed or used a Molotov cocktail. Under immense pressure given the charges against her, and fearful of her chances at trial, she accepted a plea deal in May. In her plea agreement, Jeffrey acknowledged being present during the attack and the mixing of Molotov cocktails and \"agreed with others to commit acts of vandalism on government buildings and damaging police cars by puncturing tires and/or breaking windows.\" 38 \"There's no way you can be an American citizen feeling like you're being attacked or at war with your own government,\" she said in an interview. \"When do the scales balance for justice?\" 39 Jeffrey's supporters present an image of a leader dispensing hard truths about political injustices in America, unfairly persecuted by the powerful entities she criticized. By contrast, those on the other side of the political spectrum see her as a provocateur who got what she deserved. 40 In a Facebook group called \"Make Little Rock Great Again,\" whose moderators have alluded to being local police officers, an administrator of the page posted a cartoon of a police officer shooting a Black woman in the head, mocking a post by Jeffrey. One person commented, \"Be a shame if she came up missing,\" and followed that with: \"Lemme rephrase that correctly...replace she with it.\" When asked about the page, a police department spokesperson said, \"There's no way to conclusively determine if this page is moderated by any member of the Little Rock Police Department.\" 41 Lung'aho, a spoken-word artist, told us that he and Jeffrey had both been targeted for their politics. He's accused of throwing Molotov cocktails on multiple occasions and faces more time in prison than anybody else. \"The entire reason why we were doing the activism that we were involved in is because we were doing something for Black people,\" Lung'aho said, speaking to us from jail. 42 N ot all of the jurisdictions that experienced unrest in the wake of George Floyd's murder-even when that unrest turned destructive-resorted to federal prosecutions. Our past reporting found that such prosecutions were especially likely in jurisdictions whose US attorneys were politically affiliated with the Trump administration. 43 In Little Rock, Trump had an ideological ally in Cody Hiland, then the US attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas. A former local prosecutor-and, before that, deputy chief of staff to former governor Mike Huckabee-Hiland showed an eagerness to pursue the Trump administration's political goals, once resurrecting an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. In Congress, GOP Senator Tom Cotton, who later called for federal troops to be deployed against racial justice protests, lauded Hiland's nomination by Trump. 44 In an op-ed published amid the protests, Hiland wrote, \"It is my prayer that the shrill cries of 'Defund the Police' always be muted by our nation's earnest declaration that we 'thank God for the Police.'\" 45 When police found messages and photos on Lung'aho's phone suggesting he was involved in the attacks, they sent the evidence to agents at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Hiland soon got personally involved in the case, inviting Lung'aho's attorney, Michael Kaiser, to meet with him at the police station where Lung'aho was being detained. 46 The US attorney hoped that he could persuade Lung'aho to provide information about other protesters, according to Kaiser. Hiland told Kaiser he had the authority to add several charges involving the use of a destructive device in a crime of violence that would carry sentences of 30 years to life. \"I hadn't ever seen that before,\" Kaiser said, adding that it was unusual for a US attorney to get so involved in a case that didn't involve charges like murder or drug trafficking. 47 Prosecutors' actions in the case align with findings from the Movement for Black Lives report. The authorities filed multiple and redundant charges against protesters, a technique critics say is meant to pressure defendants into accepting plea deals. The same technique was used by federal prosecutors against at least 84 racial justice protesters in 2020. One protester in Philadelphia was hit with four federal arson charges for burning two police cars, because the cars had benefited from federal funding and, the government claimed in a filing, had a role in interstate commerce. 48 Hiland resigned from his federal post in the final weeks of Trump's presidency and is now working on Sarah Huckabee Sanders's gubernatorial campaign; Sanders recently nominated him to be the next chair of the Arkansas Republican Party. Hiland didn't respond to our calls and texts regarding this story. 49 Meanwhile, local pro-Trump Facebook pages tracked Jeffrey's and Lung'aho's cases. During an early pretrial hearing for Lung'aho, over a dozen men wearing paramilitary clothing and carrying rifles loitered on street corners near the courthouse. 50 F or most of the past year, Jeffrey and Lung'aho were held in separate wings of the Greene County Detention Center in rural Arkansas. Judges revoked bond for both of them less than a year after they were arrested. The courts faulted them for failing tests for cannabis use, missing check-ins, and, in Lunga'ho's case, an arrest for public intoxication. Recently, after pleading guilty to a single count of conspiracy to possess a destructive device, Jeffrey was transferred back to a detention center in Little Rock. 51 As both cases have plodded along for nearly two years, Jeffrey's supporters have continued their efforts to raise awareness and funds. She eventually hired Phillip Hamilton, a New York City-based corporate lawyer, as her counsel. In a motion to appeal her ongoing detention, Hamilton described Jeffrey's distress: Her long separation from her 12-year-old daughter and her family had reached \"the point where it was making her mentally and emotionally sick,\" Hamilton wrote, adding that he had been unable to communicate regularly with Jeffrey because of staffing shortages at the Pulaski County Regional Detention Facility. 52 When Jeffrey spoke to us in January, she described the pain of the family separation, noting that she was her daughter's primary caregiver. In the messages she sends to her daughter, \"I'm always reflecting that I love her, and that she's my forever,\" Jeffrey said. \"It's really hard not being in her life, making her lunch and dinner, tucking her into bed.\" 53 Lung'aho is still fighting his case and hoping that his battle can help others in his position. In November 2021, Kaiser filed a motion urging the judge to consider whether prosecutors had stretched \"the reach of federal criminal law beyond its constitutional bounds.\" He argues that the Justice Department lacks jurisdiction in the case, pointing out that federal funding for the affected police agencies is minuscule. \"From minute one, we've said this is a state case charged federally because of politics,\" Kaiser said in an interview. 54 Almost a year later, US District Judge D.P. Marshal ruled that although the destroyed police cars were not federal property nor purchased with federal financial assistance, Lung'aho could still be federally charged with arson. But Marshal dismissed three of Lung'aho's 13 charges, each of which prescribed a 30-year mandatory minimum sentence, for using a destructive device during a crime of violence. \"Federal arson is not a crime of violence,\" Marshal wrote-at least in Lung'aho's case. 55 The ruling dropped Lung'aho's maximum prison sentence from more than 90 years to somewhere between 10 and 30, according to Kaiser. But federal prosecutors immediately filed an appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which could take up to eight months to issue a ruling-and Lung'aho would remain in jail the whole time. 56 If the ruling is upheld, he is considering going to trial, despite the risk of prison time and the extraordinarily low success rates of federal defendants. 57 \"Ten years is scary, but the 30-to-life is what they threatened at the beginning, and now it's all gone,\" Kaiser said the morning of the ruling. Lung'aho is more willing to face a jury \"now that the potential sentence for accepting a plea deal is only slightly better than what we'd face at trial.\" 58 Meanwhile, Jeffrey's incarceration has been a devastating coda to a summer that initially held so much hope for change. Since then, the GOP-controlled Arkansas legislature has passed a raft of regressive bills loosening checks on police and private militias and restricting public education under the guise of stopping \"critical race theory.\" 59 The surveillance and prosecutions \"crumbled the activist movement in Arkansas, because nobody can trust anybody,\" said Brooklen Mason, a Little Rock activist who knows Jeffrey and several other defendants. \"And part of the work is being able to trust people.\" 60 The ACLU's Dickson agrees, noting that Jeffrey's long incarceration has had a \"chilling effect\" on local activism. \"That's not a defect,\" she said. \"That's part of the design.\" 61\n\n\"There are folks who are very vocal about the fact that they think [Jeffrey] was too loud, that she was, in their words, doing too much,\" Davis said. But \"I don't find anybody out here right now as intrepid as her, because she was such a powerful voice.\" 18 In the weeks following Floyd's murder, Jeffrey started a statewide bail fund for protesters. It's now a permanent fund for people in Little Rock who can't afford bail. 19 In a video promoting the fund, Jeffrey laid out her theory of change. \"Protests disrupt daily lives as usual, so it's good to start disrupting business as usual for them,\" she says. \"When you start taking it to them and put it in their face, where they can't ignore it, then they start listening and say, 'Well, what are they talking about?'\" 20 Other Arkansas activists shared her approach. Demonstrations for racial justice in Little Rock were disruptive but peaceful. That soon changed. Police amped up their use of riot munitions. Protesters smashed the windows of downtown businesses late in the night, according to police incident reports sent to us in response to a records request. 21 Arkansas State Police began using a \"fusion center,\" a post-9/11 innovation that was meant to facilitate information sharing between local and federal police for anti-terrorism purposes, to track even peaceful protesters-endangering First Amendment rights to free speech and assembly. Records indicate that the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Arkansas State Police compiled lists of upcoming protest events, including some explicitly described as peaceful, echoing the War on Terror-era surveillance of Muslim gatherings. 22 \"There was a concerted effort by law enforcement to do cross-agency cooperation and communication in response to these protests,\" said the ACLU's Dickson regarding the sharing of tips between the city police and state fusion center. \"It was very clear it was happening, from [the use of] infiltrators to [carrying out] open and obvious surveillance.\" 23 Apart from tracking Jeffrey, local police were following false leads, including an unsubstantiated rumor that busloads of antifa activists were booking hotels in the city. Federal and state police tracked protests across Arkansas, while US Attorney General Bill Barr activated all 56 of the nation's FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces, which rely on deputized local law enforcement, to stop \"violent radical elements.\" 24 In July, Barr traveled to Little Rock to meet with local law enforcement officials. In public remarks, he said the FBI's terrorism task forces were working with local police to share intelligence \"and go after the people we think are ringleaders\" behind protest violence. 25 The Nation and Type Investigations, in partnership with the Arkansas Nonprofit News Network, sent public records requests to the Arkansas State Police and Little Rock Police Department for all documents related to protest activity, rioting activity, and the destruction of property in Little Rock from June through September 2020. The response included hundreds of pages of e-mail records between local police, state intelligence officers, and federal agents. Taken together, they show authorities zeroing in on Black activists, including Jeffrey, for protest activity-while largely dismissing the threat posed by counterprotesters. 26 In an e-mail dated May 30, 2020, Heath Helton, the assistant police chief in Little Rock, warned of an event \"which to my understanding is being organized by Dawn Jeffrey.... Our partners at ASP [Arkansas State Police] and the State Capital have been made aware of this event, which is supposed to be peaceful.\" A June 1 screenshot of Jeffrey's Facebook page about a die-in-when protesters simulate being dead-also appears to have originated from the Arkansas fusion center. 27 The state police did not respond to questions we sent about Jeffrey. The Little Rock Police Department defended its approach. \"As with any policing agency, the role of LRPD is to protect the citizens ... they serve. Ms. Jeffrey had/has a public page which means it is viewable,\" a spokesperson for the department said. \"Therefore, there can be no violation in looking at a public page.\" 28 Jeffrey is by far the most mentioned activist in the law enforcement e-mails we reviewed. In one instance, surveillance records line up with an arrest. On July 12, she was arrested by local police at a demonstration outside of a custard shop in nearby Conway. A video recorded by a reporter shows police calling Jeffrey by name and then immediately handcuffing her without a clear reason. The Conway Police Department said she was arrested for trespassing. Intelligence officers for the Arkansas State Police were aware that Jeffrey would be at the event because they were monitoring her Facebook page in the fusion center and sent out an e-mail with a link to a livestream of the protest. While it's not clear whether this monitoring led directly to her arrest that day, the e-mail was one of at least eight sent by senior intelligence officials in the fusion center that referred to Jeffrey's organizing or her participation in nonviolent protests. By comparison, out of hundreds of e-mails and other communications, we saw few that referred to counterprotest groups-and even when they were mentioned, law enforcement focused not on the threat of violence they might pose but on possible violence initiated by racial justice protesters. In one e-mail, an FBI agent dismissed a man's threats \"encouraging the destruction of African Americans' property\" as \"just talking online.\" 29 Center of the dragnet: BLM protester Benjamin Mujera Lung'aho faces criminal charges after being surveilled for months. (Thomas Metthe / Arkansas Democrat-Gazette) T he heavy surveillance of the protesters ultimately caught up with Jeffrey-thanks in part to a T-shirt. 30 One of her closest friends, Mujera Benjamin Lung'aho, was also at the July protest at the Capitol. The two first met in high school, where they played soccer together, and reconnected years later as the racial justice uprising in Ferguson, Mo., reverberated across the country. They eventually grew close enough that Jeffrey spoke at Lung'aho's father's funeral. 31 At the Capitol clash, Lung'aho had worn a distinctive shirt. According to a warrant later filed to search his phone, a detective claimed to have recognized Lung'aho's shirt and other specific features from surveillance video taken a few days earlier during a vandalism spree at a local Confederate cemetery, where several people were caught on camera destroying monuments. Officers showed up at Lung'aho's residence and arrested him after a foot chase. \"Under the current climate, I just was compelled to flee,\" Lung'aho recalled in a conversation with us. 32 When the police searched his phone, they found encrypted group chats and social media messages that they claim tied him to high-profile demonstrations in Little Rock throughout 2020. This turned out to be a key moment for law enforcement-and a big payoff after months of tracking Black activists. 33 According to the authorities, messages on Lung'aho's phone indicated that he participated in several attacks on police vehicles. After arresting him, the police reached out to another alleged participant, Emily Terry, who'd messaged with Lung'aho the morning after the most recent outing. According to police documents, Terry positively identified others who were involved. Although a criminal complaint alleged that Terry threw a Molotov cocktail, Terry was never indicted. Terry declined to speak with us when reached by phone. 34 On December 17, Jeffrey was arrested and charged. Federal prosecutors alleged that she was present when Molotov cocktails were made at her house and drove with friends who tried but failed to set an empty squad car on fire. Three other activists, Renea Goddard, Loba Espinosa-Villegas, and Emily Nowlin, were also arrested and agreed to plead guilty to lesser charges.

One person commented, \"Be a shame if she came up missing,\" and followed that with: \"Lemme rephrase that correctly...replace she with it.\" When asked about the page, a police department spokesperson said, \"There's no way to conclusively determine if this page is moderated by any member of the Little Rock Police Department.\" 41 Lung'aho, a spoken-word artist, told us that he and Jeffrey had both been targeted for their politics. He's accused of throwing Molotov cocktails on multiple occasions and faces more time in prison than anybody else. \"The entire reason why we were doing the activism that we were involved in is because we were doing something for Black people,\" Lung'aho said, speaking to us from jail. 42 N ot all of the jurisdictions that experienced unrest in the wake of George Floyd's murder-even when that unrest turned destructive-resorted to federal prosecutions. Our past reporting found that such prosecutions were especially likely in jurisdictions whose US attorneys were politically affiliated with the Trump administration. 43 In Little Rock, Trump had an ideological ally in Cody Hiland, then the US attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas. A former local prosecutor-and, before that, deputy chief of staff to former governor Mike Huckabee-Hiland showed an eagerness to pursue the Trump administration's political goals, once resurrecting an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. In Congress, GOP Senator Tom Cotton, who later called for federal troops to be deployed against racial justice protests, lauded Hiland's nomination by Trump. 44 In an op-ed published amid the protests, Hiland wrote, \"It is my prayer that the shrill cries of 'Defund the Police' always be muted by our nation's earnest declaration that we 'thank God for the Police.'\" 45 When police found messages and photos on Lung'aho's phone suggesting he was involved in the attacks, they sent the evidence to agents at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Hiland soon got personally involved in the case, inviting Lung'aho's attorney, Michael Kaiser, to meet with him at the police station where Lung'aho was being detained. 46 The US attorney hoped that he could persuade Lung'aho to provide information about other protesters, according to Kaiser. Hiland told Kaiser he had the authority to add several charges involving the use of a destructive device in a crime of violence that would carry sentences of 30 years to life. \"I hadn't ever seen that before,\" Kaiser said, adding that it was unusual for a US attorney to get so involved in a case that didn't involve charges like murder or drug trafficking. 47 Prosecutors' actions in the case align with findings from the Movement for Black Lives report. The authorities filed multiple and redundant charges against protesters, a technique critics say is meant to pressure defendants into accepting plea deals. The same technique was used by federal prosecutors against at least 84 racial justice protesters in 2020. One protester in Philadelphia was hit with four federal arson charges for burning two police cars, because the cars had benefited from federal funding and, the government claimed in a filing, had a role in interstate commerce. 48 Hiland resigned from his federal post in the final weeks of Trump's presidency and is now working on Sarah Huckabee Sanders's gubernatorial campaign; Sanders recently nominated him to be the next chair of the Arkansas Republican Party. Hiland didn't respond to our calls and texts regarding this story. 49 Meanwhile, local pro-Trump Facebook pages tracked Jeffrey's and Lung'aho's cases. During an early pretrial hearing for Lung'aho, over a dozen men wearing paramilitary clothing and carrying rifles loitered on street corners near the courthouse. 50 F or most of the past year, Jeffrey and Lung'aho were held in separate wings of the Greene County Detention Center in rural Arkansas. Judges revoked bond for both of them less than a year after they were arrested. The courts faulted them for failing tests for cannabis use, missing check-ins, and, in Lunga'ho's case, an arrest for public intoxication. Recently, after pleading guilty to a single count of conspiracy to possess a destructive device, Jeffrey was transferred back to a detention center in Little Rock. 51 As both cases have plodded along for nearly two years, Jeffrey's supporters have continued their efforts to raise awareness and funds. She eventually hired Phillip Hamilton, a New York City-based corporate lawyer, as her counsel. In a motion to appeal her ongoing detention, Hamilton described Jeffrey's distress: Her long separation from her 12-year-old daughter and her family had reached \"the point where it was making her mentally and emotionally sick,\" Hamilton wrote, adding that he had been unable to communicate regularly with Jeffrey because of staffing shortages at the Pulaski County Regional Detention Facility. 52 When Jeffrey spoke to us in January, she described the pain of the family separation, noting that she was her daughter's primary caregiver. In the messages she sends to her daughter, \"I'm always reflecting that I love her, and that she's my forever,\" Jeffrey said. \"It's really hard not being in her life, making her lunch and dinner, tucking her into bed.\" 53 Lung'aho is still fighting his case and hoping that his battle can help others in his position. In November 2021, Kaiser filed a motion urging the judge to consider whether prosecutors had stretched \"the reach of federal criminal law beyond its constitutional bounds.\" He argues that the Justice Department lacks jurisdiction in the case, pointing out that federal funding for the affected police agencies is minuscule. \"From minute one, we've said this is a state case charged federally because of politics,\" Kaiser said in an interview. 54 Almost a year later, US District Judge D.P. Marshal ruled that although the destroyed police cars were not federal property nor purchased with federal financial assistance, Lung'aho could still be federally charged with arson. But Marshal dismissed three of Lung'aho's 13 charges, each of which prescribed a 30-year mandatory minimum sentence, for using a destructive device during a crime of violence. \"Federal arson is not a crime of violence,\" Marshal wrote-at least in Lung'aho's case. 55 The ruling dropped Lung'aho's maximum prison sentence from more than 90 years to somewhere between 10 and 30, according to Kaiser. But federal prosecutors immediately filed an appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which could take up to eight months to issue a ruling-and Lung'aho would remain in jail the whole time. 56 If the ruling is upheld, he is considering going to trial, despite the risk of prison time and the extraordinarily low success rates of federal defendants. 57 \"Ten years is scary, but the 30-to-life is what they threatened at the beginning, and now it's all gone,\" Kaiser said the morning of the ruling. Lung'aho is more willing to face a jury \"now that the potential sentence for accepting a plea deal is only slightly better than what we'd face at trial.\" 58 Meanwhile, Jeffrey's incarceration has been a devastating coda to a summer that initially held so much hope for change. Since then, the GOP-controlled Arkansas legislature has passed a raft of regressive bills loosening checks on police and private militias and restricting public education under the guise of stopping \"critical race theory.\" 59 The surveillance and prosecutions \"crumbled the activist movement in Arkansas, because nobody can trust anybody,\" said Brooklen Mason, a Little Rock activist who knows Jeffrey and several other defendants. \"And part of the work is being able to trust people.\" 60 The ACLU's Dickson agrees, noting that Jeffrey's long incarceration has had a \"chilling effect\" on local activism. \"That's not a defect,\" she said. \"That's part of the design.\" 61\n\nIn a video promoting the fund, Jeffrey laid out her theory of change. \"Protests disrupt daily lives as usual, so it's good to start disrupting business as usual for them,\" she says. \"When you start taking it to them and put it in their face, where they can't ignore it, then they start listening and say, 'Well, what are they talking about?'\" 20 Other Arkansas activists shared her approach. Demonstrations for racial justice in Little Rock were disruptive but peaceful. That soon changed. Police amped up their use of riot munitions. Protesters smashed the windows of downtown businesses late in the night, according to police incident reports sent to us in response to a records request. 21 Arkansas State Police began using a \"fusion center,\" a post-9/11 innovation that was meant to facilitate information sharing between local and federal police for anti-terrorism purposes, to track even peaceful protesters-endangering First Amendment rights to free speech and assembly. Records indicate that the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Arkansas State Police compiled lists of upcoming protest events, including some explicitly described as peaceful, echoing the War on Terror-era surveillance of Muslim gatherings. 22 \"There was a concerted effort by law enforcement to do cross-agency cooperation and communication in response to these protests,\" said the ACLU's Dickson regarding the sharing of tips between the city police and state fusion center. \"It was very clear it was happening, from [the use of] infiltrators to [carrying out] open and obvious surveillance.\" 23 Apart from tracking Jeffrey, local police were following false leads, including an unsubstantiated rumor that busloads of antifa activists were booking hotels in the city. Federal and state police tracked protests across Arkansas, while US Attorney General Bill Barr activated all 56 of the nation's FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces, which rely on deputized local law enforcement, to stop \"violent radical elements.\" 24 In July, Barr traveled to Little Rock to meet with local law enforcement officials. In public remarks, he said the FBI's terrorism task forces were working with local police to share intelligence \"and go after the people we think are ringleaders\" behind protest violence. 25 The Nation and Type Investigations, in partnership with the Arkansas Nonprofit News Network, sent public records requests to the Arkansas State Police and Little Rock Police Department for all documents related to protest activity, rioting activity, and the destruction of property in Little Rock from June through September 2020. The response included hundreds of pages of e-mail records between local police, state intelligence officers, and federal agents. Taken together, they show authorities zeroing in on Black activists, including Jeffrey, for protest activity-while largely dismissing the threat posed by counterprotesters. 26 In an e-mail dated May 30, 2020, Heath Helton, the assistant police chief in Little Rock, warned of an event \"which to my understanding is being organized by Dawn Jeffrey.... Our partners at ASP [Arkansas State Police] and the State Capital have been made aware of this event, which is supposed to be peaceful.\" A June 1 screenshot of Jeffrey's Facebook page about a die-in-when protesters simulate being dead-also appears to have originated from the Arkansas fusion center. 27 The state police did not respond to questions we sent about Jeffrey. The Little Rock Police Department defended its approach. \"As with any policing agency, the role of LRPD is to protect the citizens ... they serve. Ms. Jeffrey had/has a public page which means it is viewable,\" a spokesperson for the department said. \"Therefore, there can be no violation in looking at a public page.\" 28 Jeffrey is by far the most mentioned activist in the law enforcement e-mails we reviewed. In one instance, surveillance records line up with an arrest. On July 12, she was arrested by local police at a demonstration outside of a custard shop in nearby Conway. A video recorded by a reporter shows police calling Jeffrey by name and then immediately handcuffing her without a clear reason. The Conway Police Department said she was arrested for trespassing. Intelligence officers for the Arkansas State Police were aware that Jeffrey would be at the event because they were monitoring her Facebook page in the fusion center and sent out an e-mail with a link to a livestream of the protest. While it's not clear whether this monitoring led directly to her arrest that day, the e-mail was one of at least eight sent by senior intelligence officials in the fusion center that referred to Jeffrey's organizing or her participation in nonviolent protests. By comparison, out of hundreds of e-mails and other communications, we saw few that referred to counterprotest groups-and even when they were mentioned, law enforcement focused not on the threat of violence they might pose but on possible violence initiated by racial justice protesters. In one e-mail, an FBI agent dismissed a man's threats \"encouraging the destruction of African Americans' property\" as \"just talking online.\" 29 Center of the dragnet: BLM protester Benjamin Mujera Lung'aho faces criminal charges after being surveilled for months. (Thomas Metthe / Arkansas Democrat-Gazette) T he heavy surveillance of the protesters ultimately caught up with Jeffrey-thanks in part to a T-shirt. 30 One of her closest friends, Mujera Benjamin Lung'aho, was also at the July protest at the Capitol. The two first met in high school, where they played soccer together, and reconnected years later as the racial justice uprising in Ferguson, Mo., reverberated across the country. They eventually grew close enough that Jeffrey spoke at Lung'aho's father's funeral. 31 At the Capitol clash, Lung'aho had worn a distinctive shirt. According to a warrant later filed to search his phone, a detective claimed to have recognized Lung'aho's shirt and other specific features from surveillance video taken a few days earlier during a vandalism spree at a local Confederate cemetery, where several people were caught on camera destroying monuments. Officers showed up at Lung'aho's residence and arrested him after a foot chase. \"Under the current climate, I just was compelled to flee,\" Lung'aho recalled in a conversation with us. 32 When the police searched his phone, they found encrypted group chats and social media messages that they claim tied him to high-profile demonstrations in Little Rock throughout 2020. This turned out to be a key moment for law enforcement-and a big payoff after months of tracking Black activists. 33 According to the authorities, messages on Lung'aho's phone indicated that he participated in several attacks on police vehicles. After arresting him, the police reached out to another alleged participant, Emily Terry, who'd messaged with Lung'aho the morning after the most recent outing. According to police documents, Terry positively identified others who were involved. Although a criminal complaint alleged that Terry threw a Molotov cocktail, Terry was never indicted. Terry declined to speak with us when reached by phone. 34 On December 17, Jeffrey was arrested and charged. Federal prosecutors alleged that she was present when Molotov cocktails were made at her house and drove with friends who tried but failed to set an empty squad car on fire. Three other activists, Renea Goddard, Loba Espinosa-Villegas, and Emily Nowlin, were also arrested and agreed to plead guilty to lesser charges. In interviews, they said they were friends with Jeffrey and that her home had become a haven for activists that summer. None recalled her plotting illegal actions, and the police affidavit doesn't identify her by name when describing the more serious incidents that night. 35 Espinosa-Villegas told us that it seemed, based on police questioning, that prosecutors saw Jeffrey and Lung'aho, the only Black defendants charged, as the \"big fish.\" 36 \"Their intention was to try and figure out, was it [Jeffrey or Lung'aho] who was the leader?\" The actual leader, Espinosa-Villegas said, was another person whom prosecutors accused of illegal actions, according to a criminal complaint naming multiple defendants. The documents also show that prosecutors named two others, including Terry, who allegedly committed similar crimes. None were indicted. 37 In repeated interviews, Jeffrey denied she had ever possessed or used a Molotov cocktail. Under immense pressure given the charges against her, and fearful of her chances at trial, she accepted a plea deal in May. In her plea agreement, Jeffrey acknowledged being present during the attack and the mixing of Molotov cocktails and \"agreed with others to commit acts of vandalism on government buildings and damaging police cars by puncturing tires and/or breaking windows.\" 38 \"There's no way you can be an American citizen feeling like you're being attacked or at war with your own government,\" she said in an interview. \"When do the scales balance for justice?\" 39 Jeffrey's supporters present an image of a leader dispensing hard truths about political injustices in America, unfairly persecuted by the powerful entities she criticized.

Hiland told Kaiser he had the authority to add several charges involving the use of a destructive device in a crime of violence that would carry sentences of 30 years to life. \"I hadn't ever seen that before,\" Kaiser said, adding that it was unusual for a US attorney to get so involved in a case that didn't involve charges like murder or drug trafficking. 47 Prosecutors' actions in the case align with findings from the Movement for Black Lives report. The authorities filed multiple and redundant charges against protesters, a technique critics say is meant to pressure defendants into accepting plea deals. The same technique was used by federal prosecutors against at least 84 racial justice protesters in 2020. One protester in Philadelphia was hit with four federal arson charges for burning two police cars, because the cars had benefited from federal funding and, the government claimed in a filing, had a role in interstate commerce. 48 Hiland resigned from his federal post in the final weeks of Trump's presidency and is now working on Sarah Huckabee Sanders's gubernatorial campaign; Sanders recently nominated him to be the next chair of the Arkansas Republican Party. Hiland didn't respond to our calls and texts regarding this story. 49 Meanwhile, local pro-Trump Facebook pages tracked Jeffrey's and Lung'aho's cases. During an early pretrial hearing for Lung'aho, over a dozen men wearing paramilitary clothing and carrying rifles loitered on street corners near the courthouse. 50 F or most of the past year, Jeffrey and Lung'aho were held in separate wings of the Greene County Detention Center in rural Arkansas. Judges revoked bond for both of them less than a year after they were arrested. The courts faulted them for failing tests for cannabis use, missing check-ins, and, in Lunga'ho's case, an arrest for public intoxication. Recently, after pleading guilty to a single count of conspiracy to possess a destructive device, Jeffrey was transferred back to a detention center in Little Rock. 51 As both cases have plodded along for nearly two years, Jeffrey's supporters have continued their efforts to raise awareness and funds. She eventually hired Phillip Hamilton, a New York City-based corporate lawyer, as her counsel. In a motion to appeal her ongoing detention, Hamilton described Jeffrey's distress: Her long separation from her 12-year-old daughter and her family had reached \"the point where it was making her mentally and emotionally sick,\" Hamilton wrote, adding that he had been unable to communicate regularly with Jeffrey because of staffing shortages at the Pulaski County Regional Detention Facility. 52 When Jeffrey spoke to us in January, she described the pain of the family separation, noting that she was her daughter's primary caregiver. In the messages she sends to her daughter, \"I'm always reflecting that I love her, and that she's my forever,\" Jeffrey said. \"It's really hard not being in her life, making her lunch and dinner, tucking her into bed.\" 53 Lung'aho is still fighting his case and hoping that his battle can help others in his position. In November 2021, Kaiser filed a motion urging the judge to consider whether prosecutors had stretched \"the reach of federal criminal law beyond its constitutional bounds.\" He argues that the Justice Department lacks jurisdiction in the case, pointing out that federal funding for the affected police agencies is minuscule. \"From minute one, we've said this is a state case charged federally because of politics,\" Kaiser said in an interview. 54 Almost a year later, US District Judge D.P. Marshal ruled that although the destroyed police cars were not federal property nor purchased with federal financial assistance, Lung'aho could still be federally charged with arson. But Marshal dismissed three of Lung'aho's 13 charges, each of which prescribed a 30-year mandatory minimum sentence, for using a destructive device during a crime of violence. \"Federal arson is not a crime of violence,\" Marshal wrote-at least in Lung'aho's case. 55 The ruling dropped Lung'aho's maximum prison sentence from more than 90 years to somewhere between 10 and 30, according to Kaiser. But federal prosecutors immediately filed an appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which could take up to eight months to issue a ruling-and Lung'aho would remain in jail the whole time. 56 If the ruling is upheld, he is considering going to trial, despite the risk of prison time and the extraordinarily low success rates of federal defendants. 57 \"Ten years is scary, but the 30-to-life is what they threatened at the beginning, and now it's all gone,\" Kaiser said the morning of the ruling. Lung'aho is more willing to face a jury \"now that the potential sentence for accepting a plea deal is only slightly better than what we'd face at trial.\" 58 Meanwhile, Jeffrey's incarceration has been a devastating coda to a summer that initially held so much hope for change. Since then, the GOP-controlled Arkansas legislature has passed a raft of regressive bills loosening checks on police and private militias and restricting public education under the guise of stopping \"critical race theory.\" 59 The surveillance and prosecutions \"crumbled the activist movement in Arkansas, because nobody can trust anybody,\" said Brooklen Mason, a Little Rock activist who knows Jeffrey and several other defendants. \"And part of the work is being able to trust people.\" 60 The ACLU's Dickson agrees, noting that Jeffrey's long incarceration has had a \"chilling effect\" on local activism. \"That's not a defect,\" she said. \"That's part of the design.\" 61\n\nArkansas State Police began using a \"fusion center,\" a post-9/11 innovation that was meant to facilitate information sharing between local and federal police for anti-terrorism purposes, to track even peaceful protesters-endangering First Amendment rights to free speech and assembly. Records indicate that the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Arkansas State Police compiled lists of upcoming protest events, including some explicitly described as peaceful, echoing the War on Terror-era surveillance of Muslim gatherings. 22 \"There was a concerted effort by law enforcement to do cross-agency cooperation and communication in response to these protests,\" said the ACLU's Dickson regarding the sharing of tips between the city police and state fusion center. \"It was very clear it was happening, from [the use of] infiltrators to [carrying out] open and obvious surveillance.\" 23 Apart from tracking Jeffrey, local police were following false leads, including an unsubstantiated rumor that busloads of antifa activists were booking hotels in the city. Federal and state police tracked protests across Arkansas, while US Attorney General Bill Barr activated all 56 of the nation's FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces, which rely on deputized local law enforcement, to stop \"violent radical elements.\" 24 In July, Barr traveled to Little Rock to meet with local law enforcement officials. In public remarks, he said the FBI's terrorism task forces were working with local police to share intelligence \"and go after the people we think are ringleaders\" behind protest violence. 25 The Nation and Type Investigations, in partnership with the Arkansas Nonprofit News Network, sent public records requests to the Arkansas State Police and Little Rock Police Department for all documents related to protest activity, rioting activity, and the destruction of property in Little Rock from June through September 2020. The response included hundreds of pages of e-mail records between local police, state intelligence officers, and federal agents. Taken together, they show authorities zeroing in on Black activists, including Jeffrey, for protest activity-while largely dismissing the threat posed by counterprotesters. 26 In an e-mail dated May 30, 2020, Heath Helton, the assistant police chief in Little Rock, warned of an event \"which to my understanding is being organized by Dawn Jeffrey.... Our partners at ASP [Arkansas State Police] and the State Capital have been made aware of this event, which is supposed to be peaceful.\" A June 1 screenshot of Jeffrey's Facebook page about a die-in-when protesters simulate being dead-also appears to have originated from the Arkansas fusion center. 27 The state police did not respond to questions we sent about Jeffrey. The Little Rock Police Department defended its approach. \"As with any policing agency, the role of LRPD is to protect the citizens ... they serve. Ms. Jeffrey had/has a public page which means it is viewable,\" a spokesperson for the department said. \"Therefore, there can be no violation in looking at a public page.\" 28 Jeffrey is by far the most mentioned activist in the law enforcement e-mails we reviewed. In one instance, surveillance records line up with an arrest. On July 12, she was arrested by local police at a demonstration outside of a custard shop in nearby Conway. A video recorded by a reporter shows police calling Jeffrey by name and then immediately handcuffing her without a clear reason. The Conway Police Department said she was arrested for trespassing. Intelligence officers for the Arkansas State Police were aware that Jeffrey would be at the event because they were monitoring her Facebook page in the fusion center and sent out an e-mail with a link to a livestream of the protest. While it's not clear whether this monitoring led directly to her arrest that day, the e-mail was one of at least eight sent by senior intelligence officials in the fusion center that referred to Jeffrey's organizing or her participation in nonviolent protests. By comparison, out of hundreds of e-mails and other communications, we saw few that referred to counterprotest groups-and even when they were mentioned, law enforcement focused not on the threat of violence they might pose but on possible violence initiated by racial justice protesters. In one e-mail, an FBI agent dismissed a man's threats \"encouraging the destruction of African Americans' property\" as \"just talking online.\" 29 Center of the dragnet: BLM protester Benjamin Mujera Lung'aho faces criminal charges after being surveilled for months. (Thomas Metthe / Arkansas Democrat-Gazette) T he heavy surveillance of the protesters ultimately caught up with Jeffrey-thanks in part to a T-shirt. 30 One of her closest friends, Mujera Benjamin Lung'aho, was also at the July protest at the Capitol. The two first met in high school, where they played soccer together, and reconnected years later as the racial justice uprising in Ferguson, Mo., reverberated across the country. They eventually grew close enough that Jeffrey spoke at Lung'aho's father's funeral. 31 At the Capitol clash, Lung'aho had worn a distinctive shirt. According to a warrant later filed to search his phone, a detective claimed to have recognized Lung'aho's shirt and other specific features from surveillance video taken a few days earlier during a vandalism spree at a local Confederate cemetery, where several people were caught on camera destroying monuments. Officers showed up at Lung'aho's residence and arrested him after a foot chase. \"Under the current climate, I just was compelled to flee,\" Lung'aho recalled in a conversation with us. 32 When the police searched his phone, they found encrypted group chats and social media messages that they claim tied him to high-profile demonstrations in Little Rock throughout 2020. This turned out to be a key moment for law enforcement-and a big payoff after months of tracking Black activists. 33 According to the authorities, messages on Lung'aho's phone indicated that he participated in several attacks on police vehicles. After arresting him, the police reached out to another alleged participant, Emily Terry, who'd messaged with Lung'aho the morning after the most recent outing. According to police documents, Terry positively identified others who were involved. Although a criminal complaint alleged that Terry threw a Molotov cocktail, Terry was never indicted. Terry declined to speak with us when reached by phone. 34 On December 17, Jeffrey was arrested and charged. Federal prosecutors alleged that she was present when Molotov cocktails were made at her house and drove with friends who tried but failed to set an empty squad car on fire. Three other activists, Renea Goddard, Loba Espinosa-Villegas, and Emily Nowlin, were also arrested and agreed to plead guilty to lesser charges. In interviews, they said they were friends with Jeffrey and that her home had become a haven for activists that summer. None recalled her plotting illegal actions, and the police affidavit doesn't identify her by name when describing the more serious incidents that night. 35 Espinosa-Villegas told us that it seemed, based on police questioning, that prosecutors saw Jeffrey and Lung'aho, the only Black defendants charged, as the \"big fish.\" 36 \"Their intention was to try and figure out, was it [Jeffrey or Lung'aho] who was the leader?\" The actual leader, Espinosa-Villegas said, was another person whom prosecutors accused of illegal actions, according to a criminal complaint naming multiple defendants. The documents also show that prosecutors named two others, including Terry, who allegedly committed similar crimes. None were indicted. 37 In repeated interviews, Jeffrey denied she had ever possessed or used a Molotov cocktail. Under immense pressure given the charges against her, and fearful of her chances at trial, she accepted a plea deal in May. In her plea agreement, Jeffrey acknowledged being present during the attack and the mixing of Molotov cocktails and \"agreed with others to commit acts of vandalism on government buildings and damaging police cars by puncturing tires and/or breaking windows.\" 38 \"There's no way you can be an American citizen feeling like you're being attacked or at war with your own government,\" she said in an interview. \"When do the scales balance for justice?\" 39 Jeffrey's supporters present an image of a leader dispensing hard truths about political injustices in America, unfairly persecuted by the powerful entities she criticized. By contrast, those on the other side of the political spectrum see her as a provocateur who got what she deserved. 40 In a Facebook group called \"Make Little Rock Great Again,\" whose moderators have alluded to being local police officers, an administrator of the page posted a cartoon of a police officer shooting a Black woman in the head, mocking a post by Jeffrey. One person commented, \"Be a shame if she came up missing,\" and followed that with: \"Lemme rephrase that correctly...replace she with it.\" When asked about the page, a police department spokesperson said, \"There's no way to conclusively determine if this page is moderated by any member of the Little Rock Police Department.\" 41 Lung'aho, a spoken-word artist, told us that he and Jeffrey had both been targeted for their politics. He's accused of throwing Molotov cocktails on multiple occasions and faces more time in prison than anybody else. \"The entire reason why we were doing the activism that we were involved in is because we were doing something for Black people,\" Lung'aho said, speaking to us from jail. 42 N ot all of the jurisdictions that experienced unrest in the wake of George Floyd's murder-even when that unrest turned destructive-resorted to federal prosecutions. Our past reporting found that such prosecutions were especially likely in jurisdictions whose US attorneys were politically affiliated with the Trump administration. 43 In Little Rock, Trump had an ideological ally in Cody Hiland, then the US attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas. A former local prosecutor-and, before that, deputy chief of staff to former governor Mike Huckabee-Hiland showed an eagerness to pursue the Trump administration's political goals, once resurrecting an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. In Congress, GOP Senator Tom Cotton, who later called for federal troops to be deployed against racial justice protests, lauded Hiland's nomination by Trump. 44 In an op-ed published amid the protests, Hiland wrote, \"It is my prayer that the shrill cries of 'Defund the Police' always be muted by our nation's earnest declaration that we 'thank God for the Police.'\" 45 When police found messages and photos on Lung'aho's phone suggesting he was involved in the attacks, they sent the evidence to agents at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

But Marshal dismissed three of Lung'aho's 13 charges, each of which prescribed a 30-year mandatory minimum sentence, for using a destructive device during a crime of violence. \"Federal arson is not a crime of violence,\" Marshal wrote-at least in Lung'aho's case. 55 The ruling dropped Lung'aho's maximum prison sentence from more than 90 years to somewhere between 10 and 30, according to Kaiser. But federal prosecutors immediately filed an appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which could take up to eight months to issue a ruling-and Lung'aho would remain in jail the whole time. 56 If the ruling is upheld, he is considering going to trial, despite the risk of prison time and the extraordinarily low success rates of federal defendants. 57 \"Ten years is scary, but the 30-to-life is what they threatened at the beginning, and now it's all gone,\" Kaiser said the morning of the ruling. Lung'aho is more willing to face a jury \"now that the potential sentence for accepting a plea deal is only slightly better than what we'd face at trial.\" 58 Meanwhile, Jeffrey's incarceration has been a devastating coda to a summer that initially held so much hope for change. Since then, the GOP-controlled Arkansas legislature has passed a raft of regressive bills loosening checks on police and private militias and restricting public education under the guise of stopping \"critical race theory.\" 59 The surveillance and prosecutions \"crumbled the activist movement in Arkansas, because nobody can trust anybody,\" said Brooklen Mason, a Little Rock activist who knows Jeffrey and several other defendants. \"And part of the work is being able to trust people.\" 60 The ACLU's Dickson agrees, noting that Jeffrey's long incarceration has had a \"chilling effect\" on local activism. \"That's not a defect,\" she said. \"That's part of the design.\" 61\n\nApart from tracking Jeffrey, local police were following false leads, including an unsubstantiated rumor that busloads of antifa activists were booking hotels in the city. Federal and state police tracked protests across Arkansas, while US Attorney General Bill Barr activated all 56 of the nation's FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces, which rely on deputized local law enforcement, to stop \"violent radical elements.\" 24 In July, Barr traveled to Little Rock to meet with local law enforcement officials. In public remarks, he said the FBI's terrorism task forces were working with local police to share intelligence \"and go after the people we think are ringleaders\" behind protest violence. 25 The Nation and Type Investigations, in partnership with the Arkansas Nonprofit News Network, sent public records requests to the Arkansas State Police and Little Rock Police Department for all documents related to protest activity, rioting activity, and the destruction of property in Little Rock from June through September 2020. The response included hundreds of pages of e-mail records between local police, state intelligence officers, and federal agents. Taken together, they show authorities zeroing in on Black activists, including Jeffrey, for protest activity-while largely dismissing the threat posed by counterprotesters. 26 In an e-mail dated May 30, 2020, Heath Helton, the assistant police chief in Little Rock, warned of an event \"which to my understanding is being organized by Dawn Jeffrey.... Our partners at ASP [Arkansas State Police] and the State Capital have been made aware of this event, which is supposed to be peaceful.\" A June 1 screenshot of Jeffrey's Facebook page about a die-in-when protesters simulate being dead-also appears to have originated from the Arkansas fusion center. 27 The state police did not respond to questions we sent about Jeffrey. The Little Rock Police Department defended its approach. \"As with any policing agency, the role of LRPD is to protect the citizens ... they serve. Ms. Jeffrey had/has a public page which means it is viewable,\" a spokesperson for the department said. \"Therefore, there can be no violation in looking at a public page.\" 28 Jeffrey is by far the most mentioned activist in the law enforcement e-mails we reviewed. In one instance, surveillance records line up with an arrest. On July 12, she was arrested by local police at a demonstration outside of a custard shop in nearby Conway. A video recorded by a reporter shows police calling Jeffrey by name and then immediately handcuffing her without a clear reason. The Conway Police Department said she was arrested for trespassing. Intelligence officers for the Arkansas State Police were aware that Jeffrey would be at the event because they were monitoring her Facebook page in the fusion center and sent out an e-mail with a link to a livestream of the protest. While it's not clear whether this monitoring led directly to her arrest that day, the e-mail was one of at least eight sent by senior intelligence officials in the fusion center that referred to Jeffrey's organizing or her participation in nonviolent protests. By comparison, out of hundreds of e-mails and other communications, we saw few that referred to counterprotest groups-and even when they were mentioned, law enforcement focused not on the threat of violence they might pose but on possible violence initiated by racial justice protesters. In one e-mail, an FBI agent dismissed a man's threats \"encouraging the destruction of African Americans' property\" as \"just talking online.\" 29 Center of the dragnet: BLM protester Benjamin Mujera Lung'aho faces criminal charges after being surveilled for months. (Thomas Metthe / Arkansas Democrat-Gazette) T he heavy surveillance of the protesters ultimately caught up with Jeffrey-thanks in part to a T-shirt. 30 One of her closest friends, Mujera Benjamin Lung'aho, was also at the July protest at the Capitol. The two first met in high school, where they played soccer together, and reconnected years later as the racial justice uprising in Ferguson, Mo., reverberated across the country. They eventually grew close enough that Jeffrey spoke at Lung'aho's father's funeral. 31 At the Capitol clash, Lung'aho had worn a distinctive shirt. According to a warrant later filed to search his phone, a detective claimed to have recognized Lung'aho's shirt and other specific features from surveillance video taken a few days earlier during a vandalism spree at a local Confederate cemetery, where several people were caught on camera destroying monuments. Officers showed up at Lung'aho's residence and arrested him after a foot chase. \"Under the current climate, I just was compelled to flee,\" Lung'aho recalled in a conversation with us. 32 When the police searched his phone, they found encrypted group chats and social media messages that they claim tied him to high-profile demonstrations in Little Rock throughout 2020. This turned out to be a key moment for law enforcement-and a big payoff after months of tracking Black activists. 33 According to the authorities, messages on Lung'aho's phone indicated that he participated in several attacks on police vehicles. After arresting him, the police reached out to another alleged participant, Emily Terry, who'd messaged with Lung'aho the morning after the most recent outing. According to police documents, Terry positively identified others who were involved. Although a criminal complaint alleged that Terry threw a Molotov cocktail, Terry was never indicted. Terry declined to speak with us when reached by phone. 34 On December 17, Jeffrey was arrested and charged. Federal prosecutors alleged that she was present when Molotov cocktails were made at her house and drove with friends who tried but failed to set an empty squad car on fire. Three other activists, Renea Goddard, Loba Espinosa-Villegas, and Emily Nowlin, were also arrested and agreed to plead guilty to lesser charges. In interviews, they said they were friends with Jeffrey and that her home had become a haven for activists that summer. None recalled her plotting illegal actions, and the police affidavit doesn't identify her by name when describing the more serious incidents that night. 35 Espinosa-Villegas told us that it seemed, based on police questioning, that prosecutors saw Jeffrey and Lung'aho, the only Black defendants charged, as the \"big fish.\" 36 \"Their intention was to try and figure out, was it [Jeffrey or Lung'aho] who was the leader?\" The actual leader, Espinosa-Villegas said, was another person whom prosecutors accused of illegal actions, according to a criminal complaint naming multiple defendants. The documents also show that prosecutors named two others, including Terry, who allegedly committed similar crimes. None were indicted. 37 In repeated interviews, Jeffrey denied she had ever possessed or used a Molotov cocktail. Under immense pressure given the charges against her, and fearful of her chances at trial, she accepted a plea deal in May. In her plea agreement, Jeffrey acknowledged being present during the attack and the mixing of Molotov cocktails and \"agreed with others to commit acts of vandalism on government buildings and damaging police cars by puncturing tires and/or breaking windows.\" 38 \"There's no way you can be an American citizen feeling like you're being attacked or at war with your own government,\" she said in an interview. \"When do the scales balance for justice?\" 39 Jeffrey's supporters present an image of a leader dispensing hard truths about political injustices in America, unfairly persecuted by the powerful entities she criticized. By contrast, those on the other side of the political spectrum see her as a provocateur who got what she deserved. 40 In a Facebook group called \"Make Little Rock Great Again,\" whose moderators have alluded to being local police officers, an administrator of the page posted a cartoon of a police officer shooting a Black woman in the head, mocking a post by Jeffrey. One person commented, \"Be a shame if she came up missing,\" and followed that with: \"Lemme rephrase that correctly...replace she with it.\" When asked about the page, a police department spokesperson said, \"There's no way to conclusively determine if this page is moderated by any member of the Little Rock Police Department.\" 41 Lung'aho, a spoken-word artist, told us that he and Jeffrey had both been targeted for their politics. He's accused of throwing Molotov cocktails on multiple occasions and faces more time in prison than anybody else. \"The entire reason why we were doing the activism that we were involved in is because we were doing something for Black people,\" Lung'aho said, speaking to us from jail. 42 N ot all of the jurisdictions that experienced unrest in the wake of George Floyd's murder-even when that unrest turned destructive-resorted to federal prosecutions. Our past reporting found that such prosecutions were especially likely in jurisdictions whose US attorneys were politically affiliated with the Trump administration. 43 In Little Rock, Trump had an ideological ally in Cody Hiland, then the US attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas. A former local prosecutor-and, before that, deputy chief of staff to former governor Mike Huckabee-Hiland showed an eagerness to pursue the Trump administration's political goals, once resurrecting an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. In Congress, GOP Senator Tom Cotton, who later called for federal troops to be deployed against racial justice protests, lauded Hiland's nomination by Trump. 44 In an op-ed published amid the protests, Hiland wrote, \"It is my prayer that the shrill cries of 'Defund the Police' always be muted by our nation's earnest declaration that we 'thank God for the Police.'\" 45 When police found messages and photos on Lung'aho's phone suggesting he was involved in the attacks, they sent the evidence to agents at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Hiland soon got personally involved in the case, inviting Lung'aho's attorney, Michael Kaiser, to meet with him at the police station where Lung'aho was being detained. 46 The US attorney hoped that he could persuade Lung'aho to provide information about other protesters, according to Kaiser. Hiland told Kaiser he had the authority to add several charges involving the use of a destructive device in a crime of violence that would carry sentences of 30 years to life. \"I hadn't ever seen that before,\" Kaiser said, adding that it was unusual for a US attorney to get so involved in a case that didn't involve charges like murder or drug trafficking. 47 Prosecutors' actions in the case align with findings from the Movement for Black Lives report. The authorities filed multiple and redundant charges against protesters, a technique critics say is meant to pressure defendants into accepting plea deals. The same technique was used by federal prosecutors against at least 84 racial justice protesters in 2020. One protester in Philadelphia was hit with four federal arson charges for burning two police cars, because the cars had benefited from federal funding and, the government claimed in a filing, had a role in interstate commerce. 48 Hiland resigned from his federal post in the final weeks of Trump's presidency and is now working on Sarah Huckabee Sanders's gubernatorial campaign; Sanders recently nominated him to be the next chair of the Arkansas Republican Party. Hiland didn't respond to our calls and texts regarding this story. 49 Meanwhile, local pro-Trump Facebook pages tracked Jeffrey's and Lung'aho's cases. During an early pretrial hearing for Lung'aho, over a dozen men wearing paramilitary clothing and carrying rifles loitered on street corners near the courthouse. 50 F or most of the past year, Jeffrey and Lung'aho were held in separate wings of the Greene County Detention Center in rural Arkansas. Judges revoked bond for both of them less than a year after they were arrested. The courts faulted them for failing tests for cannabis use, missing check-ins, and, in Lunga'ho's case, an arrest for public intoxication. Recently, after pleading guilty to a single count of conspiracy to possess a destructive device, Jeffrey was transferred back to a detention center in Little Rock. 51 As both cases have plodded along for nearly two years, Jeffrey's supporters have continued their efforts to raise awareness and funds. She eventually hired Phillip Hamilton, a New York City-based corporate lawyer, as her counsel. In a motion to appeal her ongoing detention, Hamilton described Jeffrey's distress: Her long separation from her 12-year-old daughter and her family had reached \"the point where it was making her mentally and emotionally sick,\" Hamilton wrote, adding that he had been unable to communicate regularly with Jeffrey because of staffing shortages at the Pulaski County Regional Detention Facility. 52 When Jeffrey spoke to us in January, she described the pain of the family separation, noting that she was her daughter's primary caregiver. In the messages she sends to her daughter, \"I'm always reflecting that I love her, and that she's my forever,\" Jeffrey said. \"It's really hard not being in her life, making her lunch and dinner, tucking her into bed.\" 53 Lung'aho is still fighting his case and hoping that his battle can help others in his position. In November 2021, Kaiser filed a motion urging the judge to consider whether prosecutors had stretched \"the reach of federal criminal law beyond its constitutional bounds.\" He argues that the Justice Department lacks jurisdiction in the case, pointing out that federal funding for the affected police agencies is minuscule. \"From minute one, we've said this is a state case charged federally because of politics,\" Kaiser said in an interview. 54 Almost a year later, US District Judge D.P.

Officers showed up at Lung'aho's residence and arrested him after a foot chase. \"Under the current climate, I just was compelled to flee,\" Lung'aho recalled in a conversation with us. 32 When the police searched his phone, they found encrypted group chats and social media messages that they claim tied him to high-profile demonstrations in Little Rock throughout 2020. This turned out to be a key moment for law enforcement-and a big payoff after months of tracking Black activists. 33 According to the authorities, messages on Lung'aho's phone indicated that he participated in several attacks on police vehicles. After arresting him, the police reached out to another alleged participant, Emily Terry, who'd messaged with Lung'aho the morning after the most recent outing. According to police documents, Terry positively identified others who were involved. Although a criminal complaint alleged that Terry threw a Molotov cocktail, Terry was never indicted. Terry declined to speak with us when reached by phone. 34 On December 17, Jeffrey was arrested and charged. Federal prosecutors alleged that she was present when Molotov cocktails were made at her house and drove with friends who tried but failed to set an empty squad car on fire. Three other activists, Renea Goddard, Loba Espinosa-Villegas, and Emily Nowlin, were also arrested and agreed to plead guilty to lesser charges. In interviews, they said they were friends with Jeffrey and that her home had become a haven for activists that summer. None recalled her plotting illegal actions, and the police affidavit doesn't identify her by name when describing the more serious incidents that night. 35 Espinosa-Villegas told us that it seemed, based on police questioning, that prosecutors saw Jeffrey and Lung'aho, the only Black defendants charged, as the \"big fish.\" 36 \"Their intention was to try and figure out, was it [Jeffrey or Lung'aho] who was the leader?\" The actual leader, Espinosa-Villegas said, was another person whom prosecutors accused of illegal actions, according to a criminal complaint naming multiple defendants. The documents also show that prosecutors named two others, including Terry, who allegedly committed similar crimes. None were indicted. 37 In repeated interviews, Jeffrey denied she had ever possessed or used a Molotov cocktail. Under immense pressure given the charges against her, and fearful of her chances at trial, she accepted a plea deal in May. In her plea agreement, Jeffrey acknowledged being present during the attack and the mixing of Molotov cocktails and \"agreed with others to commit acts of vandalism on government buildings and damaging police cars by puncturing tires and/or breaking windows.\" 38 \"There's no way you can be an American citizen feeling like you're being attacked or at war with your own government,\" she said in an interview. \"When do the scales balance for justice?\" 39 Jeffrey's supporters present an image of a leader dispensing hard truths about political injustices in America, unfairly persecuted by the powerful entities she criticized. By contrast, those on the other side of the political spectrum see her as a provocateur who got what she deserved. 40 In a Facebook group called \"Make Little Rock Great Again,\" whose moderators have alluded to being local police officers, an administrator of the page posted a cartoon of a police officer shooting a Black woman in the head, mocking a post by Jeffrey. One person commented, \"Be a shame if she came up missing,\" and followed that with: \"Lemme rephrase that correctly...replace she with it.\" When asked about the page, a police department spokesperson said, \"There's no way to conclusively determine if this page is moderated by any member of the Little Rock Police Department.\" 41 Lung'aho, a spoken-word artist, told us that he and Jeffrey had both been targeted for their politics. He's accused of throwing Molotov cocktails on multiple occasions and faces more time in prison than anybody else. \"The entire reason why we were doing the activism that we were involved in is because we were doing something for Black people,\" Lung'aho said, speaking to us from jail. 42 N ot all of the jurisdictions that experienced unrest in the wake of George Floyd's murder-even when that unrest turned destructive-resorted to federal prosecutions. Our past reporting found that such prosecutions were especially likely in jurisdictions whose US attorneys were politically affiliated with the Trump administration. 43 In Little Rock, Trump had an ideological ally in Cody Hiland, then the US attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas. A former local prosecutor-and, before that, deputy chief of staff to former governor Mike Huckabee-Hiland showed an eagerness to pursue the Trump administration's political goals, once resurrecting an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. In Congress, GOP Senator Tom Cotton, who later called for federal troops to be deployed against racial justice protests, lauded Hiland's nomination by Trump. 44 In an op-ed published amid the protests, Hiland wrote, \"It is my prayer that the shrill cries of 'Defund the Police' always be muted by our nation's earnest declaration that we 'thank God for the Police.'\" 45 When police found messages and photos on Lung'aho's phone suggesting he was involved in the attacks, they sent the evidence to agents at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Hiland soon got personally involved in the case, inviting Lung'aho's attorney, Michael Kaiser, to meet with him at the police station where Lung'aho was being detained. 46 The US attorney hoped that he could persuade Lung'aho to provide information about other protesters, according to Kaiser. Hiland told Kaiser he had the authority to add several charges involving the use of a destructive device in a crime of violence that would carry sentences of 30 years to life. \"I hadn't ever seen that before,\" Kaiser said, adding that it was unusual for a US attorney to get so involved in a case that didn't involve charges like murder or drug trafficking. 47 Prosecutors' actions in the case align with findings from the Movement for Black Lives report. The authorities filed multiple and redundant charges against protesters, a technique critics say is meant to pressure defendants into accepting plea deals. The same technique was used by federal prosecutors against at least 84 racial justice protesters in 2020. One protester in Philadelphia was hit with four federal arson charges for burning two police cars, because the cars had benefited from federal funding and, the government claimed in a filing, had a role in interstate commerce. 48 Hiland resigned from his federal post in the final weeks of Trump's presidency and is now working on Sarah Huckabee Sanders's gubernatorial campaign; Sanders recently nominated him to be the next chair of the Arkansas Republican Party. Hiland didn't respond to our calls and texts regarding this story. 49 Meanwhile, local pro-Trump Facebook pages tracked Jeffrey's and Lung'aho's cases. During an early pretrial hearing for Lung'aho, over a dozen men wearing paramilitary clothing and carrying rifles loitered on street corners near the courthouse. 50 F or most of the past year, Jeffrey and Lung'aho were held in separate wings of the Greene County Detention Center in rural Arkansas. Judges revoked bond for both of them less than a year after they were arrested. The courts faulted them for failing tests for cannabis use, missing check-ins, and, in Lunga'ho's case, an arrest for public intoxication. Recently, after pleading guilty to a single count of conspiracy to possess a destructive device, Jeffrey was transferred back to a detention center in Little Rock. 51 As both cases have plodded along for nearly two years, Jeffrey's supporters have continued their efforts to raise awareness and funds. She eventually hired Phillip Hamilton, a New York City-based corporate lawyer, as her counsel. In a motion to appeal her ongoing detention, Hamilton described Jeffrey's distress: Her long separation from her 12-year-old daughter and her family had reached \"the point where it was making her mentally and emotionally sick,\" Hamilton wrote, adding that he had been unable to communicate regularly with Jeffrey because of staffing shortages at the Pulaski County Regional Detention Facility. 52 When Jeffrey spoke to us in January, she described the pain of the family separation, noting that she was her daughter's primary caregiver. In the messages she sends to her daughter, \"I'm always reflecting that I love her, and that she's my forever,\" Jeffrey said. \"It's really hard not being in her life, making her lunch and dinner, tucking her into bed.\" 53 Lung'aho is still fighting his case and hoping that his battle can help others in his position. In November 2021, Kaiser filed a motion urging the judge to consider whether prosecutors had stretched \"the reach of federal criminal law beyond its constitutional bounds.\" He argues that the Justice Department lacks jurisdiction in the case, pointing out that federal funding for the affected police agencies is minuscule. \"From minute one, we've said this is a state case charged federally because of politics,\" Kaiser said in an interview. 54 Almost a year later, US District Judge D.P. Marshal ruled that although the destroyed police cars were not federal property nor purchased with federal financial assistance, Lung'aho could still be federally charged with arson. But Marshal dismissed three of Lung'aho's 13 charges, each of which prescribed a 30-year mandatory minimum sentence, for using a destructive device during a crime of violence. \"Federal arson is not a crime of violence,\" Marshal wrote-at least in Lung'aho's case. 55 The ruling dropped Lung'aho's maximum prison sentence from more than 90 years to somewhere between 10 and 30, according to Kaiser. But federal prosecutors immediately filed an appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which could take up to eight months to issue a ruling-and Lung'aho would remain in jail the whole time. 56 If the ruling is upheld, he is considering going to trial, despite the risk of prison time and the extraordinarily low success rates of federal defendants. 57 \"Ten years is scary, but the 30-to-life is what they threatened at the beginning, and now it's all gone,\" Kaiser said the morning of the ruling. Lung'aho is more willing to face a jury \"now that the potential sentence for accepting a plea deal is only slightly better than what we'd face at trial.\" 58 Meanwhile, Jeffrey's incarceration has been a devastating coda to a summer that initially held so much hope for change. Since then, the GOP-controlled Arkansas legislature has passed a raft of regressive bills loosening checks on police and private militias and restricting public education under the guise of stopping \"critical race theory.\" 59 The surveillance and prosecutions \"crumbled the activist movement in Arkansas, because nobody can trust anybody,\" said Brooklen Mason, a Little Rock activist who knows Jeffrey and several other defendants. \"And part of the work is being able to trust people.\" 60 The ACLU's Dickson agrees, noting that Jeffrey's long incarceration has had a \"chilling effect\" on local activism. \"That's not a defect,\" she said. \"That's part of the design.\" 61\n\nIn an e-mail dated May 30, 2020, Heath Helton, the assistant police chief in Little Rock, warned of an event \"which to my understanding is being organized by Dawn Jeffrey.... Our partners at ASP [Arkansas State Police] and the State Capital have been made aware of this event, which is supposed to be peaceful.\" A June 1 screenshot of Jeffrey's Facebook page about a die-in-when protesters simulate being dead-also appears to have originated from the Arkansas fusion center. 27 The state police did not respond to questions we sent about Jeffrey. The Little Rock Police Department defended its approach. \"As with any policing agency, the role of LRPD is to protect the citizens ... they serve. Ms. Jeffrey had/has a public page which means it is viewable,\" a spokesperson for the department said. \"Therefore, there can be no violation in looking at a public page.\" 28 Jeffrey is by far the most mentioned activist in the law enforcement e-mails we reviewed. In one instance, surveillance records line up with an arrest. On July 12, she was arrested by local police at a demonstration outside of a custard shop in nearby Conway. A video recorded by a reporter shows police calling Jeffrey by name and then immediately handcuffing her without a clear reason. The Conway Police Department said she was arrested for trespassing. Intelligence officers for the Arkansas State Police were aware that Jeffrey would be at the event because they were monitoring her Facebook page in the fusion center and sent out an e-mail with a link to a livestream of the protest. While it's not clear whether this monitoring led directly to her arrest that day, the e-mail was one of at least eight sent by senior intelligence officials in the fusion center that referred to Jeffrey's organizing or her participation in nonviolent protests. By comparison, out of hundreds of e-mails and other communications, we saw few that referred to counterprotest groups-and even when they were mentioned, law enforcement focused not on the threat of violence they might pose but on possible violence initiated by racial justice protesters. In one e-mail, an FBI agent dismissed a man's threats \"encouraging the destruction of African Americans' property\" as \"just talking online.\" 29 Center of the dragnet: BLM protester Benjamin Mujera Lung'aho faces criminal charges after being surveilled for months. (Thomas Metthe / Arkansas Democrat-Gazette) T he heavy surveillance of the protesters ultimately caught up with Jeffrey-thanks in part to a T-shirt. 30 One of her closest friends, Mujera Benjamin Lung'aho, was also at the July protest at the Capitol. The two first met in high school, where they played soccer together, and reconnected years later as the racial justice uprising in Ferguson, Mo., reverberated across the country.

In the messages she sends to her daughter, \"I'm always reflecting that I love her, and that she's my forever,\" Jeffrey said. \"It's really hard not being in her life, making her lunch and dinner, tucking her into bed.\" 53 Lung'aho is still fighting his case and hoping that his battle can help others in his position. In November 2021, Kaiser filed a motion urging the judge to consider whether prosecutors had stretched \"the reach of federal criminal law beyond its constitutional bounds.\" He argues that the Justice Department lacks jurisdiction in the case, pointing out that federal funding for the affected police agencies is minuscule. \"From minute one, we've said this is a state case charged federally because of politics,\" Kaiser said in an interview. 54 Almost a year later, US District Judge D.P. Marshal ruled that although the destroyed police cars were not federal property nor purchased with federal financial assistance, Lung'aho could still be federally charged with arson. But Marshal dismissed three of Lung'aho's 13 charges, each of which prescribed a 30-year mandatory minimum sentence, for using a destructive device during a crime of violence. \"Federal arson is not a crime of violence,\" Marshal wrote-at least in Lung'aho's case. 55 The ruling dropped Lung'aho's maximum prison sentence from more than 90 years to somewhere between 10 and 30, according to Kaiser. But federal prosecutors immediately filed an appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which could take up to eight months to issue a ruling-and Lung'aho would remain in jail the whole time. 56 If the ruling is upheld, he is considering going to trial, despite the risk of prison time and the extraordinarily low success rates of federal defendants. 57 \"Ten years is scary, but the 30-to-life is what they threatened at the beginning, and now it's all gone,\" Kaiser said the morning of the ruling. Lung'aho is more willing to face a jury \"now that the potential sentence for accepting a plea deal is only slightly better than what we'd face at trial.\" 58 Meanwhile, Jeffrey's incarceration has been a devastating coda to a summer that initially held so much hope for change. Since then, the GOP-controlled Arkansas legislature has passed a raft of regressive bills loosening checks on police and private militias and restricting public education under the guise of stopping \"critical race theory.\" 59 The surveillance and prosecutions \"crumbled the activist movement in Arkansas, because nobody can trust anybody,\" said Brooklen Mason, a Little Rock activist who knows Jeffrey and several other defendants. \"And part of the work is being able to trust people.\" 60 The ACLU's Dickson agrees, noting that Jeffrey's long incarceration has had a \"chilling effect\" on local activism. \"That's not a defect,\" she said. \"That's part of the design.\" 61\n\nJeffrey is by far the most mentioned activist in the law enforcement e-mails we reviewed. In one instance, surveillance records line up with an arrest. On July 12, she was arrested by local police at a demonstration outside of a custard shop in nearby Conway. A video recorded by a reporter shows police calling Jeffrey by name and then immediately handcuffing her without a clear reason. The Conway Police Department said she was arrested for trespassing. Intelligence officers for the Arkansas State Police were aware that Jeffrey would be at the event because they were monitoring her Facebook page in the fusion center and sent out an e-mail with a link to a livestream of the protest. While it's not clear whether this monitoring led directly to her arrest that day, the e-mail was one of at least eight sent by senior intelligence officials in the fusion center that referred to Jeffrey's organizing or her participation in nonviolent protests. By comparison, out of hundreds of e-mails and other communications, we saw few that referred to counterprotest groups-and even when they were mentioned, law enforcement focused not on the threat of violence they might pose but on possible violence initiated by racial justice protesters. In one e-mail, an FBI agent dismissed a man's threats \"encouraging the destruction of African Americans' property\" as \"just talking online.\" 29 Center of the dragnet: BLM protester Benjamin Mujera Lung'aho faces criminal charges after being surveilled for months. (Thomas Metthe / Arkansas Democrat-Gazette) T he heavy surveillance of the protesters ultimately caught up with Jeffrey-thanks in part to a T-shirt. 30 One of her closest friends, Mujera Benjamin Lung'aho, was also at the July protest at the Capitol. The two first met in high school, where they played soccer together, and reconnected years later as the racial justice uprising in Ferguson, Mo., reverberated across the country. They eventually grew close enough that Jeffrey spoke at Lung'aho's father's funeral. 31 At the Capitol clash, Lung'aho had worn a distinctive shirt. According to a warrant later filed to search his phone, a detective claimed to have recognized Lung'aho's shirt and other specific features from surveillance video taken a few days earlier during a vandalism spree at a local Confederate cemetery, where several people were caught on camera destroying monuments. Officers showed up at Lung'aho's residence and arrested him after a foot chase. \"Under the current climate, I just was compelled to flee,\" Lung'aho recalled in a conversation with us. 32 When the police searched his phone, they found encrypted group chats and social media messages that they claim tied him to high-profile demonstrations in Little Rock throughout 2020. This turned out to be a key moment for law enforcement-and a big payoff after months of tracking Black activists. 33 According to the authorities, messages on Lung'aho's phone indicated that he participated in several attacks on police vehicles. After arresting him, the police reached out to another alleged participant, Emily Terry, who'd messaged with Lung'aho the morning after the most recent outing. According to police documents, Terry positively identified others who were involved. Although a criminal complaint alleged that Terry threw a Molotov cocktail, Terry was never indicted. Terry declined to speak with us when reached by phone. 34 On December 17, Jeffrey was arrested and charged. Federal prosecutors alleged that she was present when Molotov cocktails were made at her house and drove with friends who tried but failed to set an empty squad car on fire. Three other activists, Renea Goddard, Loba Espinosa-Villegas, and Emily Nowlin, were also arrested and agreed to plead guilty to lesser charges. In interviews, they said they were friends with Jeffrey and that her home had become a haven for activists that summer. None recalled her plotting illegal actions, and the police affidavit doesn't identify her by name when describing the more serious incidents that night. 35 Espinosa-Villegas told us that it seemed, based on police questioning, that prosecutors saw Jeffrey and Lung'aho, the only Black defendants charged, as the \"big fish.\" 36 \"Their intention was to try and figure out, was it [Jeffrey or Lung'aho] who was the leader?\" The actual leader, Espinosa-Villegas said, was another person whom prosecutors accused of illegal actions, according to a criminal complaint naming multiple defendants. The documents also show that prosecutors named two others, including Terry, who allegedly committed similar crimes. None were indicted. 37 In repeated interviews, Jeffrey denied she had ever possessed or used a Molotov cocktail. Under immense pressure given the charges against her, and fearful of her chances at trial, she accepted a plea deal in May. In her plea agreement, Jeffrey acknowledged being present during the attack and the mixing of Molotov cocktails and \"agreed with others to commit acts of vandalism on government buildings and damaging police cars by puncturing tires and/or breaking windows.\" 38 \"There's no way you can be an American citizen feeling like you're being attacked or at war with your own government,\" she said in an interview. \"When do the scales balance for justice?\" 39 Jeffrey's supporters present an image of a leader dispensing hard truths about political injustices in America, unfairly persecuted by the powerful entities she criticized. By contrast, those on the other side of the political spectrum see her as a provocateur who got what she deserved. 40 In a Facebook group called \"Make Little Rock Great Again,\" whose moderators have alluded to being local police officers, an administrator of the page posted a cartoon of a police officer shooting a Black woman in the head, mocking a post by Jeffrey. One person commented, \"Be a shame if she came up missing,\" and followed that with: \"Lemme rephrase that correctly...replace she with it.\" When asked about the page, a police department spokesperson said, \"There's no way to conclusively determine if this page is moderated by any member of the Little Rock Police Department.\" 41 Lung'aho, a spoken-word artist, told us that he and Jeffrey had both been targeted for their politics. He's accused of throwing Molotov cocktails on multiple occasions and faces more time in prison than anybody else. \"The entire reason why we were doing the activism that we were involved in is because we were doing something for Black people,\" Lung'aho said, speaking to us from jail. 42 N ot all of the jurisdictions that experienced unrest in the wake of George Floyd's murder-even when that unrest turned destructive-resorted to federal prosecutions. Our past reporting found that such prosecutions were especially likely in jurisdictions whose US attorneys were politically affiliated with the Trump administration. 43 In Little Rock, Trump had an ideological ally in Cody Hiland, then the US attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas. A former local prosecutor-and, before that, deputy chief of staff to former governor Mike Huckabee-Hiland showed an eagerness to pursue the Trump administration's political goals, once resurrecting an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. In Congress, GOP Senator Tom Cotton, who later called for federal troops to be deployed against racial justice protests, lauded Hiland's nomination by Trump. 44 In an op-ed published amid the protests, Hiland wrote, \"It is my prayer that the shrill cries of 'Defund the Police' always be muted by our nation's earnest declaration that we 'thank God for the Police.'\" 45 When police found messages and photos on Lung'aho's phone suggesting he was involved in the attacks, they sent the evidence to agents at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Hiland soon got personally involved in the case, inviting Lung'aho's attorney, Michael Kaiser, to meet with him at the police station where Lung'aho was being detained. 46 The US attorney hoped that he could persuade Lung'aho to provide information about other protesters, according to Kaiser. Hiland told Kaiser he had the authority to add several charges involving the use of a destructive device in a crime of violence that would carry sentences of 30 years to life. \"I hadn't ever seen that before,\" Kaiser said, adding that it was unusual for a US attorney to get so involved in a case that didn't involve charges like murder or drug trafficking. 47 Prosecutors' actions in the case align with findings from the Movement for Black Lives report. The authorities filed multiple and redundant charges against protesters, a technique critics say is meant to pressure defendants into accepting plea deals. The same technique was used by federal prosecutors against at least 84 racial justice protesters in 2020. One protester in Philadelphia was hit with four federal arson charges for burning two police cars, because the cars had benefited from federal funding and, the government claimed in a filing, had a role in interstate commerce. 48 Hiland resigned from his federal post in the final weeks of Trump's presidency and is now working on Sarah Huckabee Sanders's gubernatorial campaign; Sanders recently nominated him to be the next chair of the Arkansas Republican Party. Hiland didn't respond to our calls and texts regarding this story. 49 Meanwhile, local pro-Trump Facebook pages tracked Jeffrey's and Lung'aho's cases. During an early pretrial hearing for Lung'aho, over a dozen men wearing paramilitary clothing and carrying rifles loitered on street corners near the courthouse. 50 F or most of the past year, Jeffrey and Lung'aho were held in separate wings of the Greene County Detention Center in rural Arkansas. Judges revoked bond for both of them less than a year after they were arrested. The courts faulted them for failing tests for cannabis use, missing check-ins, and, in Lunga'ho's case, an arrest for public intoxication. Recently, after pleading guilty to a single count of conspiracy to possess a destructive device, Jeffrey was transferred back to a detention center in Little Rock. 51 As both cases have plodded along for nearly two years, Jeffrey's supporters have continued their efforts to raise awareness and funds. She eventually hired Phillip Hamilton, a New York City-based corporate lawyer, as her counsel. In a motion to appeal her ongoing detention, Hamilton described Jeffrey's distress: Her long separation from her 12-year-old daughter and her family had reached \"the point where it was making her mentally and emotionally sick,\" Hamilton wrote, adding that he had been unable to communicate regularly with Jeffrey because of staffing shortages at the Pulaski County Regional Detention Facility. 52 When Jeffrey spoke to us in January, she described the pain of the family separation, noting that she was her daughter's primary caregiver.

The courts faulted them for failing tests for cannabis use, missing check-ins, and, in Lunga'ho's case, an arrest for public intoxication. Recently, after pleading guilty to a single count of conspiracy to possess a destructive device, Jeffrey was transferred back to a detention center in Little Rock. 51 As both cases have plodded along for nearly two years, Jeffrey's supporters have continued their efforts to raise awareness and funds. She eventually hired Phillip Hamilton, a New York City-based corporate lawyer, as her counsel. In a motion to appeal her ongoing detention, Hamilton described Jeffrey's distress: Her long separation from her 12-year-old daughter and her family had reached \"the point where it was making her mentally and emotionally sick,\" Hamilton wrote, adding that he had been unable to communicate regularly with Jeffrey because of staffing shortages at the Pulaski County Regional Detention Facility. 52 When Jeffrey spoke to us in January, she described the pain of the family separation, noting that she was her daughter's primary caregiver. In the messages she sends to her daughter, \"I'm always reflecting that I love her, and that she's my forever,\" Jeffrey said. \"It's really hard not being in her life, making her lunch and dinner, tucking her into bed.\" 53 Lung'aho is still fighting his case and hoping that his battle can help others in his position. In November 2021, Kaiser filed a motion urging the judge to consider whether prosecutors had stretched \"the reach of federal criminal law beyond its constitutional bounds.\" He argues that the Justice Department lacks jurisdiction in the case, pointing out that federal funding for the affected police agencies is minuscule. \"From minute one, we've said this is a state case charged federally because of politics,\" Kaiser said in an interview. 54 Almost a year later, US District Judge D.P. Marshal ruled that although the destroyed police cars were not federal property nor purchased with federal financial assistance, Lung'aho could still be federally charged with arson. But Marshal dismissed three of Lung'aho's 13 charges, each of which prescribed a 30-year mandatory minimum sentence, for using a destructive device during a crime of violence. \"Federal arson is not a crime of violence,\" Marshal wrote-at least in Lung'aho's case. 55 The ruling dropped Lung'aho's maximum prison sentence from more than 90 years to somewhere between 10 and 30, according to Kaiser. But federal prosecutors immediately filed an appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which could take up to eight months to issue a ruling-and Lung'aho would remain in jail the whole time. 56 If the ruling is upheld, he is considering going to trial, despite the risk of prison time and the extraordinarily low success rates of federal defendants. 57 \"Ten years is scary, but the 30-to-life is what they threatened at the beginning, and now it's all gone,\" Kaiser said the morning of the ruling. Lung'aho is more willing to face a jury \"now that the potential sentence for accepting a plea deal is only slightly better than what we'd face at trial.\" 58 Meanwhile, Jeffrey's incarceration has been a devastating coda to a summer that initially held so much hope for change. Since then, the GOP-controlled Arkansas legislature has passed a raft of regressive bills loosening checks on police and private militias and restricting public education under the guise of stopping \"critical race theory.\" 59 The surveillance and prosecutions \"crumbled the activist movement in Arkansas, because nobody can trust anybody,\" said Brooklen Mason, a Little Rock activist who knows Jeffrey and several other defendants. \"And part of the work is being able to trust people.\" 60 The ACLU's Dickson agrees, noting that Jeffrey's long incarceration has had a \"chilling effect\" on local activism. \"That's not a defect,\" she said. \"That's part of the design.\" 61\n\nAt the Capitol clash, Lung'aho had worn a distinctive shirt. According to a warrant later filed to search his phone, a detective claimed to have recognized Lung'aho's shirt and other specific features from surveillance video taken a few days earlier during a vandalism spree at a local Confederate cemetery, where several people were caught on camera destroying monuments. Officers showed up at Lung'aho's residence and arrested him after a foot chase. \"Under the current climate, I just was compelled to flee,\" Lung'aho recalled in a conversation with us. 32 When the police searched his phone, they found encrypted group chats and social media messages that they claim tied him to high-profile demonstrations in Little Rock throughout 2020. This turned out to be a key moment for law enforcement-and a big payoff after months of tracking Black activists. 33 According to the authorities, messages on Lung'aho's phone indicated that he participated in several attacks on police vehicles. After arresting him, the police reached out to another alleged participant, Emily Terry, who'd messaged with Lung'aho the morning after the most recent outing. According to police documents, Terry positively identified others who were involved. Although a criminal complaint alleged that Terry threw a Molotov cocktail, Terry was never indicted. Terry declined to speak with us when reached by phone. 34 On December 17, Jeffrey was arrested and charged. Federal prosecutors alleged that she was present when Molotov cocktails were made at her house and drove with friends who tried but failed to set an empty squad car on fire. Three other activists, Renea Goddard, Loba Espinosa-Villegas, and Emily Nowlin, were also arrested and agreed to plead guilty to lesser charges. In interviews, they said they were friends with Jeffrey and that her home had become a haven for activists that summer. None recalled her plotting illegal actions, and the police affidavit doesn't identify her by name when describing the more serious incidents that night. 35 Espinosa-Villegas told us that it seemed, based on police questioning, that prosecutors saw Jeffrey and Lung'aho, the only Black defendants charged, as the \"big fish.\" 36 \"Their intention was to try and figure out, was it [Jeffrey or Lung'aho] who was the leader?\" The actual leader, Espinosa-Villegas said, was another person whom prosecutors accused of illegal actions, according to a criminal complaint naming multiple defendants. The documents also show that prosecutors named two others, including Terry, who allegedly committed similar crimes. None were indicted. 37 In repeated interviews, Jeffrey denied she had ever possessed or used a Molotov cocktail. Under immense pressure given the charges against her, and fearful of her chances at trial, she accepted a plea deal in May. In her plea agreement, Jeffrey acknowledged being present during the attack and the mixing of Molotov cocktails and \"agreed with others to commit acts of vandalism on government buildings and damaging police cars by puncturing tires and/or breaking windows.\" 38 \"There's no way you can be an American citizen feeling like you're being attacked or at war with your own government,\" she said in an interview. \"When do the scales balance for justice?\" 39 Jeffrey's supporters present an image of a leader dispensing hard truths about political injustices in America, unfairly persecuted by the powerful entities she criticized. By contrast, those on the other side of the political spectrum see her as a provocateur who got what she deserved. 40 In a Facebook group called \"Make Little Rock Great Again,\" whose moderators have alluded to being local police officers, an administrator of the page posted a cartoon of a police officer shooting a Black woman in the head, mocking a post by Jeffrey. One person commented, \"Be a shame if she came up missing,\" and followed that with: \"Lemme rephrase that correctly...replace she with it.\" When asked about the page, a police department spokesperson said, \"There's no way to conclusively determine if this page is moderated by any member of the Little Rock Police Department.\" 41 Lung'aho, a spoken-word artist, told us that he and Jeffrey had both been targeted for their politics. He's accused of throwing Molotov cocktails on multiple occasions and faces more time in prison than anybody else. \"The entire reason why we were doing the activism that we were involved in is because we were doing something for Black people,\" Lung'aho said, speaking to us from jail. 42 N ot all of the jurisdictions that experienced unrest in the wake of George Floyd's murder-even when that unrest turned destructive-resorted to federal prosecutions. Our past reporting found that such prosecutions were especially likely in jurisdictions whose US attorneys were politically affiliated with the Trump administration. 43 In Little Rock, Trump had an ideological ally in Cody Hiland, then the US attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas. A former local prosecutor-and, before that, deputy chief of staff to former governor Mike Huckabee-Hiland showed an eagerness to pursue the Trump administration's political goals, once resurrecting an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. In Congress, GOP Senator Tom Cotton, who later called for federal troops to be deployed against racial justice protests, lauded Hiland's nomination by Trump. 44 In an op-ed published amid the protests, Hiland wrote, \"It is my prayer that the shrill cries of 'Defund the Police' always be muted by our nation's earnest declaration that we 'thank God for the Police.'\" 45 When police found messages and photos on Lung'aho's phone suggesting he was involved in the attacks, they sent the evidence to agents at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Hiland soon got personally involved in the case, inviting Lung'aho's attorney, Michael Kaiser, to meet with him at the police station where Lung'aho was being detained. 46 The US attorney hoped that he could persuade Lung'aho to provide information about other protesters, according to Kaiser. Hiland told Kaiser he had the authority to add several charges involving the use of a destructive device in a crime of violence that would carry sentences of 30 years to life. \"I hadn't ever seen that before,\" Kaiser said, adding that it was unusual for a US attorney to get so involved in a case that didn't involve charges like murder or drug trafficking. 47 Prosecutors' actions in the case align with findings from the Movement for Black Lives report. The authorities filed multiple and redundant charges against protesters, a technique critics say is meant to pressure defendants into accepting plea deals. The same technique was used by federal prosecutors against at least 84 racial justice protesters in 2020. One protester in Philadelphia was hit with four federal arson charges for burning two police cars, because the cars had benefited from federal funding and, the government claimed in a filing, had a role in interstate commerce. 48 Hiland resigned from his federal post in the final weeks of Trump's presidency and is now working on Sarah Huckabee Sanders's gubernatorial campaign; Sanders recently nominated him to be the next chair of the Arkansas Republican Party. Hiland didn't respond to our calls and texts regarding this story. 49 Meanwhile, local pro-Trump Facebook pages tracked Jeffrey's and Lung'aho's cases.

Since then, the GOP-controlled Arkansas legislature has passed a raft of regressive bills loosening checks on police and private militias and restricting public education under the guise of stopping \"critical race theory.\" 59 The surveillance and prosecutions \"crumbled the activist movement in Arkansas, because nobody can trust anybody,\" said Brooklen Mason, a Little Rock activist who knows Jeffrey and several other defendants. \"And part of the work is being able to trust people.\" 60 The ACLU's Dickson agrees, noting that Jeffrey's long incarceration has had a \"chilling effect\" on local activism. \"That's not a defect,\" she said. \"That's part of the design.\" 61\n\nOn December 17, Jeffrey was arrested and charged. Federal prosecutors alleged that she was present when Molotov cocktails were made at her house and drove with friends who tried but failed to set an empty squad car on fire. Three other activists, Renea Goddard, Loba Espinosa-Villegas, and Emily Nowlin, were also arrested and agreed to plead guilty to lesser charges. In interviews, they said they were friends with Jeffrey and that her home had become a haven for activists that summer. None recalled her plotting illegal actions, and the police affidavit doesn't identify her by name when describing the more serious incidents that night. 35 Espinosa-Villegas told us that it seemed, based on police questioning, that prosecutors saw Jeffrey and Lung'aho, the only Black defendants charged, as the \"big fish.\" 36 \"Their intention was to try and figure out, was it [Jeffrey or Lung'aho] who was the leader?\" The actual leader, Espinosa-Villegas said, was another person whom prosecutors accused of illegal actions, according to a criminal complaint naming multiple defendants. The documents also show that prosecutors named two others, including Terry, who allegedly committed similar crimes. None were indicted. 37 In repeated interviews, Jeffrey denied she had ever possessed or used a Molotov cocktail. Under immense pressure given the charges against her, and fearful of her chances at trial, she accepted a plea deal in May. In her plea agreement, Jeffrey acknowledged being present during the attack and the mixing of Molotov cocktails and \"agreed with others to commit acts of vandalism on government buildings and damaging police cars by puncturing tires and/or breaking windows.\" 38 \"There's no way you can be an American citizen feeling like you're being attacked or at war with your own government,\" she said in an interview. \"When do the scales balance for justice?\" 39 Jeffrey's supporters present an image of a leader dispensing hard truths about political injustices in America, unfairly persecuted by the powerful entities she criticized. By contrast, those on the other side of the political spectrum see her as a provocateur who got what she deserved. 40 In a Facebook group called \"Make Little Rock Great Again,\" whose moderators have alluded to being local police officers, an administrator of the page posted a cartoon of a police officer shooting a Black woman in the head, mocking a post by Jeffrey. One person commented, \"Be a shame if she came up missing,\" and followed that with: \"Lemme rephrase that correctly...replace she with it.\" When asked about the page, a police department spokesperson said, \"There's no way to conclusively determine if this page is moderated by any member of the Little Rock Police Department.\" 41 Lung'aho, a spoken-word artist, told us that he and Jeffrey had both been targeted for their politics. He's accused of throwing Molotov cocktails on multiple occasions and faces more time in prison than anybody else. \"The entire reason why we were doing the activism that we were involved in is because we were doing something for Black people,\" Lung'aho said, speaking to us from jail. 42 N ot all of the jurisdictions that experienced unrest in the wake of George Floyd's murder-even when that unrest turned destructive-resorted to federal prosecutions. Our past reporting found that such prosecutions were especially likely in jurisdictions whose US attorneys were politically affiliated with the Trump administration. 43 In Little Rock, Trump had an ideological ally in Cody Hiland, then the US attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas. A former local prosecutor-and, before that, deputy chief of staff to former governor Mike Huckabee-Hiland showed an eagerness to pursue the Trump administration's political goals, once resurrecting an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. In Congress, GOP Senator Tom Cotton, who later called for federal troops to be deployed against racial justice protests, lauded Hiland's nomination by Trump. 44 In an op-ed published amid the protests, Hiland wrote, \"It is my prayer that the shrill cries of 'Defund the Police' always be muted by our nation's earnest declaration that we 'thank God for the Police.'\" 45 When police found messages and photos on Lung'aho's phone suggesting he was involved in the attacks, they sent the evidence to agents at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Hiland soon got personally involved in the case, inviting Lung'aho's attorney, Michael Kaiser, to meet with him at the police station where Lung'aho was being detained. 46 The US attorney hoped that he could persuade Lung'aho to provide information about other protesters, according to Kaiser. Hiland told Kaiser he had the authority to add several charges involving the use of a destructive device in a crime of violence that would carry sentences of 30 years to life. \"I hadn't ever seen that before,\" Kaiser said, adding that it was unusual for a US attorney to get so involved in a case that didn't involve charges like murder or drug trafficking. 47 Prosecutors' actions in the case align with findings from the Movement for Black Lives report. The authorities filed multiple and redundant charges against protesters, a technique critics say is meant to pressure defendants into accepting plea deals. The same technique was used by federal prosecutors against at least 84 racial justice protesters in 2020. One protester in Philadelphia was hit with four federal arson charges for burning two police cars, because the cars had benefited from federal funding and, the government claimed in a filing, had a role in interstate commerce. 48 Hiland resigned from his federal post in the final weeks of Trump's presidency and is now working on Sarah Huckabee Sanders's gubernatorial campaign; Sanders recently nominated him to be the next chair of the Arkansas Republican Party. Hiland didn't respond to our calls and texts regarding this story. 49 Meanwhile, local pro-Trump Facebook pages tracked Jeffrey's and Lung'aho's cases. During an early pretrial hearing for Lung'aho, over a dozen men wearing paramilitary clothing and carrying rifles loitered on street corners near the courthouse. 50 F or most of the past year, Jeffrey and Lung'aho were held in separate wings of the Greene County Detention Center in rural Arkansas. Judges revoked bond for both of them less than a year after they were arrested. The courts faulted them for failing tests for cannabis use, missing check-ins, and, in Lunga'ho's case, an arrest for public intoxication. Recently, after pleading guilty to a single count of conspiracy to possess a destructive device, Jeffrey was transferred back to a detention center in Little Rock. 51 As both cases have plodded along for nearly two years, Jeffrey's supporters have continued their efforts to raise awareness and funds. She eventually hired Phillip Hamilton, a New York City-based corporate lawyer, as her counsel. In a motion to appeal her ongoing detention, Hamilton described Jeffrey's distress: Her long separation from her 12-year-old daughter and her family had reached \"the point where it was making her mentally and emotionally sick,\" Hamilton wrote, adding that he had been unable to communicate regularly with Jeffrey because of staffing shortages at the Pulaski County Regional Detention Facility. 52 When Jeffrey spoke to us in January, she described the pain of the family separation, noting that she was her daughter's primary caregiver. In the messages she sends to her daughter, \"I'm always reflecting that I love her, and that she's my forever,\" Jeffrey said. \"It's really hard not being in her life, making her lunch and dinner, tucking her into bed.\" 53 Lung'aho is still fighting his case and hoping that his battle can help others in his position. In November 2021, Kaiser filed a motion urging the judge to consider whether prosecutors had stretched \"the reach of federal criminal law beyond its constitutional bounds.\" He argues that the Justice Department lacks jurisdiction in the case, pointing out that federal funding for the affected police agencies is minuscule. \"From minute one, we've said this is a state case charged federally because of politics,\" Kaiser said in an interview. 54 Almost a year later, US District Judge D.P. Marshal ruled that although the destroyed police cars were not federal property nor purchased with federal financial assistance, Lung'aho could still be federally charged with arson. But Marshal dismissed three of Lung'aho's 13 charges, each of which prescribed a 30-year mandatory minimum sentence, for using a destructive device during a crime of violence. \"Federal arson is not a crime of violence,\" Marshal wrote-at least in Lung'aho's case. 55 The ruling dropped Lung'aho's maximum prison sentence from more than 90 years to somewhere between 10 and 30, according to Kaiser. But federal prosecutors immediately filed an appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which could take up to eight months to issue a ruling-and Lung'aho would remain in jail the whole time. 56 If the ruling is upheld, he is considering going to trial, despite the risk of prison time and the extraordinarily low success rates of federal defendants. 57 \"Ten years is scary, but the 30-to-life is what they threatened at the beginning, and now it's all gone,\" Kaiser said the morning of the ruling.

In November 2021, Kaiser filed a motion urging the judge to consider whether prosecutors had stretched \"the reach of federal criminal law beyond its constitutional bounds.\" He argues that the Justice Department lacks jurisdiction in the case, pointing out that federal funding for the affected police agencies is minuscule. \"From minute one, we've said this is a state case charged federally because of politics,\" Kaiser said in an interview. 54 Almost a year later, US District Judge D.P. Marshal ruled that although the destroyed police cars were not federal property nor purchased with federal financial assistance, Lung'aho could still be federally charged with arson. But Marshal dismissed three of Lung'aho's 13 charges, each of which prescribed a 30-year mandatory minimum sentence, for using a destructive device during a crime of violence. \"Federal arson is not a crime of violence,\" Marshal wrote-at least in Lung'aho's case. 55 The ruling dropped Lung'aho's maximum prison sentence from more than 90 years to somewhere between 10 and 30, according to Kaiser. But federal prosecutors immediately filed an appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which could take up to eight months to issue a ruling-and Lung'aho would remain in jail the whole time. 56 If the ruling is upheld, he is considering going to trial, despite the risk of prison time and the extraordinarily low success rates of federal defendants. 57 \"Ten years is scary, but the 30-to-life is what they threatened at the beginning, and now it's all gone,\" Kaiser said the morning of the ruling. Lung'aho is more willing to face a jury \"now that the potential sentence for accepting a plea deal is only slightly better than what we'd face at trial.\" 58 Meanwhile, Jeffrey's incarceration has been a devastating coda to a summer that initially held so much hope for change. Since then, the GOP-controlled Arkansas legislature has passed a raft of regressive bills loosening checks on police and private militias and restricting public education under the guise of stopping \"critical race theory.\" 59 The surveillance and prosecutions \"crumbled the activist movement in Arkansas, because nobody can trust anybody,\" said Brooklen Mason, a Little Rock activist who knows Jeffrey and several other defendants. \"And part of the work is being able to trust people.\" 60 The ACLU's Dickson agrees, noting that Jeffrey's long incarceration has had a \"chilling effect\" on local activism. \"That's not a defect,\" she said. \"That's part of the design.\" 61\n\n\"There's no way you can be an American citizen feeling like you're being attacked or at war with your own government,\" she said in an interview. \"When do the scales balance for justice?\" 39 Jeffrey's supporters present an image of a leader dispensing hard truths about political injustices in America, unfairly persecuted by the powerful entities she criticized. By contrast, those on the other side of the political spectrum see her as a provocateur who got what she deserved. 40 In a Facebook group called \"Make Little Rock Great Again,\" whose moderators have alluded to being local police officers, an administrator of the page posted a cartoon of a police officer shooting a Black woman in the head, mocking a post by Jeffrey. One person commented, \"Be a shame if she came up missing,\" and followed that with: \"Lemme rephrase that correctly...replace she with it.\" When asked about the page, a police department spokesperson said, \"There's no way to conclusively determine if this page is moderated by any member of the Little Rock Police Department.\" 41 Lung'aho, a spoken-word artist, told us that he and Jeffrey had both been targeted for their politics. He's accused of throwing Molotov cocktails on multiple occasions and faces more time in prison than anybody else. \"The entire reason why we were doing the activism that we were involved in is because we were doing something for Black people,\" Lung'aho said, speaking to us from jail. 42 N ot all of the jurisdictions that experienced unrest in the wake of George Floyd's murder-even when that unrest turned destructive-resorted to federal prosecutions. Our past reporting found that such prosecutions were especially likely in jurisdictions whose US attorneys were politically affiliated with the Trump administration. 43 In Little Rock, Trump had an ideological ally in Cody Hiland, then the US attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas. A former local prosecutor-and, before that, deputy chief of staff to former governor Mike Huckabee-Hiland showed an eagerness to pursue the Trump administration's political goals, once resurrecting an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. In Congress, GOP Senator Tom Cotton, who later called for federal troops to be deployed against racial justice protests, lauded Hiland's nomination by Trump. 44 In an op-ed published amid the protests, Hiland wrote, \"It is my prayer that the shrill cries of 'Defund the Police' always be muted by our nation's earnest declaration that we 'thank God for the Police.'\" 45 When police found messages and photos on Lung'aho's phone suggesting he was involved in the attacks, they sent the evidence to agents at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Hiland soon got personally involved in the case, inviting Lung'aho's attorney, Michael Kaiser, to meet with him at the police station where Lung'aho was being detained. 46 The US attorney hoped that he could persuade Lung'aho to provide information about other protesters, according to Kaiser. Hiland told Kaiser he had the authority to add several charges involving the use of a destructive device in a crime of violence that would carry sentences of 30 years to life. \"I hadn't ever seen that before,\" Kaiser said, adding that it was unusual for a US attorney to get so involved in a case that didn't involve charges like murder or drug trafficking. 47 Prosecutors' actions in the case align with findings from the Movement for Black Lives report. The authorities filed multiple and redundant charges against protesters, a technique critics say is meant to pressure defendants into accepting plea deals. The same technique was used by federal prosecutors against at least 84 racial justice protesters in 2020. One protester in Philadelphia was hit with four federal arson charges for burning two police cars, because the cars had benefited from federal funding and, the government claimed in a filing, had a role in interstate commerce. 48 Hiland resigned from his federal post in the final weeks of Trump's presidency and is now working on Sarah Huckabee Sanders's gubernatorial campaign; Sanders recently nominated him to be the next chair of the Arkansas Republican Party. Hiland didn't respond to our calls and texts regarding this story. 49 Meanwhile, local pro-Trump Facebook pages tracked Jeffrey's and Lung'aho's cases. During an early pretrial hearing for Lung'aho, over a dozen men wearing paramilitary clothing and carrying rifles loitered on street corners near the courthouse. 50 F or most of the past year, Jeffrey and Lung'aho were held in separate wings of the Greene County Detention Center in rural Arkansas. Judges revoked bond for both of them less than a year after they were arrested. The courts faulted them for failing tests for cannabis use, missing check-ins, and, in Lunga'ho's case, an arrest for public intoxication. Recently, after pleading guilty to a single count of conspiracy to possess a destructive device, Jeffrey was transferred back to a detention center in Little Rock. 51 As both cases have plodded along for nearly two years, Jeffrey's supporters have continued their efforts to raise awareness and funds. She eventually hired Phillip Hamilton, a New York City-based corporate lawyer, as her counsel.

Hiland soon got personally involved in the case, inviting Lung'aho's attorney, Michael Kaiser, to meet with him at the police station where Lung'aho was being detained. 46 The US attorney hoped that he could persuade Lung'aho to provide information about other protesters, according to Kaiser. Hiland told Kaiser he had the authority to add several charges involving the use of a destructive device in a crime of violence that would carry sentences of 30 years to life. \"I hadn't ever seen that before,\" Kaiser said, adding that it was unusual for a US attorney to get so involved in a case that didn't involve charges like murder or drug trafficking. 47 Prosecutors' actions in the case align with findings from the Movement for Black Lives report. The authorities filed multiple and redundant charges against protesters, a technique critics say is meant to pressure defendants into accepting plea deals. The same technique was used by federal prosecutors against at least 84 racial justice protesters in 2020. One protester in Philadelphia was hit with four federal arson charges for burning two police cars, because the cars had benefited from federal funding and, the government claimed in a filing, had a role in interstate commerce. 48 Hiland resigned from his federal post in the final weeks of Trump's presidency and is now working on Sarah Huckabee Sanders's gubernatorial campaign; Sanders recently nominated him to be the next chair of the Arkansas Republican Party. Hiland didn't respond to our calls and texts regarding this story. 49 Meanwhile, local pro-Trump Facebook pages tracked Jeffrey's and Lung'aho's cases. During an early pretrial hearing for Lung'aho, over a dozen men wearing paramilitary clothing and carrying rifles loitered on street corners near the courthouse. 50 F or most of the past year, Jeffrey and Lung'aho were held in separate wings of the Greene County Detention Center in rural Arkansas. Judges revoked bond for both of them less than a year after they were arrested. The courts faulted them for failing tests for cannabis use, missing check-ins, and, in Lunga'ho's case, an arrest for public intoxication. Recently, after pleading guilty to a single count of conspiracy to possess a destructive device, Jeffrey was transferred back to a detention center in Little Rock. 51 As both cases have plodded along for nearly two years, Jeffrey's supporters have continued their efforts to raise awareness and funds. She eventually hired Phillip Hamilton, a New York City-based corporate lawyer, as her counsel. In a motion to appeal her ongoing detention, Hamilton described Jeffrey's distress: Her long separation from her 12-year-old daughter and her family had reached \"the point where it was making her mentally and emotionally sick,\" Hamilton wrote, adding that he had been unable to communicate regularly with Jeffrey because of staffing shortages at the Pulaski County Regional Detention Facility. 52 When Jeffrey spoke to us in January, she described the pain of the family separation, noting that she was her daughter's primary caregiver. In the messages she sends to her daughter, \"I'm always reflecting that I love her, and that she's my forever,\" Jeffrey said. \"It's really hard not being in her life, making her lunch and dinner, tucking her into bed.\" 53 Lung'aho is still fighting his case and hoping that his battle can help others in his position. In November 2021, Kaiser filed a motion urging the judge to consider whether prosecutors had stretched \"the reach of federal criminal law beyond its constitutional bounds.\" He argues that the Justice Department lacks jurisdiction in the case, pointing out that federal funding for the affected police agencies is minuscule. \"From minute one, we've said this is a state case charged federally because of politics,\" Kaiser said in an interview. 54 Almost a year later, US District Judge D.P. Marshal ruled that although the destroyed police cars were not federal property nor purchased with federal financial assistance, Lung'aho could still be federally charged with arson. But Marshal dismissed three of Lung'aho's 13 charges, each of which prescribed a 30-year mandatory minimum sentence, for using a destructive device during a crime of violence. \"Federal arson is not a crime of violence,\" Marshal wrote-at least in Lung'aho's case. 55 The ruling dropped Lung'aho's maximum prison sentence from more than 90 years to somewhere between 10 and 30, according to Kaiser. But federal prosecutors immediately filed an appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which could take up to eight months to issue a ruling-and Lung'aho would remain in jail the whole time. 56 If the ruling is upheld, he is considering going to trial, despite the risk of prison time and the extraordinarily low success rates of federal defendants. 57 \"Ten years is scary, but the 30-to-life is what they threatened at the beginning, and now it's all gone,\" Kaiser said the morning of the ruling. Lung'aho is more willing to face a jury \"now that the potential sentence for accepting a plea deal is only slightly better than what we'd face at trial.\" 58 Meanwhile, Jeffrey's incarceration has been a devastating coda to a summer that initially held so much hope for change. Since then, the GOP-controlled Arkansas legislature has passed a raft of regressive bills loosening checks on police and private militias and restricting public education under the guise of stopping \"critical race theory.\" 59 The surveillance and prosecutions \"crumbled the activist movement in Arkansas, because nobody can trust anybody,\" said Brooklen Mason, a Little Rock activist who knows Jeffrey and several other defendants. \"And part of the work is being able to trust people.\" 60 The ACLU's Dickson agrees, noting that Jeffrey's long incarceration has had a \"chilling effect\" on local activism. \"That's not a defect,\" she said. \"That's part of the design.\" 61\n\nIn Little Rock, Trump had an ideological ally in Cody Hiland, then the US attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas.

Hiland didn't respond to our calls and texts regarding this story. 49 Meanwhile, local pro-Trump Facebook pages tracked Jeffrey's and Lung'aho's cases. During an early pretrial hearing for Lung'aho, over a dozen men wearing paramilitary clothing and carrying rifles loitered on street corners near the courthouse. 50 F or most of the past year, Jeffrey and Lung'aho were held in separate wings of the Greene County Detention Center in rural Arkansas. Judges revoked bond for both of them less than a year after they were arrested. The courts faulted them for failing tests for cannabis use, missing check-ins, and, in Lunga'ho's case, an arrest for public intoxication. Recently, after pleading guilty to a single count of conspiracy to possess a destructive device, Jeffrey was transferred back to a detention center in Little Rock. 51 As both cases have plodded along for nearly two years, Jeffrey's supporters have continued their efforts to raise awareness and funds. She eventually hired Phillip Hamilton, a New York City-based corporate lawyer, as her counsel. In a motion to appeal her ongoing detention, Hamilton described Jeffrey's distress: Her long separation from her 12-year-old daughter and her family had reached \"the point where it was making her mentally and emotionally sick,\" Hamilton wrote, adding that he had been unable to communicate regularly with Jeffrey because of staffing shortages at the Pulaski County Regional Detention Facility. 52 When Jeffrey spoke to us in January, she described the pain of the family separation, noting that she was her daughter's primary caregiver. In the messages she sends to her daughter, \"I'm always reflecting that I love her, and that she's my forever,\" Jeffrey said. \"It's really hard not being in her life, making her lunch and dinner, tucking her into bed.\" 53 Lung'aho is still fighting his case and hoping that his battle can help others in his position. In November 2021, Kaiser filed a motion urging the judge to consider whether prosecutors had stretched \"the reach of federal criminal law beyond its constitutional bounds.\" He argues that the Justice Department lacks jurisdiction in the case, pointing out that federal funding for the affected police agencies is minuscule. \"From minute one, we've said this is a state case charged federally because of politics,\" Kaiser said in an interview. 54 Almost a year later, US District Judge D.P. Marshal ruled that although the destroyed police cars were not federal property nor purchased with federal financial assistance, Lung'aho could still be federally charged with arson. But Marshal dismissed three of Lung'aho's 13 charges, each of which prescribed a 30-year mandatory minimum sentence, for using a destructive device during a crime of violence. \"Federal arson is not a crime of violence,\" Marshal wrote-at least in Lung'aho's case. 55 The ruling dropped Lung'aho's maximum prison sentence from more than 90 years to somewhere between 10 and 30, according to Kaiser. But federal prosecutors immediately filed an appeal to the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which could take up to eight months to issue a ruling-and Lung'aho would remain in jail the whole time. 56 If the ruling is upheld, he is considering going to trial, despite the risk of prison time and the extraordinarily low success rates of federal defendants. 57 \"Ten years is scary, but the 30-to-life is what they threatened at the beginning, and now it's all gone,\" Kaiser said the morning of the ruling.

      "text": "St. Louis Couple Charged With Felony for Wildly Brandishing Weapons at BLM Protesters\n\nThe white St. Louis couple who aimed weapons at Black Lives Matter protesters in front of their home last month were charged with felony counts of unlawful use of a weapon. The charge was announced Monday by Circuit Attorney Kimberly Gardner weeks after a viral video showed Mark and Patricia McCloskey, both in their 60s, come out of their home pointing weapons, including a semi-automatic rifle, at protesters in the street nearby. At the time, several hundred protesters were making their way to the home of the city's Democratic mayor nearby to protest. As they passed, Mark McCloskey emerged wearing khakis and a tucked-in pink polo shirt while swinging around the semi-automatic rifle. Patricia McCloskey looked wild-eyed as she unevenly pointed a pistol in the direction of the protesters. The couple's wild conduct during the standoff with peaceful protesters who were largely Black was ludicrous verging on parody. It was also clearly dangerous and, according to the district prosecutor, against the law.\n\n\"It is illegal to wave weapons in a threatening manner at those participating in nonviolent protest, and while we are fortunate this situation did not escalate into deadly force, this type of conduct is unacceptable in St. Louis,\" Gardner said in a statement . The couple, both of whom are personal injury attorneys, said they were scared for their safety, as one does to lay the groundwork to try to get away with violent conduct, particularly against people of color. The Class E felony charge carries with it a potential four-year prison sentence, though Gardner is pushing for a diversion program that would result in community service.\n\nA daily email update of the stories you need to read right now.\n\nThe charges have prompted the usual apoplectic response from the gun-toting right. Moments after the charges were filed, the state attorney general filed a brief calling for the charges to be dismissed. The basis for the dismissal is Missouri's Castle Doctrine, which allows residents wide legal leeway in \"protecting\" their homes. It is a measure that has been pushed by the National Rifle Association at the state legislature level across the country and has had the effect of legalizing white violence under the auspices of an expansive definition of self-defense to include one's property. On cue, the Republican establishment-from President Donald Trump down to Missouri Gov. Mike Parson and Sen. Josh Hawley-has called for a civil rights investigation into the prosecutor for having the audacity to investigate, and ultimately prosecute, the matter.\n\nA lawyer for the couple said the McCloskeys \"support the First Amendment right of every citizen to have their voice and opinion heard. This right, however, must be balanced with the Second Amendment and Missouri law, which entitle each of us to protect our home and family from potential threats.\" Potential threats, not actual ones. Not that the distinction will actually matter, as the state's Republican governor has suggested he will pardon the couple, short-circuiting the legal system before it has even warmed up.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Soldier who killed BLM protester called 'evil' as he is sentenced to 25 years\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott said he will seek a pardon for Daniel Perry.\n\nAn Army sergeant convicted of murder in the fatal 2020 shooting of an armed Black Lives Matter protester during a demonstration in Austin, Texas, was sentenced to 25 years in prison on Wednesday, even as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott seeks to grant him a pardon.\n\nAttorneys for 35-year-old Daniel Perry asked a judge to consider giving their client a 10-year sentence for the murder of Garrett Foster, a U.S. Air Force veteran, citing Perry's lack of criminal history and presenting evidence that he has post-traumatic stress disorder from a tour of duty in Afghanistan.\n\nBut Travis County, Texas, Criminal Courts Judge Clifford Brown rejected the plea for leniency and sentenced Perry to 25 years in prison.\n\nProsecutors have asked Brown to consider a sentence of at least 25 years.\n\n\"This man is a loaded gun, ready to go off at any perceived threat. He's going to do it again,\" Travis County Assistant District Attorney Guillermo Gonzalez told Brown during Tuesday's hearing.\n\nBrown announced his sentencing after Foster's mother and sister testified Wednesday morning.\n\n\"Do you have any idea how hard it is to sit here facing the evil that killed my son, sitting here thinking how surreal it is that this is happening, finally. After three long years, we're finally getting justice for Garrett,\" Sheila Foster testified.\n\nAnna Mayo, Garrett Foster's sister, testified that her brother was an U.S. Air Force veteran who comes from a family of military combat veterans, including her father.\n\n\"When I look at you, I see a very small man who used his military status as a means to kill,\" Mayo testified, speaking directly to Perry, who sat at the defense table wearing black and gray striped jail clothes and with his head bowed down. \"I do not see any honorable traits and I see no remorse for what you've done. You can't even look at my family.\"\n\nPerry, who was an active-duty U.S. Army sergeant based in Texas at Fort Hood, was working as a driver for a ridesharing company when he drove onto a street crowded with protesters on July 25, 2020, in downtown Austin.\n\nFoster, 28, who was white, was pushing his fiancee Whitney Mitchell's wheelchair during the Austin protest over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis when authorities said protesters surrounded Perry's ridesharing car. Foster, who was legally wielding an AK-47 rifle in accordance with Texas' open carry law, was fatally shot when he approached Perry's vehicle, according to prosecutors.\n\nDuring the trial, defense attorneys argued that Perry fired at Foster in self-defense, alleging the protester pointed the rifle in his direction. But prosecutors argued that Perry could have avoided the fatal confrontation by simply driving away and witnesses testified at the trial that Foster never raised his rifle at Perry.\n\nAfter a jury convicted Perry of murder on April 7, Abbott said he was \"working as swiftly as Texas law allows\" to pardon Perry.\n\nAbbott criticized both the jury's decision to convict Perry and Travis County District Attorney José Garza for pursuing the case.\n\n\"Texas has one of the strongest 'Stand Your Ground' laws of self-defense that cannot be nullified by a jury or a progressive District Attorney,\" Abbott said in a statement.\n\nDuring Tuesday's hearing, prosecutors called Mitchell, who lost both her legs to sepsis, to the witness stand and she gave emotional testimony of how difficult her life his become since losing Foster, her primary caregiver.\n\n\"It's hard to sleep in my bed because he's not there. To have to learn how to do all of that stuff that Garrett was doing for me for a decade, and it's hard because I have to get comfortable being vulnerable,\" Mitchell testified, according to ABC Austin affiliate station KVUE .\n\nDefense attorneys called forensic psychologist Greg Hupp to testify. Hupp said he believes Perry suffers from PTSD and has personality characteristics consistent with an autism spectrum disorder.\n\nFollowing the trial, Judge Brown unsealed court records revealing racist messages and anti-protest sentiments Perry posted on social media prior to the shooting. In one of the social media posts, Perry wrote, \"Black Lives Matter is racist to white people ... It is official I am racist because I do not agree with people acting like monkeys.\"\n\nDuring the two-week trial, the jury did not see or hear Perry's social media posts.\n\nTwo soldiers, Ronald Wilson and Traveon Napper, who served in the Army with Perry were called to the witness stand Tuesday and both testified that Perry, in their opinion, is not a racist. Wilson testified that sharing such social media posts was a way to cope with the daily stress of serving in the military.\n\nPerry's mother, Rachel Perry, also took the witness stand, testifying her son has shown remorse for the fatal shooting.\n\n\"He cried a lot when this happened,\" Rachel Perry testified. \"His intention was just to protect himself, not to go out and shoot anybody.\"\n\nFollowing Perry's conviction, his attorneys requested a new trial, citing juror misconduct. The defense attorneys alleged jurors brought outside information into the jury deliberation room concerning self-defense law during their deliberations.\n\nJudge Brown rejected the motion for a new trial.\n\nPerry's attorneys said in a statement that they will appeal the verdict and \"are now in a position to fully cooperate in the Texas pardon process.\"\n\n\"In short, in the event Sgt. Perry might ultimately receive a pardon, it would simply reflect the strong self-defense laws that exist in Texas and the political efforts of a rogue district attorney to curtail the rights of Texas citizens in an effort to appease the district attorney's own political supporters,\" the defense attorneys said.\n\nABC News' Kiara Alfonseca contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
