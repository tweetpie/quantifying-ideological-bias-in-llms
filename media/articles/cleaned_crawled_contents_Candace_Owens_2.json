All Rights Reserved.\n\nDOVER, Del. (AP) - Delaware's Supreme Court has upheld a judge's dismissal of a lawsuit filed by conservative political commentator Candace Owens against USA Today and another media organization over fact-checking coronavirus posts she made on Facebook.\n\nAfter oral arguments two weeks ago, the court issued a two-paragraph order Tuesday affirming the July decision by Superior Court Judge Craig Karsnitz.\n\nKarsnitz said Owens had failed to state an actionable claim against USA Today or Lead Stories LLC, a Colorado-based entity. Lead Stories, like USA Today, is paid by Facebook to publish fact-check articles examining whether certain posts contain false information, according to the court ruling. Dozens of outside organizations, including The Associated Press, participate in Facebook's fact-checking program.\n\nLead Stories published an article in April 2020 about a Facebook post in which Owens claimed the way government officials counted COVID-19 deaths overstated the pandemic's scope and dangers. The article labeled Owens' post with the terms \"Hoax Alert\" and \"False.\"\n\nUSA Today said in an article that same month that a post in which Owens questioned the relationship between the counting of COVID-19 deaths and flu deaths in early 2020 contained false information.\n\nAs a result of the articles, Facebook put false information warning labels on Owens' posts.\n\nOwens claimed the defendants' articles prevented her from deriving advertising revenue from her Facebook page and promoting her book \"Blackout\" on Facebook. She sued USA Today and Lead Stories for intentional interference with contractual relations, tortious interference with prospective business relations, and unfair competition. She also filed separate defamation claims against Lead Stories.\n\nKarsnitz, a Democrat, ruled that Owens had failed to show that statements made by Lead Stories were false under a \"reasonable conceivability\" standard. He also said readers would not understand the term \"Hoax Alert\" to mean that Owens was intentionally spreading a lie. Karsnitz also ruled that Owens failed to adequately plead that the defendants improperly or wrongfully interfered with the contract between her and Facebook.\n\nTuesday's Supreme Court ruling came just weeks after the justices upheld a decision by Karsnitz to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed by former Donald Trump campaign operative Carter Page against the media company that includes Yahoo! and AOL and formerly owned HuffPost.\n\nPage claimed he was harmed by the publication of false and defamatory statements suggesting he was secretly plotting with Russian officials. He was the target of a secret surveillance campaign by the FBI but was never charged with any wrongdoing.\n\nWhile upholding the dismissal of Page's suit, the Supreme Court ruled Karsnitz had abused his discretion in barring Georgia lawyer and Trump supporter Lin Wood from representing Page, after initially granting him permission to do so.\n\nKarsnitz suggested Wood's participation in lawsuits in Georgia and Wisconsin challenging the 2020 election results demonstrated \"a toxic stew of mendacity, prevarication and surprising incompetence.\" He also cited tweets by Wood attacking former Vice President Mike Pence and Chief Justice John Roberts, and the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThe Supreme Court noted, however, that Wood had not been cited for sanctionable conduct in either Georgia or Wisconsin. The insinuation that Wood was at least partially responsible for the events of Jan. 6 was even \"more questionable,\" it said.\n\n\"One cannot read the court's order without concluding that the court intended to cast aspersions on Wood's character, referring to him as 'either mendacious or incompetent' and determining that he was not 'of sufficient character' to practice in the courts of our state,\" the justices added. \"We offer no opinion on the accuracy of these characterizations, but we see no evidence in the Superior Court's record that supports them.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Owens cited Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports and argued sarcastically in her post that the number of flu deaths had decreased drastically in early 2020.\n\nAs a result of the USA Today article, Facebook put a false information warning label on Owens' second post.\n\nOwens claimed that the defendants' articles harmed her by preventing her from deriving advertising revenue from her Facebook page and promoting her book \"Blackout\" on Facebook. She sued USA Today and Lead Stories for intentional interference with contractual relations, tortious interference with prospective business relations, and unfair competition. She also filed two separate claims against Lead Stories accusing it of defamation.\n\n\"The political aspects of this case are manifest but must be ignored in favor of application of the law,\" Superior Court Judge Craig Karsnitz noted in his ruling.\n\nWhile rejecting arguments that he lacked jurisdiction over Lead Stories, Karsnitz ruled that Owens had failed to show that statements made by Lead Stories regarding her Facebook post were false under a \"reasonable conceivability\" standard.\n\nThe judge also ruled that the term \"Hoax Alert\" in the Lead Stories article was used as \"loose, figurative, or hyperbolic language\" and readers would not understand it to mean that Owens was intentionally spreading a lie.\n\nKarsnitz also said Owens, a public figure, failed to show that Lead Stories had published a false statement and did so with actual malice.\n\nThe judge also ruled that Owens failed to adequately plead that the defendants improperly or wrongfully interfered with the performance of the contract between her and Facebook.\n\n\"A tortious interference claim cannot survive if the claim is premised solely on statements that are protected by the First Amendment because the exercise of constitutionally protected speech cannot be an 'improper' or 'wrongful' action,\" he wrote.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

I've never been a slave in this country.\"\n\nOwens' comments drew sharp criticism on Twitter, where users cited her Stamford lawsuit. The 2007 incident turned scandal when the boy charged in the case was with several other teens - including the then-14-year-old son of former mayor and governor Dannel P.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nFILE - A pair of migrant families from Brazil passes through a gap in the border wall to reach the United States after crossing from Mexico in Yuma, Ariz., to seek asylum on June 10, 2021. A video circulating online is spreading claims about immigrants that experts say are false. (AP Photo/Eugene Garcia, File)\n\nA video from 2018 featuring two prominent conservative activists making claims about immigrant s coming into the U.S. has resurfaced and is circulating widely on social media.\n\nIn the clip, Charlie Kirk , the founder of the conservative group Turning Point USA, and Candace Owens, a conservative commentator, are speaking to a live audience about immigration and calling for a border wall. But experts say many of the claims they make to support their argument are false or misleading.\n\nThe video, shared on Facebook on Sunday , has since been viewed over 2 million times. It was originally recorded at an event at Stanford University in 2018 where both Kirk and Owens spoke.\n\nHere's a closer look at claims made in the video.\n\n-\n\nCLAIM: 50% of the immigrants America \"takes in\" are from Mexico.\n\nTHE FACTS: False. The percentage of Mexican nationals who are granted permanent legal authorization to live in the U.S. is significantly lower than 50%. Mexican nationals also do not make up 50% of the immigrants who attempt to enter the U.S. illegally, experts say.\n\nOf the roughly 1 million immigrants who were granted permanent legal residency status in 2019, only 153,502 were from Mexico, according to recent data published by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n\nSimilarly, people from Mexico made up only 37% of all of the encounters with migrants reported by authorities at the southwest border in fiscal 2021, according to the Pew Research Center . The remaining 63% were people from other countries.\n\n\"When you take all types of immigrants, documented, undocumented, it's not true for sure,\" said Ernesto Castañeda, director of the Immigration Lab at American University.\n\nAdditionally, the proportion of Mexicans who compose the population of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally has declined over time. As of 2017 , 47% of the immigrants living in the U.S. illegally were Mexican, according to the Pew Research Center .\n\n\"The Mexican undocumented population has stopped growing since 2008 and there is no sign that is going to catch up to historical levels again,\" Castañeda said.\n\nOwens responded to the AP's request for comment but did not provide evidence to support this claim.\n\n-\n\nCLAIM: Immigrants living in the U.S. illegally who come from Mexico, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and El Salvador are \"twice as likely\" to commit crime than U.S.-born citizens.\n\nTHE FACTS: False. Research shows that immigrants living in the U.S. without legal permission commit crimes at lower rates in comparison to citizens born in the country. Experts say no evidence supports the notion that immigrants from those specific countries commit more crime.\n\n\"It is false. Very false and troubling,\" said Denise Gilman, director of the Immigration Clinic at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law. \"There is a lot of empirical evidence that goes in the other direction.\"\n\n\"Almost every reputable report that I have seen has found that immigrants commit crimes at a lower rate than native born U.S. citizens,\" said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor at Cornell University who teaches immigration law.\n\nYale-Loehr cited a 2020 study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a peer-reviewed journal. The study used data from the Texas Department of Public Safety and found that immigrants living in the U.S. illegally have \"substantially lower crime rates than native-born citizens and legal immigrants across a range of felony offenses.\"\n\nGilman pointed to a 2014 study published in the Journal of Law and Economics that found a program that allowed the federal government to check the immigration status of people arrested by local police and place them in federal custody for deportation proceedings had \"no observable effect on the overall crime rate.\"\n\nWhen asked to provide evidence for Kirk's claim, Andrew Kolvet, a spokesperson for Turning Point USA, pointed to a 2018 news story about a report from the Crime Prevention Research Center, a conservative nonprofit, which found that immigrants between the ages of 15 and 35 who were living in the U.S. illegally accounted for almost 8% of Arizona's prison population, despite being around 2% of the state's population. The report also concluded that immigrants living in the U.S. illegally are significantly more likely to be convicted of crime than \"other Arizonans.\"\n\nBut the paper has \"significant problems,\" Gilman wrote in an email to the AP. She noted that the paper was not peer-reviewed and that the author failed to account for prosecutors' potential bias against immigrants.\n\n\"There is no effort to control for prosecutorial predilection towards prosecuting undocumented persons or migrants,\" Gilman wrote. \"In other words, it may well be that migrants do not commit more crimes but are instead prosecuted at higher rates.\"\n\n\"The whole methodology is very questionable and the basic explanation of the method is not sound,\" Ingrid Eagly, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, wrote in an email to the AP.\n\nCastañeda wrote in an email to the AP that the finding that immigrants living in the U.S. illegally are overrepresented in Arizona's prisons \"does not mean they were committing more or worse crime.\"\n\n-\n\nCLAIM: There are 21 million immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.\n\nTHE FACTS: False. Many credible sources gauge the total number as around 10 million.\n\nIn response to the AP's questions, Kolvet of Turning Point USA pointed to a 2018 study published in PLOS ONE, a peer-reviewed journal, that found that as many as 22 million immigrants could be living in the U.S. illegally.\n\nHowever, this is just one estimate based on a variety of assumptions, and experts who spoke to the AP pointed to other credible sources that determined that the figure was far smaller.\n\n\"Their numbers of 21 million are just wildly off base,\" Yale-Loehr said, referring to Kirk's claim. \"They are double what reputable research organizations have found.\"\n\nHe pointed to the Pew Research Center, which estimated that 10.5 million immigrants were living in the U.S. illegally as of 2017. The Pew Research Center also found in 2018 that immigrants who overstayed their visa make up an increasing share of that population.\n\nEagly cited 2019 statistics published by the Migration Policy Institute , a nonpartisan think tank, which estimated that roughly 11 million immigrants are living in the U.S. illegally.\n\nSimilarly, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security estimated that there were 11.4 million immigrants living in the U.S. illegally in 2018.\n\n\"The numbers presented in this study are outliers as compared to the estimates provided in numerous other studies,\" Gilman wrote in an email to the AP.\n\n\"One study does not cancel many studies showing different findings using different data sources and methods,\" Castañeda wrote in an email to the AP. \"The consensus from experts is different from those of the speakers in the video.\"\n\n-\n\nCLAIM: Immigrants living in the U.S. illegally get welfare benefits and 80% never stop using welfare.\n\nTHE FACTS: False. Immigrants living in the U.S. illegally don't qualify for most federal welfare benefits, such as food stamps, experts say.\n\n\"Undocumented immigrants absolutely don't qualify for benefits,\" Gilman said. \"In fact, even green card holders, lawful permanent residents, are not eligible for food stamps, Medicaid for five years after they get their green card.\"\n\nGilman pointed to a 2018 report published by the CATO Institute, a libertarian think tank, that found that immigrants who qualify for federal benefits \"are less likely to consume welfare benefits and, when they do, they generally consume a lower dollar value of benefits than native‐born Americans.\"\n\nWhen asked to provide evidence for her claim, Owens pointed to a 2002 report published by the Brookings Institution discussing the details of federal law governing welfare benefits for noncitizens. She also cited a 2011 report from the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for less immigration, that determined that immigrant households with children used welfare programs at a higher rate than \"native households with children.\"\n\nThe 2002 Brookings Institution report states that use of welfare by legal permanent residents has declined by a faster rate than use of such benefits by citizens, Yale-Loehr noted in an email to the AP.\n\n\"The CIS report doesn't distinguish between legal and illegal immigrants,\" Yale-Loehr wrote. \"Neither report states that 80% of undocumented immigrants never go off welfare. The bottom line: These two reports fail to support Candace Owens' claim.\"\n\n___\n\nThis is part of AP's effort to address widely shared misinformation, including work with outside companies and organizations to add factual context to misleading content that is circulating online.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nCLAIM: An image shows Candace Owens retweeting Fox News post and suggesting she had long-term side effects from taking the drug ivermectin.\n\nAP'S ASSESSMENT: False. There is no record of Owens posting that tweet and Fox News confirmed the supposed story and tweet shown in the image were fabricated. The image was previously shared on Reddit as satire.\n\nTHE FACTS: The fabricated Fox News post circulating on social media falsely claims there are new studies on ivermectin, an antiparasitic drug that has been touted by some as a COVID-19 treatment despite a lack of evidence to support that use.\n\nThe purported Fox News tweet reads: \"Ivermectin's hidden cost: New studies show that 68% of those who used ivermectin to treat or prevent Covid are suffering long-term bowel and urinary incontinence.\" The screenshot of the tweet doesn't show a link to a story and claims the tweet was posted on May 12.\n\nThe screenshot also shows a retweet from Owens, a conservative commentator, reading: \"Well this explains a few things.\"\n\nOne Twitter user shared the supposed screenshot on May 16 and the post garnered more than 40,000 likes. Another tweet of the screenshot accrued more than 12,000 likes. Some replies suggested users believed the screenshot was authentic.\n\n\"I'm surprised that Fox News is tweeting this because they were one of the sources of the whole Ivermectin misinformation,\" said one user.\n\nHowever, both the Owens and Fox News tweets shown in the image are fabricated. The screenshot shows a watermark that reads, \"r/totallyrealtweets\" which is a Reddit account where the post originated.\n\nA reverse image search also shows the image on another Reddit page where the poster of the image said it was fake. \"This post is flaired as 'FAKE NEWS.' That means it is not a real tweet. From r/TOTALLYREALTWEETS,\" reads the comment.\n\nA Fox News spokesperson told the AP that the tweet attributed to the channel is fabricated. The tweet also doesn't appear on Fox News' Twitter feed captured by the Wayback Machine and there are no tweets showing engagement from other users to the supposed post, which would still be visible even if the post was deleted.\n\nThere is also no record of Owens posting the tweet; it is not on her profile and there are no replies signaling engagement with such a deleted tweet. Owens did not respond to the AP's request for comment.\n\nDiarrhea is listed as a side effect of ivermectin if one overdoses, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe AP has fact-checked faulty claims about ivermectin in the past. The FDA has not authorized or approved the drug to prevent or treat COVID-19.\n\n___\n\nThis is part of AP's effort to address widely shared misinformation, including work with outside companies and organizations to add factual context to misleading content that is circulating online.

      "text": "The New Republican Battle Cry\n\nWhat \"awake, not woke\" reveals about the GOP\n\nT he right-wing media personality Candace Owens wants to warn the conservative movement about horny bears. In fact, she's been waiting for five years to relay a factoid she promises will unlock everything.\n\nStrolling the stage at Orlando's Rosen Shingle Creek Resort, Owens finally has her chance to address the true believers who have come to the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC. And she's going to seize that moment. Nature, she says, is not the pleasant place that the woke media elites down the road at Disney would have you believe.\n\n\"Male bears actually kill their cubs,\" she tells the audience, which doesn't quite know how to react. It's just like humans, she adds. \"When female bears give birth and are nursing their cubs, they cannot go into heat.\" And here comes the really \"weird\" part, she announces: \"If a nursing mother loses her cubs, the lactation will stop and she will once again become receptive to breeding. So male bears kill their cubs for sex. Really, that's what it comes down to.\"\n\nOkay, it turns out, it's not just like humans. But the point is that mama bears will fend off horny dads to protect their cubs. And that's just what conservative women are doing. They are fending off the likes of Anthony Fauci, who wants to inject their kids with \"never-ending doses\" of COVID vaccines, who instruct parents to put \"a filthy cloth over the mouth of your innocent child,\" and who teach students \"to judge one another on the very basis of their skin.\"\n\nIn Owens's description, the woke elite have pedophiliac tendencies. They are \"sexualizing\" children by asking kids to think about their gender identity. It's a variation of a theme that I keep hearing as I move from event to event at CPAC. Ben Carson, who was Donald Trump's secretary of housing and urban development, describes the progressive gestalt as \"child abuse.\" Granted, his examples don't quite seem to match the force of his metaphor. In preschool, \"they have these books about these worms. They say the worms can be male or female. They make the worms seem like really cool individuals. What are they doing? They're planting seeds.\"\n\nDavid Brooks: The terrifying future of the American right\n\nThe obsession with woke child abusers echoes the theology of QAnon, which holds that a powerful cabal of pedophiles runs the country. In fact, another panel features the social-media conspiracy-monger Jack Posobiec , who enthusiastically touted Pizzagate, even livestreaming his own visit to the Washington, D.C., restaurant at the center of the conspiracy.\n\nAt CPAC 2022, the alt-right has become the right, and the fringe is now mainstream-and that's exactly as the establishment intended it.\n\nT he brains of that establishment is Matt Schlapp, a lobbyist who has worked for Koch Industries, Comcast, Verizon, and other corporate interests. He is the chair of CPAC and the impresario of the four-day event, and he has scheduled himself ample time in the program. Now he's onstage to explain the sort of good works he likes to perform. But before he starts, he has a question for his flock.\n\n\"Have any of you been canceled?\"\n\nHe pauses briefly-apparently his question was not rhetorical. Thousands of conservatives have gathered in the arena-size ballroom-blond women dressed in Fox News formal, men in suits and cowboy hats, a few stray biker beards. Much of the room responds to Schlapp, shouting \"Yes!\": They have been canceled.\n\nOnce upon a time, it was anti-communism that knitted the movement together. Today, even as a new cold war breaks out, anti-wokeism is the glue that adheres the social conservatives who want to ban critical race theory, the populists who hate Big Business, the libertarians who still just want to drown the government in the bathtub. The slogan hovering over the room is Awake, not woke. Nearly every speech includes a denunciation of the grand inquisitors of cancel culture.\n\nFor Schlapp, the story begins with his wife, Mercedes, who served as the Trump White House's director of strategic communications. Earlier this year, having left her job with the turn of administrations, she began receiving teary late-night calls from former young Trump-administration staffers. In Schlapp's telling, these idealistic souls happened to be in the White House on January 6, going about their daily duties. Then came the terrible House Select Committee, investigating the events of that day. There was no good reason to call these wholesome kids to testify. But that's the way the commissars of cancel culture work.\n\nNow Schlapp and Senator Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, an old Jeb Bush supporter turned \"America First\" devotee, are raising money to pay for lawyers to represent these poor kids through a group Schlapp founded called the First Amendment Fund. There is an element of autobiography in Schlapp's crusade. He is one of the most unwavering Trumpists in Washington. And like those innocent kids, his association with Trump, not to mention his comments slagging Black Lives Matter, have cost him. Once-lucrative clients now want nothing to do with him. He, too, has been a victim of the cultural Marxists, who won't let a conservative make an honest buck these days.\n\nAs I watch Schlapp explain how his fund protects the staffers from cancellation, I can't help but think he is setting a trap for himself. In the past, CPAC's mission has been to stoke the enthusiasm of a conservative movement that exists independently of any politician. At times, as I squint at the stage, I can see Schlapp trying to fulfill that role. He's succeeded in banishing Trump's signature obsession, the unfounded theory that Democrats stole the presidential election, from the programming. (The task of beating that drum is left to Mike Lindell, the MyPillow guy , who tirelessly stalks the halls giving interview after interview-but is never invited onstage.) Indeed, there are hours when the name Donald Trump doesn't pass the lips of any of the speakers.\n\nAnne Applebaum: The MyPillow guy could really destroy democracy\n\nThere are pragmatic reasons for drawing a little distance from Trump. In the coming midterm elections, Republicans are poised for huge political gains-to benefit from rising inflation and spiking gas prices, frustration over the coronavirus pandemic, and disappointment with the Afghanistan withdrawal. The only plausible obstacles to victory are the ones that they might place in their own path. For the purposes of reclaiming congressional majorities, there's no need to tie themselves to the polarizing figure of Trump. Better, the organizers of this year's event seem to have decided, to dwell on the sense among movement conservatives that they are being persecuted by ascendant progressivism.\n\n\"Awake, not woke,\" however, poses its own problems as an ideological platform. It is true that Glenn Youngkin, now the governor of Virginia, demonstrated that a variation of the slogan can carry a blue state. But he was a stolid denizen of an investment firm with fanatical self-control who cannily used the culture wars to his political advantage. When CPAC speakers talk about the perils of cancel culture, they are attacking Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff, but they are also defending their own right to scream incendiary statements. Throughout its history, the conference has been a place for politicians to prove their ideological purity. Today, they accomplish that by deliberately offending, by shouting the verboten with relish. By adopting their crusade, Schlapp has limited his ability to play the role of gatekeeper. Instead, he's doomed himself to providing a safe space for conspiracists and racists.\n\nF ortunately, an outsider seems like he might be able to charm the crowd into some common sense. Donald Trump's English sidekick, Nigel Farage, the original figurehead of the Brexit movement and a fellow traveler in the international struggle against the globalists, is the quintessential CPAC celeb, a beloved minor hero in the \"America First\" cinematic universe who is crushed by selfie-seekers in the hall.\n\nBut before he can get to the uncomfortable stuff, he wants to reassure the crowd that he is one of them. \"It's just as well that CPAC isn't being held in Canada at the moment,\" he bellows. Indeed, it would be odd for the American conservative movement to hold its annual gathering in Vancouver or Montreal in any year. But never mind, he's here for the punch line: \"Well, Mr. Trudeau has become the most authoritarian ...\"\n\nThere's a smattering of boos and Farage feigns alarm. \"You must all be half-asleep. It's clearly been a long day. I said, Justin Trudeau .\"\n\nHe flashes an exaggerated expression of relief as the crowd begins to emit sounds of displeasure worthy of the man it has deemed the Maple-Leaf Mussolini. By dispersing the trucker protests in Ottawa and Windsor, the Canadian prime minister has assumed a position alongside Hillary Clinton in the pantheon of CPAC villains.\n\nAfter Farage launches into a condemnation of America's staunchest historic allies-Canada, Australia, New Zealand-he needs to deal with the awkward matter of his past affinity for one of the nation's present enemies, Vladimir Putin.\n\nMany other speakers at CPAC have tried to pivot away from their own record on the subject. Days after praising Putin as \"savvy,\" former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the conference, \"We've seen a Russian dictator now terrorize the Ukrainian people.\" But Farage's backtracking is unique. The thing was, until recently, he thought Putin's demands were awfully reasonable. \"He wanted to get back, at least I thought, to get back the Russian-speaking areas [of Ukraine].\" In other words, Farage was cool with a partial invasion of Ukraine. Unfortunately, Putin went further. \"I'd always thought we were dealing with someone who was logical,\" he pleads. Well, it turns out he was wrong about that. In the end, though, it was all Joe Biden's fault, anyway.\n\nBut Farage is only now getting to the hard truth. Without mentioning Trump, he's prepared to challenge one of the ex-president's sacrosanct positions.\n\n\"Does it make sense for the Republican Party to go on talking about the stolen election?\" His question elicits cries of \"yes\" from the crowd.\n\n\"You may say 'yes' in this hall because you're political activists and you understand what happened. Remember, most voters are busy with their lives.\"\n\nThe crowd is listening politely.\n\n\"This message of a stolen election, if you think about it, is actually a negative, backward-looking message. There's a better, more positive message the Republican Party needs to embrace and it's this: 'We're going state by state, vote by vote, to make sure that America has the best, the cleanest, the fairest election system anywhere in the Western world.'\"\n\nDavid A. Graham: Trump is threatening Republican prospects in 2022\n\nAs he leaves the stage, the crowd applauds, and it's possible, for a moment at least, to entertain the idea that Schlapp was right not to make the 2020 election a conference theme. Perhaps the true believers care less about Trump's grievances than their own.\n\nT he last time I attended CPAC was in 1999, back when it was held in a drab room in a Crystal City, Virginia, hotel. Maybe then somebody bothered with placing American flags behind the podium. Certainly, there were no swirling spotlights coming from the ceiling, no slick advertisements for Dinesh D'Souza documentaries playing between speakers. To get a small crowd with good energy, college kids were bused into town. It was like a middle-school play compared with the Super Bowl halftime show that CPAC has become. The diminutive head of the Family Research Council, Gary Bauer-Gary Bauer!-won the straw poll that year, making him the movement's favorite contender for the 2000 presidential election. I remember standing in the back of the room listening to Bill Kristol hold court. Now I imagine what the guys wearing I Stand for the Flag, I Kneel for the Cross T-shirts, who circle the resort on Harleys with Trump flags fluttering behind their hogs, would say if the Never Trump pundit made an appearance.\n\nLast year, CPAC migrated south because there was nothing more anathema than following the public-health dictates required by authorities in Maryland, where the event was scheduled to be held. It moved to Florida, the new spiritual heartland of the movement, where Governor Ron DeSantis was building his anti-woke utopia.\n\nOf course, that also moved the event closer to Mar-a-Lago, and whatever impulse existed to keep Trump at arm's length from this year's gathering never had the force of genuine conviction. Earlier in the week, Trump announced that he would appear on Saturday, not Sunday. The schedule bent to his desire. It's his presence that fills the seats, that attracts the media, that makes the enterprise run. On the morning that he is to address the conference, a line snakes along the outside of the hotel. A stand selling Trump merchandise appears in the resort. (Among the wares: a five-volume collection of Trump's tweets, the ultimate in right-wing samizdat.) Red baseball caps suddenly sprout on heads.\n\nThat afternoon, Barry Goldwater Jr., the son of the original patron saint of conservatism, wanders the hotel. He has his father's obstreperous chin, and it's as if an apparition has descended on the hall. But the ghost of conservatism's supposedly more honorable past is here for the main event, like everyone else.\n\nFor the first three days, one speaker had followed another in quick succession. But the program stops so that a crew can reconfigure the stage, lending it the trappings of a campaign rally. The decibel level of the hype music increases. Word spreads that Trump was in the building, eating McDonald's in a holding room with high rollers and faithful foot soldiers, like Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida.\n\nAs he enters the room, every phone flips to its side so that it can capture the moment in landscape mode, even though most in the crowd are witnessing a performance they've seen many times before. Trump has been coy about his intentions for 2024. But there has been enough chatter about his potential successors that he feels the time has come to crush their hopes. \"We did it twice and we'll do it again,\" Trump blares. \"We're going to be doing it again, a third time.\" His intent is unmistakable and it brings the crowd back to its feet, arms punching the air. Lest anyone get any ideas, the movement is his, and his alone."

      "text": "The Oddly Intense Anger Against Zelensky, Explained\n\nDomestic animosity drives right-wing rage\n\n\" I just want to punch him .\" That's what Candace Owens told her 3.3 million Twitter followers in response to a video of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanking Americans for their support in his nation's existential struggle against Russian aggression. It's an absurd, juvenile statement, but it was also par for the course on the new American right.\n\nZelensky's visit to the United States triggered an astonishing outpouring of raw vitriol from some of the most prominent right-wing voices in the land. Donald Trump Jr. called Zelensky an \" international welfare queen .\" In a furious monologue on Tucker Carlson Tonight, Carlson said that Zelensky-who wore fatigues similar to the ones he's worn since the conflict started-\" dressed like the manager of a strip club .\" The Daily Wire 's Matt Walsh told his 1.2 million Twitter followers that Zelensky was a \" grifting leech .\"\n\nThe list goes on. Turning Point USA's Benny Johnson called Zelensky an \" ungrateful piece of sh*t. \" His boss, Turning Point USA President Charlie Kirk, said Zelensky is \"the perfect person for DC. Barely can speak English, an actor, and totally corrupt.\"\n\nAnd if you think that's the entirety of right-wing hatred against Zelensky, you're sadly mistaken. I simply highlighted a few of the people with huge platforms on the right. If you want an even more complete roundup, I'd suggest reading Cathy Young's outstanding report over at The Bulwark .\n\nIn fact, Cathy and I are doing much the same thing. We're trying to highlight and explain the incredible outpouring of right-wing anger against the president of a country that's defending itself against an unprovoked, brutal invasion by one of our nation's chief geopolitical foes. Here's Cathy's smart take:\n\nI agree with all of her explanations. Each element is in the mix to a greater or lesser degree, but I want to drill down on her first point. Partisan polarization doesn't just explain the fact of right-wing opposition to Ukraine; it also explains its raw intensity.\n\nSimply put, it's not about Ukraine. It's about you. A key reason why the new right hates Zelensky is that the new right hates you . You are the real enemy, and anything or anyone you like, they will hate. And, to be clear, I'm not just talking about polarization between Republicans and Democrats. Most Americans (including most Republicans) still support sending additional arms to Ukraine .\n\nThis is about polarization against the Democrats, against the Republican establishment, and against traditional Reagan conservatives like me-a coalition the new right calls the \"uniparty.\" What the alleged uniparty supports, the new right opposes, and it doesn't just oppose positions; it opposes the people within the alleged uniparty with an almost primal ferocity. Just watch a typical Carlson monologue. It's peppered with schoolyard insults and juvenile name-calling.\n\nAlong with the vitriol, there is a kind of potpourri of positions that goes along with membership in the new right, including vaccine skepticism (or outright opposition) and election denial. No, not every person shares the same position, but the overlap is tremendous-including among most of the public voices I highlighted above.\n\nKirk, for example, spent much of yesterday tweeting against Zelensky and in support of Kari Lake's hopeless effort to reverse the results of the Arizona gubernatorial election, which Lake lost. There are few more prominent opponents of the COVID vaccine than Owens . Carlson has also relentlessly criticized COVID vaccines.\n\nAt first glance, these issues might seem to be completely disconnected. But scratch beneath the surface, and they all share the same fundamental characteristic: furious defiance of majority consensus. Again, what the \"uniparty\" is for, the new right is against.\n\nAnd this defiance makes a difference in people's decisions. Republicans are less likely to get vaccinated against COVID, and now there's evidence that this was a deadly choice. A study of voters in Ohio and Florida has revealed some startling facts: \"The fates of Republicans and Democrats began to diverge markedly after the introduction of vaccines in April of 2021. Between March 2020 and March 2021, excess death rates for Republicans were 1.6 percentage points higher than for Democrats. After April 2021, the gap widened to 10.6 percentage points.\"\n\nThat defiance is also making a difference in American support for Ukraine. The same poll I cited above, which indicates that a majority of Republicans still support additional arms for Ukraine, also shows that support for arms and economic assistance to Ukraine has dropped far more with Republicans than with Democrats or independents.\n\nI've written about right-wing contrarianism before , but it's important to identify each time it arises. And it's important to identify the sheer amount of hatred that animates new-right discourse. You don't compare foreign leaders to strip-club owners, call them leeches or welfare queens, or fantasize about punching them if you're simply holding a different opinion about a complex and difficult point of policy.\n\nThat's why it's become particularly difficult to discuss policy. The new right's objections to supporting Ukraine, or taking a vaccine, or accepting the results of an election are largely born out of hatred-the conviction that the evil \"they\" are out to destroy \"us\"; it's difficult to reasonably debate policy differences against the backdrop of such extreme animosity. If the new right believes its Democratic and Republican opponents are fundamentally evil, then of course it will believe that the policies and people they support are evil as well.\n\nWe saw this animosity again yesterday, when 18 Republicans joined Democrats in the Senate to pass an omnibus spending package that included a substantial increase in aid to Ukraine. And how did Johnson react? \" Senate Republicans are traitors ,\" he tweeted. Carlson hosted a segment called \" adventures in idiocy \" in which his guest, yes, decried the \"uniparty\" and called the bill a \"betrayal of the American people.\"\n\nOf course, not every opponent of Ukraine aid shares these dark motivations. There are thoughtful people who raise serious concerns about escalation, or about the increasing financial costs of our support. But right-wing infotainment doesn't feature reasoned argument. Instead it sensationalizes. It insults. It provokes. And those insults and provocations have far more reach than reasoned arguments.\n\nThe longer I write about American politics and culture, the more I realize that animosity is our real enemy. The anger in so many American hearts blinds them to the truth, renders them vulnerable to conspiracies, and tempts them into dehumanizing their opponents.\n\nThat's what we saw unfold online this week during Zelensky's visit. It wasn't the new right rising in reasoned opposition to American policy, but rather hysterical rage animated by very real hate. And the hatred isn't truly against the people of Ukraine or even necessarily against Zelensky himself. It's against you. It's against me. It's against the people of this country who the new right believes are rotten to our very core."

      "text": "Social Media Are a Mass Shooter's Best Friend\n\nA terrorist attack in New Zealand cast new blame on how technology platforms police content. But global internet services were designed to work this way, and there might be no escape from their grip.\n\nForty-nine people are dead and 20 more injured after terrorist attacks on two New Zealand mosques Friday. One of the alleged shooters is a white man who appears to have announced the attack on the anonymous-troll message board 8chan. There, he posted images of the weapons days before the attack, and an announcement an hour before. On 8chan and Twitter, he also posted links to a 74-page manifesto, titled \"The Great Replacement,\" blaming immigration for the displacement of whites in Oceania and elsewhere. The manifesto cites \"white genocide\" as a motive for the attack, and calls for \"a future for white children\" as its goal.\n\nThe person who wrote the manifesto, identified by authorities as a 28-year-old Australian named Brenton Tarrant, also live-streamed one of the attacks on Facebook; Tarrant appears to have posted a link to the stream on 8chan before carrying out the attack.\n\nIt's terrifying stuff, especially since 8chan is one of a handful of sites where disaffected internet misfits create memes and other messages to provoke dismay and sow chaos among the \"normies\" outside their ranks, whom they often see as suckers at best, oppressors at worst. \"It's time to stop shitposting,\" the alleged shooter's 8chan post reads, \"and time to make a real-life effort post.\" Many of the responses , anonymous by 8chan's nature, celebrate the attack, with some posting congratulatory Nazi memes. A few seem to decry it, even if just for logistical quibbles. Still others lament that the whole affair might destroy the site, a concern that betrays its users' priorities.\n\nRead: Why conspiracy videos go viral on YouTube\n\nSocial-media companies scrambled to take action as the news-and the video-of the attack spread. Facebook finally managed to pull down Tarrant's profiles and the video, but only after New Zealand police brought the live-stream to the company's attention. Twitter also suspended Tarrant's account, where he had posted links to the manifesto from several file-sharing sites.\n\nThe chaotic aftermath mostly took place while many North Americans slept unaware, waking up to the news and its associated confusion. By morning on the East Coast, news outlets had already weighed in on whether technology companies might be partly to blame for catastrophes such as the New Zealand massacre because they have failed to catch offensive content before it spreads. But the internet was designed to resist the efforts of any central authority to control its content-even when a few large, wealthy companies control the channels by which most users access information.\n\n\"Tech companies basically don't see this as a priority,\" the counter-extremism policy adviser Lucinda Creighton told CNN. \"They say this is terrible, but what they're not doing is preventing this from reappearing.\" Others affirmed the importance of quelling the spread of the manifesto, video, and related materials, for fear of producing copycats, or of at least furthering radicalization among those who would be receptive to the message. \"Do not share the video or you are part of this,\" said a retired FBI agent who now works as an analyst for CNN.\n\nThat might be impossible. When I started catching up on the shooting this morning, I stumbled upon the video of the massacre searching for news. I didn't intend to watch it, but it autoplayed in my Twitter search results, and I couldn't look away until it was too late. I wish I'd never seen it, but I didn't even get a chance to ponder that choice before Twitter forced it upon me. The internet is a Pandora's box that never had a lid.\n\nThe circulation of ideas might have motivated the shooter as much as, or even more than, ethnic violence. As Charlie Warzel wrote at The New York Times , the New Zealand massacre seems to have been made to go viral . Tarrant teased his intentions and preparations on 8chan. When the time came to carry out the act, he provided a trove of resources for his anonymous brethren, scattered to the winds of mirror sites and repositories. Once the live-stream started, one 8chan user posted \"capped for posterity\" on Tarrant's thread, meaning that he had downloaded the stream's video for archival and, presumably, future upload to other services, such as Reddit or 4chan, where other like-minded trolls or radicals would ensure the images spread even further. As Warzel put it, \"Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube ... were no match for the speed of their users.\"\n\nRead: The shooter's manifesto was designed to troll\n\nDefending himself and Facebook before Congress last year against myriad failures, including allowing Russian operatives to disrupt American elections and permitting illegal housing ads that discriminate by race, Mark Zuckerberg repeatedly invoked artificial intelligence as a solution for the problems his and other global internet companies have created. There's just too much content for human moderators to process, even when pressed hard to do so under poor working conditions . The answer, Zuckerberg has argued, is to train AI to do the work for them.\n\nBut that technique has proved insufficient . For one part, that's because AI is an aspirational solution for a future that has not arrived. It gives Zuckerberg and others rhetorical cover more than technological outcomes. But for another, detecting and scrubbing undesirable content automatically is extremely difficult. False positives enrage earnest users or foment conspiracy theories among paranoid ones, thanks to the black-box nature of computer systems. Worse, given a pool of billions of users, the clever ones will always find ways to trick any computer system, for example, by slightly modifying images or videos in order to make them appear different to the computer but identical to human eyes. 8chan, as it happens, is largely populated by computer-savvy people who have self-organized to perpetrate exactly those kinds of tricks.\n\nThe primary sources are only part of the problem, too. Long after the deed, YouTube has bolstered conspiracy theories about murders, successfully replacing truth with lies among broad populations of users who might not even know they are being deceived. Even stock-photo providers are licensing stills from the New Zealand shooter's video; a Reuters image that shows the perpetrator wielding his rifle as he enters the mosque is simply credited, \"Social media.\"\n\nThe video is just the tip of the iceberg. Many smaller and less obviously inflamed messages have no hope of being found, isolated, and removed by technology services. The shooter praised Donald Trump as a \"symbol of renewed white identity\" and incited the conservative commentator Candace Owens, who took the bait on Twitter in a post that got retweeted thousands of times by the morning after the attack. The shooter's forum posts and video are littered with memes and inside references that bear special meaning within certain communities on 8chan, 4chan, Reddit, and other corners of the internet, offering tempting receptors for consumption and further spread.\n\nRead: White nationalism's deep American roots\n\nPerhaps worst of all, the forum posts, the manifesto, and even the shooting itself might not have been carried out with the purpose that a literal read of their contents suggests. On first blush, it seems impossible to deny that this terrorist act was motivated by white-supremacist hatred, an animosity that authorities like the FBI expert and the Facebook officials would want to snuff out before it spreads. But 8chan is notorious for an ironic, above-it-all approach to all of its perversities, a squalor amplified by the anonymity intrinsic to the service. Here, where users post \"for the lulz,\" or just to get a rise out of those who aren't in the know, the ideology embraces chaos before it does zealotry. But the internet separates images from context and action from intention, and then it spreads those messages quickly among billions of people scattered all around the globe.\n\nThat structure makes it impossible to even know what individuals like Tarrant \"really mean\" by their words and actions. As it spreads, social-media content neuters earnest purpose entirely, putting it on the same level as anarchic randomness. What a message means collapses into how it gets used and interpreted. For 8chan trolls, any ideology might be as good as any other , so long as it produces chaos. No one can find safe harbor from this upheaval. Even here, I am forced to tiptoe around the question of what truly motivated Tarrant and his apparent accomplices. In the process, I risk playing into the hands of conspiracy theorists and trollish contrapuntists on Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, Reddit, and all the rest, underplaying white-supremacist violence by casting it as an epiphenomenon of disgruntled internet culture. There is no winning at this game. The Atlantic originally illustrated this story with the stock-image still from the live-stream video, only to change it after internet users found it offensive. Did we do the right thing, or simply perpetuate the disquiet 8chan hoped for? The answer is unknowable.\n\nIt's easy to say that technology companies can do better. They can, and should. But ultimately, that's not the problem. The problem is the media ecosystem they have created. The only surprise is that anyone would still be surprised that social media produce this tragic abyss, for this is what social media are supposed to do, what they were designed to do: spread the images and messages that accelerate interest, without check, and absent concern for their consequences. It's worth remembering that \"viral\" spread once referred to contagious disease, not to images and ideas. As long as technology platforms drive the spread of global information, they can't help but carry it like a plague."

      "text": "The Dangerous Confusion of Trump's Celebrity Fans\n\nWhen Kanye West and Shania Twain express admiration for the president's communication style, they forget what's at stake.\n\nAs Donald Trump's approval ratings hover around 40 percent, two glimmering celebrity names appeared to come to his defense this weekend. Shania Twain, the Canadian country-pop pioneer, told The Guardian that if she could have participated in the U.S. election, she would have voted for Trump because \"even though he was offensive, he seemed honest.\" Kanye West, the rap institution who paid a controversial visit to Trump before his inauguration, tweeted about his fandom for Candace Owens, a conservative commentator who thinks Trump is the \"savior\" of Western civilization.\n\nBoth statements led to a predictable cyclone: liberals howling that musicians they once loved were \"canceled,\" and conservatives who'd shown little interest in these stars showering praise on them as brave truth-tellers. Twain apologized; West kept tweeting. Taken together, the two episodes lay bare the seductive danger of treating politics as entertainment, and politicians as entertainers.\n\nPrior to this, West already stood among the most potently political-and progressive-musicians ever. \"George Bush doesn't care about black people\" was a pivotal moment of public dissent; his lyrics have vividly described racial inequality and screamed against private prisons. Outside of music, West works to freight his every move, from his marriage to his celebrity feuds , as socially significant. He's made noise about running for president , and he has the rare distinction of being referred to as a \"jackass\" by Barack Obama.\n\nSo it was a shock to fans that after the 2016 election, West visited with Trump. He explained himself on Twitter by saying, \"It is important to have a direct line of communication with our future President if we truly want change.\" He also said he and Trump had talked over \"multicultural issues,\" including \"bullying, supporting teachers, modernizing curriculums, and violence in Chicago.\"\n\nBut what's clear is that for West, political allegiance flows from style first, not substance. \"That don't mean that I don't think that black lives matter,\" he said on tour, explaining why he would have voted for Trump. \"That don't mean I don't think that I'm a believer in women's rights. That don't mean I don't believe in gay marriage.\" What attracted him, instead, were Trump's \"nonpolitical methods to speaking\" that were \"very futuristic.\" In other words, he was interested in Trump as an aesthetic innovator-and even, perhaps , as an artist.\n\nWest's notion of politics as an artform explains his latest controversy, too. In his recent return to Twitter (he'd left a few months after his 2016 hospitalization for exhaustion) he's announced an astonishing slew of back-to-back release dates for albums by himself and by his famous friends, including Nas, Kid Cudi, and Pusha T. He's also been tweeting about philosophy and style. \"Everything is so planned these days,\" he wrote. \"People appreciate spontaneity and honesty.\" Shortly after, he tweeted this: \"I love the way Candace Owens thinks.\"\n\nOwens is a rising pundit in the right-leaning media ecosystem, having used public-speaking gigs and her YouTube channel to criticize Black Lives Matter and praise Trump. Her big idea appears to be that for African Americans to focus too much on racism will consign them to remain \"victims.\" In a widely shared clip, she said, \"There's an ideological civil war happening [between] black people that are focused on their past and shouting about slavery and black people that are focused on their futures.\"\n\nFuture -that, right there, may well be Kanye West's favorite word. As I type this, he's tweeting out videos by Scott Adams, the Dilbert creator who in recent years has built a following as a right-leaning guru . Adams stands in front of a white board, explaining that West \"just altered reality\" by endorsing Owens. \"Forget about whether you think Candace has everything right or everything wrong,\" Adams says. \"That's not the story. The story is that these two people that shouldn't be in the same conversation, in seven words, Kanye just changed that.\"\n\nThis thrill, a shock of disruption that opens new possibilities, is what West continually chases as an artist. As he rapped in 2013, \"Soon as they like you make 'em unlike you.\" As he tweeted last week, \"Trend is always late.\" Owens may play a familiar role as a black pundit who, to the glee of a conservative white audience, tells black people not to complain too much. But she has found a way to update that role for the YouTube era, and West, who fetishizes the notion of influence for its own sake, must see that as a breakthough, too. \"Self victimization is a disease,\" he tweeted, swiping Owens's rhetoric. \"It's no more [barring] people because they have different ideas,\" he also wrote.\n\nBut in politics, unlike music or fashion, the ideas have life-and-death consequences. West has deleted most of his tweets predating this latest burst of activity, save one: a message from Russell Simmons in the wake of the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, saying, \"Police sensitivity training, diversity initiatives, body cameras for police and a fucking arrest would be a good start.\" It's a reminder that Black Lives Matter is not, as critics often make it seem, simply venting emotion. And it's a reminder that West, at least theoretically, supports the movement's policy goals.\n\nYet since January 2017, Trump's administration has signaled support of police officers who act with brutal force. It has also pushed policies that may undercount minorities in the next census, advocated harsher drug sentencing , and ordered the transfer of inmates to private prisons. If these things concern West, he hasn't said. He's just here to cheer the show, regardless of what's happening backstage.\n\nShania Twain's Trump-related drama offers an even starker portrait of politics rendered purely as style. \"Do you want straight or polite?\" she told The Guardian recently , explaining why she'd have voted for the current president. \"Not that you shouldn't be able to have both. If I were voting, I just don't want bullshit. I would have voted for a feeling that it was transparent. And politics has a reputation of not being that, right?\"\n\nWithin hours of the publication of the statement, following outcry spotlighting how Trump's politics and persona conflict with Twain's reputation as a feminist and LGBTQ ally, Twain tweeted an apology. \"The question caught me off guard,\" she wrote:\n\nI am passionately against discrimination of any kind and hope it's clear from the choices I have made, and the people I stand with, that I do not hold any common moral beliefs with the current President ... I was trying to explain, in response to a question about the election, that my limited understanding was that the President talked to a portion of America like an accessible person they could relate to, as he was NOT a politician.\n\nSetting aside the mystery of how a question about the No. 1 topic in the country caught her \"off-guard,\" both Twain's statement and apology suggest she approaches politicians as if they're entertainers-as if they, like Twain, exist to make people feel good. But in the case of pop stars who sing songs that people relate to, most everyone understands that the lyrics aren't necessarily rooted in the singer's real life. The cynical line on politicians is that they're always lying, too. When Twain praises Trump for not seeming like a politician, what she's saying is that she's bought his act-which is all the more remarkable given that the man she believes doesn't \"bullshit\" has fudged the truth a historic number of times .\n\nOn some level, then, Twain and West appear intrigued by Trump for exactly the same reason: the way his rhetorical crudity innovates on previous political styles. Much has been written about how Trump's rise conceptually recalls previous times when some new, norm-upending musical force-like, say, punk rock -arrived on the scene. As artists, recognizing the power of such performances is West and Twain's specialty. Evaluating the ideology underneath? Less so.\n\nYet what's most eerie is that they speak not just as artists but as news consumers like anyone else. And theirs is a story that's been told time and again in relation to the 2016 election. People really might vote for a guy because he doesn't seem like a politician. But that's still, in the end, a vote for his policies."

      "text": "The Right Has a Bluesky Problem\n\nThe X exodus is weakening a way for conservatives to speak to the masses.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nSince Elon Musk bought Twitter in 2022 and subsequently turned it into X, disaffected users have talked about leaving once and for all. Maybe they'd post some about how X has gotten worse to use, how it harbors white supremacists, how it pushes right-wing posts into their feed, or how distasteful they find the fact that Musk has cozied up to Donald Trump. Then they'd leave. Or at least some of them did. For the most part, X has held up as the closest thing to a central platform for political and cultural discourse.\n\nBut that may have changed. After Trump's election victory, more people appear to have gotten serious about leaving. According to Similarweb , a social-media analytics company, the week after the election corresponded with the biggest spike in account deactivations on X since Musk's takeover of the site. Many of these users have fled to Bluesky: The Twitter-like microblogging platform has added about 10 million new accounts since October.\n\nX has millions of users and can afford to shed some here and there. Many liberal celebrities, journalists, writers, athletes, and artists still use it-but that they'll continue to do so is not guaranteed. In a sense, this is a victory for conservatives: As the left flees and X loses broader relevance, it becomes a more overtly right-wing site. But the right needs liberals on X. If the platform becomes akin to \"alt-tech platforms\" such as Gab or Truth Social, this shift would be good for people on the right who want their politics to be affirmed. It may not be as good for persuading people to join their political movement.\n\nThe number of people departing X indicates that something is shifting, but raw user numbers have never fully captured the point of what the site was. Twitter's value proposition was that relatively influential people talked to each other on it. In theory, you could log on to Twitter and see a country singer rib a cable-news anchor, billionaires bloviate, artists talk about media theory, historians get into vicious arguments, and celebrities share vaguely interesting minutiae about their lives. More so than anywhere else, you could see the unvarnished thoughts of the relatively powerful and influential. And anyone, even you, could maybe strike up a conversation with such people. As each wave departs X, the site gradually becomes less valuable to those who stay, prompting a cycle that slowly but surely diminishes X's relevance.\n\nThis is how you get something approaching Gab or Truth Social. They are both platforms with modest but persistent usership that can be useful for conservatives to send messages to their base: Trump owns Truth Social, and has announced many of his Cabinet picks on the site. (As Doug Burgum, his nominee for interior secretary, said earlier this month : \"Nothing's true until you read it on Truth Social.\") But the platforms have little utility to the general public. Gab and Truth Social are rare examples of actual echo chambers , where conservatives can congregate to energize themselves and reinforce their ideology. These are not spaces that mean much to anyone who is not just conservative, but extremely conservative. Normal people do not log on to Gab and Truth Social. These places are for political obsessives whose appetites are not satiated by talk radio and Fox News. They are for open anti-Semites, unabashed swastika-posting neo-Nazis, transphobes, and people who say they want to kill Democrats.\n\nOf course, if X becomes more explicitly right wing, it will be a far bigger conservative echo chamber than either Gab or Truth Social. Truth Social reportedly had just 70,000 users as of May, and a 2022 study found just 1 percent of American adults get their news from Gab. Still, the right successfully completing a Gab-ification of X doesn't mean that moderates and everyone to the left of them would have to live on a platform dominated by the right and mainline conservative perspectives. It would just mean that even more people with moderate and liberal sympathies will get disgusted and leave the platform, and that the right will lose the ability to shape wider discourse.\n\nThe conservative activist Christopher Rufo, who has successfully seeded moral panics around critical race theory and DEI hiring practices, has directly pointed to X as a tool that has let him reach a general audience. The reason right-wing politicians and influencers such as Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Nick Fuentes, and Candace Owens keep posting on it instead of on conservative platforms is because they want what Rufo wants: a chance to push their perspectives into the mainstream. This utility becomes diminished when most of the people looking at X are just other right-wingers who already agree with them. The fringier, vanguard segments of the online right seem to understand this and are trying to follow the libs to Bluesky .\n\nLiberals and the left do not need the right to be online in the way that the right needs liberals and the left. The nature of reactionary politics demands constant confrontations-literal reactions-to the left. People like Rufo would have a substantially harder time trying to influence opinions on a platform without liberals. \"Triggering the libs\" sounds like a joke, but it is often essential for segments of the right. This explains the popularity of some X accounts with millions of followers, such as Libs of TikTok, whose purpose is to troll liberals.\n\nThe more liberals leave X, the less value it offers to the right, both in terms of cultural relevance and in opportunities for trolling. The X exodus won't happen overnight. Some users might be reluctant to leave because it's hard to reestablish an audience built up over the years, and network effects will keep X relevant. But it's not a given that a platform has to last. Old habits die hard, but they can die."

      "text": "What Kanye West's Trump Phase Meant\n\nAs the rapper steps away from politics, he finally clarifies his policies.\n\nKanye ... recants? \"My eyes are now wide open and now realize I've been used to spread messages I don't believe in,\" the rapper tweeted Tuesday night. \"I am distancing myself from politics and completely focusing on being creative !!!\"\n\nHis tweet has been taken as a disavowal of Donald Trump, which it may or may not fully be: The \"messages\" West doesn't believe in aren't specified. But remarkably, all of a sudden, he's announced what he does stand for. \"I support creating jobs and opportunities for people who need them the most,\" he tweeted. \"I support prison reform, I support common-sense gun laws that will make our world safer ... I support those who risk their lives to serve and protect us and I support holding people who misuse their power accountable. I believe in love and compassion for people seeking asylum and parents who are fighting to protect their children from violence and war.\"\n\nThe episode comes after the conservative pundit Candace Owens claimed that West had designed a logo for the \"Blexit\" campaign to get black people to leave the Democratic Party. \"I introduced Candace to the person who made the logo and they didn't want their name on it so she used mine,\" he said in his tweets. \"I never wanted any association with Blexit. I have nothing to do with it.\"\n\nIt's fitting that the breaking point may have been a dispute over product design: All along, West's flirtation with the \"Make America Great Again\" machine-which started after the 2016 election but bloomed into a headline saga in April-centered on aesthetics. For West, supporting Trump just felt right. He loved the president's \"very futuristic\" \"nonpolitical methods to speaking,\" praising his \"dragon energy\" and savoring the cognitive dissonance implied in George W. Bush's iconic critic embracing the right. He took a special interest in Trump's signature red hat, delivering a redesigned version to the White House earlier this month and at one point sporting it along with a Colin Kaepernick sweatshirt.\n\nThe rapper's juxtaposition of Kaepernick and Trump was telling: West really did want the NFL's great dissident to make sweet with the president who'd called him a \"son of a bitch.\" The childish surety that the country's divides could be healed through openhearted outreach came with an even more childish disregard for history. West suggested slavery was a \"choice\"-a state of mind, rather than a system enforced by violence-and during his visit to the Oval Office, he said that time is an illusion, that there might be multiple universes, and that this explains why racism shouldn't be seen as a big deal.\n\nRead: Kanye West's White House visit was a paean to male bonding.\n\nAs substance, West and Trump's dialogue at the White House last month was sickening like an overstuffed and undercooked dish is sickening. Welfare, unemployment, taxes, stop-and-frisk, prisons, and school curricula all got brief mentions, but West emphasized that he admired Trump for reasons beyond policy . Yet as spectacle, the sit-down really was a triumph. There's something deeply trippy-West might say \"futuristic\"-about viewing his 10-minute ramble captured from cameras arrayed around the Resolute Desk. Some feeds show West's mutating expressions as he bounced between topics, some spotlight the president's perplexed head nods, and all lay bare the media machine amplifying the nonsense. Put it in MoMA.\n\nA few plausible theories explain why West is supposedly ditching politics now. His wife, Kim Kardashian, was being pestered to defend him, and this past week his mother-in-law, Kris Jenner, publicly wished he'd quiet down. West's mental-health issues, too, will be scrutinized: The radio host Charlamagne tha God recently canceled a planned appearance with West because the rapper is allegedly off his meds. Music and money must be considered as well. The promo cycle for West's recent album ( s ) has been swallowed by politics, and maybe he wants to shift the focus back to his art for his upcoming album, Yandhi .\n\nOne other possibility, far-fetched as it may sound: an earnest awakening by West. The president's agenda was never hidden, but this week brought news of Trump's plan to end birthright citizenship , his callous reactions to bomb threats and mass shootings, and his increased militarization of the border. \"West calls his struggle the right to be a 'free thinker,' and he is, indeed, championing a kind of freedom-a white freedom, freedom without consequence, freedom without criticism, freedom to be proud and ignorant,\" Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote earlier this year . Maybe at some point-as fans and peers and family members implored West to remember what he once stood for-that ignorance became impossible to maintain, and the consequences unavoidable.\n\nCertainly, if West didn't seem that interested in Trump's specific ideas previously, the fact that his new tweets include his own policy positions-some of which clash with Trump's-suggests he's paying more attention now. \"I would like to thank my family, loved ones, and community for supporting my ACTUAL beliefs and my vision for a better world,\" he wrote. It's good to learn, after so much talking and so little saying of anything, what those beliefs are."

      "text": "Dear White People Is Both Timely and Timeless\n\nIn Season 2, the Netflix dramedy about black students attending a predominantly white university is better than ever.\n\n\"Something's changed,\" Sam (Logan Browning) tells her best friend Joelle (Ashley Blaine Featherson) in the first episode of the new season of Dear White People . \"Logic, reason, discourse. It's out the window now.\"\n\nIn a pop-cultural landscape that's been suffused with explicit political references over the past year, Season 2 of Justin Simien's Netflix series is unusual in that it never mentions President Trump by name. It doesn't have to. The aftershocks of his election have rippled into every aspect of American culture, and Dear White People , which focuses on the experiences of a group of black students at a fictional Ivy League university called Winchester, isn't interested in Trump himself so much as what his presidency has rendered.\n\nThis tight focus is why Dear White People is so eerily timely in Season 2, which tackles the conflict between student activists and a growing alt-right presence on campus that's emboldened by Trump's election. For one thing, the show has a new character played by an actress whom Netflix asked reviewers not to reveal: a black Fox News commentator named Rikki Carter who rails against the \"victim mindset\" of identity politics. In the wake of a news cycle that's spent two weeks dissecting Kanye West's public praise for Candace Owens and his trollish comments about slavery, the storyline feels prescient, to say the least.\n\nIn its first season, spun out from Simien's film of the same name, the show vaulted viewers into the experiences of a different student in every episode. There was Sam, the host of a college-radio show called \"Dear White People\" that aimed to shine a light on the racism inherent in everyday interactions between black and white students on campus. There was Lionel (DeRon Horton), a shy journalist on the college newspaper trying to carve out some sense of his own identity. There was Troy (Brandon P. Bell), the son of the school's dean, who felt hamstrung meeting every one of his father's lofty expectations. And there was Reggie (Marque Richardson), a genial overachiever who found himself at the end of a campus-security officer's gun in the first season's most wrenching episode. By depicting the same events through a multiplicity of viewpoints, the show complicated how viewers interpreted them.\n\nSeason 2 uses the same structure, but it inserts a series of flashbacks to Winchester's history, contrasting scenes of the school's more egregiously racist past with the conflicts happening now. And that's Simien's point: Dear White People feels so timely because it's timeless-the situations it explores never go away. In a conversation with The New York Times ' Reggie Ugwu, Simien expanded on why the series doesn't explicitly mention Trump this season. \"I just didn't want to say his name,\" he said. \"I didn't want to give it that kind of power. I think the underlying issues that brought about the Trump presidency are American issues, and they've been around before Trump and they'll be around after Trump.\"\n\nThe new episodes carry this awareness as they depict Sam's targeting by an alt-right troll, and the emergence of a radio show in response to hers called \"Dear Right People.\" Some of the drama seems inspired by the controversy Dear White People provoked when it debuted, with some commentators on the right dubbing it \"reverse racism.\" Simien responds via the season's best episode, a tense, theatrical debate between Sam and her white ex-boyfriend Gabe (John Patrick Amedori), who's making a documentary titled Am I Racist? \"I don't set out to be inflammatory,\" Sam says. \"I just try to tell people how we feel .\"\n\nIn scenes like this one, Dear White People comes across as vital, enabling difficult, impassioned debates while allowing participants the space to screw up, to be wrong, to make mistakes with good intentions. If the new season has flaws, it's that it structures itself around an odd kind of overarching mystery, and that not every character gets the same kind of depth and complexity. Lionel, in particular, is underserved this time, pigeonholed into a knotty plot that seems like it'll finally make sense in Season 3. And the series doesn't always perfectly balance its vibrant sense of humor with its more serious interrogations. But for the most part, it's as entertaining as it is pointed, deepening the topics of Season 1 by alluding to the reality outside the show. Dear White People might not say Trump's name, but its excavation of the culture he's helped create makes it one of the most compelling analyses yet of this moment, an era where he's inescapable."

      "text": "What the Russian Invasion Teaches Us About the Right\n\nContrarians aren't critical thinkers. They're gullible reactionaries, vulnerable to conspiracy theories.\n\nThis is a free edition of The Third Rail, a weekly newsletter about the Constitution, culture, and the disputes that divide America. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. For access to all editions of the newsletter, including subscriber-only exclusives, subscribe to The Atlantic .\n\nI want to share with you two remarkably similar numbers. At first glance, they should have nothing to do with each other. On closer examination, they're inextricably linked.\n\nThe first number is 57 . That's the percentage of Republicans who told Yahoo News/YouGov pollsters that the United States should take Ukraine's side as it defends itself against Russian invasion (28 percent said the U.S. should back neither, and 5 percent said we should back Russia). By contrast, 76 percent of Democrats said the U.S. should back Ukraine.\n\nThe second number is 56 . That's the percentage of Republicans who told Kaiser Family Foundation researchers that they were vaccinated. For Democrats, it's 92 percent. The partisan disparity is so profound that fully 61 percent of all unvaccinated adults are Republican.\n\nVaccines have nothing to do with Russia, and Russia has nothing to do with vaccines. So why are those two numbers so similar? The answer lies with a phenomenon that afflicts a substantial minority of the right, including a substantial minority of my neighbors. It's a constant, intense contrarianism rooted in deep antipathy against perceived \"elites\" or against the \"establishment\" on the left or the right.\n\nThe overlap between various conspiracy theories is simply extraordinary. Find someone who believes Trump truly won the 2020 election, and the overlap with anti-masking activism (especially pre-vaccine) and vaccine skepticism is almost guaranteed. Find someone who believes in the basics of the QAnon conspiracy theory, and you'll find an election conspiracist and likely a Ukraine skeptic.\n\nIndeed, contrarianism and antipathy also present a crucial explanation for Trumpism. What's a key reason the right likes Trump? Because the mainstream media doesn't. When would they boo Trump? When he conforms to what the establishment wants, including by getting a COVID-vaccine booster .\n\nIf you spend any time watching Tucker Carlson or following the rhetoric of popular far-right voices, such as Candace Owens , Marjorie Taylor Greene, and many, many others, you'll see a consistent theme-they'll find what they call \"the narrative\" (another word for the perceived conventional wisdom in the media or in the political establishment) and simply argue the opposite.\n\nWe saw the pattern throughout the pandemic. \"The narrative\" was that COVID was serious, and so right-wing figures minimized the virus , claiming that it was like the common cold, or that it was merely the flu, or that it would claim only 500 or 5,000 lives.\n\n\"The narrative\" claimed that masks could help limit the spread of the disease, so far-right figures mocked masks, sometimes even referring to them as \" face diapers .\"\n\nThen as the narrative moved to full-throated support for vaccines, the same cohort held back. If \"they\" want me to take a vaccine, then something must be wrong.\n\nThe right-wing contrarian can quote chapter and verse of every time the narrative was incorrect. And there are certainly legitimate critiques to level against the conventional wisdom. Way too many people in the mainstream media and political establishment were too credulous about the Steele Dossier , for example. At the same time, many of the same individuals were too quick to dismiss the authenticity of the Hunter Biden emails disclosed in the waning days of the 2020 election and to improperly label them Russian disinformation .\n\nRegarding COVID, every scientific stumble and mistake is on instant recall. The contrarian is quick to point out the inefficacy of outdoor masking, the bizarre reversals of warnings against mass gatherings during the George Floyd protests, and the improper delays in reopening schools.\n\nBut don't for a moment mistake contrarianism for critical thinking. A true critical thinker holds all sides accountable for their mistakes. Those who underplayed the COVID threat would be rejected just as decisively (if not more, given the staggering toll in lives) as those who overplayed it. Those who said there were no contacts between Russians and the Trump campaign would be rejected just as decisively as those who said there was active collusion with the Russian government.\n\nThe critical thinker is universally skeptical. The contrarian commits a double error-he's both excessively cynical and excessively credulous. He's too quick to disbelieve one side and too quick to believe the opposite. For example, he'll reject an avalanche of evidence of the safety and effectiveness of a vaccine while jumping quickly on fad treatments, like hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin. He'll reject overwhelming proof that the January 6 insurrection was a Trumpist attack on the Capitol and respond immediately to speculation that the FBI or antifa instigated the riot.\n\nThe same people who were catastrophically wrong about the severity of COVID or the effectiveness of vaccines continue to enjoy an audience from the same people who demand rigorous and merciless accountability from their political opponents.\n\nThe pattern holds true across multiple fronts. The contrarians still love the voices who spread absurd misinformation about the 2020 election, in part because the rest of the media rejects them. And what does the Russian invasion teach us about the right? It's that a similar percentage will resist \"the narrative\" even when the reality and the morality of the moment could not be more clear.\n\nThe Russian invasion tells us something else also. It reaffirms that the pure contrarians are a Republican minority. Living in the heart of red America, I've experienced a rough two-thirds, one-third political dynamic. Two-thirds of my neighbors are part of the coalition of the normal. One-third are full of profound antipathy. But the one-third easily makes two-thirds of the noise online or at the grassroots. They punch well above their numerical weight.\n\nThey've dominated and intimidated Republican politicians and Republican neighbors. They've ruled with fear. They're so active online that they create the impression that they are the American right.\n\nUntil now. Yesterday, the House voted 424-8 to impose trade sanctions on Russia . The eight dissenters were all Republican, but there were only eight. It was a sign-a hopeful sign-that the GOP can recover from conspiracy theories and that the contrarian minority will not control the conservative future.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the Republican winds are truly shifting. Much depends on the GOP primaries in 2022 and 2024, and that's exactly where the far right holds disproportionate sway. But if the GOP is going to turn the page, the 57 percent will need to exert their will. Their sanity and clarity are the key to a Republican recovery."

      "text": "The Lost Boys\n\nThe young men of the alt-right could define American politics for a generation.\n\nThe sudden emergence of the so-called alt-right from the dark recesses of the internet into the American mainstream was at first more baffling than shocking. The young people sharing strange, coded frog memes and declaring their commitment to white identity politics on obscure websites remained in the realm of the unserious-or at least the unknowable and weird.\n\nThen, last November, The Atlantic published footage of a prominent alt-right provocateur, Richard Spencer, raising a glass to Donald Trump's election at a conference in Washington, D.C. \"Hail Trump!\" he shouted, and in response, audience members saluted in unmistakably Nazi style. The incident made waves-here were young men behaving, in public, like fascists. But Spencer laughed it off, claiming that the gestures were \"ironic.\" The methods and meaning of the alt-right were as yet elusive.\n\nIt wasn't until the events in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August that the alt-right took on a form that most Americans could finally grasp as a real, and unambiguous, political movement. A disciplined, torch-lit procession snaked through a college town, with white men shouting explicitly white-nationalist slogans in chorus. A true believer drove his Dodge Challenger into a crowd of counterprotesters and was charged with killing a woman named Heather Heyer. Could it be that these \"ironic\" young men had meant what they were saying all along?\n\nTo answer this question-and to comprehend the powerful and unexpected effect Charlottesville is having on the alt-right itself-we need to understand what the movement is, and what it is not. Unlike old-fashioned, monolithic political movements, the alt-right is a fractious, fluid coalition comprising bloggers and vloggers, gamers, social-media personalities, and charismatic ringleaders like Spencer, who share an antiestablishment, anti-left politics and an enthusiasm for the political career of Donald Trump. Older theorists who predate the 2016 election-men such as Jared Taylor of the \"white advocacy\" organization American Renaissance and the neoreactionary Curtis Yarvin, who writes under the name Mencius Moldbug-exert influence. But what is new, and unusual, about today's far right is the large number of young people, most of them men, who have been drawn into its orbit-or, as they would put it, \"red pilled.\" The metaphor comes from The Matrix , the dystopian science-fiction movie in which the protagonist, Neo, is offered a red pill that allows him to see through society's illusions and view the world in its true, ugly reality.\n\nFor eight years, I have been closely observing an array of rightist forums as they have followed a strange and marked evolution. Initially, at least, taking the red pill was more closely associated with antifeminist and men's-rights forums like Reddit's /r/TheRedPill, which launched in 2012, than with the nativist or racist corners of the online right. TheRedPill was infamous for its mix of virulent misogyny and retrograde dating advice. The young men who frequented it obsessed over the male pecking order, evolutionary sexual psychology, and the decline of Western men, who had become too meek to stand up to their women. It also played a significant role in popularizing terms now associated with the racial politics of the alt-right, including cuck , a derivative of cuckold first used to describe an emasculated man and later adapted to brand conservatives who were seen as weak on immigration, or just weak.\n\nOver time, this online \"manosphere\" would embrace an increasingly hard-line antifeminism, one that began to shade into broader critiques of a fraying social order. Daryush Valizadeh, known as \"Roosh V,\" launched his writing career with the Bang series of books, many of them essentially travel guides for pick-up artists. His site, Return of Kings, was at first dedicated to crude misogyny and pick-up advice. But by 2015, he was ranging further afield in his search for the source of male woe, writing pieces like \"The Damaging Effects of Jewish Intellectualism and Activism on Western Culture,\" a positive review of an anti-Semitic conspiracy text popular among the alt-right. The Proud Boys, a group founded by the former Vice impresario Gavin McInnes to fight the forces of emasculation (in part through a renunciation of masturbation), also blended sexism and creeping nativism. While some adherents were attracted by the campaign against self-abuse, or the fraternity-like initiation rituals, membership also entailed support for closed borders and what McInnes called, in a clever stroke of euphemism, \"western chauvinism.\"\n\nThe anonymous forum 4chan provided another portal into the nascent movement. Some of the young geeks who populated the site were interested in transgression for transgression's sake-the fun of trolling what they saw as an increasingly politically correct culture. One running joke, captured by the phrase the current year , mocked Baby Boomer liberalism for constantly undermining those who refused to keep pace with its progressive pieties, its cries of \"You can't still think that-it's 2017!\"\n\nPosters in these online forums became adept at using offbeat humor and new media to wrong-foot the establishment. Anyone caught fretting about the right's online youth movement was met with the contention that the entire thing was a joke-and anyone taking it at face value was a clueless outsider. Last winter, for instance, an elaborate hoax originated on 4chan. \"Operation O-KKK\" called for pranksters to flood social media with claims that the \"okay\" hand gesture was a symbol of white supremacy. \"Leftists have dug so deep down into their lunacy,\" wrote the original poster of the hoax plan. \"We must force [them] to dig more, until the rest of society ain't going anywhere near that shit.\" In April, when the pro-Trump writers Mike Cernovich and Cassandra Fairbanks were photographed in the White House press-briefing room making \"okay\" signs, Emma Roller, a reporter at Fusion, wrote on Twitter that the writers were \"doing a white power hand gesture.\" Fairbanks sued Roller for defamation.\n\nAt a moment in history when the right seemed to have died of terminal uncoolness, this strategy of making the left seem puritanical and humorless represented no small cultural revolution. Ever since the 1960s, the right, holding fast to stuffy tradition, had struggled to compete with the youthful vibrancy of the left. But the earnestness and fervor of contemporary progressives, particularly on college campuses, opened the left up to mockery.\n\nOne of the most successful propaganda weapons the alt-right produced was its caricature of the Social-Justice Warrior. Rightists flooded YouTube with \"cringe compilations\" depicting liberal vloggers, protesters, and college students-mostly young women-screaming at opponents, calling out their racism, sexism, and hate speech. In an interview, Richard Spencer described these figures as a gift from the left to the alt-right. \"I love Social-Justice Warriors,\" he said. \"I might donate money to them or something. I want them to become even more, just, ridiculous.\" Andrew Anglin, who runs the alt-right site The Daily Stormer (and is profiled in this issue ), wrote, \"Right now, a divide is happening. And there are only going to be two sides. Either you are with the SJWs or you are with the Fascists.\"\n\nWatching YouTube videos of college-age liberals decrying microaggressions and demanding safe spaces, the young men of the alt-right may have cheered Anglin as he threw down this gauntlet. Then Charlottesville happened, and it became clear what, exactly, it meant to be \"with the Fascists.\" The useful idiots of the less extreme \"alt-lite\" tier of the new right had successfully deployed irony to confound the alt-right's critics. But they had also given cover to its most radical elements. The rally brought into the open the movement's racist core-not the winking shit-posters and fuzzy-faced geeks wearing obscure-internet-joke T-shirts, but a small army of unapologetic white nationalists. Anyone who flirted with the alt-right now understood what they were pledging allegiance to.\n\nCharlottesville splintered the alt-right, though along fault lines that had appeared well before the violence there. The rally had been dubbed Unite the Right, but it proved to be the culmination of a vicious period of internecine squabbling. In June, the alt-right and the alt-lite had held rival free-speech rallies in Washington, D.C., with Spencer whipping up the hard-liners at the Lincoln Memorial while Cernovich hosted a tamer group outside the White House. Spencer accused the alt-lite of being \"cucks.\" Cernovich said the alt-right's \"big tent\" had folded after \"Hail-gate.\" After Charlottesville, he disparagingly called its members \"Nazi boys.\"\n\nGavin McInnes also took pains to distance himself from the movement. \"Charlottesville changed everything,\" he said to Boston Herald Radio. \"I don't advocate the alt-right. I don't advocate their politics.\" Even Steve Bannon, who, as the head of Breitbart News , had done more than anyone else to disseminate alt-right ideas into mainstream American politics, and had once proudly called his site a platform for the alt-right, now described its adherents as \"losers\" and a \"collection of clowns.\"\n\nFor those, like Spencer, who wanted the movement to pursue its most radical goals, the Charlottesville rally looks like a fatal mistake. It happened too soon, before enough young recruits had had time to steep in toxic ideology and see their ironic pranking curdle into something more like real conviction. (A common path to the worst sorts of extremism begins with a search for camaraderie and tribe; the adoption and hardening of truly extreme ideological views come later.)\n\nArriving when it did, Unite the Right was devastating for the movement. The euphoria of the first, tiki-torch-lit night was followed by arrests and humiliation. The names of rally attendees were exposed, which in several cases resulted in the loss of jobs. Online-infrastructure companies booted the alt-right websites they'd hosted and supported, including Anglin's The Daily Stormer.\n\nEven so, the young men who found brotherhood and a sense of purpose in the movement have not disappeared. In the immediate aftermath of Charlottesville, forums like 4chan's politics board were full of discussions about the need to shift tactics and do damage control. But I've seen nothing to suggest that those who were convinced that civilization is in decline-and that feminism, liberalism, and demographic change are to blame-have been unconvinced of those things. \"This was fucking ignorant and now it was all for nothing,\" one 4chan poster lamented. \"Liberal media will blast this for years and scare younger generations from our cause.\" By definition, those who have been red-pilled feel that they have seen the world as it really is and can never go back. So where will they go now?\n\nAt this still-early stage, it is guesswork to say. Some, certainly, will continue to gravitate toward the nastiest corners of the movement-those who were motivated by racism, cruelty, a desire to punish the weak. Others may find new leaders to follow, new movements to join. Many of the young men who first came to the politics of antifeminism in their teens or early 20s are now in their late 20s or early 30s, and may have aged out of some of their more rebellious impulses to shock and offend. The popularity of the Canadian academic Jordan B. Peterson, a contrarian who has decried political correctness but claims to be as suspicious of the radical right as he is of the radical left, suggests one alternative path. Peterson's videos, viewed by hundreds of thousands of people, encourage young men to take personal responsibility for their future and to resist blaming women for their failures.\n\nThe more politically engaged may drift back to the somewhat less extreme positions that had red-pilled them in the first place-opposition to political correctness and immigration reform, support for cultural libertarianism and free-speech absolutism. Candace Owens, a popular young black conservative also known as Red Pill Black, has mastered new media platforms, but in service of advocating for something closer to a traditional strain of conservatism: She's critical of the press, feminism, and open borders, but supports gay marriage.\n\nCan Owens, or anyone else, bring these young men into the political mainstream? To the unhappy forum dwellers who identified themselves as \"beta males\" and neets (\"not in education, employment, or training\"), what the alt-right offered was a revalorized masculinity, a sense of purpose, and a collective identity. Identity has become the coin of the realm in American culture, but one that's not accessible to the heirs of white male hegemony. While everyone else was telling these young men to check their privilege, the alt-right was speaking powerfully to their Millennial woes-their diminished place in society, their dwindling economic prospects, their growing alienation. Asked recently what had attracted him to the far right, Frank Meeink, a former neo-Nazi, responded: \"Just the belonging. Feeling like I was part of something.\"\n\nIt is often said that the left won the culture war and the right won the economic war. From the point of view of angry young white men, however, neither side has scored any victories. A generation ago, Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher championed the individual and the market, while liberals abandoned institutions like religion, national pride, even the nuclear family in favor of individual freedom. Together, right and left created a world in which a young person could invent his own identity and curate his own personal brand online, but also had dimmed hopes for enjoying what used to be considered the most basic elements of a decent life-marriage, a job, a house, a community. (Liberalism claimed that a village could raise a child, but never got around to building the village.)\n\nAmid this desert of meaning into which Millennials were born, the new far right expertly pinpointed the existential questions, particularly for those who couldn't be permitted a collective identity, namely straight white men: Who are we? What is our story? What is our future?\n\nCheck out more from this issue and find your next story to read.\n\nThe alt-right overplayed its hand, fracturing before it coalesced and consolidated its gains. But the forces behind the movement, not least the rapid demographic transformation of the Western world, are not going away. Those who do not want to see the far right reassert itself-not this year or next year, or in five or 10 or 20 years-must provide a different vision of the future, one that is based on a joint sense of purpose and that delivers on the promise of material progress. Figures like Bernie Sanders and, in the United Kingdom, Jeremy Corbyn have brought back a spirit of class solidarity and a vision of society as more than a collection of individuals. Theirs, of course, is only one possible approach, and it may have limited appeal to conservative voters. Whether any vision will be strong enough to unite increasingly fragmented nations remains to be seen. Even if the alt-right doesn't survive in its current form, a generation of young white men now harbor the dangerous belief that they have no future-a belief that will be that much more dangerous if it proves to be true."

      "text": "Two Hatreds Empower Anti-Semitism on the Right\n\nWhen a movement loses its moral voice and its moral will\n\nThe sheer amount of gross, blatant anti-Semitism on the right (including from some of America's most prominent public officials) has reached a level I never thought I'd see in the United States of America in the year 2022, or ever.\n\nYesterday, in his invaluable morning newsletter , my friend Charlie Sykes recounted some of the worst incidents. There's nothing subtle about them, no \"dog whistles\" here. Just in the past week, Donald Trump \"truthed\" this message to his loyal fans :\n\nDays before Trump's post, Ye (formerly Kanye West) tweeted this evil nonsense :\n\nAs The Daily Wire 's Ben Shapiro stated on his podcast , \"What he is spouting is Der Stürmer-type anti-Semitism, and that is about as ugly as it gets, and nobody should be defending that.\" Shapiro was on the receiving end of an avalanche of right-wing anti-Semitic hatred in 2016 when he opposed Donald Trump. Indeed, an immense number of anti-Semitic messages were aimed at Jewish Trump critics throughout Trump's first campaign.\n\nAnd yet, oddly enough, days after Ye's reprehensible statement, Ye attended a star-studded premiere of a new documentary by The Daily Wire 's Candace Owens. The Daily Wire promoted the documentary and Ye's appearance at the premiere.\n\nOwens isn't the only right-wing infotainment personality to stand proudly beside Ye. Fox News's Tucker Carlson broadcast an interview with Ye that conveniently edited out additional anti-Semitic rants .\n\nThis is hardly the first time that powerful conservatives have linked arms with open anti-Semites. As Sykes notes, the Republican fundraising queen Marjorie Taylor Greene spoke at a conference hosted by one of the most vicious and notorious anti-Semites in America, a young man named Nick Fuentes. Just this week, Fuentes demanded that Jews leave America and said, \" I piss on your Talmud .\"\n\nWhat is going on? Two hatreds are combining to empower anti-Semitism on the right. The first is obvious enough: It's the hatred of Jews plain in the messages themselves. It's the ancient evil that has plagued the Jewish people for millennia.\n\nA second hatred, however, enables the first. Parts of the right simply loathe the left. They hate progressives, and they will never react to any progressive criticism by taking concrete action against anyone on \"their\" side. They might say they're opposing cancel culture, but this same quarter of the right delights in censorship when it controls the levers of power.\n\nThis hatred of the left means that the far right will rally around virtually any right-wing personality who says just about anything-so long as criticism of that person's egregious behavior comes from the left. In 2018, for example, parts of the right were furious when ABC canceled Roseanne Barr's sitcom after she attacked the former Barack Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett by tweeting, \"muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj.\".\n\nIn my newsletter last Friday , I wrote about the immediate, reflexive defense of Alex Jones after he was ordered to pay almost $1 billion in damages to the families of eight Sandy Hook victims. Right-wing personalities such as Greene, Charlie Kirk, and others claimed to be defending free speech, but defamation has never been a category of protected speech. (And again, many of these same people are strong supporters of state censorship for opponents and seek to ban what they deem to be \"bad ideas.\")\n\nThere is such a thing as truly problematic cancel culture. My friend Yascha Mounk's powerful June 2020 Atlantic piece \" Stop Firing the Innocent \" detailed how the combination of ideological zeal and extreme intolerance has victimized innocent people who were either misunderstood or engaged in good-faith discussion of serious American issues, including racial justice. In 2021, the National Religious Broadcasters, an international association of Christian communicators, fired my friend Daniel Darling after he wrote an op-ed in USA Today urging Christians to get the COVID vaccine and after he spoke about the op-ed on MSNBC's Morning Joe .\n\nBut moral standards are still necessary. Although some on the right try to conflate maintaining basic standards of decency and upholding the rule of law with \"wokeness\" or intolerance, they're distorting the concept of cancel culture to defend some of the worst people in American life.\n\nThe best definition of true cancel culture comes from the Yale professor Nicholas Christakis: \"1) forming a mob, to 2) seek to get someone fired (or disproportionately punished), for 3) statements within [the] Overton window.\" The \" Overton window \" refers to the range of mainstream American discourse and ideas.\n\nBlatant anti-Semitism is not within any proper understanding of mainstream discourse. Any movement that refuses to exercise its own free-speech rights to unequivocally condemn anti-Semitism when it arises (even if it's from a former president) is a movement that's lost its moral voice.\n\nAny movement that refuses to exercise its own rights of freedom of association to purge anti-Semitism from its ranks is a movement that's lost its moral will.\n\nMore than one form of hatred can harm America's Jews. Anti-Semitism is the frontal attack. It's the hatred that causes direct damage. But when any American community hates its opponents enough to protect and promote even its most vile allies, it becomes an essential enabler of hatred. It helps keep anti-Semitism alive. And when a movement continues to promote even the worst of bigots, we know it has lost its way."

      "text": "You turn to us for voices you won't hear anywhere else.\n\nSign up for Democracy Now!'s Daily Digest to get our latest headlines and stories delivered to your inbox every day.\n\nAs Monday's state funeral for Queen Elizabeth II marks the end of a national period of mourning in Britain, we speak with the U.K.'s first professor of Black studies, Kehinde Andrews, about the generational difference in perceptions of the queen within his Jamaican family, which he lays out in his recent essay, \"I Don't Mourn the Queen.\" He also describes the brutal legacy of the British slave trade and the British Empire, which makes the monarchy a symbol of white supremacy that should not be mourned, but rather abolished. \"This is an old institution - deeply racist, deeply classist, deeply patriarchal. It just needs to go. And this is the perfect time to discuss when it should end,\" says Andrews.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We end today's show in London, where the coffin carrying Queen Elizabeth II has just been placed in a hearse bound for Windsor Castle following the state funeral at Westminster Abbey. More than 500 foreign dignitaries attended the queen's funeral, including President Biden, leaders from Commonwealth nations, many members of other royal families, including the emperor and empress of Japan. The funeral was the largest police operation in U.K. history. Police reported placing sharpshooters on the roofs of every building within a mile of Westminster Abbey. The funeral conducted by dean of Westminster, the Very Reverend Dr. David Hoyle.\n\nREV . DAVID HOYLE : We come to this house of God to a place of prayer, to a church where remembrance and hope are sacred duties. Here, where Queen Elizabeth was married and crowned, we gather from across the nation, from the Commonwealth and from the nations of the world to mourn our loss, to remember her long life of selfless service.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : In related news, King Charles III was confronted directly by a protester over the weekend during a stop in Cardiff, who shouted at him, \"Not my king!\"\n\nPROTESTER : Charles, while we struggle to heat our homes, we have to pay for your parade. The taxpayer pays £100 million for you, and what for? [inaudible] Not my king!\n\nAMY GOODMAN : For more, we go to Birmingham, England, where we're joined by Kehinde Andrews, professor of Black studies in the School of Social Sciences at Birmingham City University. He's actually the U.K.'s first professor of Black studies, author of The New Age of Empire: How Racism and Colonialism Still Rule the World , his recent piece for Politico headlined \"I Don't Mourn the Queen.\"\n\nIn it, he writes, \"My paternal grandmother was born in colonial Jamaica in 1914 and was raised on the fairy tales of the Mother Country and nobility of British royalty. She migrated to Britain in search of better opportunities in the mid 50s as part of the so called Windrush generation, who helped to rebuild the nation after the Second World War. A picture of the Queen had pride of place in her front room and were she alive today, she would have wholeheartedly joined in the collective grief. But my father grew up in the 1960s, facing the cold realities of British racism and could never feel any warmth to either the nation or its figure head.\"\n\nProfessor Kehinde Andrews, welcome to Democracy Now! Instead of me reading your words, why don't you tell us that story and talk about the coverage of the queen and what the queen's passing means, not only for Britain but for the Commonwealth and the realms? Do you think this could mean the end of empire? Can you hear me, Professor Andrews?\n\nKEHINDE ANDREWS : Yes, I can hear you. Sorry. So, yeah, no, I mean, I think you've captured a lot of that with the Politico piece. And what is happening today is this collective grief of the country. And as a Black British person, it brings to mind W. E. B. Du Bois's idea of double consciousness, when he said that being Black and being American, sometimes they just clash so much that you feel alienated from the society. And seeing all this collective grief and this mourning and people queuing 24 hours with little kids so they can stare at what was likely an empty box, it just seems like the country has gone kind of collectively mad around this. It's something that we just don't have a connection to, for millions of us in this country, those of us who never saw the queen as somebody representing us, and actually saw the queen as somebody who represented the very racism that we face on a daily basis.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You know, I talked about the Windrush generation. That's what you write about. Your paternal grandmother came to Britain as a part of that, from Jamaica. Can you explain that more to people who are not familiar with what happened?\n\nKEHINDE ANDREWS : Yeah. So, my family was part of the British Empire. We have to remember that Britain isn't just these little islands. What made Britain \"great\" was this massive empire, that included Jamaica, where my family were from. And in Jamaica, it was slavery. We were taken there similarly to African Americans taken to America. I always say the Caribbean is like the American South.\n\nBut one of the things that happened with my grandmother's generation is they were born in Britain. They had British schooling, British education. They were taught that Britain is the mother country, and the queen is great, and it's all wonderful. So my grandmother grew up loving the queen, loving Britain, had lots of hope when she came and migrated here. And she had a picture of the queen on her wall 'til she died, and would have been in one of those queues to go see the coffin.\n\nBut the realities of racism were very different when she got here, when my dad got here as a young man and grew up and saw all the same racism that African Americans experience - police brutality, problems at schools, segregated housing. So we grew up not feeling any connection to Britain, and obviously not feeling any connection to the figurehead of the nation-state.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Your father chose to leave Britain and go back to Jamaica?\n\nKEHINDE ANDREWS : He retired a few years ago. Yeah, to be fair, he had always kind of been going back to Jamaica for weeks. He's never really - the weather never really took it - never really took to the weather here. My father was part of the Black power movement in Britain, very much saying, \"Look, this state, it doesn't represent us. We can't get progress here. We have to have our own education system, our own schools.\" I mean, this is how Black studies eventually came about, in [inaudible] we said, \"Actually, the curriculum isn't for us. The university is not for us. Can we do something different?\" And the queen is the head of the nation - though the king now is the head of the nation. They do represent what the nation is. And racism is as British as a cup of tea, which is why so many of us reject both the nation and the monarchy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I thought it was very interesting how you talked about Black Brits and Black Americans, how here in the United States you're talking about seeing racism every day, on a daily basis, and in Britain, it's not only in Britain, but it is the empire, it is the Commonwealth, that's not so often seen. It was exported to the colonies.\n\nKEHINDE ANDREWS : Yeah, I mean, the big difference between America and Britain is that Britain essentially did its racial violence off campus, if you like, so in the Caribbean, in India. There's been very few of us actually in the United Kingdom on the island, only 'til what we call the Windrush generation post-1948. So, whereas in America you have - you know, there's Black people in America before there was America. Racism is coded into all the laws. It's so obviously in the Constitution. In Britain, it's different, because we really have only been here in large numbers relatively recently. But the problems are exactly the same. I mean, British racism and American racism are the same, right? Britain founded America. It was Britain that first took enslaved Africans to America. So it can seem like racism is different here, but it's actually not. It's exactly the same.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Gold, tobacco, sugar, cotton. Queen Elizabeth I, you say, launched Britain's slave trade. Talk about these commodities and what they meant for the people where they were grown, those that brought that wealth to Britain that we're seeing transferred from one generation to the next in the royal family.\n\nKEHINDE ANDREWS : Yeah. So, if we think what made Britain Britain, prior to the 16th century, before the British Empire and before Britain got involved in slavery, Britain was a small country in the North Atlantic, doesn't have many resources and wasn't really going anywhere. What made Britain take off was its involvement in the slave trade. And the Royal African Company, which is the company founded to initially start enslaving Africans for the British Empire, was the company that enslaved more Africans than any company in the world. Britain was the premier slave-trading nation. And in all the things if you think about what made Britain Britain, first it is gold, then it is silver, and it's then financialization and the stock market, etc. Then it's tobacco. And those were the things which powered Britain's development.\n\nSo, on one hand, you had Britain making massive strides, the Industrial Revolution, becoming this great nation at the top of the world. But then look at what happens to the people who had to do that. The Caribbean, for example, is a perfect example, where my family is from, were taken there in chains, made to produce all this wealth. Sugar was the first one that really pushed Britain forward. And then you look 200 years later. How is somebody like Jamaica doing? It's one of the poorest economies in the world. And that's not an accident. That's because the whole country and the economy were designed to drain money out and give it to Britain. And the best example of this is, when they ended slavery in 1838, eventually, the British government paid the largest payment ever, equivalent to about 100 billion pounds, if you look at GDP , to the slave owners, and the enslaved got nothing and, in fact, had to work off their - had to work for four years 75% of the time as slaves to prove they were fit to be free. And we still see the legacy of that today.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : If you can talk about expressing dissent today in Britain, the whole issue of whether you can say you are against the monarchy, that you want it to end?\n\nKEHINDE ANDREWS : Well, it's interesting. I'd say that I've spoken to probably about 20 journalists. I've done interviews like this all week. Not one of them has been with the British press. There has been wall-to-wall coverage of the funeral. I turn any TV channel on, it's just queen, queen, queen, queen, queen, and no dissent, no questioning the role, no questioning the future of the monarchy, none of this. It really has been a week of propaganda, which has come to a crescendo today, where absolutely everything is closed.\n\nAnd you did report on some of the - you know, the way that protests are being dealt with. I mean, honestly, if you just looked, stepped back from this and said, \"Well, actually, how has this been treated?\" it's not too far from fascism, actually. And it is - and people say it's not the right time now. When else would be the best time to question the role of the monarchy? When there is 70-year reign, a very [inaudible] ended, surely now is the perfect time to wonder why on Earth we would have this monarchy, why on Earth we would represent 14 other countries in the world where the monarchy is the head of state. And even in Britain, this is an old institution - deeply racist, deeply classist, deeply patriarchal. It just needs to go. And this is the perfect time to discuss when it should end.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : If you could also address the issue of those who talk about the queen, like the conservative commentator Candace Owens speaking about British colonization of Africa on her show, The Daily Wire , earlier this month?\n\nCANDACE OWENS : The real truth of the reason why people hate the queen has nothing to do with the colonization, has nothing to do - which, by the way, just to be clear, the Brits invading Africa actually represents - and this is going to get me in trouble - but it was, if you look at how forward it brought the African colonies, it ended up being a net positive. Now, this is, of course, people - it's going to get me in trouble, because people somehow think that Africans were living happily ever after, and things were great, and then the horrible English, British descended upon and murdered everybody, and the French suddenly murdered everybody. And that just isn't the truth. Obviously, the African nations had slavery, just like the European nations had slavery.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Professor Kehinde Andrews, if you could respond?\n\nKEHINDE ANDREWS : Well, unfortunately, some people like to make money from being the Black face of white racism, and Candace Owens has a very good history of this. I mean, that is perfectly nonsensical view of the past.\n\nActually, when Britain came into - when Europe, in general, and Britain, in particular, came into Africa to enslave people, Europe was behind, was far behind. In the 15th century, Europe was probably the only place in the world in the Dark Age and came into Africa. And one of the ways - indeed, the main way that Europe takes over is the slave trade. It is draining out Africans to get the commodities - gold, silver, tobacco, etc., etc. And then it enriches Europe so that Europe can colonize. I mean, colonization in Africa was actually [inaudible] for a reason. Most countries on the African continent were not directly colonized by European powers for more than 100 years, because it took centuries of draining out African people, a barbaric system of slavery, which never existed on the African continent, which totally and utterly destabilized Africa so that Europe could take over.\n\nThe idea that slavery and colonialism were somehow positive for Africa is, frankly, insane. I mean, just look at global [inaudible]. The poorest part of the world is the place - is the so-called sub-Saharan Africa. The place with the lowest life expectancy is so-called sub-Saharan Africa. Anybody with their eyes open, looking at this honestly, could not possibly think that Africa has benefited from anything that Europe has done.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : As we wrap up this show - we have 30 seconds - Kehinde Andrews, what would you like to see now? I mean, you have the song \"God Save the Queen\" is now changing to \"God Save the King\" with now King Charles III . Your thoughts?\n\nKEHINDE ANDREWS : I think it is time now to end the anachronism of what is the British monarchy. Seventy years, certainly, I think [inaudible] - and when we say the Commonwealth, that's just a form of British empire [inaudible]. I think many countries are going to think about removing the queen as head of state, including my own country of Jamaica. But I think also in Britain, like, this monarchy is a terrible symbol. If we want to have an antiracist Britain, if we want to learn the lessons from the Black Lives Matter summer, if you want a public space which includes the millions of children of empire in it, we have to get rid of the monarchy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Kehinde Andrews, I want to thank you for being with us, professor of Black studies in the School of Social Sciences at Birmingham City University. He's the author of The New Age of Empire: How Racism and Colonialism Still Rule the World . We'll link to your piece in Politico , \"I Don't Mourn the Queen.\" That does it for our show. I'm Amy Goodman. Thanks so much for joining us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "President Trump has resumed public events less than one week after he left Walter Reed hospital, where he was treated for COVID -19. Trump has repeatedly declared himself \"immune\" to COVID -19 in recent days and has also said he can't spread the disease, with no evidence.\n\nPresident Donald Trump : \"I beat this crazy, horrible China virus. And it also gives you immunity. I mean, it does give you immunity. Even the - the people that just cannot accept anything, I mean, they just don't want to accept anything. No, so, we - I passed the highest test.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Trump held a small campaign rally on the South Lawn of the White House, where he spoke, unmasked, from the balcony to a group which included many Black and Latinx supporters. ABC News reports conservative activist Candace Owens paid travel and lodging costs for members of her so-called BLEXIT group to attend Saturday's rally. Trump is scheduled to appear at a rally at the Orlando Sanford International Airport in Florida today, and his campaign is planning large rallies in Pennsylvania and Iowa later in the week. This comes as Minnesota's Department of Health identified nine cases of COVID -19 stemming from Trump's rally in Bemidji last month - including one person who was hospitalized in an intensive care unit.\n\nAhead of Trump's release from Walter Reed last week, The New York Times reports the president proposed an idea to his aides for a stunt: Trump would walk past photographers appearing frail and weak, only to rip open his button-down shirt, revealing a Superman T-shirt underneath. On Friday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi introduced a bill that would create a congressional panel to judge the president's capacity to carry out the job, invoking the 25th Amendment, which lays out the line of presidential succession.\n\nTop U.S. infectious disease scientist Dr. Anthony Fauci is disavowing a Trump campaign commercial that he says took his words out of context. The ad features these remarks, selectively edited from an interview Fauci gave back in March.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci : \"I can't imagine that ... anybody could be doing more.\"\n\nDr. Fauci has never endorsed a political candidate in more than 35 years of public service. In a statement, he responded, \"The use of my name and my words by the G.O.P. campaign was done without my permission, and the actual words themselves were taken out of context, based on something that I said months ago regarding the entire effort of the task force.\"\n\nU.S. coronavirus cases and hospitalizations continue to rise, as the overall caseload has now topped 7.7 million, with a death toll of nearly 215,000. New cases hit a two-month daily high Friday, with 10 states reporting record single-day rises, according to Reuters. In 31 states, new cases have gone up compared to the previous week.\n\nThe New York Times reports the White House last month blocked an order from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention requiring face masks on all forms of public and commercial transportation across the U.S.\n\nMeanwhile, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear and his family will quarantine after a member of his security team tested positive for COVID -19.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, stimulus talks remain stalled, with both Democrats and Republicans rejecting a White House proposal for a $1.8 trillion stimulus. Last Tuesday, Trump tweeted that he was ending stimulus negotiations until after Election Day - only to reverse that announcement later in the day. Democrats say the latest White House offer is \"insufficient,\" citing shortfalls in funding for unemployment benefits, child care, and aid to state and local governments. Republicans say the bill is too costly and object to its expansion of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nConfirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett begin in the Senate today. In her pre-released opening statement, Judge Barrett pledges to \"apply the law as written.\" However, more evidence has emerged that Barrett has publicly advocated against abortion rights, including supporting a reversal of Roe v. Wade. On Friday, Barrett amended her Senate questionnaire to include information about talks she gave in 2013 while she was a law professor at the University of Notre Dame. The talks were hosted by anti-abortion student groups. She also disclosed she signed a newspaper advertisement in 2006 that called for \"an end to the barbaric legacy of Roe vs. Wade.\"\n\nThe second presidential debate, which had been scheduled for this Thursday, was canceled after Trump refused to take part in a virtual debate, despite his recent COVID -19 diagnosis. Joe Biden will instead participate in an ABC News town hall on that date. The next and final presidential debate is scheduled for next Thursday, October 22.\n\nIn South Carolina, the planned debate between Senator Lindsey Graham and Democratic challenger Jaime Harrison was replaced Friday by separate, individual interviews after Harrison insisted Graham take a coronavirus test before a debate but Graham refused. Graham chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is opening confirmation hearings for Judge Amy Coney Barrett today. This is Harrison speaking about healthcare in South Carolina at Friday's candidate forum.\n\nJaime Harrison : \"I remember just hearing about the coronavirus and cringing, because I knew the impact that it would have here in South Carolina, and particularly on the most vulnerable communities. We live in a state where almost 250,000 people don't have access to healthcare because we're one of 12 states that have refused to expand Medicaid. Thirty-eight other states have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, and South Carolina has failed to do so. And as a result, four of our rural hospitals in this state have closed.\"\n\nIn other election news, in Pennsylvania, a federal judge has rejected a Trump campaign lawsuit that sought to remove ballot drop boxes in the state, saying there was no evidence the drop boxes would lead to voter fraud. The court also rejected several other voter suppression attempts by the Trump campaign, including an effort to require signature matching for mail-in ballots.\n\nMeanwhile, in Texas, the fate of a directive by Governor Greg Abbott limiting ballot drop box sites to one per county remains unknown after a court stayed a ruling by a judge Friday blocking Abbott's move. Voting rights advocates say limiting ballot drop boxes will not only decrease voting, but will also put people at increased risk during the pandemic.\n\nAzerbaijan has launched fresh air raids on the capital of the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, as a Russia-backed ceasefire between Azeri and Armenian forces broke down less than a day after it was implemented Friday. Armenia accused Azerbaijan of deliberately targeting a historic cathedral, while Azerbaijan accused Armenia of shelling a residential area in its second-largest city, Ganja. At least 300 people have been killed since fighting in the territory erupted two weeks ago.\n\nIn Nigeria, a controversial police unit has been abolished in response to mass protests calling for an end to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, or SARS . Recent videos posted on social media show SARS officers, who are usually unidentified and in plain clothes, brutalizing people, including in some cases apparently killing them. Activists warn, however, that simply reassigning violent officers will not solve the issue of police brutality.\n\nIn Iraq, armed groups backed by Iran have agreed to a conditional ceasefire on attacks on U.S. targets, provided the Iraqi government presents a timetable for U.S. troop withdrawal. Last month, the Trump administration threatened to shut down the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad after a series of attacks on U.S.-linked targets.\n\nBack in the United States, a New York Times investigation into Donald Trump's tax history suggests Trump may have used part of a $30 million loan from City National Bank in Los Angeles to prop up his dwindling campaign funding in the weeks before the 2016 election. Trump's tax records show over $21 million in unusual payments from a Las Vegas hotel he co-owned, that flowed through other Trump companies, which Trump may have then used to \"self-finance\" his campaign. Such funds would likely constitute illegal campaign contributions. Additionally, it would be illegal for Trump to claim a tax deduction on payments that were not actual business expenses.\n\nIn related news, New York Attorney General Letitia James is investigating whether the Trump Organization inflated the value of a Westchester County property in order to reap a $21 million tax break as part of a conservation easement after Trump agreed to preserve 150 acres of woodlands on the estate.\n\nA federal appeals court ruled Friday President Trump's use of emergency powers in 2019 to divert billions of dollars from military construction funds to build the U.S.-Mexico border wall is illegal. We'll have more on Trump's border wall later in the broadcast as we head to Arizona to speak with O'odham water and land defender Nellie Jo David on Indigenous Peoples' Day, which scores of cities and states are observing today after rejecting the celebration of Columbus Day.\n\nIn immigration news, two Cameroonian asylum seekers, who fear they were unknowingly subjected to forced sterilizations at Irwin Detention Center in Georgia, are scheduled to be deported on Tuesday. The women are now imprisoned at Montgomery Processing Center in Conroe, Texas. Advocates are demanding Immigration and Customs Enforcement release them on humanitarian grounds.\n\nHurricane Delta has killed at least one person, cut power for hundreds of thousands and left towns under water as it pummeled Louisiana, just six weeks after Hurricane Laura ripped through the same region.

Security Council in 2003 about nonexistent weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, paving the way for the U.S. invasion and occupation that would kill over 1 million Iraqis. Powell, who was the first Black secretary of state, the first Black and youngest chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the first Black national security adviser, died on Monday due to blood cancer and Parkinson's disease that left him vulnerable to infection from COVID -19. Tributes poured in from top U.S. leaders in both Republican and Democratic circles on Monday, but in other parts of the world Powell is remembered very differently. We speak with journalist and author Roberto Lovato, and Clarence Lusane, activist, journalist and political science professor at Howard University. Lusane describes Powell as \"a complicated political figure who leaves a complicated legacy\" whose public image was \"in conflict with many of the policies of the party he supported and the administration in which he was involved.\" Assessing Powell's role in U.S. invasions around the world, from Vietnam to Central America, Lovato says \"he's made a career out of being a good soldier and supporting U.S. mass murder around the world, but evading the credit for it.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : President Biden ordered flags at the White House to be flown at half-staff in honor of General Colin Powell, who died Monday at the age of 84. Powell was the first Black secretary of state, the first Black and youngest chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the first Black national security adviser. On Monday, tributes poured in from both Republican and Democratic leaders. President Biden called Powell a, quote, \"patriot of unmatched honor and dignity.\"\n\nBut in other parts of the world, Powell is remembered very differently. In Iraq, the journalist Muntadhar al-Zaidi, who famously threw a shoe at President George W. Bush, tweeted that he was sad Powell had died before being tried for his crimes in Iraq. While serving as secretary of state under Bush, General Powell played a pivotal role in paving the way for the U.S. invasion. It was February 5th, 2003, that Powell addressed the United Nations Security Council and made the case for a first strike on Iraq. Powell's message was clear: Iraq possessed extremely dangerous weapons of mass destruction, and Saddam Hussein was systematically trying to deceive U.N. inspectors by hiding the prohibited weapons.\n\nSECRETARY OF STATE COLIN POWELL : One of the most worrisome things that emerges from the thick intelligence file we have on Iraq's biological weapons is the existence of mobile production facilities used to make biological agents. Let me take you inside that intelligence file and share with you what we know from eyewitness accounts. We have firsthand descriptions of biological weapons factories on wheels and on rails. The trucks and train cars are easily moved and are designed to evade detection by inspectors. In a matter of months, they can produce a quantity of biological poison equal to the entire amount that Iraq claimed to have produced in the years prior to the Gulf War.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : All of Colin Powell's main claims about weapons of mass destruction turned out to be false. He later described the speech as a \"blot\" on his record.\n\nBut the 2003 speech was not the first time General Powell had falsely alleged Iraq had WMDs. In 1991, during the Persian Gulf War, the U.S. bombed Iraq's only baby formula factory. At the time, General Powell said, quote, \"It is not an infant formula factory. ... It was a biological weapons facility, of that we are sure,\" he said. Well, U.N. investigators later confirmed the bombed factory was in fact making baby formula.\n\nWhile many in Iraq consider Powell to be a war criminal, just like they consider George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, Powell has long been celebrated at home. Colin Powell was born in Harlem in 1937. His parents had both immigrated from Jamaica. He was educated in public schools, including City College of New York, before he joined the military through ROTC . He served two tours in Vietnam. He was later accused of helping to whitewash the My Lai massacre, when U.S. soldiers slaughtered up to 500 villagers, most of them women and children and the elderly. While investigating an account of the massacre filed by a soldier, Powell wrote, quote, \"In direct refutation of this portrayal is the fact that relations between American soldiers and the Vietnamese people are excellent,\" he said.\n\nPowell spent 35 years in the military, rising to chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In the 1980s, he helped shape U.S. military policy in Latin America at a time when U.S.-backed forces killed hundreds of thousands of people in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala and other countries. Powell also helped oversee the U.S. invasion of Panama and the Persian Gulf War.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2005, he served as secretary of state under George W. Bush. After working under three Republican presidents, General Powell made headlines in 2008 when he endorsed Barack Obama for president just two weeks before Election Day. Earlier this year, General Powell said he no longer considered himself a Republican, following the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol.\n\nGeneral Colin Powell died on Monday. His family said he died from COVID -19 complications. He was struggling with both Parkinson's disease and multiple myeloma, which left him severely immunocompromised.\n\nTo talk more about Powell's life and legacy, we're joined by two guests. Roberto Lovato is with us, award-winning journalist, author of Unforgetting: A Memoir of Family, Migration, Gangs, and Revolution in the Americas . He has closely tracked General Powell's history in Latin America. We're also joined by Clarence Lusane, professor at Howard University. He's author of many books, including Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice: Foreign Policy, Race, and the New American Century .\n\nProfessor Lusane, let's begin with you. If you can talk about the legacy of Colin Powell?\n\nCLARENCE LUSANE : Thank you, Amy. And thank your other guests.\n\nSo, Powell leaves a very - he was a complicated political figure who leaves a complicated legacy. As you outlined in your introduction, Powell has a rise-from-the-bottom story that really captured the imagination of many people. He rose from growing up in poor areas, or at least low-income areas, in New York to become fourth in line to president, when he became the secretary of state.\n\nIn the early 1990s, he was championed by both Democrats and Republicans and recruited by both to run for president. He declined in 1995. And when he declined, he announced that he was joining the Republican Party. Now, the Republican Party he joined in 1995 was the Republican Party of Newt Gingrich, and it did not seem to be a fit. Colin was pro-choice, pro-affirmative action, pro-immigration, called for gun control, all of which the Republican Party, under Newt Gingrich and going forward, have been against.\n\nAs you point out, he joins the George W. Bush administration, the very first choice, in fact, of George W. Bush for his Cabinet because Powell has the international gravitas and respect that nobody else in and around George W. Bush has. But he never really fit in. And in the first eight or nine months of the George W. Bush administration, Powell lost fight after fight after fight when Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld and others, who were what we call the neoconservatives, the neocons, were really running the administration. And there was a pretty good bet that Powell was not going to last until the end of the year. But then September 11 happens. Powell, always the loyal soldier, decides to stay, but he's still very isolated. He says that they basically saw him as a milk carton. They put him in the refrigerator, and when they needed him, they would bring him off the shelf, and then they would put him back. They brought him off the shelf in 2003 to talk at the U.N. because there was no one else in the administration who could get the attention and at least some belated respect. And Colin Powell went and gave that talk, which was, from A to Z, false. But he was the only one in the administration, and then, of course, a year and a half later, he's gone.\n\nBut he's complicated because, in many ways, he did not fit in with the Republican Party, even though he did not leave until early this year. But he increasingly, and anyone who was a moderate, and particularly Black moderates, simply had no place in the Republican Party. And so, he endorses Obama, he endorses Biden, he endorses Hillary Clinton - or at least he votes for them. So he really had moved and been moved out of the Republican Party for many years. But he really wasn't a Democrat or seen as a progressive, either, again, because of a long history of aggression internationally, going all the way back to Reagan and the Contras and all of the foreign policy controversies of the 1980s, and then under the Bush administration, which not only included Iraq but also included the Bush policies towards Cuba, towards Venezuela, their policies around Africa, all of which increasingly isolated Colin Powell from the progressive communities.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, Professor, I wanted to ask you, in terms of the need for both the Democrats and the Republicans to repeatedly lionize and hold up General Powell especially, but then as Secretary of State Powell, as a key and important American figure, given the fact that the U.S. military - of all the institutions in American society, none is more racially diverse, it seems to me, than the U.S. military, with about 40% or more than 40% of the troops as people of color. So, could you talk about the importance of Powell as a figure, given the demographics and the changes in the American military?\n\nCLARENCE LUSANE : Thanks, Juan.\n\nSo, part of the capital that Colin Powell bills is precisely because he rises up to the top of an institution, one of the few that had not seemed to be tainted by political partisanship, and he rises up and becomes the head, becomes the head of Joint Chiefs of Staff. And Powell's personality is not a belligerent one, one that we have, unfortunately, come to see more and more in military figures and political figures, and Powell's activism relative to addressing issues of race. So, when we think of the conservative African Americans who are in and around the Republican Party - the Clarence Thomases, the Candace Owens - those types tend to come to mind. But there were African American conservatives who took positions that were supportive of issues related to the Black community and were active and supportive of civil rights. So, Powell fits into that, and so that gave him some cachet. He spoke at my graduation at Howard University in 1994 and talked about issues of racism, issues of being socially engaged. You're not going to find that coming from virtually any of the people we think of as Black Republicans these days. So, that gave Colin Powell a different kind of public-facing image, which was in conflict, again, with many of the policies in the party that he supported and in the administration in which he was involved.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: I'd like to also bring in Robert Lovato into the discussion. And, Roberto, I'm wondering if you could talk especially about - people forget that back in the invasion of Panama that not only was Colin Powell a key figure, but that the secretary of defense at the time was Dick Cheney.\n\nROBERTO LOVATO : Yeah. Thank you, Juan and Amy. I'm glad to be back with you.\n\nThe story of Colin Powell in Central America and other parts of the world is what I would call a tragic tale of militarism in the service of declining empire. And it also previews what I call the age of intersectional empire, that Clarence laid out a little bit of, in terms of how race is being deployed by the militaristic, bipartisan consensus elites in the United States. And so, Panama comes about, remember, right after the Central America engagements in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and that was preceded by the Vietnam War, when you have a decline in the morale and the sensibilities of the U.S. military, having suffered a defeat, a severe defeat, in Vietnam. And so, Powell was part of a cadre of leaders trying to figure out how to create a post-Vietnam animus for the U.S. military machine.\n\nBut one thing I want to make clear is that the Powell doctrine of overwhelming force, bringing in the public into supporting U.S. war, clearly defined national security objectives and other things that define what they call the Powell-Weinberger doctrine, are still war policies. And so, Colin Powell's political career was one thing, in terms of race and being pro-abortion, but in terms of militarism, it was clear. In El Chorrillo neighborhood, which taxi drivers in Panama still call the \"little Hiroshima,\" you know, hundreds of people were killed. They're still excavating mass grave sites of the invasion of Panama. And so, you know - and prior to that, remember, Powell was an assistant to then-secretary of defense, under the Reagan administration, Caspar Weinberger, who was charged with looking - overseeing military policy in Central America, which, instead of going into what they called asymmetrical warfare, like they did in Vietnam and got beat up, the militarists, like Colin Powell, decided to stray away from those kinds of war and fight them through proxies, and instead focus on building up to get big, you know, state-to-state military wars. And so, the fight against Manuel Noriega, also on false pretenses, was  a preview and a preparation for the state-to-state war that followed in Kuwait and Iraq.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And in that U.S. invasion of Panama that he spearheaded, can you talk about who died, Clarence Lusane, in Panama? We're not just talking about abstract, intellectual, you know, policy issues.\n\nCLARENCE LUSANE : No, that's exactly right, as Ron [ sic ] laid out. I actually went to Panama. I went with another reporter, Stan Woods from out of Chicago. We went down after the invasion, and it was horrific. As was mentioned, there were mass graves. There were the total destruction of neighborhoods. They bombed - these were poor neighborhoods, we should be clear. So, there were wealthy neighborhoods that were surgically missed, while they bombed neighborhoods that had not only been active, but had been - you know, very much embodied people who live there. So, it was a horrific invasion. And Powell said nothing about it. It was similar to other military endeavors by the Bush administration and Reagan administration. Powell was silent on the consequences that thousands and thousands and thousands of people - and hundreds of thousands of people died in Iraq, but certainly thousands of people died in Panama. And there still has not been an accounting for that particularly horrible invasion.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And these were a heavily Black population of Panama.\n\nCLARENCE LUSANE : And these were Afro-Panamanians. That's exactly right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, Roberto Lovato, go a little before the invasion of Panama to explain the Iran-Contra deal and the role of General Powell at the time. The invasion of Panama was under George H.W. Bush, and the Iran-Contra deal, of course, was when he was vice president, when it was President Ronald Reagan, the ultimately illegal deal to sell weapons to Iran, take that money and illegally support the Contras, which was against, at the time, the Boland Amendment, that said the U.S. could not support the counterrevolutionaries in Nicaragua.\n\nROBERTO LOVATO : So, Powell, we have to remember, was what he himself called the, quote, \"chief administration advocate\" for the Contras. The U.S. sponsored an insurgency to try to overthrow the Nicaraguan Sandinista government. I mean, Human Rights Watch and other organizations around the world have documented tens of thousands of people killed, nuns raped, children destroyed by the Contras. And Colin Powell would go on to say that \"I have no regrets about my role\" and that he fought very hard to get support for the Contras. So, Powell, as assistant secretary to Caspar Weinberger, was privy to information about the arms for hostages and giving money to the Contras deal, but managed to evade judgment, unlike Weinberger, who was indicted and condemned, and then, I believe, pardoned, thanks to lobbying by Colin Powell.\n\nAnd so, Powell has proven skillful not just in terms of kind of helping reengineer the post-Vietnam military, but he's also been skillful at evading political judgment, as we saw with My Lai, as we see in Iran-Contra. And, you know, having this idea that the one, quote-unquote, \"blot\" on his record is the lies around Iraq is a travesty, because he's made a career out of, you know, being a good soldier and supporting U.S. mass murder around the world, but evading the credit for it. So, this is - yeah, I'll leave it there.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Yeah. And I'm wondering if you could talk, Roberto, a little bit about, for instance, his legacy in terms of arming and training the Salvadoran Army, and including his relation with José Napoleón Duarte, who was the president of El Salvador in the 1980s.\n\nROBERTO LOVATO : Yeah. Powell was one of the Reagan administration's point people in Central America and, as the point person, helped to tee up and then legitimate, when necessary, the Salvadoran military dictatorships and the Guatemalan and other militaries in the region that were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocents - and so, in the case of Guatemala, like 200,000 or more mostly Mayan Indigenous people. And so, like, in 1983, for example, Powell was part of a fact-finding kind of mission, that included Jeane Kirkpatrick and Weinberger, to go and see if the Salvadoran - to go confirm the Salvadoran military and government were doing the right thing under Duarte. And, you know, they found that they were doing the right thing and that the U.S. should continue heavily funding and training these murderous militaries. He never said anything about the fact that just a year before and a couple of years before, the massacre of El Sumpul, where about 600 people were killed, was perpetrated by the U.S.-backed Salvadoran government; the massacre of El Mozote, where a thousand people were killed, an entire town wiped out, half of the victims under age 12, and half of those children under age 12 were under age 6. Powell seemed to have amnesia about that, along with Elliott Abrams, another, I would say, war criminal. And El Calabozo and other massacres were completely ignored.\n\nAnd so, we see Powell playing a role in Central America over the years, from the early '80s all the way 'til the end of the war. And, you know, Powell was very sophisticated and smart in terms of moving with the times, so that when it called for a hard line at the beginning of the Reagan era, he was there. When it called for - remember, in 1989, the FMLN guerrillas, for example, we launched an offensive in the capital of San Salvador to basically demonstrate to the U.S. government and the Salvadoran government, that it was supporting, that they couldn't defeat the FMLN guerrillas. And so, that worked. It was basically - the offensive showed that the guerrillas were able to enter into the capital and fight on their own terms. So, Powell and the Bush administration, you know, seeing this, pivoted and pushed the Salvadoran government to peace. Now, some historians will call Powell a peacenik almost, a liberal, which, I mean, if you're comparing him to like Alexander Haig or some just uber fascist like that, then, yeah, but in the larger scheme of empire and militarism, Colin Powell has been, you know, was always, a loyal cadre to mass-murdering empire.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, let's go back to Colin Powell's 2003 speech at the U.N., where he falsely accused Iraq of possessing weapons of mass destruction.\n\nSECRETARY OF STATE COLIN POWELL : Every statement I make today is backed up by sources, solid sources. These are not assertions. What we're giving you are facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : All of General Powell's main claims about weapons of mass destruction turned out to be false. But at the time, most of the media took Powell at his word. The invasion of Iraq began six weeks after he made his speech at the United Nations. He himself recognized it was the final nail in the coffin for so many, because he had called himself a \"reluctant warrior.\" He had dragged his feet on the war, and President Bush wanted his support to be the voice and face of this war. In 2013, Democracy Now! spoke to Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, who served as chief of staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell from 2002 to 2005. Wilkerson helped prepare Powell's infamous U.N. speech, which he later renounced. Wilkerson said Powell himself was suspicious of the intelligence and wanted to delete any reference in the speech to ties between al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein.\n\nCOL . LAWRENCE WILKERSON : The seminal moment, as we were out at Langley and Colin Powell was getting ready to throw everything out of his presentation that had anything to do with terrorism - that is, substantial contacts between Baghdad and al-Qaeda, in particular - as he was getting - he was really angry. He took me in a room by myself and literally attacked me over it. And I said, \"Boss, let's throw it out. I have as many doubts about it as you do. Let's throw it out.\" And so, we made a decision right there to throw it out.\n\nWithin 30 minutes of the secretary having made that decision and instructed me to do so, George Tenet showed up with a bombshell. And the bombshell was that a high-level al-Qaeda operative, under interrogation, had revealed substantial contacts between al-Qaeda and Baghdad.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, that is the chief of staff of former Secretary of State Colin Powell. He is an Army colonel, Lawrence Wilkerson. In 2009, Sam Husseini of the Institute for Public Accuracy questioned Colin Powell about the false claims he made during the U.N. speech, that was based in part on false information provided by prisoners who had been tortured.\n\nSAM HUSSEINI : General, can you talk about the al-Libi case and the link between torture and the production of tortured evidence for war?\n\nCOLIN POWELL : I don't have any details on the al-Libi case.\n\nSAM HUSSEINI : Can you tell us when you learned that some of the evidence that you used in front of the U.N. was based on torture? When did you learn that?\n\nCOLIN POWELL : I don't know that. I don't know what information you're referring to, so I can't answer.\n\nSAM HUSSEINI : Your chief of staff, Wilkerson, has written about this.\n\nCOLIN POWELL : So what? [inaudible] Mr. Wilkerson.\n\nSAM HUSSEINI : So, you'd think you'd know about it.\n\nCOLIN POWELL : The information I presented to the U.N. was vetted by the CIA . Every word came from the CIA . And they stood behind all that information. I don't know that any of them would believe that torture was involved. I don't know that as a fact. There's a lot of speculation, particularly by people who never attended any of these meetings. But I'm not aware of that.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Clarence Lusane, we're going to give you the final word. Again, this speech, he would late call a \"blot\" on his career.\n\nCLARENCE LUSANE : So, the thing to remember about that period is that the entire global community was against the invasion. So, when Colin Powell and the Bush administration says that they were vetting this information, they were not listening not only to their allies, they were not listening to what the United Nations itself was actually doing and had essentially proven that there were no weapons of mass destruction. But the administration was determined to go, and Colin Powell basically acceded to that, as he would do both prior to that speech, as he did with the World Conference Against Racism, when the United States and Israel were the only two countries that pulled out, and as he would do after the invasion of Iraq on other policies by the George W. Bush administration, until he was finally driven out. So, there does have to be an accounting for that record. There's no way to kind of pretty it up. It was atrocious. And again, hundreds of thousands - in some estimates, up to a million - people died as a result of that war.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And there are still thousands of U.S. troops in Iraq. Clarence Lusane, I want to thank you for being with us, professor at Howard University, author of Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice: Foreign Policy, Race, and the New American Century , and Robert Lovato, Salvadoran American journalist and author, wrote his memoir, Unforgetting: A Memoir of Family, Migration, Gangs, and Revolution in the Americas .\n\nIn 30 seconds, we bring you a Democracy Now! exclusive: a conversation with Jean Montrevil, a prominent Haitian American immigrant rights activist who was deported to Haiti several years ago. Now, in a remarkable development, he was allowed to fly back to New York. Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "El presidente estadounidense Donald Trump ha retomado los eventos públicos menos de una semana después de salir del hospital Walter Reed, donde recibió tratamiento para la COVID -19. En los últimos días, Trump se ha declarado en repetidas ocasiones \"inmune\" a la COVID -19 y también ha afirmado que ya no puede contagiar la enfermedad, sin presentar pruebas que respalden sus declaraciones.\n\nPresidente Donald Trump : \"Vencí este loco y horrible virus de China. Y eso también te da inmunidad. O sea, sí te da inmunidad. La gente no puede aceptar nada de esto, es decir, ellos simplemente no quieren aceptar nada de esto. Pasé la prueba más alta\".\n\nEl sábado, Trump llevó a cabo un pequeño acto de campaña en la Explanada Sur de la Casa Blanca, donde habló desde el balcón y sin usar mascarilla a un grupo que incluía a muchos seguidores negros y latinxs. La cadena ABC News informa que la activista conservadora Candace Owens pagó los costos de viaje y alojamiento de miembros de su agrupación, llamada \" BLEXIT \", para que asistieran al mitin del sábado. BLEXIT es un grupo que promueve que los afroestadounidenses dejen de votar mayoritariamente al Partido Demócrata. El lunes, el presidente Trump tiene programado presentarse en un mitin en el Aeropuerto Internacional Orlando-Sanford, en el estado de Florida, y su campaña tiene planes de llevar a cabo grandes actos políticos en los estados de Pensilvania e Iowa para esta semana. Esto ocurre al tiempo que el Departamento de Salud del estado de Minesota identificó nueve casos de COVID -19 que surgieron del mitin realizado por Trump en la ciudad de Bemidji el mes pasado, incluida una persona que tuvo que ser internada en terapia intensiva.\n\nEl periódico The New York Times informa que la semana pasada, antes de recibir el alta del hospital Walter Reed, el presidente les había propuesto una idea a sus asesores para montar un espectáculo: Trump pasaría caminando por delante de los fotógrafos, aparentando estar frágil y débil, solo para luego abrirse con fuerza la camisa y revelar una camiseta de Superman debajo de su traje. El viernes, la presidenta de la Cámara de Representantes, Nancy Pelosi, presentó un proyecto de ley que crearía un panel del Congreso para juzgar la capacidad del presidente de ejercer sus funciones, invocando la vigesimoquinta enmienda a la Constitución estadounidense, que establece la línea de sucesión presidencial.\n\nMientras tanto, el principal científico de enfermedades infecciosas de Estados Unidos, el Dr.  Anthony Fauci, criticó un anuncio político de la campaña de Trump, argumentando que sacaron sus palabras de contexto. La publicidad exhibe estos comentarios, que se editaron de manera selectiva de una entrevista que Fauci dio en marzo.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci : \"No me puedo imaginar que... nadie pueda estar haciendo más\".\n\nEl Dr.  Fauci nunca ha respaldado a un candidato político en sus más de 35 años de servicio público. En un comunicado, Fauci respondió: \"La campaña republicana hizo uso de mi nombre y de mis palabras sin mi permiso, y esas palabras en sí mismas se sacaron de contexto de algo que dije hace meses acerca de todo el esfuerzo de los funcionarios de salud pública\".\n\nEn Estados Unidos, los casos de coronavirus y las hospitalizaciones continúan en aumento al tiempo que la cantidad total de casos en el país desde el inicio de la pandemia supera los 7,7 millones, con un número de muertes de casi 215.000. El viernes, la cifra de nuevos casos fue la mayor de los últimos dos meses, y diez estados informaron incrementos diarios récord, según la agencia de noticias Reuters. En 31 estados del país, los nuevos casos han aumentado en comparación con la semana anterior.\n\nEl periódico The New York Times informa que la Casa Blanca bloqueó el mes pasado una orden de los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades que exigía el uso de mascarilla en todas las formas de transporte público y comercial en Estados Unidos.\n\nMientras tanto, el gobernador del estado de Kentucky, Andy Beshear, y su familia se pondrán en cuarentena después de que un integrante de su equipo de seguridad diera positivo por COVID -19.\n\nEn el Capitolio de Washington, D. C., permanecen estancados los diálogos sobre un paquete de estímulos, ya que tanto los demócratas como los republicanos rechazaron una propuesta de la Casa Blanca para un plan de ayuda de 1,8 billones de dólares. El martes pasado, Trump tuiteó que suspendería las negociaciones sobre un paquete de estímulos hasta después del día de las elecciones, solo para retractarse de esa afirmación horas más tarde. Los demócratas argumentan que la última oferta de la Casa Blanca es \"insuficiente\", citando la escasez de fondos para las prestaciones por desempleo, el cuidado infantil y la asistencia a los Gobiernos estatales y locales. Los republicanos dicen que el proyecto de ley es demasiado costoso y se oponen a la expansión de la Ley de Protección al Paciente y Cuidado de Salud Asequible.\n\nEl lunes comenzaron las audiencias de confirmación de la candidata a la Corte Suprema, Amy Coney Barrett, en el Senado. En su discurso de apertura, que fue facilitado a la prensa con anterioridad al inicio de las audiencias, la jueza Barrett se compromete a \"hacer cumplir la ley tal y como está escrita\". Sin embargo, han surgido más pruebas de que Barrett ha abogado públicamente contra el derecho al aborto, lo que se ejemplifica con su apoyo a la revocación del caso Roe contra Wade, en el que la Corte Suprema determinó la legalización del aborto en Estados Unidos. El viernes, Barrett modificó su cuestionario del Senado para incluir información sobre las charlas que dio en el año 2013, mientras era profesora de Derecho en la Universidad de Notre Dame. Las charlas habían sido organizadas por grupos de estudiantes en contra del aborto. La jueza Barret también reveló que firmó un anuncio publicitario en un periódico en el año 2006 que promovía \"el fin del legado barbárico del caso Roe contra Wade\".\n\nEl segundo debate presidencial, que estaba programado para este jueves, fue cancelado luego de que Trump se negara a participar en un debate virtual, a pesar de su reciente diagnóstico de COVID -19. En su lugar, el candidato demócrata a la presidencia, Joe Biden, participará en una asamblea pública organizada por la cadena ABC News el jueves. El próximo y último debate presidencial está programado para el próximo jueves 22 de octubre.\n\nEn el estado de Carolina del Sur, el viernes, el debate programado entre el senador Lindsey Graham y su rival demócrata, Jaime Harrison, fue reemplazado por entrevistas individuales realizadas por separado después de que Harrison insistiera en que Graham se hiciera una prueba de coronavirus antes del debate y Graham se negara a hacerlo. Graham preside la Comisión de Asuntos Judiciales del Senado, que abrirá este lunes las audiencias de confirmación de la jueza Amy Coney Barrett. Estas fueron las palabras expresadas por Harrison sobre la situación del sistema de atención médica en Carolina del Sur en el foro de los candidatos del viernes.\n\nEl candidato Jaime Harrison dijo : \"Recuerdo haberme enterado sobre el coronavirus y tener escalofríos, porque sabía el impacto que tendría aquí en Carolina del Sur, y en particular, en las comunidades más vulnerables. Vivimos en un estado donde casi 250.000 personas no tienen acceso a la asistencia de salud porque somos uno de los 12 estados que se han negado a expandir Medicaid. Otros treinta y ocho estados han expandido Medicaid bajo la Ley de Protección al Paciente y Cuidado de Salud Asequible, pero Carolina del Sur no. Y como consecuencia, han cerrado cuatro de los hospitales rurales del estado\".\n\nMedicaid es un programa público de salud que garantiza el acceso a la atención sanitaria de forma gratuita o a bajo costo para millones de personas pobres y discapacitadas en Estados Unidos.\n\nEn otras noticias electorales de Estados Unidos, en el estado de Pensilvania, un juez federal rechazó una demanda de la campaña de Trump que pretendía eliminar urnas para la entrega de papeletas de voto por correo en ese estado, con el argumento de que no existen pruebas que indiquen que las urnas puedan facilitar que se cometa fraude electoral. El tribunal también rechazó varios intentos más de restringir la participación de votantes por parte de la campaña del presidente, que incluyeron una iniciativa para exigir la coincidencia de firmas para las papeletas de voto por correo.\n\nMientras tanto, en el estado de Texas, se desconoce qué ocurrirá con la directiva del gobernador Greg Abbott que limitaba los centros para la entrega de papeletas de voto por correo a solo uno por condado, luego de que un tribunal suspendiera el viernes el fallo de un juez que bloqueaba la medida de Abbott. Los defensores del derecho al voto argumentan que limitar la entrega de papeletas de voto por correo a un solo lugar no solo disminuirá la participación electoral, sino que también aumentará el riesgo de exposición al coronavirus durante la pandemia.\n\nAzerbaiyán lanzó ataques aéreos contra la capital del territorio en disputa de Nagorno-Karabaj, tras el incumplimiento del alto el fuego auspiciado por Rusia entre las fuerzas azeríes y armenias, menos de un día después de que se acordara el viernes. Armenia acusó a Azerbaiyán de atacar deliberadamente una catedral histórica, mientras que Azerbaiyán culpó a Armenia de bombardear una zona residencial en su segunda ciudad más grande, Ganja. Al menos 300 personas han muerto desde que estalló el combate en el territorio hace dos semanas.\n\nEn Nigeria, se abolió una controvertida unidad policial en respuesta a las manifestaciones masivas que exigían el desmantelamiento del Escuadrón Especial Antirrobo o SARS , por sus siglas en inglés. Videos recientes publicados en las redes sociales muestran a los agentes del escuadrón, que suelen estar vestidos de civil y no llevan identificación, atacando a personas con brutalidad. Aparentemente, en algunos casos los agentes habrían llegado a ejecutar a sus víctimas. No obstante, los activistas advierten que la simple reasignación de los agentes violentos no resolverá el problema de la brutalidad policial.\n\nEn Irak, grupos de milicias respaldadas por Irán aceptaron mantener un alto el fuego y suspender los ataques contra objetivos estadounidenses con la condición de que el gobierno iraquí presente un calendario para la retirada de las tropas estadounidenses del país. En septiembre, el Gobierno de Donald Trump amenazó con cerrar la embajada estadounidense en Bagdad tras una serie de ataques a blancos vinculados a Estados Unidos.\n\nEn otras noticias de Estados Unidos, una investigación del periódico The New York Times sobre el historial fiscal de Donald Trump indica que el presidente podría haber destinado parte de un préstamo de 30 millones de dólares que obtuvo del banco City National Bank en la ciudad de Los Ángeles para impulsar los decrecientes fondos de su campaña en las semanas previas a las elecciones de 2016. Los registros fiscales del presidente revelan más de 21 millones de dólares en pagos inusuales de un hotel de Las Vegas del que era copropietario, que fluyeron a través de otras de sus empresas y que Trump podría haber utilizado para \"autofinanciar\" su campaña. Es probable que dichos fondos constituyan contribuciones ilegales a su campaña política. Además, sería ilegal que Trump hubiera deducido impuestos de pagos que no son gastos comerciales reales.\n\nEn noticias relacionadas, la fiscal general de la ciudad de Nueva York, Letitia James, está investigando si la Organización Trump infló el valor de una propiedad del condado de Westchester para obtener una exención fiscal de 21 millones de dólares como parte de una servidumbre de conservación después de que el mandatario acordara preservar 60 hectáreas de bosques en el terreno.\n\nEl viernes, un tribunal federal de apelaciones dictaminó que el uso de poderes de emergencia por parte del presidente Trump en 2019 para desviar miles de millones de dólares de los fondos de construcción militar para erigir el muro fronterizo entre Estados Unidos y México es ilegal. Para obtener más información sobre el muro fronterizo de Trump, visite nuestro sitio web, democracynow.org/es , donde encontrará una entrevista con la activista indígena y defensora de la tierra y el agua Nellie Jo David con motivo de la celebración del Día de los Pueblos Indígenas en Estados Unidos, donde muchos estados y ciudades han decidido rechazar la conmemoración de la festividad del Día de Colón.\n\nEl huracán Delta mató al menos a una persona, dejó sin electricidad a cientos de miles de residentes y sumergió pueblos bajo el agua en su paso por el estado de Luisiana, solo seis semanas después de que el huracán Laura azotara la región. Delta es la décima tormenta del Atlántico que golpea el continente esta temporada.\n\nEl rapero y activista Killer Mike anunció que lanzará un banco digital llamado Greenwood, cuya propiedad estará en manos de personas afroestadounidenses, junto con el fundador de la cadena Bounce TV, Ryan Glover, y el exalcalde de Atlanta, Andrew Young. El banco virtual prestará servicios financieros a clientes negros y latinxs, y lleva el nombre del antiguo vecindario de Greenwood de la ciudad de Tulsa, en el estado de Oklahoma. Este próspero distrito comercial era conocido como el \"Wall Street negro\" de Estados Unidos y fue incendiado por una multitud de ciudadanos blancos en 1921. Killer Mike sostiene que Greenwood Bank, que abrirá en enero, recibió decenas de miles de solicitudes para la apertura de cuentas bancarias en el primer día tras el anuncio de su lanzamiento. Estas fueron las palabras pronunciadas por Andrew Young en una entrevista con Killer Mike sobre la desigualdad en la distribución de la riqueza.\n\nAndrew Young : \"Tenemos que poner el capital en la base de la pirámide, para que quienes tengan ideas brillantes que mejoren la vida de todos puedan desarrollar esas ideas\"."

      "text": "¿Un guerrero reacio a la guerra? Repasamos el sangriento legado de Colin Powell, de Irak a América Latina\n\nWatch/Listen/Read in English\n\nAnalizamos la vida y el legado de Colin Powell, conocido por su falso testimonio ante el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU en 2003, en el que mintió acerca de la existencia de armas de destrucción masiva en Irak. Su declaración allanó el camino para la invasión y ocupación estadounidense, que a lo largo de los años causaría la muerte de más de un millón de iraquíes. Powell, que fue el primer Secretario de Estado negro, el primer jefe del Estado Mayor Conjunto negro -además del más joven- y el primer asesor de Seguridad Nacional negro, falleció el 18 de octubre de un tipo de cáncer de la sangre y la enfermedad de Parkinson que lo hicieron vulnerable frente a la COVID 19. Ese mismo día, destacadas figuras estadounidenses, tanto republicanas como demócratas, realizaron numerosos homenajes en su honor. Sin embargo, en otras partes del mundo se recuerda a Powell de manera muy diferente. Hablamos con el periodista y escritor Roberto Lovato y con Clarence Lusane, activista, periodista y profesor de ciencias políticas en la Universidad de Howard. Lusane describe a Powell como \"una figura política complicada que deja un legado complicado\" cuya imagen pública estaba \"en conflicto con muchas de las políticas impulsadas por el partido al que apoyaba y el Gobierno del que formaba parte\". Al evaluar el papel de Powell en las invasiones estadounidenses a distintas partes del mundo, desde Vietnam hasta América Central, Lovato afirma que \"hizo carrera como buen soldado, apoyando las masacres estadounidenses en todo el mundo, pero eludiendo su responsabilidad en ellas\".\n\nAMY GOODMAN : El presidente Biden ordenó que las banderas de la Casa Blanca ondeen a media asta en honor al general Colin Powell, quien murió el lunes 11 de octubre a la edad de 84 años. Powell fue la primera persona negra en ser secretario de Estado de EE.UU., la primera persona negra y la más joven en desempeñarse como jefe del Estado Mayor Conjunto y la primera persona negra en ejercer de asesor de Seguridad Nacional. El lunes, Powell fue homenajeado tanto por los líderes republicanos como por los demócratas. El presidente Biden describió a Powell como un \"patriota de incomparable honor y dignidad\".\n\nSin embargo, en otras partes del mundo Powell es recordado de forma muy diferente. En Irak, el periodista Muntadhar al-Zaidi, que se hizo famoso por lanzarle un zapato al presidente George W. Bush, tuiteó que lamentaba que Powell hubiera muerto sin llegar a ser juzgado por sus crímenes en Irak. Mientras se desempeñaba como secretario de Estado de Bush, el general Powell jugó un papel fundamental en allanar el camino para la invasión estadounidense de Irak. El 5 de febrero de 2003, Powell habló frente al Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU y expuso las razones para iniciar un ataque preventivo contra Irak. El mensaje de Powell fue claro: Irak poseía armas de destrucción masiva de extrema peligrosidad y Saddam Hussein estaba sistemáticamente tratando de engañar a los inspectores de la ONU escondiendo las armas prohibidas.\n\nCOLIN POWELL : Una de las cosas más preocupantes que emerge de los extensos archivos de inteligencia que tenemos sobre las armas biológicas de Irak es la existencia de instalaciones de producción móviles para la fabricación de agentes biológicos. Déjenme mostrarles el contenido de ese archivo de inteligencia y compartir con ustedes la información proveniente de testigos presenciales. Tenemos descripciones de testigos directos de fábricas de armas biológicas sobre ruedas y rieles. Los camiones y vagones de tren son trasladados fácilmente y están diseñados para evitar ser detectados por los inspectores. En cuestión de meses esas fábricas pueden producir una cantidad de agentes biológicos similar a la cantidad total que Irak afirmó haber producido en los años anteriores a la Guerra del Golfo.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Todas las principales afirmaciones de Colin Powell sobre las armas de destrucción masiva resultaron ser falsas. Posteriormente, Powell describió ese discurso como una \"mancha\" en su historial. Pero el discurso de 2003 no fue la primera vez que el general Powell había alegado falsamente que Irak tenía armas de destrucción masiva. En 1991, durante la Guerra del Golfo Pérsico, Estados Unidos bombardeó la única fábrica de leche para bebés de Irak. En aquel momento, el general Powell afirmó: \"Ese lugar no es una fábrica de leche para bebés. [...] Era una fábrica de armas biológicas, de eso estamos seguros\". Pues bien, los investigadores de la ONU confirmaron después que la fábrica bombardeada era de hecho una fábrica de leche para bebés. Mientras que muchos en Irak consideran a Powell un criminal de guerra, al igual que a George W. Bush y Dick Cheney, en EE.UU. sus acciones han sido celebradas durante mucho tiempo. Colin Powell nació en Harlem en 1937. Sus padres eran ambos inmigrantes de Jamaica. Estudió en el sistema público, incluyendo el City College de Nueva York, y posteriormente se unió al Ejército a través del programa de reclutamiento ROTC . Estuvo desplegado dos veces en Vietnam. Más tarde fue acusado de ayudar a encubrir la masacre de My Lai, en la que soldados estadounidenses masacraron unos 500 civiles, la mayoría de ellos mujeres, niños y adultos mayores. Mientras investigaba un testimonio de un soldado sobre lo ocurrido, Powell escribió: \"En refutación directa de esta descripción está el hecho de que las relaciones entre los soldados estadounidenses y el pueblo vietnamita son excelentes\", declaró. Powell pasó 35 años en la fuerza armadas, ascendiendo hasta ocupar la jefatura del Estado Mayor Conjunto. En la década de 1980, Powell ayudó a delinear la política militar de EE.UU. en América Latina en una época en la que las fuerzas y grupos armados respaldados por EE.UU. mataron a cientos de miles de personas en El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala y otros países. Powell también ayudó a supervisar la invasión estadounidense de Panamá y la Guerra del Golfo Pérsico. Desde el año 2001 hasta 2005 Powell se desempeñó como secretario de Estado del Gobierno de George W. Bush. Tras trabajar bajo las órdenes de tres presidentes republicanos, Powell fue noticia en 2008 cuando respaldó la candidatura de Barack Obama a la presidencia a tan solo dos semanas de las elecciones. A principios de este año, tras la insurrección del 6 de enero en el Capitolio de EE.UU., Powell dijo que ya no se consideraba un republicano. El general Colin Powell murió el lunes 18 de octubre. Su familia dijo que murió por complicaciones relacionadas con la COVID -19. Powell estaba luchando contra el Parkinson y contra un mieloma múltiple, por lo que se encontraba severamente inmunodeprimido. Para hablar más sobre la vida y el legado de Powell nos acompañan dos invitados. Roberto Lovato, periodista galardonado y autor de \"Unforgetting\" (Inolvidable), unas memorias sobre familia, migraciones, pandillas criminales, y revoluciones en las Américas. Lobato ha seguido de cerca el historial del general Powell en Latinoamérica. También nos acompaña Clarence Lusane, profesor de la Universidad de Howard y autor de varios libros, entre ellos \"Colin Powell y Condoleezza Rice: política exterior, raza, y el nuevo siglo estadounidense\". Profesor Lusane, empecemos por usted. Háblenos del legado de Colin Powell.\n\nCLARENCE LUSANE : Gracias, Amy. Y gracias a sus otros invitados. Bueno, Powell deja un... Powell era una figura política complicada y se va dejando un legado complicado. Como se describió en la introducción, Powell ascendió desde lo más bajo y esa historia realmente cautivó a mucha gente. Powell creció en un entorno pobre o al menos de bajos ingresos de Nueva York y llegó a convertirse en el cuarto en la línea de sucesión presidencial, cuando llegó al cargo de secretario de Estado. A principios de la década de 1990, tanto el Partido Republicano como el Demócrata trataron de convencerlo para que se postulara para la presidencia. Rechazó la oferta en 1995. Y cuando la rechazó, anunció que iba a unirse al Partido Republicano. Ahora bien, el Partido Republicano al que se unió en 1995 era el de Newt Gingrich, y Powell parecía no encajar bien. Colin estaba a favor del aborto, de la acción afirmativa, de la inmigración, y del control de armas, y el Partido Republicano, tanto durante la época de Newt Gingrich como después, ha estado en contra de todo eso. Como usted dijo, Powell formó parte del Gobierno de George W. Bush, es más, fue la primera persona elegida por George W. Bush para formar parte de su gabinete, porque Powell era la persona con más peso y respeto internacional de todas las que rodeaban a George W. Bush. Pero realmente nunca encajó. En los primeros ocho o nueve meses de la presidencia de George W. Bush, Powell perdió una pelea tras otra cuando Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld y otros, los llamados neoconservadores, los neocon, estaban al mando del Gobierno. Y parecía bastante seguro que Powell no iba a aguantar hasta fin de año. Pero luego ocurrió el 11 de septiembre. Powell, el soldado siempre leal, decide quedarse, pero sigue muy aislado. Él mismo contó que básicamente lo veían como a un cartón de leche. Lo ponían en el refrigerador, y cuando lo necesitaban lo sacaban del estante, y luego lo volvían a meter. Lo sacaron del estante en 2003 para hablar en la ONU porque no había nadie más en ese Gobierno que pudiera captar la atención y ganarse el respeto, al menos de forma tardía. Colin Powell fue y dio ese discurso, que era totalmente falso. Pero Powell era el único miembro del Gobierno... Y, por supuesto, un año y medio después dejó su cargo. Pero Powell es una figura complicada porque por muchos motivos no encajaba en el Partido Republicano, a pesar de que no lo abandonó hasta este mismo año. Pero él y cualquier moderado, particularmente afroestadounidenses moderados, simplemente no tenían lugar en el Partido Republicano. Así que Powell apoyó a Obama, a Biden y a Hillary Clinton, o al menos votó por ellos. Así que en realidad él hace años que había abandonado el Partido Republicano. Pero no era realmente un demócrata o no era visto como un progresista, de nuevo, debido a una larga historia de agresiones internacionales, desde Reagan y los contras y toda las controversias de la política exterior de los 80, y luego durante la presidencia de Bush, que no solo incluye Irak sino también las políticas de Bush hacia Cuba, Venezuela, así como sus políticas en África, y todo eso hizo que Colin Powell estuviera cada vez más aislado de los sectores progresistas.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Me gustaría preguntarle sobre la necesidad tanto de los demócratas como de los republicanos de alabar y apoyar repetidamente a Powell, y, luego, como secretario de Estado y como una importante figura estadounidense, dado el hecho de que el Ejército de EE.UU., de entre todas las instituciones de la sociedad estadounidense, es la más racialmente diversa, creo que el Ejército de EE.UU. tiene alrededor de un 40% de personal de color. ¿Podría hablar sobre la importancia de Powell como figura, dados los datos demográficos y los cambios que ha experimentado el Ejército estadounidense?\n\nCLARENCE LUSANE : Gracias, Juan. Parte del capital político de Powell proviene precisamente del hecho de que él llega a lo más alto de una institución, una de las pocas, que parece no haberse visto manchada por la polarización partidista. Powell ascendió hasta llegar a la jefatura del Estado Mayor Conjunto. Powell no tiene una personalidad beligerante, algo que lamentablemente vemos cada vez más en las figuras militares y políticas, e incluso ejercía cierto activismo al abordar cuestiones de raza. El asunto es que cuando pensamos en conservadores afroestadounidenses que son cercanos o pertenecen al Partido Republicano, pensamos en gente como Clarence Thomas o Candace Owens. Pero ha habido conservadores afroestadounidenses que han tomado posiciones en apoyo de asuntos relacionados con la comunidad negra y han apoyado y tenido un rol activo en el movimiento de los derechos civiles. Powell encaja en ese grupo, y eso le dio algo de prestigio. Powell habló en mi graduación en la Universidad de Howard en 1994 y habló de racismo y de temas relacionados con el compromiso social. Algo que no vas a escuchar de prácticamente ningún republicano afroestadounidense actual. Así que eso le dio a Colin Powell una imagen pública diferente, que, repito, entraba en conflicto con muchas de las políticas del partido al que él apoyaba y del Gobierno del que formó parte.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Me gustaría también traer a la conversación a Roberto Lovato. Roberto, me preguntaba si podría hablar sobre... La gente se olvida de que durante la invasión de Panamá Colin Powell no solo fue una figura clave, sino que el secretario de Defensa en aquel momento era Dick Cheney.\n\nROBERTO LOVATO : Sí. Gracias, Juan y Amy. Me alegro de estar aquí de nuevo. La historia de Colin Powell en Centroamérica y en otras partes del mundo es lo que yo llamaría una trágica historia de militarismo al servicio de un imperio en declive. Y también fue una muestra de lo que yo llamo la época del imperio interseccional, sobre lo que Clarence ya habló un poco, y que tiene que ver con cómo se está usando la raza de forma consensuada por las élites militaristas de ambos partidos en EE.UU. Por lo tanto, cabe recordar que lo de Panamá ocurre justo después de otras intervenciones estadounidenses en Centroamérica, como en El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras y Nicaragua, y, a su vez, eso fue precedido por la guerra de Vietnam, cuando se vio un declive en la moral y las sensibilidades del Ejército de EE.UU., debido a la severa derrota sufrida en Vietnam. Y Powell fue parte de ese grupo de líderes que trataron de determinar cómo crear una actitud post-Vietnam para la maquinaria militar estadounidense. Pero quiero dejar claro que la doctrina de Powell, consistente en usar una fuerza abrumadora, lograr un apoyo social a las guerras de EE.UU., definir de forma clara los objetivos para la seguridad nacional y otras cosas que caracterizan lo que ellos llaman la doctrina Powell-Weinberger, sigue siendo parte de la política bélica de EE.UU. Así que la carrera política de Colin Powell fue una cosa en lo que respecta a temas raciales y a su posición a favor del aborto, pero por otro lado muy clara en relación al militarismo. En el barrio El Chorrillo, al que los taxistas de Panamá todavía llaman el \"pequeño Hiroshima\", cientos de personas murieron. Y aún se siguen excavando fosas comunes de la época de la invasión de Panamá. Recordemos que antes de eso Powell fue asistente del entonces secretario de Defensa durante la presidencia de Reagan, Caspar Weinberger, quien fue el encargado de la supervisión de la política militar en Centroamérica, donde, en lugar de involucrarse en lo que ellos llamaron una \"guerra asimétrica\" como lo hicieron en Vietnam y acabaron siendo vencidos, los militaristas, como Colin Powell, decidieron evitar ese tipo de guerra y luchar a través de alianzas con grupos armados locales, lo que les permitiría enfocarse en aumentar su capacidad para afrontar guerras militares entre países. Por lo tanto, la lucha contra Manuel Noriega, también librada bajo falsos pretextos, fue un adelanto y una preparación para la guerra entre países que posteriormente se libró en Kuwait e Irak.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Clarence Lusane, en el contexto de la invasión estadounidense de Panamá, que Powell encabezó, ¿puede hablar sobre las víctimas fatales en dicho país? No estamos hablando solo desde un enfoque abstracto o intelectual de las políticas estadounidenses.\n\nCLARENCE LUSANE : No, eso es correcto, como acaba de describirlo Ron [sic]. De hecho, yo fui a Panamá. Fui con otro reportero llamado Stan Woods, de Chicago. Llegamos después de la invasión y lo que vimos fue horrible. Como ya se mencionó, había fosas comunes. Había barrios totalmente destruidos. EE.UU. bombardeó los barrios pobres y eso hay que dejarlo claro. Los barrios ricos fueron meticulosamente evitados mientras se bombardeaban vecindarios que no solo habían sido activos políticamente sino que, en definitiva, eran representativos de la población del país. Fue una invasión horrible y Powell no dijo nada al respecto. Fue similar a otros operativos militares llevados a cabo por los Gobiernos de Bush y de Reagan. Powell guardó silencio sobre las consecuencias de estas intervenciones, sobre las miles y miles de personas que... Sí, cientos de miles de personas murieron en Irak, pero ciertamente miles de personas murieron en Panamá, Y nadie ha rendido cuentas por esa particularmente horrible invasión.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Y esa era en gran medida población negra de Panamá.\n\nCLARENCE LUSANE : Eran afropanameños, exactamente.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Roberto Lovato, hable un poco sobre los años anteriores a la invasión de Panamá. Explique el escándalo Irán-Contra y el papel del entonces general Powell. La invasión de Panamá se produjo durante el mandato de George H. W. Bush, mientras que el escándalo Irán-Contra sucedió cuando Bush era vicepresidente del Gobierno de Ronald Reagan. Hablamos del acuerdo ilegal de venta de armas a Irán, tras el cual se usó ese dinero para apoyar ilegalmente a los contras, algo que, en el momento, violó la Enmienda Boland, que establecía que EE.UU. no podía apoyar a los grupos contrarrevolucionarios en Nicaragua.\n\nROBERTO LOVATO : Hay que recordar que Powell era, como él mismo dijo, \"el principal promotor en el Gobierno\" a favor de los contras. EE.UU. patrocinó una insurgencia con el objetivo de derrocar al Gobierno sandinista nicaragüense. La organización Human Rights Watch y otras organizaciones alrededor del mundo han documentado decenas de miles de personas muertas, monjas violadas y menores destrozados por los contras. Colin Powell dijo luego textualmente que no se arrepentía del papel que desempeñó y que además luchó bastante para obtener apoyo para los contras. Como asesor militar de Caspar Weinberger, Powell tenía acceso a información sobre el acuerdo para intercambiar armas por rehenes y para financiar a los contras, pero pudo evadir cualquier acción legal, a diferencia de Weinberger, quien fue acusado y condenado, y luego, creo, perdonado gracias al cabildeo por parte de Colin Powell. Así que Powell demostró ser hábil no solo en cuanto a, de alguna forma, ayudar en la restructuración del Ejército tras la guerra de Vietnam, sino también al evadir cualquier juicio a nivel político, como vimos tras la masacre de My Lai y tras el escándalo Irán-Contra. Así que esa idea de que la única, entre comillas, \"mancha\" en su historial son las mentiras acerca de Irak es una farsa, porque Powell basó su carrera en ser un buen soldado y apoyar las masacres cometidas por EE.UU. en el mundo sin que se le señalara por ello. Eso es todo en cuanto al tema.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Sí. Roberto, ¿podría hablar un poco sobre, por ejemplo, el legado de Powell en cuanto a la dotación de armas y entrenamiento al Ejército salvadoreño, además de su relación con José Napoleón Duarte, quien era el presidente de El Salvador en la década de 1980?\n\nROBERTO LOVATO : Sí. Powell fue uno de los designados por el Gobierno de Reagan para los asuntos relacionados con Centroamérica y, como tal, ayudó a orquestar y luego legitimar, cuando fue necesario, las dictaduras militares salvadoreñas y los Ejércitos de Guatemala y de otros países de la región que fueron responsables de las muertes de cientos de miles de inocentes. En el caso de Guatemala, fueron unos 200.000 o más, en su mayoría indígenas mayas. En 1983, por ejemplo, Powell hizo parte de una especie de misión de evaluación, que incluía a Jeane Kirkpatrick y a Weinberger, con la que visitó El Salvador para confirmar si el Gobierno y el Ejército de ese país estaban haciendo lo correcto bajo el mando de Duarte. Efectivamente concluyeron que sí estaban haciendo lo correcto y que EE.UU. debía seguir financiando fuertemente y entrenando a estos militares homicidas. Powell nunca dijo nada sobre el hecho de que solo un año antes y un par de años antes, la masacre del Sumpul, en la que unas 600 personas fueron asesinadas, fue perpetrada por el Gobierno salvadoreño con el respaldo de EE.UU., ni sobre que en la masacre de El Mozote, en la que mil personas murieron y un pueblo entero fue arrasado, la mitad de las víctimas eran menores de 12 años y la mitad de ellas eran menores de 6 años. Colin Powell parecía no tener memoria de eso, al igual que Elliott Abrams, otro criminal de guerra en mi opinión. También se ignoró por completo la masacre de El Calabozo, entre otras. Entonces, vemos que Powell desempeñó un papel en Centroamérica a través de los años, desde principios de los 80 hasta el final de la guerra. También sabemos que él era muy sofisticado e inteligente en su forma de adaptarse a los tiempos, así que si una situación requería adoptar una línea dura, como en los inicios de la era Reagan, él estaba allí. Otro ejemplo es el de 1989, cuando la guerrilla del FMLN lanzamos una ofensiva contra la capital, San Salvador, básicamente para demostrarle al Gobierno de EE.UU. y al Gobierno salvadoreño, al cual EE.UU. apoyaba, que no podrían vencer a la guerrilla del FMLN . Y eso funcionó. La ofensiva demostró que la guerrilla podía entrar en la capital y luchar en sus propios términos. Al ver esto, Powell y el Gobierno de Bush dieron un giro en su postura y presionaron al Gobierno salvadoreño a buscar un acuerdo de paz. Ahora bien, algunos historiadores dirán que Powell era casi un pacifista, un liberal, lo cual, si se le compara con Alexander Haig por ejemplo, u otros completos fascistas, tal vez sí. Pero en el esquema más amplio del imperialismo y militarismo, Colin Powell fue siempre un miembro leal al imperio asesino.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Veamos un extracto del discurso de Colin Powell en 2003 ante la ONU , en el que acusó falsamente a Irak de poseer armas de destrucción masiva.\n\nSECRETARIO DE ESTADO COLIN POWELL : Cada declaración que hoy doy está respaldada por fuentes, fuentes sólidas. Estas no son aserciones. Lo que estamos presentando son hechos y conclusiones basadas en sólidas informaciones de inteligencia.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Todas las principales afirmaciones del general Powell sobre las armas de destrucción masiva resultaron ser falsas. Pero en ese momento, la mayoría de los medios confiaron en su palabra. La invasión de Irak comenzó seis semanas después de que pronunciara ese discurso en la ONU . El mismo Powell reconoció que ese sería el final para muchos, porque él se había autodeclarado un \"guerrero reacio [a la guerra]\". Powell había apoyado la guerra sin estar totalmente convencido y el presidente Bush quería que ese apoyo fuera la voz y la imagen de dicha guerra. En 2013, Democracy Now! entrevistó al coronel Lawrence Wilkerson, quien trabajó como jefe de personal del secretario de Estado Colin Powell de 2002 a 2005. Wilkerson ayudó a preparar aquel discurso de Powell ante la ONU , el cual este último repudiaría más tarde. Wilkerson dijo que el propio Powell no confiaba mucho en los informes de inteligencia y quería borrar del discurso cualquier referencia a los vínculos entre al-Qaeda y Saddam Hussein.\n\nLAWRENCE WILKERSON : El momento trascendental fue cuando estábamos en Langley y Colin Powell estaba preparándose para sacar todo lo que tuviera que ver con terrorismo de su presentación, en particular, contactos sustanciales entre Bagdad y al-Qaeda. Estaba realmente enojado. Me llevó a un cuarto en privado y prácticamente me atacó al respecto. Yo le dije: \"Jefe, quitemos eso. Tengo tantas dudas sobre ello como usted. Saquemos eso del discurso\". Así que allí mismo tomamos la decisión de sacarlo. Media hora después de que el secretario Powell tomara esa decisión y me indicara que lo hiciera, George Tenet apareció con una noticia bomba. La noticia era que un importante agente de al-Qaeda había revelado, bajo interrogatorio, contactos sustanciales entre al-Qaeda y Bagdad.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Acabamos de escuchar al jefe de personal del ex secretario de Estado Colin Powell, el coronel retirado del Ejército Lawrence Wilkerson. En 2009, Sam Husseini, de la organización sin ánimo de lucro Institute for Public Accuracy, le preguntó a Colin Powell sobre las afirmaciones infundadas que hizo durante su discurso en la ONU , que se basó en parte en informaciones falsas proporcionadas por prisioneros que habían sido torturados.\n\nSAM HUSSEINI : General, ¿puede hablar del caso de al-Libi y del vínculo entre las torturas y la obtención de pruebas para justificar la guerra a través de esas torturas?\n\nCOLIN POWELL : No tengo ninguna información sobre el caso de al-Libi.\n\nSAM HUSSEINI : ¿Puede decirnos cuándo se enteró de que algunas de las pruebas que presentó en su discurso ante la ONU fueron obtenidas bajo tortura? ¿Cuándo se enteró de eso?\n\nCOLIN POWELL : No lo sé. No sé a qué información se refiere, por lo tanto no puedo contestar.\n\nSAM HUSSEINI : Su jefe de personal, Wilkerson, ha escrito sobre esto.\n\nCOLIN POWELL : ¿Y qué? [inaudible] al señor Wilkerson.\n\nSAM HUSSEINI : Uno esperaría que usted supiera eso.\n\nCOLIN POWELL : La información que presenté ante la ONU fue examinada por la CIA . Cada palabra provino de la CIA . Y ellos defendieron toda esa información. No tengo conocimiento de que ninguno de ellos creyera que hubo torturas. No es un hecho que yo conozca. Hay mucha especulación, en particular por parte de quienes nunca asistieron a esas reuniones. Pero no tengo conocimiento de eso.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Clarence Lusane, quiero darle la última palabra. Seguimos hablando de ese discurso, que más tarde Powell calificaría como una \"mancha\" en su carrera.\n\nCLARENCE LUSANE : Hay que recordar que en esa época toda la comunidad internacional se oponía a la invasión. Y cuando Colin Powell y el Gobierno de Bush dijeron que estaban examinando esa información, no solo no estaban escuchando a sus aliados, sino que estaban ignorando lo que la propia ONU estaba haciendo. Básicamente, la ONU había comprobado que no había armas de destrucción masiva. Pero el Gobierno de EE.UU. estaba decidido a ir a la guerra, y Colin Powell básicamente accedió a eso, al igual que lo hizo antes de ese discurso, cuando en la Conferencia Mundial contra el Racismo Estados Unidos e Israel fueron los únicos dos países que se retiraron, y al igual que lo hizo después de la invasión a Irak en relación con otras políticas del Gobierno de George W. Bush, hasta finalmente ser forzado a dimitir. Por lo tanto, ese historial debe ser tenido en cuenta. No hay forma de embellecerlo. Fue algo atroz. Y, de nuevo, cientos de miles, y según algunas estimaciones, hasta un millón de personas murieron como resultado de esa guerra.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Y miles de tropas estadounidenses permanecen aún en Irak.

Powell, que fue el primer Secretario de Estado negro, el primer jefe del Estado Mayor Conjunto negro -además del más joven- y el primer asesor de Seguridad Nacional negro, falleció el 18 de octubre de un tipo de cáncer de la sangre y la enfermedad de Parkinson que lo hicieron vulnerable frente a la COVID 19. Ese mismo día, destacadas figuras estadounidenses, tanto republicanas como demócratas, realizaron numerosos homenajes en su honor. Sin embargo, en otras partes del mundo se recuerda a Powell de manera muy diferente. Hablamos con el periodista y escritor Roberto Lovato y con Clarence Lusane, activista, periodista y profesor de ciencias políticas en la Universidad de Howard. Lusane describe a Powell como \"una figura política complicada que deja un legado complicado\" cuya imagen pública estaba \"en conflicto con muchas de las políticas impulsadas por el partido al que apoyaba y el Gobierno del que formaba parte\". Al evaluar el papel de Powell en las invasiones estadounidenses a distintas partes del mundo, desde Vietnam hasta América Central, Lovato afirma que \"hizo carrera como buen soldado, apoyando las masacres estadounidenses en todo el mundo, pero eludiendo su responsabilidad en ellas\".\n\nAMY GOODMAN : El presidente Biden ordenó que las banderas de la Casa Blanca ondeen a media asta en honor al general Colin Powell, quien murió el lunes 11 de octubre a la edad de 84 años. Powell fue la primera persona negra en ser secretario de Estado de EE.UU., la primera persona negra y la más joven en desempeñarse como jefe del Estado Mayor Conjunto y la primera persona negra en ejercer de asesor de Seguridad Nacional. El lunes, Powell fue homenajeado tanto por los líderes republicanos como por los demócratas. El presidente Biden describió a Powell como un \"patriota de incomparable honor y dignidad\".\n\nSin embargo, en otras partes del mundo Powell es recordado de forma muy diferente. En Irak, el periodista Muntadhar al-Zaidi, que se hizo famoso por lanzarle un zapato al presidente George W. Bush, tuiteó que lamentaba que Powell hubiera muerto sin llegar a ser juzgado por sus crímenes en Irak. Mientras se desempeñaba como secretario de Estado de Bush, el general Powell jugó un papel fundamental en allanar el camino para la invasión estadounidense de Irak. El 5 de febrero de 2003, Powell habló frente al Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU y expuso las razones para iniciar un ataque preventivo contra Irak. El mensaje de Powell fue claro: Irak poseía armas de destrucción masiva de extrema peligrosidad y Saddam Hussein estaba sistemáticamente tratando de engañar a los inspectores de la ONU escondiendo las armas prohibidas.\n\nCOLIN POWELL : Una de las cosas más preocupantes que emerge de los extensos archivos de inteligencia que tenemos sobre las armas biológicas de Irak es la existencia de instalaciones de producción móviles para la fabricación de agentes biológicos. Déjenme mostrarles el contenido de ese archivo de inteligencia y compartir con ustedes la información proveniente de testigos presenciales. Tenemos descripciones de testigos directos de fábricas de armas biológicas sobre ruedas y rieles. Los camiones y vagones de tren son trasladados fácilmente y están diseñados para evitar ser detectados por los inspectores. En cuestión de meses esas fábricas pueden producir una cantidad de agentes biológicos similar a la cantidad total que Irak afirmó haber producido en los años anteriores a la Guerra del Golfo.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Todas las principales afirmaciones de Colin Powell sobre las armas de destrucción masiva resultaron ser falsas. Posteriormente, Powell describió ese discurso como una \"mancha\" en su historial. Pero el discurso de 2003 no fue la primera vez que el general Powell había alegado falsamente que Irak tenía armas de destrucción masiva. En 1991, durante la Guerra del Golfo Pérsico, Estados Unidos bombardeó la única fábrica de leche para bebés de Irak. En aquel momento, el general Powell afirmó: \"Ese lugar no es una fábrica de leche para bebés. [...] Era una fábrica de armas biológicas, de eso estamos seguros\". Pues bien, los investigadores de la ONU confirmaron después que la fábrica bombardeada era de hecho una fábrica de leche para bebés. Mientras que muchos en Irak consideran a Powell un criminal de guerra, al igual que a George W. Bush y Dick Cheney, en EE.UU. sus acciones han sido celebradas durante mucho tiempo. Colin Powell nació en Harlem en 1937. Sus padres eran ambos inmigrantes de Jamaica. Estudió en el sistema público, incluyendo el City College de Nueva York, y posteriormente se unió al Ejército a través del programa de reclutamiento ROTC . Estuvo desplegado dos veces en Vietnam. Más tarde fue acusado de ayudar a encubrir la masacre de My Lai, en la que soldados estadounidenses masacraron unos 500 civiles, la mayoría de ellos mujeres, niños y adultos mayores. Mientras investigaba un testimonio de un soldado sobre lo ocurrido, Powell escribió: \"En refutación directa de esta descripción está el hecho de que las relaciones entre los soldados estadounidenses y el pueblo vietnamita son excelentes\", declaró. Powell pasó 35 años en la fuerza armadas, ascendiendo hasta ocupar la jefatura del Estado Mayor Conjunto. En la década de 1980, Powell ayudó a delinear la política militar de EE.UU. en América Latina en una época en la que las fuerzas y grupos armados respaldados por EE.UU. mataron a cientos de miles de personas en El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala y otros países. Powell también ayudó a supervisar la invasión estadounidense de Panamá y la Guerra del Golfo Pérsico. Desde el año 2001 hasta 2005 Powell se desempeñó como secretario de Estado del Gobierno de George W. Bush. Tras trabajar bajo las órdenes de tres presidentes republicanos, Powell fue noticia en 2008 cuando respaldó la candidatura de Barack Obama a la presidencia a tan solo dos semanas de las elecciones. A principios de este año, tras la insurrección del 6 de enero en el Capitolio de EE.UU., Powell dijo que ya no se consideraba un republicano. El general Colin Powell murió el lunes 18 de octubre. Su familia dijo que murió por complicaciones relacionadas con la COVID -19. Powell estaba luchando contra el Parkinson y contra un mieloma múltiple, por lo que se encontraba severamente inmunodeprimido. Para hablar más sobre la vida y el legado de Powell nos acompañan dos invitados. Roberto Lovato, periodista galardonado y autor de \"Unforgetting\" (Inolvidable), unas memorias sobre familia, migraciones, pandillas criminales, y revoluciones en las Américas. Lobato ha seguido de cerca el historial del general Powell en Latinoamérica. También nos acompaña Clarence Lusane, profesor de la Universidad de Howard y autor de varios libros, entre ellos \"Colin Powell y Condoleezza Rice: política exterior, raza, y el nuevo siglo estadounidense\". Profesor Lusane, empecemos por usted. Háblenos del legado de Colin Powell.\n\nCLARENCE LUSANE : Gracias, Amy. Y gracias a sus otros invitados. Bueno, Powell deja un... Powell era una figura política complicada y se va dejando un legado complicado. Como se describió en la introducción, Powell ascendió desde lo más bajo y esa historia realmente cautivó a mucha gente. Powell creció en un entorno pobre o al menos de bajos ingresos de Nueva York y llegó a convertirse en el cuarto en la línea de sucesión presidencial, cuando llegó al cargo de secretario de Estado. A principios de la década de 1990, tanto el Partido Republicano como el Demócrata trataron de convencerlo para que se postulara para la presidencia. Rechazó la oferta en 1995. Y cuando la rechazó, anunció que iba a unirse al Partido Republicano. Ahora bien, el Partido Republicano al que se unió en 1995 era el de Newt Gingrich, y Powell parecía no encajar bien. Colin estaba a favor del aborto, de la acción afirmativa, de la inmigración, y del control de armas, y el Partido Republicano, tanto durante la época de Newt Gingrich como después, ha estado en contra de todo eso. Como usted dijo, Powell formó parte del Gobierno de George W. Bush, es más, fue la primera persona elegida por George W. Bush para formar parte de su gabinete, porque Powell era la persona con más peso y respeto internacional de todas las que rodeaban a George W. Bush. Pero realmente nunca encajó. En los primeros ocho o nueve meses de la presidencia de George W. Bush, Powell perdió una pelea tras otra cuando Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld y otros, los llamados neoconservadores, los neocon, estaban al mando del Gobierno. Y parecía bastante seguro que Powell no iba a aguantar hasta fin de año. Pero luego ocurrió el 11 de septiembre. Powell, el soldado siempre leal, decide quedarse, pero sigue muy aislado. Él mismo contó que básicamente lo veían como a un cartón de leche. Lo ponían en el refrigerador, y cuando lo necesitaban lo sacaban del estante, y luego lo volvían a meter. Lo sacaron del estante en 2003 para hablar en la ONU porque no había nadie más en ese Gobierno que pudiera captar la atención y ganarse el respeto, al menos de forma tardía. Colin Powell fue y dio ese discurso, que era totalmente falso. Pero Powell era el único miembro del Gobierno... Y, por supuesto, un año y medio después dejó su cargo. Pero Powell es una figura complicada porque por muchos motivos no encajaba en el Partido Republicano, a pesar de que no lo abandonó hasta este mismo año. Pero él y cualquier moderado, particularmente afroestadounidenses moderados, simplemente no tenían lugar en el Partido Republicano. Así que Powell apoyó a Obama, a Biden y a Hillary Clinton, o al menos votó por ellos. Así que en realidad él hace años que había abandonado el Partido Republicano. Pero no era realmente un demócrata o no era visto como un progresista, de nuevo, debido a una larga historia de agresiones internacionales, desde Reagan y los contras y toda las controversias de la política exterior de los 80, y luego durante la presidencia de Bush, que no solo incluye Irak sino también las políticas de Bush hacia Cuba, Venezuela, así como sus políticas en África, y todo eso hizo que Colin Powell estuviera cada vez más aislado de los sectores progresistas.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Me gustaría preguntarle sobre la necesidad tanto de los demócratas como de los republicanos de alabar y apoyar repetidamente a Powell, y, luego, como secretario de Estado y como una importante figura estadounidense, dado el hecho de que el Ejército de EE.UU., de entre todas las instituciones de la sociedad estadounidense, es la más racialmente diversa, creo que el Ejército de EE.UU. tiene alrededor de un 40% de personal de color. ¿Podría hablar sobre la importancia de Powell como figura, dados los datos demográficos y los cambios que ha experimentado el Ejército estadounidense?\n\nCLARENCE LUSANE : Gracias, Juan. Parte del capital político de Powell proviene precisamente del hecho de que él llega a lo más alto de una institución, una de las pocas, que parece no haberse visto manchada por la polarización partidista. Powell ascendió hasta llegar a la jefatura del Estado Mayor Conjunto. Powell no tiene una personalidad beligerante, algo que lamentablemente vemos cada vez más en las figuras militares y políticas, e incluso ejercía cierto activismo al abordar cuestiones de raza. El asunto es que cuando pensamos en conservadores afroestadounidenses que son cercanos o pertenecen al Partido Republicano, pensamos en gente como Clarence Thomas o Candace Owens. Pero ha habido conservadores afroestadounidenses que han tomado posiciones en apoyo de asuntos relacionados con la comunidad negra y han apoyado y tenido un rol activo en el movimiento de los derechos civiles. Powell encaja en ese grupo, y eso le dio algo de prestigio. Powell habló en mi graduación en la Universidad de Howard en 1994 y habló de racismo y de temas relacionados con el compromiso social. Algo que no vas a escuchar de prácticamente ningún republicano afroestadounidense actual. Así que eso le dio a Colin Powell una imagen pública diferente, que, repito, entraba en conflicto con muchas de las políticas del partido al que él apoyaba y del Gobierno del que formó parte.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Me gustaría también traer a la conversación a Roberto Lovato. Roberto, me preguntaba si podría hablar sobre... La gente se olvida de que durante la invasión de Panamá Colin Powell no solo fue una figura clave, sino que el secretario de Defensa en aquel momento era Dick Cheney.\n\nROBERTO LOVATO : Sí. Gracias, Juan y Amy. Me alegro de estar aquí de nuevo. La historia de Colin Powell en Centroamérica y en otras partes del mundo es lo que yo llamaría una trágica historia de militarismo al servicio de un imperio en declive. Y también fue una muestra de lo que yo llamo la época del imperio interseccional, sobre lo que Clarence ya habló un poco, y que tiene que ver con cómo se está usando la raza de forma consensuada por las élites militaristas de ambos partidos en EE.UU. Por lo tanto, cabe recordar que lo de Panamá ocurre justo después de otras intervenciones estadounidenses en Centroamérica, como en El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras y Nicaragua, y, a su vez, eso fue precedido por la guerra de Vietnam, cuando se vio un declive en la moral y las sensibilidades del Ejército de EE.UU., debido a la severa derrota sufrida en Vietnam. Y Powell fue parte de ese grupo de líderes que trataron de determinar cómo crear una actitud post-Vietnam para la maquinaria militar estadounidense. Pero quiero dejar claro que la doctrina de Powell, consistente en usar una fuerza abrumadora, lograr un apoyo social a las guerras de EE.UU., definir de forma clara los objetivos para la seguridad nacional y otras cosas que caracterizan lo que ellos llaman la doctrina Powell-Weinberger, sigue siendo parte de la política bélica de EE.UU. Así que la carrera política de Colin Powell fue una cosa en lo que respecta a temas raciales y a su posición a favor del aborto, pero por otro lado muy clara en relación al militarismo. En el barrio El Chorrillo, al que los taxistas de Panamá todavía llaman el \"pequeño Hiroshima\", cientos de personas murieron. Y aún se siguen excavando fosas comunes de la época de la invasión de Panamá. Recordemos que antes de eso Powell fue asistente del entonces secretario de Defensa durante la presidencia de Reagan, Caspar Weinberger, quien fue el encargado de la supervisión de la política militar en Centroamérica, donde, en lugar de involucrarse en lo que ellos llamaron una \"guerra asimétrica\" como lo hicieron en Vietnam y acabaron siendo vencidos, los militaristas, como Colin Powell, decidieron evitar ese tipo de guerra y luchar a través de alianzas con grupos armados locales, lo que les permitiría enfocarse en aumentar su capacidad para afrontar guerras militares entre países. Por lo tanto, la lucha contra Manuel Noriega, también librada bajo falsos pretextos, fue un adelanto y una preparación para la guerra entre países que posteriormente se libró en Kuwait e Irak.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Clarence Lusane, en el contexto de la invasión estadounidense de Panamá, que Powell encabezó, ¿puede hablar sobre las víctimas fatales en dicho país? No estamos hablando solo desde un enfoque abstracto o intelectual de las políticas estadounidenses.\n\nCLARENCE LUSANE : No, eso es correcto, como acaba de describirlo Ron [sic]. De hecho, yo fui a Panamá. Fui con otro reportero llamado Stan Woods, de Chicago. Llegamos después de la invasión y lo que vimos fue horrible. Como ya se mencionó, había fosas comunes. Había barrios totalmente destruidos. EE.UU. bombardeó los barrios pobres y eso hay que dejarlo claro. Los barrios ricos fueron meticulosamente evitados mientras se bombardeaban vecindarios que no solo habían sido activos políticamente sino que, en definitiva, eran representativos de la población del país. Fue una invasión horrible y Powell no dijo nada al respecto. Fue similar a otros operativos militares llevados a cabo por los Gobiernos de Bush y de Reagan. Powell guardó silencio sobre las consecuencias de estas intervenciones, sobre las miles y miles de personas que... Sí, cientos de miles de personas murieron en Irak, pero ciertamente miles de personas murieron en Panamá, Y nadie ha rendido cuentas por esa particularmente horrible invasión.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Y esa era en gran medida población negra de Panamá.\n\nCLARENCE LUSANE : Eran afropanameños, exactamente.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Roberto Lovato, hable un poco sobre los años anteriores a la invasión de Panamá. Explique el escándalo Irán-Contra y el papel del entonces general Powell. La invasión de Panamá se produjo durante el mandato de George H. W. Bush, mientras que el escándalo Irán-Contra sucedió cuando Bush era vicepresidente del Gobierno de Ronald Reagan. Hablamos del acuerdo ilegal de venta de armas a Irán, tras el cual se usó ese dinero para apoyar ilegalmente a los contras, algo que, en el momento, violó la Enmienda Boland, que establecía que EE.UU. no podía apoyar a los grupos contrarrevolucionarios en Nicaragua.\n\nROBERTO LOVATO : Hay que recordar que Powell era, como él mismo dijo, \"el principal promotor en el Gobierno\" a favor de los contras. EE.UU. patrocinó una insurgencia con el objetivo de derrocar al Gobierno sandinista nicaragüense. La organización Human Rights Watch y otras organizaciones alrededor del mundo han documentado decenas de miles de personas muertas, monjas violadas y menores destrozados por los contras. Colin Powell dijo luego textualmente que no se arrepentía del papel que desempeñó y que además luchó bastante para obtener apoyo para los contras. Como asesor militar de Caspar Weinberger, Powell tenía acceso a información sobre el acuerdo para intercambiar armas por rehenes y para financiar a los contras, pero pudo evadir cualquier acción legal, a diferencia de Weinberger, quien fue acusado y condenado, y luego, creo, perdonado gracias al cabildeo por parte de Colin Powell. Así que Powell demostró ser hábil no solo en cuanto a, de alguna forma, ayudar en la restructuración del Ejército tras la guerra de Vietnam, sino también al evadir cualquier juicio a nivel político, como vimos tras la masacre de My Lai y tras el escándalo Irán-Contra. Así que esa idea de que la única, entre comillas, \"mancha\" en su historial son las mentiras acerca de Irak es una farsa, porque Powell basó su carrera en ser un buen soldado y apoyar las masacres cometidas por EE.UU. en el mundo sin que se le señalara por ello. Eso es todo en cuanto al tema.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Sí. Roberto, ¿podría hablar un poco sobre, por ejemplo, el legado de Powell en cuanto a la dotación de armas y entrenamiento al Ejército salvadoreño, además de su relación con José Napoleón Duarte, quien era el presidente de El Salvador en la década de 1980?\n\nROBERTO LOVATO : Sí. Powell fue uno de los designados por el Gobierno de Reagan para los asuntos relacionados con Centroamérica y, como tal, ayudó a orquestar y luego legitimar, cuando fue necesario, las dictaduras militares salvadoreñas y los Ejércitos de Guatemala y de otros países de la región que fueron responsables de las muertes de cientos de miles de inocentes. En el caso de Guatemala, fueron unos 200.000 o más, en su mayoría indígenas mayas. En 1983, por ejemplo, Powell hizo parte de una especie de misión de evaluación, que incluía a Jeane Kirkpatrick y a Weinberger, con la que visitó El Salvador para confirmar si el Gobierno y el Ejército de ese país estaban haciendo lo correcto bajo el mando de Duarte. Efectivamente concluyeron que sí estaban haciendo lo correcto y que EE.UU. debía seguir financiando fuertemente y entrenando a estos militares homicidas. Powell nunca dijo nada sobre el hecho de que solo un año antes y un par de años antes, la masacre del Sumpul, en la que unas 600 personas fueron asesinadas, fue perpetrada por el Gobierno salvadoreño con el respaldo de EE.UU., ni sobre que en la masacre de El Mozote, en la que mil personas murieron y un pueblo entero fue arrasado, la mitad de las víctimas eran menores de 12 años y la mitad de ellas eran menores de 6 años. Colin Powell parecía no tener memoria de eso, al igual que Elliott Abrams, otro criminal de guerra en mi opinión. También se ignoró por completo la masacre de El Calabozo, entre otras. Entonces, vemos que Powell desempeñó un papel en Centroamérica a través de los años, desde principios de los 80 hasta el final de la guerra. También sabemos que él era muy sofisticado e inteligente en su forma de adaptarse a los tiempos, así que si una situación requería adoptar una línea dura, como en los inicios de la era Reagan, él estaba allí. Otro ejemplo es el de 1989, cuando la guerrilla del FMLN lanzamos una ofensiva contra la capital, San Salvador, básicamente para demostrarle al Gobierno de EE.UU. y al Gobierno salvadoreño, al cual EE.UU. apoyaba, que no podrían vencer a la guerrilla del FMLN . Y eso funcionó. La ofensiva demostró que la guerrilla podía entrar en la capital y luchar en sus propios términos. Al ver esto, Powell y el Gobierno de Bush dieron un giro en su postura y presionaron al Gobierno salvadoreño a buscar un acuerdo de paz. Ahora bien, algunos historiadores dirán que Powell era casi un pacifista, un liberal, lo cual, si se le compara con Alexander Haig por ejemplo, u otros completos fascistas, tal vez sí. Pero en el esquema más amplio del imperialismo y militarismo, Colin Powell fue siempre un miembro leal al imperio asesino.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Veamos un extracto del discurso de Colin Powell en 2003 ante la ONU , en el que acusó falsamente a Irak de poseer armas de destrucción masiva.\n\nSECRETARIO DE ESTADO COLIN POWELL : Cada declaración que hoy doy está respaldada por fuentes, fuentes sólidas. Estas no son aserciones. Lo que estamos presentando son hechos y conclusiones basadas en sólidas informaciones de inteligencia.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Todas las principales afirmaciones del general Powell sobre las armas de destrucción masiva resultaron ser falsas. Pero en ese momento, la mayoría de los medios confiaron en su palabra. La invasión de Irak comenzó seis semanas después de que pronunciara ese discurso en la ONU . El mismo Powell reconoció que ese sería el final para muchos, porque él se había autodeclarado un \"guerrero reacio [a la guerra]\". Powell había apoyado la guerra sin estar totalmente convencido y el presidente Bush quería que ese apoyo fuera la voz y la imagen de dicha guerra. En 2013, Democracy Now! entrevistó al coronel Lawrence Wilkerson, quien trabajó como jefe de personal del secretario de Estado Colin Powell de 2002 a 2005. Wilkerson ayudó a preparar aquel discurso de Powell ante la ONU , el cual este último repudiaría más tarde. Wilkerson dijo que el propio Powell no confiaba mucho en los informes de inteligencia y quería borrar del discurso cualquier referencia a los vínculos entre al-Qaeda y Saddam Hussein.\n\nLAWRENCE WILKERSON : El momento trascendental fue cuando estábamos en Langley y Colin Powell estaba preparándose para sacar todo lo que tuviera que ver con terrorismo de su presentación, en particular, contactos sustanciales entre Bagdad y al-Qaeda. Estaba realmente enojado. Me llevó a un cuarto en privado y prácticamente me atacó al respecto. Yo le dije: \"Jefe, quitemos eso. Tengo tantas dudas sobre ello como usted. Saquemos eso del discurso\". Así que allí mismo tomamos la decisión de sacarlo. Media hora después de que el secretario Powell tomara esa decisión y me indicara que lo hiciera, George Tenet apareció con una noticia bomba. La noticia era que un importante agente de al-Qaeda había revelado, bajo interrogatorio, contactos sustanciales entre al-Qaeda y Bagdad.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Acabamos de escuchar al jefe de personal del ex secretario de Estado Colin Powell, el coronel retirado del Ejército Lawrence Wilkerson. En 2009, Sam Husseini, de la organización sin ánimo de lucro Institute for Public Accuracy, le preguntó a Colin Powell sobre las afirmaciones infundadas que hizo durante su discurso en la ONU , que se basó en parte en informaciones falsas proporcionadas por prisioneros que habían sido torturados.\n\nSAM HUSSEINI : General, ¿puede hablar del caso de al-Libi y del vínculo entre las torturas y la obtención de pruebas para justificar la guerra a través de esas torturas?\n\nCOLIN POWELL : No tengo ninguna información sobre el caso de al-Libi.\n\nSAM HUSSEINI : ¿Puede decirnos cuándo se enteró de que algunas de las pruebas que presentó en su discurso ante la ONU fueron obtenidas bajo tortura? ¿Cuándo se enteró de eso?\n\nCOLIN POWELL : No lo sé. No sé a qué información se refiere, por lo tanto no puedo contestar.\n\nSAM HUSSEINI : Su jefe de personal, Wilkerson, ha escrito sobre esto.\n\nCOLIN POWELL : ¿Y qué? [inaudible] al señor Wilkerson.\n\nSAM HUSSEINI : Uno esperaría que usted supiera eso.\n\nCOLIN POWELL : La información que presenté ante la ONU fue examinada por la CIA . Cada palabra provino de la CIA . Y ellos defendieron toda esa información. No tengo conocimiento de que ninguno de ellos creyera que hubo torturas. No es un hecho que yo conozca. Hay mucha especulación, en particular por parte de quienes nunca asistieron a esas reuniones. Pero no tengo conocimiento de eso.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Clarence Lusane, quiero darle la última palabra. Seguimos hablando de ese discurso, que más tarde Powell calificaría como una \"mancha\" en su carrera.\n\nCLARENCE LUSANE : Hay que recordar que en esa época toda la comunidad internacional se oponía a la invasión. Y cuando Colin Powell y el Gobierno de Bush dijeron que estaban examinando esa información, no solo no estaban escuchando a sus aliados, sino que estaban ignorando lo que la propia ONU estaba haciendo. Básicamente, la ONU había comprobado que no había armas de destrucción masiva. Pero el Gobierno de EE.UU. estaba decidido a ir a la guerra, y Colin Powell básicamente accedió a eso, al igual que lo hizo antes de ese discurso, cuando en la Conferencia Mundial contra el Racismo Estados Unidos e Israel fueron los únicos dos países que se retiraron, y al igual que lo hizo después de la invasión a Irak en relación con otras políticas del Gobierno de George W. Bush, hasta finalmente ser forzado a dimitir. Por lo tanto, ese historial debe ser tenido en cuenta. No hay forma de embellecerlo. Fue algo atroz. Y, de nuevo, cientos de miles, y según algunas estimaciones, hasta un millón de personas murieron como resultado de esa guerra.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Y miles de tropas estadounidenses permanecen aún en Irak.

      "text": "Black Podcasters Are Platforming White Supremacy And It's Sickening to Watch\n\nA month or so back, I listened to a clip from \"The Joe Budden Podcast\" in which the crew played a snippet of Candace Owens - the worst Black woman in existence since Mary J. Blige's character on \"Power Book II: Ghost\" - giving Ariana Grande a verbal drubbing for being a \"ho .\"\n\nEveryone on the pod - even the sole woman, Melyssa Ford - gave Owens props for her takedown. It was a bizarre moment even for a podcast that prides itself on being contrarian for contrarianism's sake. Especially since Owens has made a career off of taking Black people to task to appease her white listeners.\n\nBudden didn't just side with Owens. He was intrigued.\n\nSo color me (un)surprised when Budden and Owens linked up for an episode of his podcast, which was released on his Patreon on March 15.\n\nFor the uninitiated, a brief primer on Owens: She's a different brand of foul right-wing f**kery. She's built a career downplaying racism, hoisting up Donald Trump and promoting homophobia, sexism, ableism and any other -ism you can muster - all in the name of getting Black folks away from the Democratic Party , and all while being a dark-skinned Black woman.\n\nAmong her headline-making absurdities: She testified to the House Judiciary Committee about how white supremacy is not nearly as big a deal as a culture that doesn't promote \"masculinity,\" and walked down a dark path with Kanye West, using the hip-hop culture she often condemns to her own benefit.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Budden let Owens speak with little pushback as she went through a medley of rancid talking points, including the idea that Black people will be \"free\" of structural or institutionalized racism if only we \"think\" our way out of it. She reminded him that Black rappers once loved Trump, who is only being \"misinterpreted\" because of the media (and not because of what's come out of his own goddamn mouth in the last eight years).\n\nOwens isn't the first Black conservative, but she's among the most noxious and the most followed, with millions of supporters across multiple platforms. And Budden likes her energy because ... she talked s**t about Ariana Grande ?\n\nBudden's homeboy Charlamagne Tha God also has the platforming-assholes thing down bad: His \"Breakfast Club\" radio show recently interviewed Republican presidential candidate (and inevitable loser) Nikki Haley.\n\nHaley, who'd just been cooked for refusing to acknowledge that the Civil War was about slavery , traipsed on this Black show and refused once again to explicitly acknowledge that racism is the lifeblood of America.\n\n\"When you look at the inequalities in America, in education, you know, homeownership, employment and wealth, health care,\" Charlamagne asked. \"Can you admit that America is, systemically and structurally, a racist country?\"\n\n\"I think culture has a lot to do with it, right?\" she responded.\n\nThat Owens and Haley are both women of color is immaterial - but it might actually make them more dangerous.\n\nThis isn't the first time Charlamagne, DJ Envy and company have placed a spotlight on terrible humans: They took an on-air phone call from O.G. conservative death adder Rush Limbaugh about George Floyd's murder.\n\nCharlamagne was pictured in 2016 with conservative blonde mudslinger (and former Donkey of the Day) Tomi Lahren, when she was at the height of her popularity. He claimed it was a publicity stunt, but he knew who she was when he walked with her - like Black folks are walking shoulder to shoulder with David Duke, just because .\n\nDefenses for these men and their choice of white supremacist guests have largely fallen into the \"let's hear both sides\" argument, but everyone can miss me with that. Why do we need exposure to the \"side\" of fomenting anti-Blackness and general hatred?\n\nOwens has several million followers and all the space in the world to get off bulls**t so ridiculous that I'm not even sure she believes it. She's in no risk of not having her side heard, and there's zero reason to Black media to engage her in dialogue outside of getting money - because not all money is good (or ethical) money.\n\nOwens is ecstatic that Black media is giving her play right now because, ostensibly, she believes Black folks are on the verge of an \"awakening\" that will see us dip out from the Democratic party en masse, and finally acknowledge that Toupee Fiasco will bring us all to the Promised Land.\n\nBut I think she's just excited about getting to flex her intellect over Budden: Owens is very loud and frequently wrong, but she's not stupid, and she knows that Budden couldn't hang with her intellectually. (In contrast, I bet she wouldn't step foot on Roland Martin's show.) Charlamagne and DJ Envy can also get steamrolled by their guests.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

And if they're not platforming anti-Blackness, they're going in the polar opposite direction: Budden and \"The Breakfast Club\" have both hosted Dr. Umar Johnson - a man who, oddly enough, espouses the same homophobic, pro-\"masculinity\" message as Owens, but framed in a pro-Blackness way.\n\nBalance, right?\n\nIt doesn't matter if your guest is on some clock-is-right-twice-a-day stuff - If their message is consistently that of racism, discrimination and wholly unnecessary attacks on marginalized groups, find another guest. I'm sure Budden and company can find someone else who thinks Ariana Grande is a ho."

      "text": "Trump Takes Personal Credit For COVID-19 Vaccines In Interview With Candace Owens\n\nSenior Culture Reporter, HuffPost\n\nShaky messaging on pandemic-related affairs aside, former President Donald Trump now considers the COVID-19 vaccines \"one of the greatest achievements of mankind.\"\n\nIn an interview with right-wing media personality Candace Owens this week, Trump took personal credit for the efficacy of the vaccines, as well as the \"incredible speed\" at which they were developed.\n\n\"I came up with three vaccines - all are very, very good,\" Trump told Owens on Wednesday. \"The vaccine worked, but some people aren't taking it. The ones that get very sick and go to the hospital are the ones that don't take their vaccine.\"\n\n\"But it's still their choice,\" he continued. \"If you take the vaccine, you're protected. But the results of the vaccine are very good, and if you do get it, it's a very minor form. People aren't dying when they take the vaccine.\"\n\nWatch a clip of Trump's chat with Candace Owens below.\n\nDonald Trump: 'The Vaccine is one of the greatest achievements of mankind' 'All three vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna, J&J) are very good' 'The vaccines work - If you take the vaccine you are protected' 'People aren't dying when they take the vaccine' pic.twitter.com/fU8q1sdMda\n\nOwens has been an outspoken critic of COVID-19 safety protocols, and in October, she shared that she was not vaccinated.\n\n\"I survived the greatest psychological fear campaign in human history,\" she wrote on Twitter at the time. \"I see our media and governments for what they are now: powerless without our incessant fear.\"\n\nThat same month, she applauded boxing champion Floyd Mayweather for his COVID-19 vaccine refusal, tweeting , \"A slave mind follows the crowd.\"\n\nThe interview marked the second time in less than a week that Trump has promoted the jabs. Last weekend, he drew boos in Dallas after revealing to former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly that he'd received a booster shot at some point prior to the pair's four-city \"History Tour.\"\n\nTrump's endorsement of the vaccines has put him at odds with his base. A November poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that the widest divide in vaccination rates in the United States exists between Democrats and Republicans . According to the poll, 60% of unvaccinated Americans identified as Republican or Republican-leaning independents, while 17% said they were Democrats or Democrat-leaning.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Christina Applegate Slams Candace Owens For 'F**king Gross' Rant About Disabled Model\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nChristina Applegate couldn't help but pop off at Candace Owens after a truly nonsensical and ableist diatribe.\n\nThe right-wing media host pulled a Tucker Carlson a la M&M's move earlier this week when she decided to criticize an 11-month-old Skims campaign targeted towards disabled people on her podcast \"The Daily Wire\" Tuesday.\n\nIn April of 2022, Kim Kardashian's shapewear company launched its adaptive collection of underwear for people with limited mobility who have difficulty putting on and taking off their undergarments. Logically, the campaign consisted of disabled people modeling the line's products.\n\nYet, Owens did not compute. She saw an ad from the campaign that included a wheelchair user and took it as another instance of woke culture.\n\n\"I don't know why this needs to be done. I'm just getting tired of this all-inclusivity thing. It seems ridiculous,\" Owens said, proving that she completely misunderstood the point of the line.\n\n\"I really don't get it, and if I am wrong, educate me,\" she added.\n\npic.twitter.com/2NQl9VqIAr\n\nAlthough someone from a marginalized group should never feel like it's their obligation to educate ignorant people about their community, Appplegate took the opportunity to school Owens.\n\n\"Going to try and sleep but my rage is keeping me awake,\" the \"Dead to Me\" star began. \"Candace Owens, do you know when you have seen pictures of me how fucking hard it was to get my clothes on? A team has to help me!!! So I'm excited for accessibility clothing for me and my community.Hope u wake.\"\n\nGoing to try and sleep but my rage is keeping me awake. Candace Owens, do you know when you have seen pictures of me how fucking hard it was to get my clothes on? A team has to help me!!! So I'm excited for accessibility clothing for me and my community.Hope u wake\n\nBut it seems Applegate wasn't quite done, and seemed bothered by Owens' remark to educate her.\n\n\"I thought my last tweet was enough,\" Applegate subsequently wrote. \"But then my heart said something else. No rage. If Candace wants to get on the phone with me to be educated on being disabled. I will not come with anger. I will come with love. Because she needs to hear that. I pray for her tonight.sincerely.\"\n\nI thought my last tweet was enough. But then my heart said something else. No rage. If Candace wants to get on the phone with me to be educated on being disabled. I will not come with anger. I will come with love. Because she needs to hear that. I pray for her tonight.sincerely\n\nApplegate - who announced she was diagnosed with MS in 2021 - wasn't the only person who took offense to Owens's rant.\n\nBut, it seems like one TikToker did seem to get through to Owens - by basically explaining to her that the accessible line is targeted towards disabled people.\n\nOn Wednesday, Owens acknowledged that this TikToker made sense with her \"rational\" explanation and played the user's message on her podcast.\n\n\"I am a full time wheelchair user,\" the TikToker says in her video. \"And since you're asking to be educated, here I am, happy to educate. Everything you just said is completely ableist, and here's why. Skims has created an adaptive clothing line making it easier for people like myself and people with accessibility needs to put on underwear, clasp their bras, and also be able to access shapewear that is usually impossible to get on for us.\"\n\nThe TikToker also couldn't help but get a dig in at Owner's expense.\n\n\"I lived my life as an able-bodied person and a disabled person and when I was able-bodied I would not say ignorant comments like this,\" the TikToker said.\n\nOwens then thanked the TikToker for giving her the very-hard-to-find-out intel on the brand that \"developed unique technology and the reason why they created these ads because it makes it easier for people in wheelchairs to get into a bra and underwear.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nThis year's GOP congressional candidates are more racially diverse than ever, and the party is making worrisome inroads among voters of color. Democrats have never understood that without a substantive appeal to voters of color, those voters may leave them.\n\nAnna Paulina Luna appears on a panel discussion during a taping of \"Candace\" hosted by Candace Owens on January 4, 2022 in Nashville, Tennessee. (Brett Carlsen / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe GOP, which since the 1970s has relied on white voters to win elections, is currently running the largest number of non-white candidates for Congress. Mainstream outlets like the New York Times and Washington Post have noted that, since at least some of these candidates are likely to win their races, they will create the most diverse GOP congressional delegation since Reconstruction.\n\nThese candidates come from racial and ethnic groups not typically associated with the GOP. For example, there's Anna Paulina Luna in Florida's 13th Congressional District, which encompasses St Petersburg and the surrounding area. Luna is a Latina and a conservative, critical of what she calls \"illegal immigration\" (though her comments are considerably less virulently racist than some of her Republican counterparts, including Lauren Boebert, who recently endorsed her). Wesley Hunt, a black man running in Texas's 38th Congressional District in the Houston metro area, favors what he calls \"border security\" and supports \"our men and women in blue,\" who must be defended against \"radical liberals in Congress.\"\n\nOf the 435 Republicans running for the House of Representatives, sixty-seven are people of color. This number doesn't reflect the racial demographics of the United States. But it does represent a significant effort on the part of the GOP to diversify their candidates and their party.\n\nOur legislative bodies should, of course, be more diverse. It isn't just morally correct; more elected officials of color can make our governments better at advancing progressive priorities. But Democrats too often treat racial, gender, sexual, and other representation as if it were a final victory. Which, for many of them, it is: the party has sought diverse faces in high places to carry out an agenda that leaves the miserably unequal status quo untouched.\n\nVoters of color aren't stupid. They've realized this approach is hollow at best, a multiracial cover for political misdeeds at worst - which has helped lead to a situation in which the GOP, pursuing an agenda that is dangerous to the working class, immigrants, queer and transgender people, black people, the environment, and much more, doesn't seem like such a bad gamble.\n\nThe GOP's goal in nominating a more diverse set of candidates is to challenge a key Democratic strategy in the US electorate. Winning an overwhelming majority of the black vote has been crucial to Democratic electoral victories for several decades, particularly in cities and metropolitan areas where black people and people of color in general disproportionately live in the United States. Even in regions where these groups are minorities, carrying 80 to 95 percent of the black vote can catapult a Democrat to victory. When this turnout is less than expected or hoped, Democratic victories become chancier or impossible.\n\nThis is one of the many double binds the mainstream of the Democratic Party has put itself in: it not only relies on the support of black voters but is simultaneously trying to poach more conservative white voters from Republicans. When the Republicans respond in kind, trying to entice more people of color to their side, mainstream commentators get confused: this is not supposed to be possible.\n\nFor years, mainstream commentators heralded a coming \" demographic wave ,\" when people of color would be the majority in the United States and white people a plurality, making the country \"majority minority.\" If you've convinced yourself that demographics equal destiny and people of color \"naturally\" vote for the Democrats, Democratic victories appear inevitable. This argument was everywhere during the Trump administration, reassuring Democrats that their eventual return to permanent power was settled social scientific fact.\n\nThis narrative has proved to be both misguided and racist. First, it relied on the assumption that Latinos - the fastest-growing ethnic group in the United States - would always identify as Democrats - something that isn't borne out by the data.\n\nSecond, it assumed that the GOP wouldn't, or couldn't, offer any kind of alternative to the mainstream of the Democratic Party that people of color would support. This has also proven false. While people of color still vote disproportionately for Democrats, the 2020 election revealed that rule to be as malleable as any other. Donald Trump actually gained ground among minority voters during his reelection campaign, despite four years of racist fearmongering, political violence, and his alliance with the far right.\n\nThese essentialist assumptions fall into precisely the kind of racist tropes that the Democrats claim to oppose, assuming a kind of static, intrinsic, across-the-board progressive bent to voters of color. But like all essentialist assumptions, this is wrong.\n\nFor example, while black voters in the United States have moved left on the issue over time, a majority of them still find abortion to be \"morally unacceptable.\" Another supermajority of black voters, the highest proportion of all racial groups polled, said that gender was permanently determined by ones' assigned sex at birth, squarely at odds with both trans rights activists and the position of the Democratic Party. A majority of Hispanic voters in Flordia support conservative governor Ron DeSantis's racist actions against undocumented immigrants, which saw the state government intentionally lie to a group of immigrants and put them on a plane to Martha's Vineyard in an arguably illegal political stunt.\n\nThe coalition that currently votes for Democrats in the United States is contingent and malleable. The GOP can win over members of that coalition in their favor - perhaps especially if Democrats continue pursuing a politics that treats racial representation as if it were the full extent of their program for racial justice.\n\nAnother clear example of this inadequacy is the ascension of Rishi Sunak in the United Kingdom, the country's first ever prime minister who is not white. President Joe Biden and other commentators have hailed his election as an historic moment but have neglected to mention that Sunak's being of South Asian descent or being the descendant of immigrants doesn't mean that he or his party will support freedom of movement or the provision of increased rights for migrants. In fact, it seems that his government is poised to enact the same kinds of reactionary policies that previous Conservative governments have throughout the UK's history.\n\nEven the extreme right wing, which in the United States has always been deeply tied to white supremacism, has in countries from Brazil to India been accompanied by very different politics of race and ethnicity. The Brazilian Integralist Action , Brazil's fascist party from the 1930s, had many non-white members and also several regional leaders who were black, even as it was aligning itself with European fascists. And recently defeated Jair Bolsonaro fared surprisingly well with non-white voters in Brazil despite his open racism. In India the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh , a Hindu nationalist organization deeply connected to both the country's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and to networks of far-right militants, espouses a form of nationalism and racism that is focused on religious sectarianism rather than whiteness. Even the Italian National Fascist Party originally avoided the antisemitic policies that obsessed the Nazis, only later adopting them when pressured by their allies.\n\nA politics of empty racial representation that does not actually advance any sort of substantively progressive politics and leaves out the basic, material issues affecting the lives of Democrats' most important and most oppressed constituents presents the Right with a golden opportunity - one that Republicans are currently seizing.\n\nCraig Johnson has a PhD in history from the University of California Berkeley, where his work focused on the right wing and the Catholic Church in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Spain. He hosts a podcast called Fifteen Minutes of Fascism , a weekly news and analysis show covering the global rise of the radical right.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Over the past two weeks, a swelling cavalcade of right-wing pundits, talking heads, and elected officials have sought to distance themselves from Donald Trump and signal in no uncertain terms that the future of the Republican Party lies elsewhere.\n\nReacting to the results, Fox's Laura Ingraham - notably a longtime Trump sycophant - remarked : \"It is not about any one person. If the voters conclude that you're putting your own ego . . . ahead of what's good for the country, they're going to look elsewhere. Period.\" Former congressman Mick Mulvaney, who served as Trump's chief of staff for over a year, meanwhile told CNBC :\n\nI'm ready for a generational change in my party. Ron DeSantis would make a great president. Tim Scott would make a great president. Nikki Haley would make a great president. Mike Pompeo. Mike Pence. Go down the list. . . . I think [Trump] is the only Republican who could lose.\n\nAlso joining the chorus was Candace Owens, who asked, \"What is his vision for 2024? Is it going to be more than 'I'm back'? Because that's not a vision to me.\" None other than Chris Christie, arguably one of the most abject and pathetic Trump grovelers on the face of the earth, even drew applause for his attacks on the former president at a recent meeting of Republican governors. Apparently smelling blood, the National Review several days ago issued an editorial rejecting a Trump rerun in 2024 simply titled \"No.\" The opening lines of a November 14 report in Politico more or less sum up what now seems to be the consensus view on the state of Trumpism after the 2022 midterms: \"Donald Trump's iron grip on the GOP is beginning to crack. And some Republicans aren't even sure he's in command at all anymore.\"\n\nWatching these convulsions, it's hard not to feel a palpable sense of déjà vu. Throughout the entirety of his initial rise, virtually every part of what officially calls itself the conservative movement - from big-money corporate donors and Republican power brokers to the supposedly upright and cerebral intellectuals who populate outlets like National Review - did their utmost to brand Trump an electoral albatross and instruct Republican voters to reject him.\n\nTo say that none of it mattered would, if anything, be an understatement. Far from blunting the mercurial front-runner's momentum, the Republican establishment's attacks on Trump only seemed to make the base like him more. In the years since, Trumpism not only brought erstwhile critics onside - including many of those who had contributed to the National Review 's January 2016 \"Against Trump\" issue - but so firmly embedded itself as the lingua franca of American conservatism that it's become difficult to imagine what a post-Trumpian GOP would even look like.\n\nIf there was a broader takeaway to be drawn from the Trump candidacy and subsequent Trump presidency, it was that the conservative establishment wielded considerably less authority or legitimacy within the Republican base than its elites had long liked to tell themselves. Having repeatedly ordered Republican primary voters not to anoint Trump as their standard-bearer, those voters proceeded to do so anyway - and, having done so, rallied around his administration with a fanatical devotion arguably without precedent in US politics. Predictably enough, many of the right-wing elites who had so shrilly spent a year or more denouncing Trump hastily bent the knee.\n\nNotwithstanding all of this, the Republican Party's decidedly unremarkable showing in the recent midterms appears to have inspired right-wing apparatchiks and opinion leaders to initiate a reboot of their own failed strategy from 2016. Trump, it must be said, does indeed look weaker than he's looked for quite some time. His recent presidential announcement, while hitting all of the familiar notes, was a somewhat downbeat and deflated affair lacking the transgressive aura of its 2015 equivalent and devoting considerable time to the parochial grievances that have increasingly dominated Trumpist discourse since 2020.\n\nBarring some unexpected shift in American conservatism, however, there's little reason to believe that the dynamics of 2016 won't persist into 2024. Among the basic lessons of 2016 was that pure and unrestrained ideology is a much more potent force within the Right than the conventional electoralism typically favored by Republican elites. Conservative donors and public intellectuals may prefer to erect an artifice of respectability around their project, but Republican voters overwhelmingly respond when such calculations are set aside and their pleasure centers are stimulated instead. No figure on the modern right has done that more effectively than Trump, and even if the growing chorus of critics is correct in deeming him a spent force and an electoral liability, there's little reason to think it will be of any concern to the Republican base.\n\nIf anything, in fact, such attacks may help Trump rediscover his lost élan and reclaim the mantle of transgressive outsider that served him so well throughout his improbable 2016 ascendancy. As the young conservative writer Nate Hochman recently observed :\n\nOne of the reasons Trump's base adores him is that he overcame overwhelming odds - including both party establishments - to win. The more Republican elites consolidate against him, the more otherwise persuadable Trump voters are going to remember why they loved him in the first place.\n\nLuke Savage is a staff writer at Jacobin .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Having pioneered many of the destructive, reactionary ideas associated with Trumpism, they're now aspiring to global hegemony.\n\nUS president Donald Trump and Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán pose for a picture at the NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, on May 25, 2017. (Danny Gys / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nI expect the mood was joyful at Budapest's Scruton Café following the news of Donald Trump's election to a second term in office. The café is named after the English philosopher Roger Scruton, revered by American and European right-wingers.\n\nIt also featured prominently in the Vice documentary \" America and Hungary, a Far-Right Love Affair \" as a popular spot where right-wing thinkers from around the world converge and parrot conservative talking points. Hungary, under the far-right leader Victor Orbán, is often held up on a pedestal by the right as proof that an illiberal future is indeed possible.\n\nBut Budapest is not the only capital city where populist, right-wing politicians are feeling hopeful following the US elections. From Rome to Buenos Aires, and from San Salvador to New Delhi, right-wing leaders are similarly optimistic that, with a friend like Donald Trump at the helm in Washington, an illiberal reconstruction of global politics is within reach.\n\nFor one thing, Trump's return assures them that a cult of personality has immense appeal in electoral democracies. Trump has fashioned himself as the straight-talking, hard-nosed \"outsider\" with little patience for the political waffling of the career politician. Rather, he presents himself as a single-minded leader, willing to transgress all political norms and democratic checks and balances for the national cause. This model is inspirational for politicians like Javier Milei in Argentina and Nayib Bukele in El Salvador.\n\nThe fiery economist and self-styled anarcho-capitalist president of Argentina rose to power touting his \"chain-saw\" policies that would slash the supposedly overgrown state and rescue the country from a severe financial crisis. He found global fame thanks to a 2023 TikTok video where he can be seen ripping off the names of various government agencies, like the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Environment, and the Ministry of Women, Gender, and Diversity from a whiteboard, and then yelling afuera (\"out\").\n\nHis antics on the campaign trail, where he often brought along a chain saw, worked. Since coming to power, Milei has kept his promise and taken the chain saw to the public sector. The victims, however, have been Argentina's poorest. More than half of the country has slipped below the poverty line, while 18 percent of the population now lives in extreme poverty.\n\nBukele also took power in El Salvador as a rock-star political outsider, promising a no-nonsense approach to the country's gang violence. His mano dura , or \"iron fist,\" policies have led to 1 percent of the entire population being held in fortress-like megaprisons. This includes three thousand children.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International , Bukele's crusade against the gangs has led to \"massive human rights violations, including thousands of arbitrary detentions and violations of due process, as well as torture and ill-treatment.\" Despite this, Bukele's approval rate has hovered around 90 percent, and his fans have dubbed him the \"world's coolest dictator.\"\n\nThe global right finds Trump's anti-woke agenda just as appealing as his leadership style. He has said that universities are dominated by \"Marxists, maniacs, and lunatics\" and promised to roll back DEI policies and antidiscrimination protections for trans people.\n\nViktor Orbán sees himself as a first mover in such matters. At the 2023 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Budapest, he boasted:\n\nHungary is actually an incubator where experiments are done on the future of conservative policies. Hungary is the place where we didn't just talk about defeating the progressives and liberals and causing a conservative Christian political turn, but we actually did it.\n\nThe sign over the entrance to the conference venue read \"No Woke Zone.\" Presumed \"woke journalists\" were banned from attending the conference.\n\nIn 2021, the Orbán government banned the \"depiction of homosexuality or sex reassignment\" in media programs catering to children under the age of eighteen. References to homosexuality are banned in sex education at schools.\n\nThe Hungarian authorities also implemented a new law targeting foreign universities and forced the George Soros-funded Central European University (CEU) to leave the country. CEU was the primary target of the law because it was seen as a liberal hub of anti-Orbán thinking.\n\nFinally, right-wing leaders see their own worldviews reflected in Trump's xenophobia and Islamophobia. At home, he has promised to round up and deport undocumented migrants en masse. Previously, Trump falsely claimed to have seen Muslims in New Jersey celebrating the 9/11 attacks. He has also called for additional surveillance of Muslim Americans and introduced the infamous Muslim travel ban.\n\nAll of this resonates with the likes of Orbán and the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni. Both have been at the forefront of the European anti-migrant movement. Meloni has championed the \"right not to migrate\" and worked to stem what she views as illegal immigration by outsourcing European border control to non-European Union  countries. She has presented her policies as a model that other European leaders should follow, though critics have called them \"dehumanizing and illegal.\"\n\nFor his part, Orbán has fashioned himself as a savior of European, Christian civilization. He has railed against the arrival of the allegedly terroristic and culturally alien Muslim migrants to European shores, presenting his draconian anti-migration policies as a way to keep Europe safe and Christian.\n\nThousands of miles away in New Delhi, the Hindu nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi, would agree with the talking points of Meloni, Orbán, and Trump. Under his decade-long leadership, anti-Muslim rhetoric and violence in India has been at an all-time high.\n\nLeaders from Modi's party have demolished the homes of Muslim activists and called for the boycott of Muslim-owned businesses. The Modi government pushed forward the Citizenship Amendment Act of 2019 that only grants non-Muslim undocumented migrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan the right to fast-track citizenship. Critical journalists have faced trumped-up terror charges, while civil society organizations have been accused of unlawfully receiving foreign funding.\n\nOf course, all of these illiberal moves are not happening in the vacuum of individual national contexts. The Trumps, Modis, Orbáns, Melonis, and Bukeles of the world are well aware of each other's existence and are in the process of forging a global alliance.\n\nElon Musk - sitting at the helm of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under the second Trump presidency - proclaims himself to be a big fan of Milei's chain-saw policies. Trump and Milei also share a special bond. After Milei won his election, Trump congratulated him on Truth Social: \"I'm very proud of you. You will turn your Country around. Make Argentina Great Again!\" Milei was the first foreign leader to meet Trump after US election this November and was a guest at Trump's inauguration.\n\nThe Salvadoran leader, Bukele, also had a highly publicized meeting with Musk back in September. Under Orbán, Hungary has hosted three international CPAC gatherings, where speakers have included the likes of the far-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders, right-wing commentator Candace Owens, Republican congressman Andy Harris, and Eduardo Bolsonaro, son of the former president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro. Orbán delivered the opening address at the 2022 CPAC summit in Dallas.\n\nSince winning the presidential election, Trump is reported to have had several calls with the Hungarian leader, seeking his advice on the Ukraine war. Orbán has been a vocal critic of military aid to Ukraine and has maintained friendly ties with Vladimir Putin.\n\nModi is equally popular with right-wing leaders around the world. Trump and Modi have held two joint megarallies: \"Howdy Modi\" in Houston in 2019 and \"Namaste Trump\" in Ahmedabad in 2020. Both have publicly celebrated each other's political accomplishments. Trump has fondly called Modi his friend, who \"looks like your father\" but is also a \"total killer.\"\n\nMeloni and Modi have also embarked on efforts to strengthen India-Italy ties in \"defense, security, trade, and technology.\" Of course, in the European context, Meloni and Orbán are kindred spirits in their anti-immigration stance.\n\n2025 might be shaping up as the best year yet for the global fraternity of illiberal conservative leaders.\n\nSomdeep Sen teaches international relations at Roskilde University and is the author of Decolonizing Palestine: Hamas Between the Anticolonial and the Postcolonial .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Don't count him out yet, though.\n\nFormer president Donald Trump speaks at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, on November 15, 2022, to announce his 2024 run for the White House. (Alon Skuy / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWhen you announce a presidential run, you typically want to establish yourself as the front-runner by having some momentum behind you and demonstrating broad support from within your party. You certainly don't want to do it off a stunning electoral failure you're being widely blamed for, with members of your own party attacking you, and people in your inner circle advising you to delay the announcement.\n\nBut this is Donald Trump we're talking about. Could it have gone any other way?\n\nTrump defiantly announced his 2024 presidential campaign yesterday, a week after a disappointing GOP midterm election performance led his own advisers to urge him to delay the announcement. Having planned to take credit for what he thought would be a Republican landslide that never happened, Trump was in a bind: delay the event, looking weak and tacitly admitting the election didn't go his way, or barrel ahead with it anyway, pissing off the Republican establishment while insisting everything was going great. For anyone who's watched Trump the past six years, there was never any doubt what he'd do.\n\nThe speech was a relatively subdued one by Trump standards, heavy on the teleprompter and mostly free of references to made-up election fraud that have become synonymous with the former president over the past two years (though he did at one point allude to China playing \"a very active role in the 2020 election\"). It seemed a concerted attempt to present a more sober, serious, presidential Trump, after a spate of election-denying candidates in his mold fell short in their races last week, and the GOP's entire underperformance was blamed on his years' worth of efforts to cast doubt on and overturn the 2020 election result. Even so, Trump touted the win record of his endorsees (\"In the primaries, it was 98.6 percent, but they were still trying to blame me\") and took credit for the GOP's wave of victories in Florida, where his leading rival for the GOP nomination had just won reelection by 20 points.\n\nIt was also a far more listless speech, especially compared to the pretty fiery 2015 announcement that started it all. Where that event saw Trump come down a golden escalator to Neil Young's \"Rockin' in the Free World\" and immediately start attacking the various ways other countries, China above all, were taking advantage of a perennially losing United States, this Tuesday saw Trump shuffle up from within the crowd to the patriotic tones of Proud to Be an American , to complain about how the Golden Age he had built over his four years as president had been squandered.\n\nIn Trump's telling, he had spent his presidency as the guarantor of prosperity and economic security for all, stressing that every demographic group had done better under him, only to see his political opponents destroy the economy and the stable order he'd created. Having originally campaigned on restoring an America in decline, it was a neat way to marry the themes that had worked for Trump seven years ago while leap-frogging the awkward fact that he had just recently been president.\n\nSo once more, American greatness had to be restored, this time not because of decades of bad trade deals, corruption, and an out-of-touch elite that didn't care about American workers but because of Joe Biden and the \"radical left lunatics running our country right into the ground.\" Over his four years, Trump said, he had built a strong economy, ensured US energy independence, ended the practice of one-sided trade deals, created a peaceful world, and kept American adversaries in check. But in the less than two years he's been out of office, it had all unraveled, and now Trump was leading a diverse, working-class movement to save the United States from a corrupt establishment and \"radical left Democrats\" out to destroy the country. It was time to make America great again, again.\n\nTrump hit on familiar themes to that end, including a border that had been \"erased,\" a United States being \"invaded by millions upon millions,\" a deluge of \"thousands of pounds of deadly drugs,\" and lamenting the \"bloodsoaked streets of our once-great cities\" (\"How sad\"). He continued attacking the Green New Deal for \"destroying our country\" in a variety of ways, despite the fact that it's never actually been enacted.\n\nBut he also hit on some surprising themes. While touting how he had kept US adversaries under heel, Trump also boasted about his diplomatic efforts and that North Korea stopped launching long-range missiles after he and Kim Jong Un held a summit and developed a relationship. \"That's a good thing, not a bad thing,\" he added. \"It's a good thing. A very good thing actually.\" He likewise had some incongruously kind words for Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO): \"A great gentleman, a socialist, but that is okay. You can't have everything.\"\n\nTrump blamed Biden for \"leading us to the brink of nuclear war,\" mixing his criticism of the administration's Ukraine policy with climate denial, contrasting what he cast as a blasé attitude toward nuclear war to panic over climate change, which he falsely said would only come into effect in three hundred years. He also pointed to the fact that he is the first president in decades not to start a new war - which is strictly true, but ignores the fact that he only pulled back at the last minute from starting a pointless one with Iran because Tucker Carlson told him not to. At the same time, he attacked Biden over the Afghanistan withdrawal.\n\nThe statements may be a preview of what will be Trump's campaign strategy, should he win the nomination. So might be a line in the middle of the speech absolving himself of blame for the midterm result. Pointing to criticism of Republicans for faring badly in the midterms, he said that \"much of this blame is correct\" but also warned that voters \"have not yet realized the full extent and gravity of the pain our nation is going through.\" \"They don't quite feel it yet, but they will soon,\" he said ominously. Trump's hopes for a deteriorating economy giving him an election boost may well come true, if economists are correct that the Federal Reserve is pushing the country into a recession .\n\nBut to capitalize on such a scenario, Trump has to win the Republican primary first. And that may be a taller order at this point than anyone anticipated before last week's elections.\n\nThe loyalty Trump's commanded from Republican officials, even ones he openly humiliated and mistreated, stemmed from his perceived electoral strength and the hold he's had over the Republican base. Both have shown signs of slipping for some time, but they've been severely dented by this midterm result, and the knives are already out.\n\nA variety of right-wing commentators , even those like Candace Owens who crawled out of the primordial MAGA ooze, have criticized Trump in the wake of the result. The unflinchingly loyal Mike Pence, left high and dry by Trump during the storming of the Capitol last January, is saying the country will have \"better choices in the future\" than Trump. A number of peeved Republican senators are either withholding their endorsements or outright backing Florida governor Ron DeSantis, who was recently urged to run for president by eighty-six GOP officials in Utah. Longtime advisors and other allies are saying Trump shouldn't run or are considering jumping ship. Even Chris Christie, a hall of famer among the sizable ranks of Trump's most pathetic toadies, has suddenly found the guts to publicly attack Trump .\n\nThere are other reasons he should be worried. A number of polls carried out by the Club for Growth show DeSantis ahead of Trump in Florida, Georgia, Iowa, and New Hampshire, while a YouGov poll has DeSantis ahead nationally. A Texas GOP-commissioned poll has DeSantis leading Trump by ten points in the key state. The Wall Street Journal is warning its readers that Trump is \"most likely to produce a GOP loss and total power for the progressive left.\" Trump hasn't helped himself by lashing out at potential rivals Glenn Youngkin (\"Sounds Chinese, doesn't it?\") and DeSantis in bizarre and self-defeatin g ways. DeSantis recently struck back , telling reporters to \"go check out the scoreboard from last Tuesday night.\"\n\nThere's also the spider's web of investigations and possible prosecutions swirling around Trump, whether over alleged election fraud in Georgia, his mishandling of classified documents, or tax fraud in Manhattan. In the elite-favored US judicial system, Trump is still more likely to escape prosecution than not, but all of this could further hurt his claim to electability come 2024.\n\nThen again, Trump lashing out at anyone and everyone, carrying a load of scandals while the GOP establishment piles on, refusing to admit defeat or back down - we've seen this story before. Anyone with a working memory can recall the umpteen times Trump's 2016 campaign was declared over, that pundits declared this at long last would be the thing he can't come back from, the long list of commentators and politicians who proudly declared their opposition to Trump, only to fall in line anyway. Trump may be down right now, but it's never been a good bet to count him out.\n\nOne thing's for sure: however it goes, the Republican contest is going to be entertaining for a while. After that, it'll be time to worry.\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .

Owens was among the company's most recognizable and followed personalities, making appearances on Fox News and Infowars. Owens is also in the midst of a tour with Turning Point USA, a conservative organization that has recently gained power in the Republican Party .\n\nThe Daily Wire did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A representative for Owens said she would have more information about her next venture soon.\n\nOwens has been a controversial, outspoken figure in right-wing media and has been known to share conspiracy theories. She also publicly clashed with Shapiro on X in the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack against Israel.\n\nOwens has been one of the few far-right pundits who has been openly critical of Israel's handling of the war in Gaza. Critics of Owens say that she has spread antisemitism.\n\nIn an X post on Nov. 13, Owens wrote, \"No one can serve two masters\" and ended her post by writing, \"You cannot serve both God and money.\"\n\nShapiro reposted Owens, saying, \"Candace, if you feel that taking money from The Daily Wire somehow comes between you and God, by all means quit.\"\n\nOwens then claimed Shapiro had \"been acting unprofessional and emotionally unhinged  for weeks now\" and went on to say Shapiro \"cross[ed] a certain line when you come for scripture and read yourself into it. I will not tolerate it.\"\n\nThe feud continued when Owens appeared on conservative commentator Tucker Carlson's X show, calling Shapiro's jabs \"ad-hominem attacks.\"\n\nThe Daily Wire was founded in 2015 by Shapiro and Boreing. The company calls itself \"one of America's fastest-growing media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment\" that is part of the \"right-of-center media landscape.\" Owens joined the company in 2021.\n\nIn addition to her escalating feud with Shapiro, Owens also recently spread unsubstantiated claims that French President Emmanuel Macron's wife, Brigitte Marie-Claude Macron, is a transgender woman.\n\n\"After looking into this, I would stake my entire professional reputation on the fact that Brigette Macron is in fact a man,\" she previously claimed in a post on X.\n\nThe French president addressed the claim about his wife earlier this month, according to t he New York Post . \"The worst thing is the false information and fabricated scenarios,\" Macron reportedly said. \"People eventually believe them and disturb you, even in your intimacy.\"\n\nKalhan Rosenblatt is a reporter covering youth and internet culture for NBC News, based in New York.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

      "text": "Candace Owens doubles down on her absurd fight against inclusion\n\nWATCH LIVE: Journalists and political leaders take part in the 2025 White House Correspondents' Dinner\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nActor Christina Applegate took right-wing pundit Candace Owens to task this week for resurfaced disparaging and ableist comments Owens made in 2022, in which she criticized Skims, Kim Kardashian's shapewear line, for running ads with an underwear model in a wheelchair - comments Owens doubled down on on Wednesday.\n\nApplegate, who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2021, and whose quality of life has been dramatically affected by the disease, tweeted: \"This Candace person making comments about companies who see we need help. It's f---ing gross. I thank skims ... for seeing us.\" In a subsequent tweet, Applegate explained how she needs help getting dressed since the deterioration of her MS, and praised Skims for promoting \"accessibility clothing for me and my community.\"\n\nThe episode exposes some telling points about the right's antagonistic relationship to inclusion and the reality of the perceived threat (spoiler alert: There isn't really one).\n\nOwens, in typical fashion, unleashed a series of hateful screeds in attacking the inclusion of minorities in modeling campaigns.\n\nIn a number of her Daily Wire podcast-cum-YouTube videos, Owens, in typical fashion, unleashed a series of hateful screeds in attacking the inclusion of minorities in modeling campaigns, and used bad faith arguments to lash out at her detractors. In her most recent episode, published Wednesday, Owens shared that one viewer who uses a wheelchair wrote to the host and explained the Skims ad campaign made her believe she could fulfill her lifelong dream of being a model. Owens responded: \"Okay, so what you're saying there is you want to be patronized. You want people to essentially hand out participation trophies - you're perhaps not the best person suited for this particular role, but you want people to give it to you anyways ... you're seeing Victoria's Secret fashion shows with clinically obese people.\" Companies do this in part to pander to liberals, Owens contends, but also to \"placate the literal mob,\" who threaten violence unless they get their \"token Black person, token fat person, a person that is disabled, [and] the trans person\" in ad campaigns.\n\nOwens escalated the absurdity : \"People were accusing me of not wanting disabled people to wear underwear. ... That's true, everybody knows that I can't stand that. Everybody knows you have to see a model doing something to know that you're allowed to do it. Until I saw a Black woman wearing clothes on a billboard, I was naked my whole life. I was just butt naked walking around. Until I saw Tyra Banks on Top Model, I was butt naked. So, thank you, representation matters.\"\n\nOK, Candace ...\n\nBut this whole conversation touches on an increasingly fundamental tenet of the right-wing culture wars: \"Diversity\" as a boogeyman has entered every facet of the far-right zeitgeist and become an obsession, a catchall scapegoat for reactionary pundits and politicians across the country.\n\nOn Thursday, World Athletics announced a total ban on transgender women competing in the female category for international events (there are currently no trans female athletes competing internationally). Self-penned anti-woke leader Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis blamed the fall of Silicon Valley Bank diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives .\n\nScapegoating minorities and associated fear-mongering is not a new tactic. It's a trusted go-to in the reactionary playbook. But as inclusion, perceived increased influence of minoritiesand DEI initiatives gain more steam than ever, we're seeing a predictably loud retaliation from the right.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the right's fear about the threat of inclusion and diversity is, well, not real. Yes, improved inclusion can help on the margins. Endless studies have made the case that diversity can help avoid \"groupthink\" and promote innovation and creativity. And, generally, giving marginalized populations opportunities they've historically not had is a good idea. But, as I made the case in my article about Rishi Sunak's ascent as the U.K.'s first prime minister of color, we often confuse tokenism with meaningful diversity, and simply including more minorities in systems designed to oppress them is not progress.\n\n\"Diversity\" as a boogeyman has entered every facet of the far-right zeitgeist and become an obsession, a catchall scapegoat for reactionary pundits and politicians across the country.\n\nA 2020 Harvard Business Review paper titled \"Getting Serious About Diversity: Enough Already with the Business Case,\" makes the case that \"there is no research support for the notion that diversifying the workforce automatically improves a company's performance. ... To fully benefit from increased racial and gender diversity, organizations must adopt a learning orientation and be willing to change the corporate culture and power structure.\"\n\nAnd here is the crux of the issue. Institutions and power structures predicated on white supremacist, patriarchal, ableist, heteronormative systems designed for the dominant classes cannot fundamentally be reshaped by the simple inclusion of women and minorities.\n\nBuilding on the work of Black, lesbian and radical feminists, author and cultural critic Marcie Bianco makes this case in her forthcoming book, \" Breaking Free: The Lie of Equality and the Feminist Fight for Freedom .\" The proclamation that inclusion equates equality is a lie that merely helps expand the harmful systems we want to \"smash,\" Bianco rightly contends.\n\nSo, yes, empowering oppressed classes is, in theory, threatening to those in power. But, no, the extent of the right's fear is not warranted. The inclusion of an underwear model in a wheelchair in a Skims ad campaign and general DEI initiatives are not going to lead to the French Revolution. But the sheer terror, fear and hatred exhibited by the right every time DEI initiatives make modest advances speaks volumes about how tenuous they believe their own power to be.\n\nNoor Noman is a freelance journalist in New York City who has worked as a writer, editor, producer and presenter.

      "text": "How right-wing influencers are exploiting the Justin Baldoni-Blake Lively feud\n\nWATCH LIVE: Journalists and political leaders take part in the 2025 White House Correspondents' Dinner\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nAfter actress Blake Lively sued director Justin Baldoni in December, saying he had retaliated against her for reporting sexual harassment on a film set, an unusual group of online talkers dove into this Hollywood dispute.\n\nRight-wing personality Candace Owens - who split from The Daily Wire last year amid conflicts over her antisemitic rhetoric - was not previously known for covering celebrity litigation. But she has become one of Baldoni's loudest defenders online, helping propel the feud and gaining new audiences for herself along the way.\n\nThis strategy appears to be successful in multiple ways.\n\nIn an interview, Baldoni's lawyer Bryan Freedman recognized the role of podcasters and social media influencers like Owens: \"You've seen social media, and these TikTokers and people on YouTube, they're amazing,\" he said. Since January, Owens has dedicated at least 19 episodes of her online show to Lively and Baldoni. Her YouTube videos and TikToks on the topic have garnered over 130 million views.\n\nOther right-wing hosts like Brett Cooper and former Fox News and NBC personality Megyn Kelly have also tried to reel in new audiences, mentioning Lively or Baldoni at least 440 times on their online shows since the beginning of the year. After Kelly interviewed   Baldoni's lawyer (who she says is also her lawyer ), Kelly told her audience : \"The thing that stood out to me was, I don't understand this, because she's the one in the power position here. It's Blake Lively and some guy who pretty much nobody knows.\" She added: \"I'm neck-deep in this weird industry that I really want nothing to do with, but it's the case everyone's been talking about.\"\n\nThis strategy appears to be successful in multiple ways. These influencers are keeping this story in the spotlight - Owens predicts it's \"going to be bigger than\" the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard's legal battle - and they're gaining engagement and new audiences as they do it. Pro-Baldoni content is spreading wildly online, with some saying that all they know about the story is from Owens, that they're closely following and are invested in her content about the legal tussle, or that this content led them to her other content.\n\nOwens has also tried capturing true crime fans with a series in which she \"transvestigates\" the first lady of France and another about Hollywood producer and convicted sex offender Harvey Weinstein that she says will include an interview with him. In just two months, she has added 1.75 million followers to her social media accounts . Kelly's TikTok video of her interview with Baldoni's lawyer is one of her most-viewed, with 9.1 million views.\n\nFor decades, the right has built a massive media ecosystem to prop up right-wing narratives and politicians. In recent years, they've successfully expanded beyond print and television media into talk radio, social media and now podcasts, streams and other online shows. Some, like Owens and Kelly, are now drawing even bigger audiences by stretching outside their comfort zones. Meanwhile, right-wing narratives have been seeping into supposedly nonpolitical shows, like those of Joe Rogan at Theo Von.\n\nThose shifts have impacts. For instance, you may have heard about how Trump's appearances on popular podcasts brought young men into his winning coalition. But just how bad is the disparity between audiences of these right-leaning versus left-leaning shows? A new Media Matters study assessing popular online shows found that the right's online audiences are five times larger than those of progressives. And many of those shows don't present themselves as political at all.\n\nAs the right seeps into these traditionally nonpolitical spaces, they've also been pushing mainstream media and social media to the right.\n\nIn fact, 72% of the shows we examined that describe themselves as focused on topics like sports, pop culture or comedy were actually right-leaning in terms of their content or guests. Some of the top online shows - like those of Rogan, Von, Andrew Schulz and the Nelk Boys - fall in this category. That means that their tens of millions of followers are hearing not just from celebrity guests like Timothée Chalamet but also from Trump, his allies and right-wing media personalities.\n\nMany of these shows' hosts are also spreading right-wing narratives themselves, such as praising and bolstering Trump's actions and policies.\n\nTake Joe Rogan, whose show is listed as \"comedy\" on both Apple Podcasts and Spotify. But during the first 30 days of Trump's second presidency, Rogan repeatedly praised Trump and promoted his policies while chatting with comedians - claiming \"the new government is emphasizing privacy and freedom of speech,\" praising Trump for getting a deal done in Gaza \"in a day\" while \"the Biden administration had two years, couldn't get anything done,\" and repeating debunked claims that Trump is rooting out widespread fraud and corruption in government agencies like USAID.\n\nOr PBD Podcast , a self-described \"business\" show. Each episode in Trump's first 30 days mentioned him dozens of times, and guests included right-wing media personality Glenn Beck and Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla. The hosts said that \"we're gonna have four years of this just kicking ass,\" \"the market - it's cool to be pro-Trump,\" and \"Trump is always five, six, you know, 10 steps ahead of the other person that he's negotiating with.\"\n\nAs the right seeps into these traditionally nonpolitical spaces, they've also been pushing mainstream media and social media to the right. Just look at CNN laying off staff while reportedly giving pro-MAGA pundit Scott Jennings a hefty raise. Or Meta rolling back its content moderation policies to appease Republicans.\n\nThe right's expansive online ecosystem plays into a fundamental aspect of the current online environment: Outrage and fearmongering garner more attention and engagement than facts. And right-wing media figures have leaned into pop culture to garner more audiences for their content, while comedians, sports commentators and entertainers are pushing right-wing content. The result is that right-wing narratives are seemingly everywhere. And this environment allows Trump and his allies to easily spread propaganda to wide swaths of Americans.\n\nKayla Gogarty is research director at Media Matters for America, a progressive research center that monitors the U.S. media.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Smith is a megaphone for MAGA propaganda\n\nWATCH LIVE: Journalists and political leaders take part in the 2025 White House Correspondents' Dinner\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nBy Ja'han Jones\n\nWhen white nationalist Nick Fuentes recently praised ESPN host Stephen A. Smith , it was just the latest in a series of data points showing how the loudest voice in sports entertainment has become a boon to MAGA world.\n\nFuentes praised Smith , arguably ESPN's most cherished employee, for being \"clearly\" red-pilled (a term for those who have embraced right-wing ideology) since he hosted far-right influencer Candace Owens on his show.\n\nSmith's far-right sympathies have seemed clear to me for years. I still remember, as a high schooler, witnessing his weak defense - interestingly enough, on MSNBC - of right-wingers who formed the anti-Obama tea party back in 2009. And a report I covered last year, highlighting various platforms that disseminate right-wing propaganda and misinformation among Black audiences, listed Smith's show as one of the top culprits.\n\nLast year, for example, Smith told his friend Sean Hannity , whose Fox News show he has appeared on numerous times, that liberals were weaponizing the legal system to stop Donald Trump's momentum ahead of the 2024 election.\n\n\"Primarily, I have voted Democrat throughout my life, but I'm utterly disgusted with what I'm seeing,\" he said.\n\nSmith's embrace of the MAGA movement and its influencers has only continued since then.\n\nSmith's embrace of the MAGA movement and its influencers has only continued since then. In recent days, for example, he has spoken with right-wing commentators Ben Shapiro , Megyn Kelly and Bill O'Reilly . You might be thinking that these were adversarial chats between a left-leaning \"centrist\" and a conservative - but to adroit listeners, they can come across more as conservatives in friendly discussion than anything else.\n\nIn his conversation with Shapiro , in which the two disagreed over whether Trump should pardon Derek Chauvin in the murder of George Floyd, Smith called Shapiro \"a pretty brilliant dude.\" Smith also praised the job Shapiro has done at The Daily Wire, the platform he launched that has become a cesspool of right-wing propaganda .\n\nAppearing on Kelly's show , Smith said \"it's just so bad on the left right now,\" called himself a centrist - and said it would be a \"cakewalk\" for him to win the Democratic primaries for president in 2028.\n\nAnd w hile hosting O'Reilly , Smith accused Democrats of \"hypocrisy\" because Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., used words like \"waste\" and \"abuse\" years ago while discussing Medicare. This seemed like odd bothsidesism that lacked context and gave Smith an opportunity to do what he's been known to do lately: target liberals and provide the Trump administration some cover.\n\nSmith's overt politicism seems to fly in the face of ESPN's apparent effort, in recent years, to deter some of its talent from speaking on controversial political matters . Either way, the network's most recognizable host is now regularly platforming MAGA propaganda at will.\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger. He previously wrote The ReidOut Blog.

      "text": "Influencers and popular podcasts fuel election disinformation among Black voters, report shows\n\nWATCH LIVE: Journalists and political leaders take part in the 2025 White House Correspondents' Dinner\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nAt least 40 million Americans may be regularly targeted and fed disinformation within Black online spaces by a host of sources across social media, fueling false information around the election, according to a new report published Tuesday.\n\nTouted as the first deep dive into understanding disinformation targeting Black America, the report, published by Onyx Impact , a nonprofit organization working to combat disinformation within the Black community, identified half a dozen core online networks \"reaching or targeting\" Black Americans online with false and misleading narratives.\n\nConservative commentators like Candace Owens are among the most influential distributors of false information, according to the report, followed by a variety of sources, such as platforms geared toward the Black manosphere, like the \"Fresh and Fit\" podcast. Some episodes of the show have outright challenged women's intelligence and allowed guests to share false and harmful narratives without pushback.\n\nThe report identifies some platforms like the nationally syndicated radio show, \"The Breakfast Club,\" as a \"gateway influencer\" or an authentic online space that holds critical space for stemming the tide of disinformation. These platforms, however, are also often targets for \"bad actors to introduce harmful narratives,\" according to the report.\n\nThree other effective sources of disinformation, the report notes, are extreme Black nativists and separatists, like Foundational Black Americans who don't believe in the concept of pan-Africanism and have stressed that people who are not descendants of enslaved people should not speak for or on behalf of Black Americans, as well as health skeptics such as Rizza Islam, an activist and self-proclaimed intellectual extremist, who has said without evidence that childhood vaccines \"destroy the brain chemistry\" and lead to autism and other disabilities. According to the CDC , this is not true. None of the other individuals or platforms listed above responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe report also identified foreign actors \"that seek to influence U.S. political discourse,\" like the digital media company African Stream.\n\nAfrican Stream denied spreading misinformation, adding that they \"present an authentically African perspective.\"\n\n\"We have a vigorous fact-checking process, which means work is checked by three different trained journalists three times before posting on our platforms,\" the Nairobi-based company said in a statement, describing their work as a \"Pan-African digital media platform covering affairs concerning Africans at home and in the diaspora.\"\n\nOnyx Impact found those six sources collectively have a potential reach of nearly 41 million Americans, adding that each represents spaces where skepticism, anti-Black rhetoric and deception of truth run rampant. For context, that figure is equivalent to nearly every Black person in the country, according to the latest census data.\n\nOver four months, a team of researchers for Onyx Impact identified 2,500 online accounts creating, sharing or amplifying disinformation to Black communities. The researchers also held seven national focus groups of Black audiences to understand how those narratives were showing up in offline spaces. The point of the effort was to gauge the impact of the information, said the founder of Onyx Impact, Esosa Osa, an alumnus of the voting rights group Fair Fight.\n\nConstant repetition of false or misleading information, \"no matter how kind of absurd that disinformation is,\" said Osa, can be effective across audiences, regardless of income, education or class. \"Disinformation works because the more times that we hear something, the more likely we are to believe that it is true,\" she said.\n\nNarratives with the highest reach and impact across the networks, the report says, include misleading narratives focused on promises that these networks say President Joe Biden has broken, civic engagement and issues that stoke division.\n\nEarlier this year, for example, Owens tweeted without evidence that vaccines cause an \"explosion\" of childhood cancer. But experts, through data , have denied that any link exists. In another instance, Owens shared inaccurate information that the shooter that killed 21 people, including 19 children, at Robb Elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, in 2022 was transgender, an assertion that was based on the wrong photos of the shooter.\n\nCritics have also repeatedly slammed the popular gossip site The Shade Room for being a hub for disinformation, particularly on issues related to Biden. The outlet once reported about a Biden-backed program to distribute \"crack pipes\" to promote health equity. The site ran with an article by The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website. The post quickly went viral, and the White House called it \"misleading and misinformed.\" In reality, the program was harm-reduction program meant to reduce drug overdoses. The Shade Room corrected the information in a follow-up post and took the original post down, but for many , the misinformation had already spread further than the truth.\n\nThe Shade Room did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe report noted that \"confronting the challenges created by misinformation\" is \"crucial to ensuring the health and stability of our democracy.\"\n\nWhen it is left unchecked, experts said, disinformation can have devastating effects on the most marginalized communities, including harming physical and mental health.\n\nTimothy Welbeck, a civil rights attorney and director of the Center for Anti-Racism at Temple University, said disinformation presented as fact has the \"heightened ability\" to influence Black communities' decision-making in ways never before seen, particularly less than five months from a presidential election.\n\n\"It can either encourage [voter] apathy or potentially encourage people to vote differently than they would have already,\" Welbeck said, noting that Americans' biggest issues, from the economy to Israel's war with Hamas to federal judicial appointments, will greatly be affected by who becomes president in November - in his eyes, a direct byproduct of how successful disinformation continues to spread.\n\nOnyx Impact offered strategic guidance in the report to those combating disinformation to engage with those platforms by identifying trusted messengers and discrediting bad actors. While there is no evidence that African Americans are more susceptible to disinformation than any other ethnic group, Osa said, consistent targeting of any group has a way of breaking through.\n\n\"Black voters are likely less susceptible to many disinformation narratives given their deserved higher levels of skepticism in institutions and government overall,\" she said, \"but just like other communities, when disinformation is targeted and comes from messengers with standing, it can be incredibly effective and dangerous.\"\n\nPolling shows that disinformation remains a concern for most Americans.\n\nA national survey published this month by the media reform group Free Press found that 79% of adults in the U.S. worry that what they read online includes \"fake\" or \"false\" information with the deliberate goal to \"confuse.\" The poll of 3,000 people across the U.S. also found that 76% of respondents are concerned that they were reading misleading information online about the presidential election. Black Americans, in particular, are also disproportionately more likely to get their news from social media, the Free Press survey found.\n\nOsa said there is nothing new about increased disinformation and misinformation ahead of recent presidential elections. In 2016, Russia set out to interfere with the election by spreading propaganda on social media, hacking into campaigns and probing state voter databases, according to a Senate report . In 2020, there were coordinated efforts to deter Black voters from going to the polls more systematically, including conservative activists' making more than a thousand fake robocalls to deter Detroit voters, who are overwhelmingly Black, from voting by mail.\n\nToday, however, Osa said, the way disinformation is presented to a population with outsize political power and influence continues to be more sophisticated. Black Americans are projected to account for 14% of eligible voters in November and have a higher turnout rate than Latino voters, despite making up a lower share of the U.S. population.\n\nRecent outreach to Black voters by Biden and former President Donald Trump is evidence of an emphasis on capturing the demographic.\n\nThe latest NBC News poll found that 2 in 3 Black voters ages 18 to 49 support Biden, as well as 88% of older Black voters.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has garnered support from 1 in 4 young Black voters ahead of this year's election and 6% of older Black voters, according to the NBC News poll, in an election in which even minor changes in voting patterns in battleground states could decide the race.\n\nBy comparison, in 2020, no less than 78% of Black voters chose Biden, according to exit polling data .\n\nBut not all experts believe disinformation efforts have substantial influence now or will have it in the future.\n\nDeen Freelon, a presidential professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania and an expert in digital politics, remains hesitant about overstating how deep misinformation runs within the Black community.\n\n\"It is incredibly difficult to draw a straight line between any kind of communication ... and the kinds of attitudinal and behavioral changes that people would like communication to have,\" he said. \"It's just very hard to change people's minds and their behavior in substantial ways from what they're already doing.\"\n\nHowever, Freelon acknowledged that even a slight change in behavior could tip the race to Biden or Trump.\n\n\"The vast majority of people who consume [disinformation] is a small group of people, but in a close election, a small group of people can be sufficient to, at least potentially, sway the election one way or the other,\" he said.\n\nCORRECTION (June 26, 2024, 12:17 a.m. ET): An earlier version of this article misclassified The Breakfast Club, according to the report's criteria. The report classifies it as a \"gateway influencer,\" not as an outright distributor of false information.\n\nFor more from NBC BLK, sign up for our weekly newsletter .\n\nMarquise Francis is a correspondent for \"Stay Tuned.\"\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

He downplayed the deadliness of the novel coronavirus by equating it to a flu, he railed against lifesaving lockdowns and he mused about injecting disinfectant as a remedy. But in a rare show of good sense, Trump has recently been trying to sell his own base on the value of the Covid vaccines.\n\nThe former president wants credit for his administration's role in the vaccines' quick development and distribution. He might not be championing the vaccines for the right reasons, but given that he's likely the single-most influential person in America when it comes to convincing establishment-skeptical conservatives to get the jab, the consequences are beneficial for our country. His sparring with anti-vaccine activists also speaks to tensions within his base that he'll have to reckon with if he runs in 2024.\n\nTrump clearly sees the development of the vaccines while he was president as an opportunity to secure his historical legacy.\n\nIn an interview for The Daily Wire with right-wing commentator Candace Owens, Trump gushed about the development of the three major Covid vaccines in the United States while he was still president, and, in true Trumpian fashion, took credit for them as if he had engineered them in the lab himself.\n\n\"The vaccine is one of the greatest achievements of mankind,\" Trump said. \"I came up with a vaccine - with three vaccines - all are very, very good ... in less than nine months. It was supposed to take five to 12 years.\"\n\nJust going to echo former President Trump here on the safety and efficacy of the vaccines. Merry Christmas eve eve. go get boosted https://t.co/0PCffM5kHl\n\n(Trump had a mixed record on vaccine development: He politicized the process by leaning inappropriately on regulators for approval, but his investment and interest in assisting with development and deployment was helpful in speeding it up.)\n\nWhen Owens replied that more people have died from Covid during President Joe Biden's term than Trump's (which is not correct ) and suggested that it raised questions about the efficacy of the vaccines, Trump interrupted to defend them.\n\n\"The vaccine worked, but some people aren't taking it,\" he said. \"The ones that get very sick and go to the hospital are the ones who don't take their vaccine. But it's still their choice.\"\n\n\"And if you take the vaccine, you're protected,\" Trump went on. \"The results of the vaccine are very good. And if you do get it, it's a very minor form. People aren't dying when they take their vaccine.\"\n\nDuring that same interview, he criticized mask mandates, including for children in schools. But the takeaway was unapologetic advocacy for getting vaccinated in the face of misinformation about whether the vaccines work.\n\nTrump's reasoning emerged more starkly during an interview at a public event with Bill O'Reilly on Sunday. He championed the vaccines as something that saved millions of lives and something that should be considered a badge of pride. \"Take credit for it. Take credit for it. It's a great - what we've done is historic. Don't let them take it away. Don't take it away from ourselves. You're playing right into their hands, when you're sort of like like, 'Oh the vaccine.'\" Trump later revealed he had gotten a booster and rebuffed boos from the crowd.\n\nThere are a couple things going on here. Trump clearly sees the development of the vaccines while he was president as an opportunity to secure his historical legacy, to argue that he shaped global events during his time in the White House. And he also views it as politically advantageous for the right to try to own the Covid vaccines and claim to have authored them.\n\nTrump's expediency is unsightly as always, but the more comforting truth that underlies it is that Trump does seem to believe in the effectiveness of the vaccines himself. He got vaccinated while he was in the White House, and he's since taken a booster - and he seemed happy to share that news at the event with O'Reilly. Particularly as the wildfire spread of omicron has fueled new conspiracy theories and false claims about how the vaccines are not worthwhile, it's tremendously valuable to have Trump willing to confront skeptics.\n\nIf Trump does run in 2024, it goes without saying that he could backtrack if he determines that his vaccine views could be an electoral liability. But his apparent belief that they work and his belief that they will put him on the right side of history, even if only for reasons of ego, are a boon for America.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Yet, right-wingers have promoted the false idea that womanhood is \"under attack\" by the existence of trans people and some women's rejection of the view that their only roles should be homemaking and child-rearing .\n\nAnd the summit plans to feature several MAGA women who've done well trafficking in this kind of hysteria, from far-right agitator Candace Owens to anti-trans activist Riley Gaines to former Fox News host Megyn Kelly and others.\n\nFeast your eyes on this lineup:\n\nAttendees at last year's event were treated to speeches from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and failed Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake; a \"Make Canceled Cool\" discussion panel for MAGA women to gripe about public criticism they say they've received for their ultraconservative views; and even dating advice from TPUSA founder Charlie Kirk .\n\nA Washington Post dispatch from last year's event perfectly describes the combination of the grifting and far-right victimhood one can expect at these events:\n\nIn the exhibition hall, the young women were greeted with products that were created for feminine non-feminists. Like Garnuu, a brand that proudly declares that feminine products are for \"Girls Only. Period.\" Or Hope Beauty, which sells \"biblically inspired cosmetics.\" Or the Right Stuff, a dating app for women who want to filter out any men who might be - as Turning Point founder Charlie Kirk put it during a session on dating advice - \"feminized versions of metrosexual culture.\" Or Turning Point's official merchandise, which includes a sweatshirt proclaiming, in the style of the Chanel No. 5 logo, that, \"No 1 cares about your pronouns.\"\n\nThis summit is not an outlier, either. As I've noted previously , Turning Point USA and its affiliates are leading the public relations effort for Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Trump even appeared at a TPUSA-aligned church Thursday. And the summit is drawing some of the movement's most well-known figures for promoting this outmoded conception of womanhood. Turning Point Action is hosting what it is calling \"The People's Convention\" - essentially, an off-brand RNC convention - in Michigan next week, slated to draw right-wing lawmakers and influencers.\n\nBut the summit also shows how gender politics are playing a key role in the GOP's push to regain control in Washington. The MAGA movement is structured around hypermasculinity , and that worldview requires women to abide by rigid gender roles that undermine their civil rights and sense of independence.\n\nThe Young Women's Leadership Summit is an attempt by Republicans to put a positive spin on what that will likely mean for the women of the United States.\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger.

      "text": "Madam C.J. Walker's descendant doesn't want these Republicans speaking on her ancestor\n\nWATCH LIVE: Journalists and political leaders take part in the 2025 White House Correspondents' Dinner\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nBy Zahara Hill\n\nMadam C.J. Walker was born to former slaves , orphaned, abused, widowed, raised a child alone - and still found a way to secure her place in the Guinness World Records as the first American woman to become a self-made millionaire. Her millionaire status would later be disputed , but in her lifetime, her success was still largely unparalleled.\n\nWalker, a hair care mogul, is one to talk about. But her great-great-granddaughter A'Lelia Bundles, who has written five books on her ancestor, doesn't want everyone getting in on the discourse.\n\nNonetheless, a few Republicans and showrunners have taken it upon themselves to play fast and loose with Walker's legacy anyway.\n\nAmong these is Dinesh D'Souza and his 2014 political commentary film \"America: Imagine the World Without Her,\" in which he introduces a character billed as Madam C.J. Walker. The character is seen giving a motivational speech to a group of women, using herself as an example that success can be had no matter the hardships.\n\nA few Republicans and showrunners have taken it upon themselves to play fast and loose with Walker's legacy anyway.\n\n\"I got my start by giving myself a start,\" the woman says. \"Ladies, there is no flower-strewn path to success. And if there is, I haven't found it. If I've accomplished anything in my life, it's because I was willing to work hard.\"\n\nWalker did give an inspirational speech at the 13th Annual Convention of the Negro Business League in 1912 in which she alluded to having overcome adversity. But she didn't co-sign any delusions in her speech about bootstrapping one's self to success in America.\n\nWalker, having been excluded from the convention's speaker lineup, instead demanded recognition for her business from conference curators and attendees. While there, she announced that her goal for her wealth was to give back, including her aspiration to build a Tuskegee Institute (America's first historically Black college) in Africa.\n\nD'Souza's work left that bit out.\n\nInstead, the Walker character in his film seems to suggest that America is the sweet land of meritocracy - slavery and its consequences be damned. Speaking as narrator, D'Souza then goes on to assert that Walker has been left out of history books because her trajectory doesn't align with what he refers to as the \"shame narrative.\"\n\nAs if D'Souza's cockamamie thesis wasn't bad enough, Bundles recalls that the Trump White House name-checked Walker in its 2017 Black History Month statement. Nearly a year later, the then-president would refer to Haiti and nations in Africa, where Walker sought to build a school, as \"s---hole countries.\"\n\nThe paradox is overwhelming, and Bundles would prefer that the aforementioned politicos keep some distance from Walker's legacy.\n\n\"Keep her [name] out of your mouth,\" Bundles said of Republicans like D'Souza and Trump officials.\n\n\"Because you don't really understand what she's about. She was a radical,\" Bundles said of her ancestor's advocacy.\n\n\"She was Black Lives Matter 1.0.\"\n\nA'Lelia Bundles on Madam c.j. waLKER\n\nIn 1917, in the wake of the riots in East Saint Louis , the National Convention of the Madam C.J. Walker Agents wrote a letter to President Woodrow Wilson urging him to take action against lynchings and to ensure Black soldiers fighting for America in World War I would be afforded civil rights upon their return.\n\nOne year later, she and journalist Ida B. Wells were referred to as \"Negro subversives\" in a military intelligence report. Bundles found that her ancestor had been surveilled by a Black spy, Walter H. Loving , from the war department. Walker and Wells were named in the report alongside six men whom Loving described as being \"more or less agitators.\"\n\nHe suggested Walker, Wells and the six men be prevented from obtaining passports , Bundles writes in her biography of Walker, \"On Her Ground.\" By denying them passports, William E. Allen, acting director of the Bureau of Investigation, sought to stop them from raising the \"Negro question\" at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919.\n\nPerhaps D'Souza should have found another poster woman (people like Candace Owens exist for a reason).\n\nBut D'Souza isn't the only one to attempt to flip Walker's legacy.\n\nNetflix's \"Self-Made\" biopic was supposed to be based on Bundles' 2002 biography, referenced above. Despite her work being the basis for the series, Bundles says it misrepresented several areas of Walker's life, and the showrunners veered off course.\n\nBundles wrote multiple searing op-eds in response and did interviews speaking out against the four-part series. \"They really misled people about the real pieces of Madam Walker's life - her philanthropy, her commitment to African American activism and her inspiration for other women,\" Bundles said.\n\nWalker's philanthropy was so wide-reaching that it became the cornerstone for a book on the charitable works of Black women. She made financial contributions to the National Association of Colored Women, to the NAACP and to several Tuskegee Institute students.\n\nAs Bundles puts it, \"she was Black Lives Matter 1.0.\"\n\nZahara Hill is a platforms editor for MSNBC Digital.

Did she forget about Jesus?\n\nWATCH LIVE: Journalists and political leaders take part in the 2025 White House Correspondents' Dinner\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nThe presidential election might be over, but Trump surrogates aren't done playing the man card to energize their base. After attacking President-elect Joe Biden for the size of his mask and implying that protecting others made him less of a man , they've moved on to being provoked by another piece of cloth: a dress.\n\nShockingly, men don't come out of utero sporting a nifty pair of trousers or cargo shorts.\n\nAfter pop icon Harry Styles posed on the cover of Vogue wearing a ball gown, conservative radio host and Trump endorser Erick Erickson tweeted : \"Biden gets elected by promising a return to normal. Then the left goes all in on men in dresses.\"\n\nBiden gets elected by promising a return to normal. Then the left goes all in on men in dresses.\n\nJust to prove that women can also perpetuate patriarchy despite being disproportionately harmed by it, right-wing extremist Candace Owens followed up by tweeting that \"there is no society that can survive without strong men,\" and that we need to \"bring back manly men.\"\n\nThere is no society that can survive without strong men. The East knows this. In the west, the steady feminization of our men at the same time that Marxism is being taught to our children is not a coincidence. It is an outright attack. Bring back manly men. https://t.co/sY4IJF7VkK\n\nThe truth is that throughout history, men have always sported so-called dresses. And not that it matters, but most of them would be considered \"manly men\" under Owens' own extremely rigid definition of manhood, a topic on which she curiously claims to be an expert.\n\nShockingly, men don't come out of utero sporting a nifty pair of trousers or cargo shorts. In fact, pants made their first appearance when humans started riding horses about 3,000 years ago . Owens might find it noteworthy that that's also why high heels were invented , and why men wore them first. But since pants really seem important to people like Owens, let's talk about the several men - unequivocally touted as historical models of manliness - who never wore pants.\n\nTo clear up this confusion, and to avoid this unfortunate misunderstanding about the fact that men have been rocking a diversity of clothing for centuries, I've made a nonexhaustive list of men who aren't known for wearing the pants, well, anywhere.\n\n1. Jesus\n\nLet's start with a classic \"manly man.\" That's right, the Kings of Kings, Jesus Christ. According to historians , he wore a thin one-piece knee-length cloth tunic (called a chitōn), was a common undergarment for most men at the time. But because of his focus on income redistribution and helping the poor (another concept known for making Owens gasp ), it make sense that he wouldn't dress like the wealthier men of his time, who wore fuller length tunics. If Owens wants to live in a fantasy world in which men have always and exclusively worn pants, I wouldn't recommend she visit anyone in ancient Greece or Rome, where tunics were a hit with men.\n\n2. Hercules\n\nSpeaking of ancient Greece, one of the most magnetic and lasting male archetypes of strength and stamina in Greek mythology was also technically a dude in a skirt. Known for going from zero to hero, the son of Zeus (another guy who was known for not being afraid to wear a dress) wasn't just notorious for conquering monsters like Cacus and defeating the Titans , but also for doing it all without ever relying on pants.\n\nIn most depictions of the demigod , he is portrayed wearing a very-not-vegan-friendly lion's pelt, and in both Marvel's and Disney's portrayals of the superhero, he rocks a sporty rust-orange skirt . Could Owens argue that Hercules, the ultimate symbol of strength and courage is any less of a man because of what he wears? \" No chance, no way .\" (If you don't get that reference, you're far too young to be reading this article.)\n\n3. King Henry VIII\n\nOften referred to as one of the best-dressed sovereigns of all time, Henry VIII did not try and hide his shopping addiction or his love for colorful velvet gowns. According to the book \"Henry VIII: The King and His Court\" by Alison Weir, he spent more than $10,500 (today's equivalent of around $3 million according to the author) a year on clothes every year.\n\nFor comparison, that's a tad more than the $70,000 President Donald Trump reportedly spent on his hair. Weir writes that James Worsley, who was the equivalent of King Henry VIII's stylist, said that the king's closet was packed with everything from \"mantles, gowns of cloth of gold and velvet, coats, jackets and doublets, glaudkyns (surcoats), bases, girdles, belts, furs and sables, powdered ermines, cloths of gold of divers colors, velvets, satins, damasks, sarcanets and linen cloths.\" He also said that in 1547, his inventory included not one, but 41 gowns. Henry VIII also had 25 pairs of hose, 23 pairs of girdles and \"several bonnets.\" The man was a legend.\n\n4. Gandalf\n\nIn one of her threads about how petrified she is of men wearing dresses, Owens mentions Lord of the Rings as one of her favorite movies in a response to actor Elijah Wood's chiming in about what masculinity means to him. Which is rib-tickling because the movie is basically about a bunch of guys fighting in dresses or skirts.\n\nDON'T TEMPT ME, FRODO!!! https://t.co/dQVC6pM0X2\n\nOwens's reply features a gif of Gandalf , one of the most senior wizards in the trilogy, the leader of the Fellowship of the Ring. While his enormous hat and scepter may have been the most iconic parts of his Oscar-winning outfit, I'd be remiss not to mention his dark grey cloak, which Owens may be very disappointed to learn does not have separate holes for each leg.\n\n5. Every Supreme Court judge, ever\n\nWith all eyes on the Supreme Court in the weeks leading up to the election, you would think it would be obvious that the outfit judges wear to court is called a robe, which literally translates to \"dress\" in French. Of course, one could argue that male and female judges wear the same robe, and I would argue that that is precisely the point. We don't blink twice when judges show up to court in the same outfit. So, why do we have a public meltdown when Styles shows up on a Vogue cover in the same outfit as Ariana Grande?\n\nLiz Plank is an award-winning journalist and author, was the host of \"Positive Spin.\" Her book, \" For the Love of Men: A New Vision for Mindful Masculinity ,\" was published in 2019.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

The gathering in Detroit is being hosted by Turning Point Action, which is an affiliate of Turning Point USA, the organization founded by right-wing activist Charlie Kirk .\n\nTPUSA and TPAction have effectively assumed much of the responsibility for coordinating Trump's 2024 campaign, and the past few weeks have helped underscore that. TPUSA affiliates, for example, organized recent Trump events in Harlem and the Bronx , as well as last week's MAGA-fueled Young Women's Leadership Summit in Texas.\n\nKirk has warred with the national Republican Party's traditional power brokers for years, while portraying his organizations as grassroots and the MAGA movement's rightful shepherds.\n\nKirk has warred with the national Republican Party's traditional power brokers for years , while portraying his organizations as grassroots and the MAGA movement's rightful shepherds. (For the record, TPUSA has been propped up by multiple uber-rich backers .) Some people may have thought Kirk's successful push to oust Ronna McDaniel as RNC chair in favor of more obsequious Trump loyalists was the culmination of his efforts on that front. But The People's Convention is arguably the crown jewel of his quest to wrest power and clout from the national GOP.\n\nYou can see in this promotional tweet , for example, that The People's Convention is being branded as an alternative to the Republican National Convention. (And this convention, unlike the actual RNC next month, has the benefit of occurring before Trump's July 11 sentencing in his hush money case.)\n\nAlong with Trump, scheduled speakers include vice presidential hopefuls, such as Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida, in addition to the likes of Steve Bannon , Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, failed presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy and right-wing activist Candace Owens. And sure - that may not sound like a group of A-listers to you , but the list undoubtedly represents the power center of today's conservative movement. And they're all lining up to speak at this RNC knockoff.\n\nHaving witnessed how Kirk's organization transformed Arizona's GOP chapter for the worse, Arizona Republic columnist Phil Boas predicted that TPUSA and Kirk's cold war with GOP leadership could destroy the national Republican Party .\n\nI agree - and The People's Convention is just Kirk's latest shot across the bow.\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger.

Some of these people worked for the right wing's biggest names, including Tucker Carlson , Ron DeSantis and Donald Trump .\n\nWhat started in the shadows is now right in the open. It's being advanced by some of the most powerful and influential people in America, and there is nothing subtle about it. The latest eruption started with a fight between the Daily Wire co-founder Ben Shapiro and his Daily Wire colleague Candace Owens. Both are immensely popular right-wing stars. Owens, for example, has more than four million followers on X, formerly known as Twitter, and more than five million on Instagram.\n\nOn Nov. 3, Owens posted on social media, \"No government anywhere has a right to commit a genocide, ever. There is no justification for a genocide. I can't believe this even needs to be said or is even considered the least bit controversial to state.\" Many of her followers interpreted this as a criticism of Israel, and Shapiro, who staunchly supports Israel in its present conflict with Hamas, was later caught on tape at a private event saying Owens's behavior during the war has been \" disgraceful .\"\n\nDaily Wire drama should be of little interest to anyone outside The Daily Wire, but what happened next was truly alarming. First, Jason Whitlock, a leading personality at The Blaze, one of the largest right-wing websites, accused Shapiro of dual loyalties : \"The guy has multiple loyalties.

Shear John Eligon and Maggie Haberman\n\nWASHINGTON - The surprise hits of the annual gathering of right-wing activists in Washington were appearances by three black women. Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson, better known as Diamond and Silk, thanked the organizers for inviting them - \"two conservative black chicks\" - before mocking reparations. Candace Owens, the fiery young YouTube sensation, called on black people to escape from the country's liberal ideology.\n\nTheir unapologetic support for President Trump was greeted with huge applause at the Conservative Political Action Conference, which concluded Saturday with an appearance by the president. Days before, Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's former lawyer and fixer, testified before a Congressional committee that the president is a racist who had once said that black people were \"too stupid\" to vote for him.\n\n\"I don't believe the president said that,\" Ms. Owens said in an interview from the bustling convention hall on Friday. \"The second you put him in front of a crowd of black Americans, they love him. They walk away and they say, 'he's amazing.'\"\n\nAll three women are part of the small but diverse collection of black Trump supporters who operate out of TV studio green rooms and appear at rallies far from the president's inner circle in the West Wing. They advocate on the president's behalf. Their very presence, some of Mr. Trump's backers argue, is evidence that the president's critics are wrong that he is a racist.\n\nAt the committee hearing, the surprise appearance of a black Trump surrogate raised fresh debates in Washington about the paltry number of black people who are in Mr. Trump's orbit - the few who have worked in his private company or work in his White House, serve in his cabinet and speak for him on his favorite medium of cable news - and what their presence means for the administration.\n\nAccording to some polls, 92 percent of black voters, who are overwhelmingly Democrats, disapprove of Mr. Trump.

      "text": "How Russia and Right-Wing Americans Converged on War in Ukraine\n\nRussia-Ukraine War\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nSome conservatives have echoed the Kremlin's misleading claims about the war and vice versa, giving each other's assertions a sheen of credibility.\n\nBy Sheera Frenkel and Stuart A. Thompson\n\nSheera Frenkel and Stuart Thompson, who cover tech and misinformation, combed through more than four dozen videos, podcasts and social media posts for this article.\n\nAfter President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia claimed that action against Ukraine was taken in self-defense, the Fox News host Tucker Carlson and the conservative commentator Candace Owens repeated the assertion. When Mr. Putin insisted he was trying to \" denazify \" Ukraine, Joe Oltmann , a far-right podcaster, and Lara Logan , another right-wing commentator, mirrored the idea.\n\nThe echoing went the other way, too. Some far-right American news sites, like Infowars, stoked a longtime, unfounded Russian claim that the United States funded biological weapons labs in Ukraine. Russian officials seized on the chatter, with the Kremlin contending it had documentation of bioweapons programs that justified its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine.\n\nAs war has raged, the Kremlin's talking points and some right-wing discourse in the United States - fueled by those on the far right - have coalesced. On social media, podcasts and television, falsehoods about the invasion of Ukraine have flowed both ways, with Americans amplifying lies from Russians and the Kremlin spreading fabrications that festered in American forums online.\n\nBy reinforcing and feeding each other's messaging, some right-wing Americans have given credibility to Russia's assertions and vice versa. Together, they have created an alternate reality, recasting the Western bloc of allies as provokers, blunderers and liars, which has bolstered Mr. Putin.\n\nThe war initially threw some conservatives - who had insisted no invasion would happen - for a loop. Many criticized Mr. Putin and Russia's assault on Ukraine. Some have since gone on to urge more support for Ukraine.\n\nBut in recent days, several far-right commentators have again gravitated to narratives favorable to Mr. Putin's cause. The main one has been the bioweapons conspiracy theory , which has provided a way to talk about the war while focusing criticism on President Biden and the U.S. government instead of Mr. Putin and the Kremlin.\n\nMedia mentions related to bioweapons labs in Ukraine spiked at the start of the invasion among English-language media. Days later, Russian-language media joined in.\n\nNote: Moving average of the preceding three days. Media includes news sources, social media, online videos and forums.\n\nSource: Zignal Labs\n\nBy The New York Times\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "'I'll Stand on the Side of Russia': Pro-Putin Sentiment Spreads Online\n\nRussia-Ukraine War\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nAfter marinating in conspiracy theories and Donald J. Trump's Russia stance, some online discourse about Vladimir Putin has grown more complimentary.\n\nBy Davey Alba and Stuart A. Thompson\n\nDavey Alba and Stuart Thompson, tech reporters based in New York, report on online information flows.\n\nThe day before Russia invaded Ukraine, former President Donald J. Trump called the wartime strategy of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia \" pretty smart .\" His remarks were posted on YouTube, Twitter and the messaging app Telegram, where they were viewed more than 1.3 million times.\n\nRight-wing commentators including Candace Owens, Stew Peters and Joe Oltmann also jumped into the fray online with posts that were favorable to Mr. Putin and that rationalized his actions against Ukraine. \"I'll stand on the side of Russia right now,\" Mr. Oltmann, a conservative podcaster, said on his show this week.\n\nAnd in Telegram groups like The Patriot Voice and Facebook groups including Texas for Donald Trump 2020, members criticized President Biden's handling of the conflict and expressed support for Russia, with some saying they trusted Mr. Putin more than Mr. Biden.\n\nThe online conversations reflect how pro-Russia sentiment has increasingly penetrated Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, right-wing podcasts, messaging apps like Telegram and some conservative media. As Russia attacked Ukraine this week, those views spread, infusing the online discourse over the war with sympathy - and even approval - for the aggressor.\n\nThe positive Russia comments are an extension of the culture wars and grievance politics that have animated the right in the United States in the past few years. In some of these circles, Mr. Putin carries a strongman appeal, viewed as someone who gets his way and does not let political correctness stop him.\n\n\"Putin embodies the strength that Trump pretended to have,\" said Emerson T. Brooking, a resident senior fellow for the Atlantic Council who studies digital platforms. \"For these individuals, Putin's actions aren't a tragedy - they're a fantasy fulfilled.\"\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Alarm, Denial, Blame: The Pro-Trump Media's Coronavirus Distortion\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nSean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh and other right-wing commentators turned a pandemic into a battle of us vs. them - the kind of battle President Trump has waged for much of his life.\n\nBy Jeremy W. Peters\n\nOn Feb. 27, two days after the first reported case of the coronavirus spreading inside a community in the United States, Candace Owens was underwhelmed. \"Now we're all going to die from Coronavirus,\" she wrote sarcastically to her two million Twitter followers, blaming a \"doomsday cult\" of liberal paranoia for the growing anxiety over the outbreak.\n\nOne month later, on the day the United States reached the grim milestone of having more documented coronavirus cases than anywhere in the world, Ms. Owens - a conservative commentator whom President Trump has called \"a real star\" - was back at it, offering what she said was \"a little perspective\" on the 1,000 American deaths so far. \"The 2009 swine flu infected 1.4 Billion people around the world, and killed 575,000 people,\" she wrote . \"There was no media panic, and societies did not shut down.\"\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the escalation of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States, tens of millions of Americans who get their information from media personalities like Ms. Owens heard that this once-in-a-lifetime global health crisis was actually downright ordinary.\n\nThe president's backers sometimes seemed to take their cues from him. On Feb. 26, the day before Ms. Owens was a guest at the White House for an African-American History Month reception, Mr. Trump denied it would spread further. \"I don't think it's inevitable,\" he said.\n\nAt other times, the president echoed right-wing media stars. When he declared at a campaign rally two days later that criticism of his halting response was a \"new hoax,\" commentators like Laura Ingraham of Fox News had already been accusing his opponents of exploiting the crisis. \"A coronavirus,\" she said on Feb. 25, \"that's a new pathway for hitting President Trump.\" And when he falsely asserted that he had treated the outbreak as a pandemic all along, Fox hosts like Sean Hannity backed him up, saying that Mr. Trump's decision to restrict travel from China and Europe would \"go down as the single most consequential decision in history.\"\n\nA review of hundreds of hours of programming and social media traffic from Jan. 1 through mid-March - when the White House started urging people to stay home and limit their exposure to others - shows that doubt, cynicism and misinformation about the virus took root among many of Mr. Trump's boosters in the right-wing media as the number of confirmed cases in the United States grew.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Why MAGA Loves Russia and Hates Ukraine\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSubscriber-only Newsletter\n\nBy David French\n\nOpinion Columnist\n\nAs I type this newsletter, continued American aid for Ukraine is in grave doubt. Tucker Carlson is in Moscow to conduct a friendly interview with Vladimir Putin. And we're receiving reports from the front lines that Russia is advancing, in part because of Ukrainian ammunition shortages. In short, the war is reaching a critical stage, and Ukraine may lose because Republicans are willing to hand authoritarian Russia a historic military victory rather than supply further aid to a democratic ally.\n\nRonald Reagan isn't just rolling over in his grave; he may also lurch from it in a fit of incredulous rage. This is a remarkable and potentially catastrophic reversal by a political party that is in a state of near-total, frequently random ideological transformation.\n\nTo explain the intensity of Republican resistance to Ukraine aid, I need to return to a concept I wrote about in November: that of bespoke realities . My friend Renée DiResta, the technical research manager at the Stanford Internet Observatory, coined the term, and she wrote that it refers to the \"bubble realities\" constructed by communities \"that operate with their own norms, media, trusted authorities and frameworks of facts.\"\n\nAmong those who oppose aid to Ukraine, there are certainly several paleoconservatives who object on classic isolationist grounds: It's not our fight, our support is costly, we might find ourselves inadvertently embroiled in war, and so on. But the mass Republican movement against Ukraine is rooted far less in policy than it is in a particular bespoke reality of the MAGA universe, in which Ukraine is a pernicious villain, Putin is a flawed hero and Russia should have crushed Ukraine long ago.\n\nMAGA Republicans' hatred and contempt for Volodymyr Zelensky and the Ukrainian cause is shockingly vehement. Candace Owens says she wants to \" punch \" Zelensky. Donald Trump Jr. calls him an \" international welfare queen .\" Carlson says he dresses \" like the manager of a strip club .\" It's all bizarre and unreasonable. And it all fits the broader MAGA narrative.\n\nLet's break it down, step by step. First, if you're stumped by the notion that Ukraine is a villain, you may need reminding of a conspiracy theory that is now largely forgotten but was prevalent on the right at the time of Donald Trump's first impeachment. In his infamous conversation with Zelensky - the one that triggered the impeachment - Trump asked Zelensky about a \"CrowdStrike\" server allegedly being held in Ukraine.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Thompson\n\nIn the 24 hours before Elon Musk closed his deal for Twitter on Thursday, thousands of new accounts were created on the social media service and joined a broader surge of new followers for some of the platform's most influential far-right accounts, according to research from Memetica, a digital investigations company.\n\nThe Twitter account of Kari Lake, a Republican candidate for governor in Arizona, gained 18,000 followers in the last 24 hours, a 600 percent increase from the usual number of new followers that Ms. Lake typically sees in a day, according to Memetica. Of those 18,000 new followers, over 3,100 were new to Twitter.\n\nRepresentative Lauren Boebert, a Republican of Colorado, gained over 18,679 new followers in the last 24 hours, a 1,200 percent jump above normal, Memetica said. Nearly half of those new followers were also new to Twitter.\n\nAnd Candace Owens, a conservative media personality, gained over 3,700 new followers in the last 24 hours, 300 percent above normal. Of her new followers, over 2,300 accounts were new to Twitter, according to Memetica.\n\nIt's unclear if the activity was connected to Mr. Musk's ownership of Twitter. The billionaire has described himself as a \"free speech absolutist\" who wants to make the social media platform a more freewheeling place for all types of commentary.\n\nBen Decker, the chief executive of Memetica, said the findings were alarming because many of the far-right figures who experienced spikes in followers \"are really well known purveyors of disinformation, harassment, and hate.\" The accounts have shared misinformation about voter fraud in the 2020 presidential elections and made unsubstantiated claims about potential fraud in the upcoming Nov. 8 midterm elections.\n\nFOLLOWERS\n\nGAINED ON FRIDAY\n\nUSER

      "text": "The Establishment Right's Alliance With Open Bigots Is Under a New Kind of Pressure\n\nWhen Candace Owens, the far-right political commentator, parted ways with conservative media company the Daily Wire in late March, the news unleashed something strange on the internet. Factions emerged to yell at each other about theology, censorship, and bigotry. Extremists chatted with establishment right-wingers in audio chatrooms on social media.

Fuentes has said that the phrase is the \"spiritual and moral foundation\" of his America First movement-an explicitly antisemitic campaign. And in the months that followed Owens' exchange with Shapiro, right-wing users on X took to posting the phrase as a reply to Jewish accounts, usually with an aggressively bigoted subtext .\n\nLast month, Owens' antisemitic comments grew more explicit. She claimed that there was a \"sinister\" \"ring\" of Jews in Hollywood. In an online feud with a famous rabbi, she liked a post on X asking if he was \"drunk on Christian blood again.\"\n\nFuentes was delighted. \"Candace Owens has just been on a tear lately,\" he said on his March 19 show. \"She has been in a full-fledged war against the Jews, and specifically some of these Zionist rabbis. And I've been watching her evolution.

In some cases-Fuentes was likely pleased to see this-the critical posts were met with a backlash by people who either missed the context or were feigning ignorance. Other users, meanwhile, said they believed that people on the right should always assume that \"Christ Is King\" is said in good faith and that, regardless, speech should never be policed. Still others responded to the chaos by adding their own \"Christ Is King\" posts to the mix, as a stand against \"wokeism\" suppressing religious speech.\n\nTaken together, it was often impossible to tell apart the ostentatiously pious from the confused, the trolls, or the hateful white nationalists.\n\nAnd Fuentes' people seemed to rise in legitimacy by their participation in the discourse. In a conversation on Twitter/X Spaces about the phrase hosted by a Turning Point USA contributor and show host for the Blaze, Boreing ended up in conversation with a group of notable right-wingers that included anti-Muslim activist Laura Loomer-and Fuentes, who also took the opportunity to spew antisemitic nonsense. Some observers were shocked to hear Boreing-again, the CEO of the Daily Wire, a company that is so influential it has its own film studio and, now, streaming network -tell Fuentes he wouldn't be opposed to debating him on a Daily Wire platform. \"I listen to your show quite often,\" Boreing said. \"I think you're one of the most talented people out there, and I'm very concerned about some of the things that you're saying.\" On that same call, Fuentes praised Hitler as a \"statesman\" and complained that \"Jews run our society.\"\n\nTo Ben Lorber, a senior researcher at Political Research Associates, a think tank that monitors right-wing movements, this was a remarkable moment in showing just how far the window of acceptable discourse has shifted among establishment right-wingers. Turning Point USA's Charlie Kirk has discussed \" Jewish dollars \" funding \"cultural Marxism\"; Elon Musk has amplified a conspiracy theory claiming that Jewish people are promoting \"hatred against whites\" and bringing \"hordes of minorities\" into Western nations.\n\n\"All these things were the stuff of 4chan a few years ago,\" Lorber said. \"Suddenly, it's acceptable to think Jews shouldn't have leadership positions in America.\"\n\nIn another way though, the argument was literally an ancient one. The confusion echoed some of the oldest and ugliest sectarian conflicts in the Western world. Even as the news cycle itself amounted to a triumph for Fuentes and his trolls, the group succeeded by raising a question among Christian nationalists: If your animosity toward another religion and its adherents is based in your own religious beliefs, why is expressing that animosity not considered legitimate speech-especially when your political party claims to stand for religious freedom?\n\nUndoubtedly, some of the backlash to Owens' firing came from people who were purely hateful and gleeful at sowing chaos-edgelords with a taste for offense. But the religious core of some of the backlash was visible in the response the Daily Wire's Andrew Klavan received after he spoke up against harassing Jewish accounts with \"Christ Is King\": \"When you use that phrase to mean God has abandoned his chosen people, the Jews, through whom he came into this world incarnate ... you are quoting Scripture like Satan does in the Bible,\" he said. \"You are quoting Scripture to your purposes, and that to me is specifically wicked.\"\n\nAndrew Torba, the CEO of the right-wing social network Gab-a platform that welcomes open bigotry, slurs, and hate speech-and self-proclaimed Christian nationalist, responded in his newsletter: \"First of all the Bible is very clear: God's Chosen People are Christians, not unbelieving Christ-rejecting Jews.\" He, like many other participants in the conversation, was incensed that he was being told by his own allies not to publicly proclaim such beliefs. \"New 'sins' are being fabricated from thin air not by the Christless pagans on the left, but by those who claim to be Christians on the conservative right.\"\n\nConservative Christians overwhelmingly support Israel, in part because of their fondness for the peoples of the Hebrew Bible. A smaller subset of evangelical Christians support Israel because they see it as necessary (along with the conversion of Jews) to pave the way for the Second Coming. There's no simple unified stance within Christianity toward Jews and Israel. But there is one common stance, held by a large portion of churches, including the religion's single largest denomination: the Catholic Church. The church is aware of the centuries of persecution against Jews that it fostered and the remaining modern-day dangers of antisemitic dogmas, and it officially rejects \"supersessionism\"-the theology Torba is promoting, which argues that Christians have replaced Jews as God's chosen people.\n\n\"It's dismissed at least in theory by most Christian traditions for being antisemitic,\" Zack Hunt, a Christian nonfiction writer and the author of Unraptured: How End Times Theology Gets It Wrong , wrote in an email. \"But in practice, at least among laity, but also many pastors, especially in fundamentalist and evangelical circles, there's an unspoken understanding that it's basically true.\"\n\nSo, if you spent any time on right-wing social media during this debate, you saw a portion of those in the conservative movement arguing over not just whether they are allowed to say edgy things but whether they are allowed to openly profess that they, as Christians, view Jews as inferior at best and culpable in their savior's murder at worst. For leading Jewish conservatives, such as Shapiro, it must have been pretty unpleasant. But people who believe this are the bedfellows that people like Shapiro have chosen to make.\n\n\"Now mainstream conservatives are forced to debate Is it OK that Jews don't believe in Jesus? \" Lorber, the researcher of right-wing movements, said. \" Is it OK to have Jews in your movement if it's a Christian nationalist movement? What's the place for people like Ben Shapiro? \"\n\nSo, while the war in Gaza naturally brought out conflicts between isolationists and Israel-supporting conservatives, it also revealed-with the help of internet trolls eager to erode religious pluralism on the right-the fragility of the working relationship between extreme right-wing Christians and conservative Jews in their coalition.\n\nA week later, the heat has died down. Conservative Christians were able to unite over a less dicey stance: condemning the Biden administration for celebrating National Transgender Day of Visibility, which this year fell on Easter Sunday. But the rift over Jews on the right was, for a week at least, exposed-and it remains a raw subject. For the trolls who managed to occupy space alongside leading members of the right, it was a major victory.\n\nUpdate, April 5, 2024: This piece has been updated to flesh out Boreing's comments to Fuentes on X Spaces.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "How the Right Won Podcasting\n\nFor decades, American liberals have been waiting for a presidential election without the red-cast shadow of Rush Limbaugh. Between 1984 and 2021, the megawatt talk-radio star hosted the most popular program in the country. An estimated 15.5 million people tuned in to The Rush Limbaugh Show every day to listen to him parrot a comprehensive list of Republican talking points, and many of them internalized his uniquely cranky brand of conservatism. With his thumb finally off the scale following his death from lung cancer-related complications, some hoped that the audio monopoly of conservative media was finally breaking. Maybe, just maybe, a reliable progressive could step up to the plate and reshape the American airwaves.\n\nThree years after Limbaugh's death, it's clear that those dreams haven't come true. Terrestrial radio might not be as important to American psychology as it once was, but that's only because conservatives have taken their talents elsewhere: to radio's heir, podcasting. Scroll through Spotify's Top Podcasts chart these days, and, at any given moment, at least half of the most popular shows are hosted by figures friendly to the MAGA cause. As of this writing, Tucker Carlson's show is the fourth most-listened-to show on the platform, while anti-woke entrepreneur Patrick Bet-David lingers a few rungs below him, and Candace Owens sits comfortably between them both. Further down you can find firebrands like Charlie Kirk, Ben Shapiro, and Dan Bongino cranking out new shows every day. Similarly, Joe Rogan, with his eternally inscrutable, RFK Jr.-adjacent brand of populism , continues to dominate the top spot, while a variety of other comedians forged in Rogan's fratty mold-Theo Von, Andrew Schulz-round out the list. Even if these podcasters don't market themselves as explicitly political, many of them have recently welcomed Trump to their respective shows as part of the former president's outreach to the podcasts' core demographic of disaffected young men. Tony Hinchcliffe, another comedian turned podcaster in this milieu, was even invited to speak at Trump's Madison Square Garden rally this past Sunday. ( It went poorly. )\n\nTellingly, members of the reliably liberal podcasting commentariat are few and far between on the charts alongside their opposition. The long-running Pod Save America , famously founded by a quartet of former Obama staffers, is currently stalled out somewhere in the 30s and 40s, while Ezra Klein, the patron saint of liberal wonks, is sitting outside the top 50. At its advent, podcasting appeared to be the realm of Warby Parker-bespectacled urban millennials, but this is no longer the industry of Serial or Savage Love . While podcast charts are admittedly fluid and not exactly consistent-Apple's top chart looks different from Spotify's, for instance-and the calculations behind each of them are nearly inscrutable to outsiders, today's dominance of a certain type of podcast is hard to refute. (Spotify did not respond to a request for comment on the data behind the platform's Top Podcasts chart, or on how conservative-leaning podcasts appear to dominate much of the ranking.)\n\nThe age of Rogan is firmly upon us, and it's not ending anytime soon.\n\nAnalysts aren't sure how the right wing achieved such a stranglehold on the podcast industry, but many have conceded that the grasp conservatives held over the airwaves during the Limbaugh era has proven to be surprisingly durable. \"They were dominant in the 1990s with talk radio and Fox, and then they replicated what they had with a different medium,\" said Angelo Carusone, president of the left-leaning watchdog Media Matters for America. Republicans have adjusted their news-gathering habits accordingly-according to data from the Pew Research Center , 46 percent of conservative podcast listeners say they trust the news they hear in their audio diet more than news from other sources, compared to just 19 percent of Democrats.\n\nIt makes sense. The American conservative movement and its corresponding media arm have historically been defined by an unquenchable thirst for the counternarrative. National Review, one of the country's leading conservative publications, was born in 1955 due to right-wing author and political commentator William F. Buckley Jr.'s insistence that the other publications on the newsstand-the Nation and the New Republic in particular-were tainted with a bone-deep pinko bias. (He gathered a team of libertarians and anti-communists in order to, in his words, stand \"athwart history, yelling, 'Stop. ' \") Nicole Hemmer, author of multiple books about right-wing media, told Slate that Buckley's fundamental thesis has been integral to the reactionary cause ever since: In order to identify as a conservative in the United States, one must ravenously consume explicitly branded conservative news, while the same does not necessarily hold for liberals.\n\n\"It's much more central to Republican politics compared to the inverse,\" Hemmer said. \"There isn't a sense that, like, Rachel Maddow commands millions of voters. Liberals have a different media diet. They aren't seeking out whoever the left-wing equivalent of Candace Owens is.\"\n\nBut while the conservative podcast apparatus shares heritage with the columnists and talk-radio cranks of yore, it isn't bound by the same dictums and restraints. Unlike terrestrial broadcasting, podcasts are not regulated by the Federal Communications Commission , meaning that there is no check on a show's ability to spread misinformation. The ramifications of that shift have already become clear. When the Brookings Institution audited 8,000 political podcast episodes in 2021 , it estimated that more than one-tenth of the sample were potentially espousing false reporting. Naturally, in another study published by Brookings, the research found that the podcasts most likely to share unsupported claims were almost exclusively ideologically conservative . The leading culprit in that study was Steve Bannon's War Room , a repository for QAnon-esque charges on everything from the COVID vaccine to the patents held by Bill Gates. Nearly 20 percent of his episodes were found to contain \"false, misleading, or unsubstantiated statements.\" In an ominous symptom of that trend, a Pew report from 2023 found that 40 percent of Republican podcast listeners agree that the news they gather from their podcast diet covers stories \"they wouldn't have heard elsewhere.\"\n\nHemmer agreed that as the conservative media nucleus has migrated to the podcast charts, it has breached some of the guardrails that once kept it connected to reality. In particular, she's been paying close attention to Tucker Carlson, whose wingnut tendencies have intensified since striking out on his own. \"His podcast allows him to be crazy in a way he hasn't been before. He's talking quite explicitly about demons, in an Alex Jones type of way,\" said Hemmer. She pointed to an episode last year where Carlson interviewed a convicted felon who claimed to have had sex with Barack Obama. That segment would've almost certainly been quashed by even the editorial firewalls at Fox, but in the lawless content ecosystems of 2024, it furthers Carlson's overarching promise to his listeners: No matter what he says, he will remain eternally un-canceled.\n\nIn that sense, the sheer unaccountability of the podcast medium doubles as the primary allure for a conservative media industry-and an audience of conservative consumers-existentially concerned with their own autonomy. More than anything else, this lack of oversight is what keeps some analysts up at night. If right-wing thought leadership is being delegated to an unmoderated, unchecked, and largely fragmented broadcasting sector-brimming with an increasingly mystic brand of conservatism-then maybe Rush Limbaugh was the least of our concerns.\n\nIt's hard to know for sure how the most popular conservative podcasts have engineered their seemingly outsized success. Nick Quah, a critic and reporter who covers the podcast industry for New York magazine, can identify a couple of different indicators. First and foremost, the biggest names in this world-Megyn Kelly, Tucker Carlson, even Glenn Beck-originally cultivated their fame on cable news, and therefore possess much more name recognition than those who earned their stripes exclusively in the audio realm. Additionally, some of the more adroit operators on the right have mastered a variety of different formats across multiple disciplines and their respective algorithms-TikTok, Instagram-allowing them to flood the airspace with content. (Ben Shapiro publishes a daily podcast and, at minimum, two clips per day on his YouTube channel.) Quah also noted that some conservative podcasts are partnered with major players in terrestrial radio. For instance, The Dan Bongino Show airs nationally on the NFL-affiliated radio network Westwood One, dramatically widening the on-ramp to the conservative commentator's brand for older, less tech-savvy patrons.\n\n\"Compare that to the only major center-left media company, Crooked Media, [the company behind Pod Save America ,] which only just began getting distributed through SiriusXM,\" Quah pointed out. \"They don't have a pact with traditional broadcast media companies that can get them in front of more people.\"\n\nBut none of that changes the fact that much of the more extreme messaging contained in these podcasts-conspiracies both absurd and fascistic, like Charlie Kirk spreading rumors of Haitians eating pets -are, well, extreme, and don't necessarily hold mass appeal in and of themselves. The secret sauce, so to speak, is in how these podcasts sneak those ideas into a much more general entertainment product that is far-ranging enough to capture the attention of millions of listeners. As Carusone put it to Slate, \"Those podcasts aren't making policy statements, but they are telling a story about the respective ideologies of the political parties. ... They are like sandpaper smoothing out the edges of fascism.\"\n\nOne case study is Candace Owens' eponymous podcast Candace . Owens became famous for a number of deranged controversies after originally making a name for herself with the \"Blexit\" movement in the early days of the Trump presidency. (Blexit was a combination of the words Black and Brexit, and it referred to Owens' efforts to encourage more Black Americans to defect from the Democrats.) But in March, Owens crossed one of the very few red lines in conservative media when she alloyed her criticism of Israel's invasion of Gaza with a healthy dose of esoteric antisemitism, asserting that an elite cabal of \"political Jews\" were some of the \"most vile, dishonest, manipulative people\" she's ever met. Later on, she appeared to endorse the idea that rabbis are drinking the blood of Christians . This was apparently a bridge too far for the Daily Wire, the MAGA new-media company where Owens was a star broadcaster, and the site cut ties with her. In a parable that's become eerily familiar, Owens quickly made herself more popular than ever before, launching her podcast Candace , which has averaged more than a million downloads per episode since its debut in June. Owens has continued to advance heavy-duty antisemitic thinking on her new platform. In a July episode titled \" Literally Hitler. Why Can't We Talk About Him? ,\" she called into question the veracity of the fact that human experiments were conducted on Holocaust victims.\n\nBut, for all its extreme political whiplash, Candace is not a strictly partisan production; Owens occasionally dabbles in hard-left conspiratorial thinking , coupled with plenty of pop-culture intrigue. (She has done multiple shows on the murky P. Diddy sex-trafficking investigation, and recently, she hosted a conspiratorialist of minor renown who believes that the disappearance of Malaysia Flight 370 had something to do with the suppression of free energy.) It's a mélange of content whose ethos is less \"explicit right-wing political indoctrination\" than \"salacious background noise keeping ordinary Americans entertained in between laundry and dishwashing\"-the podcasting equivalent of Larry King sitting across from psychics and palm readers in his CNN studio.\n\n\"Everyone is talking about the Trump trial, and I'm saying 'Women shouldn't wear yoga pants.' I don't like to stay within one box, because you get bogged down by talking about one topic all the time. I just ask myself what I'm actually interested in,\" said Owens in an interview with Slate. \"Someone once described my show to be like calling up a friend and catching up with them. ... I want it to feel like that.\"\n\nHemmer calls this trend the \"Joe Rogan Effect,\" referring to another figure who has become aligned with the MAGA project without commanding a content portfolio purely defined by its caucus. Rogan, after all, maintains a Rolodex of guests that range from UFO experts to anti-trans activists to Bernie Sanders. \"You see this with Megyn Kelly, too,\" added Hemmer. \"She does whole shows that are like Dateline episodes. It makes the show something similar to lifestyle broadcasting. Mixed in with really hardcore political messaging, you can get something else.\"\n\nWhat Rogan and the like are selling is not so much a concrete ideology, but a nostalgia for an edgy, anti-PC social order that began to go out of style around the turn of the millennium-a way of life, in other words. That same attitude has been replicated by the other comedian-cum-commentators in his wake. (Theo Von, who recently had J.D. Vance on his podcast This Past Weekend , is another such figure who has integrated a dash of un-wokeness into his brand.) So I wasn't surprised that, during our interview, Candace Owens said that she wants to resurrect what she calls \"'90s gay,\" referring to a time period-the \"golden decade,\" in Owens' words-when the general populace used the term \"gay\" as a casual insult between friends rather than a denigration of sexual orientation. In the anti-woke imagination, those were the good old days, before political correctness and paralyzing partisanship made the social contract harder to navigate.\n\nThis sentiment behind many of the top right-leaning podcasts reflects a broader rift in the culture wars. Over the past two decades, the Democrats have been cast as the no-fun party, standing athwart Barstool Sports, Zyn pouches, Luke Bryan, and Hawk Tuah. There has been a growing sense among Americans who aren't strictly confined by ideology-or aren't even all that politically activated-that the mainstream corporate-liberal gestalt presents a world where your thoughts and interactions must be exclusively filtered through the prism of identity and social justice. These podcasts, then, do a good job at flavoring boilerplate civic inertness with a tinge of MAGA conservatism. So far, liberals haven't been able to crack that code. Consider Pod Save America , which has a content portfolio thoroughly defined by anxiety about Trump, the Electoral College, and the fading vitality of democracy itself. There is little room for digression or levity. It is all policy, all the time, for a country that has grown exhausted by the discourse. The show's reach is limited to the only audience it could ever hope to capture: wonks who look, talk, and think like the hosts themselves.\n\nTo be fair, there are some podcasts on the left that are doing what the right has excelled at. The venerable socialist podcast Chapo Trap House and the prodigious leftist Twitch streamer Hasan Piker, for instance, both command large audiences-predominantly made up of young people-and produce shows that feel much more like casual conversations with friends than unrepentant pro-Democrat platform messaging. But they are not wreathed with the same institutional support that once enshrined Limbaugh. (In the years after his diagnosis, Limbaugh was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Meanwhile, in a viral moment from the 2024 Democratic National Convention, Piker was removed from the premises .) Having power brokers from the liberal media enclave extend an olive branch to the few new-media lefties that young people are excited about could be a way to cultivate more effective counterprogramming against the waves of right-leaning broadcasting that continue to dominate the charts.\n\nBut not everyone is so optimistic. \"Everyone is moving closer to and closer to Alex Jones. The incentive structure is shifting. All of these right-wing voices are increasingly disconnected from reality, and it isn't as visible in this fragmented media environment,\" said Hemmer. Perhaps the war hasn't been lost yet-or maybe, as she posits, the damage has already been done, and \"there's not much you can do about it.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "How the Right Won Podcasting\n\nFor decades, American liberals have been waiting for a presidential election without the red-cast shadow of Rush Limbaugh. Between 1984 and 2021, the megawatt talk-radio star hosted the most popular program in the country. An estimated 15.5 million people tuned in to The Rush Limbaugh Show every day to listen to him parrot a comprehensive list of Republican talking points, and many of them internalized his uniquely cranky brand of conservatism. With his thumb finally off the scale following his death from lung cancer-related complications, some hoped that the audio monopoly of conservative media was finally breaking. Maybe, just maybe, a reliable progressive could step up to the plate and reshape the American airwaves.\n\nThree years after Limbaugh's death, it's clear that those dreams haven't come true. Terrestrial radio might not be as important to American psychology as it once was, but that's only because conservatives have taken their talents elsewhere: to radio's heir, podcasting. Scroll through Spotify's Top Podcasts chart these days, and, at any given moment, at least half of the most popular shows are hosted by figures friendly to the MAGA cause. As of this writing, Tucker Carlson's show is the fourth most-listened-to show on the platform, while anti-woke entrepreneur Patrick Bet-David lingers a few rungs below him, and Candace Owens sits comfortably between them both. Further down you can find firebrands like Charlie Kirk, Ben Shapiro, and Dan Bongino cranking out new shows every day. Similarly, Joe Rogan, with his eternally inscrutable, RFK Jr.-adjacent brand of populism , continues to dominate the top spot, while a variety of other comedians forged in Rogan's fratty mold-Theo Von, Andrew Schulz-round out the list. Even if these podcasters don't market themselves as explicitly political, many of them have recently welcomed Trump to their respective shows as part of the former president's outreach to the podcasts' core demographic of disaffected young men. Tony Hinchcliffe, another comedian turned podcaster in this milieu, was even invited to speak at Trump's Madison Square Garden rally this past Sunday. ( It went poorly. )\n\nTellingly, members of the reliably liberal podcasting commentariat are few and far between on the charts alongside their opposition. The long-running Pod Save America , famously founded by a quartet of former Obama staffers, is currently stalled out somewhere in the 30s and 40s, while Ezra Klein, the patron saint of liberal wonks, is sitting outside the top 50. At its advent, podcasting appeared to be the realm of Warby Parker-bespectacled urban millennials, but this is no longer the industry of Serial or Savage Love . While podcast charts are admittedly fluid and not exactly consistent-Apple's top chart looks different from Spotify's, for instance-and the calculations behind each of them are nearly inscrutable to outsiders, today's dominance of a certain type of podcast is hard to refute. (Spotify did not respond to a request for comment on the data behind the platform's Top Podcasts chart, or on how conservative-leaning podcasts appear to dominate much of the ranking.)\n\nThe age of Rogan is firmly upon us, and it's not ending anytime soon.\n\nAnalysts aren't sure how the right wing achieved such a stranglehold on the podcast industry, but many have conceded that the grasp conservatives held over the airwaves during the Limbaugh era has proven to be surprisingly durable. \"They were dominant in the 1990s with talk radio and Fox, and then they replicated what they had with a different medium,\" said Angelo Carusone, president of the left-leaning watchdog Media Matters for America. Republicans have adjusted their news-gathering habits accordingly-according to data from the Pew Research Center , 46 percent of conservative podcast listeners say they trust the news they hear in their audio diet more than news from other sources, compared to just 19 percent of Democrats.\n\nIt makes sense. The American conservative movement and its corresponding media arm have historically been defined by an unquenchable thirst for the counternarrative. National Review, one of the country's leading conservative publications, was born in 1955 due to right-wing author and political commentator William F. Buckley Jr.'s insistence that the other publications on the newsstand-the Nation and the New Republic in particular-were tainted with a bone-deep pinko bias. (He gathered a team of libertarians and anti-communists in order to, in his words, stand \"athwart history, yelling, 'Stop. ' \") Nicole Hemmer, author of multiple books about right-wing media, told Slate that Buckley's fundamental thesis has been integral to the reactionary cause ever since: In order to identify as a conservative in the United States, one must ravenously consume explicitly branded conservative news, while the same does not necessarily hold for liberals.\n\n\"It's much more central to Republican politics compared to the inverse,\" Hemmer said. \"There isn't a sense that, like, Rachel Maddow commands millions of voters. Liberals have a different media diet. They aren't seeking out whoever the left-wing equivalent of Candace Owens is.\"\n\nBut while the conservative podcast apparatus shares heritage with the columnists and talk-radio cranks of yore, it isn't bound by the same dictums and restraints. Unlike terrestrial broadcasting, podcasts are not regulated by the Federal Communications Commission , meaning that there is no check on a show's ability to spread misinformation. The ramifications of that shift have already become clear. When the Brookings Institution audited 8,000 political podcast episodes in 2021 , it estimated that more than one-tenth of the sample were potentially espousing false reporting. Naturally, in another study published by Brookings, the research found that the podcasts most likely to share unsupported claims were almost exclusively ideologically conservative . The leading culprit in that study was Steve Bannon's War Room , a repository for QAnon-esque charges on everything from the COVID vaccine to the patents held by Bill Gates. Nearly 20 percent of his episodes were found to contain \"false, misleading, or unsubstantiated statements.\" In an ominous symptom of that trend, a Pew report from 2023 found that 40 percent of Republican podcast listeners agree that the news they gather from their podcast diet covers stories \"they wouldn't have heard elsewhere.\"\n\nHemmer agreed that as the conservative media nucleus has migrated to the podcast charts, it has breached some of the guardrails that once kept it connected to reality. In particular, she's been paying close attention to Tucker Carlson, whose wingnut tendencies have intensified since striking out on his own. \"His podcast allows him to be crazy in a way he hasn't been before. He's talking quite explicitly about demons, in an Alex Jones type of way,\" said Hemmer. She pointed to an episode last year where Carlson interviewed a convicted felon who claimed to have had sex with Barack Obama. That segment would've almost certainly been quashed by even the editorial firewalls at Fox, but in the lawless content ecosystems of 2024, it furthers Carlson's overarching promise to his listeners: No matter what he says, he will remain eternally un-canceled.\n\nIn that sense, the sheer unaccountability of the podcast medium doubles as the primary allure for a conservative media industry-and an audience of conservative consumers-existentially concerned with their own autonomy. More than anything else, this lack of oversight is what keeps some analysts up at night. If right-wing thought leadership is being delegated to an unmoderated, unchecked, and largely fragmented broadcasting sector-brimming with an increasingly mystic brand of conservatism-then maybe Rush Limbaugh was the least of our concerns.\n\nIt's hard to know for sure how the most popular conservative podcasts have engineered their seemingly outsized success. Nick Quah, a critic and reporter who covers the podcast industry for New York magazine, can identify a couple of different indicators. First and foremost, the biggest names in this world-Megyn Kelly, Tucker Carlson, even Glenn Beck-originally cultivated their fame on cable news, and therefore possess much more name recognition than those who earned their stripes exclusively in the audio realm. Additionally, some of the more adroit operators on the right have mastered a variety of different formats across multiple disciplines and their respective algorithms-TikTok, Instagram-allowing them to flood the airspace with content. (Ben Shapiro publishes a daily podcast and, at minimum, two clips per day on his YouTube channel.) Quah also noted that some conservative podcasts are partnered with major players in terrestrial radio. For instance, The Dan Bongino Show airs nationally on the NFL-affiliated radio network Westwood One, dramatically widening the on-ramp to the conservative commentator's brand for older, less tech-savvy patrons.\n\n\"Compare that to the only major center-left media company, Crooked Media, [the company behind Pod Save America ,] which only just began getting distributed through SiriusXM,\" Quah pointed out. \"They don't have a pact with traditional broadcast media companies that can get them in front of more people.\"\n\nBut none of that changes the fact that much of the more extreme messaging contained in these podcasts-conspiracies both absurd and fascistic, like Charlie Kirk spreading rumors of Haitians eating pets -are, well, extreme, and don't necessarily hold mass appeal in and of themselves. The secret sauce, so to speak, is in how these podcasts sneak those ideas into a much more general entertainment product that is far-ranging enough to capture the attention of millions of listeners. As Carusone put it to Slate, \"Those podcasts aren't making policy statements, but they are telling a story about the respective ideologies of the political parties. ... They are like sandpaper smoothing out the edges of fascism.\"\n\nOne case study is Candace Owens' eponymous podcast Candace . Owens became famous for a number of deranged controversies after originally making a name for herself with the \"Blexit\" movement in the early days of the Trump presidency. (Blexit was a combination of the words Black and Brexit, and it referred to Owens' efforts to encourage more Black Americans to defect from the Democrats.)

Fortunately, they won't need to design any kind of enticing visual for #Yexit , which is already picking up plenty of steam after West's announcement.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

Attendees will have to submit to a COVID-19 screening the morning of the event, which will consist of a temperature check and a brief questionnaire.\n\nGuests will first attend a \"BLEXIT Back the Blue event\" on the Ellipse between the White House and the Washington Monument before heading over to the South Lawn for the president's remarks, according to a schedule obtained by ABC News.\n\nWhen reached for comment, Owens told ABC News, \"We are not interested in participating in your obvious media angle here to slander/attack the President regarding Covid-19.\" She added that Saturday's event \"is about supporting law enforcement in minority communities.\" It is not immediately clear how many of those set to attend the event had their travel costs covered.\n\nWhite House spokesman Judd Deere told ABC News the White House \"is not involved in covering any cost.\"\n\nFollowing Trump's remarks, the BLEXIT group is also planning a demonstration at Black Lives Matter Plaza showing \"support for law enforcement,\" according to the schedule.\n\nThe White House plans to host an event on Saturday featuring Trump with hundreds of supporters and guests from Owens' group on the South Lawn discussing \"law and order,\" ABC News previously reported.\n\n\"All attendees must bring a mask with them and will be instructed to wear it on the White House Complex. All attendees must submit to a COVID-19 screening tomorrow morning. This will consist of a temperature check and a brief questionnaire. The health and safety of all attendees is our priority and following CDC guidelines is strongly encouraged,\" a source with knowledge of the group's planning told ABC News.\n\nTrump will deliver \"remarks to peaceful protesters for law and order,\" according to an invite obtained by ABC News and confirmed by two White House sources familiar with the planning. The move underscores an effort to deliver the president a packed crowd of supporters for the event as he struggles with support among Black voters. Joe Biden led Trump, 88% to 9%, among Black registered voters, according to a Sept. 26 ABC/Washington Post poll .\n\nOwens, who founded BLEXIT in 2018, told ABC News it is an organization \"with the purpose of educating minorities about conservative principles (free markets, entrepreneurship, capitalism, etc) -- concepts and theories that can truly transform and uplift our communities.\"\n\n\"We stand in unapologetic, stark contrast to leftist ideologies that have destroyed our communities for decades,\" Owens said.\n\nIn an Instagram post last week, Owens promoted what she called an upcoming \"anti-Black Lives Matter event,\" and urged followers to submit to attend in person. \"We are giving away a limited amount of travel stipends to those that really them,\" she said in the post.\n\n\"Our president doesn't want us to be fearful or scared,\" one person planning to attend Saturday's events told ABC News. \"Look how he came out of it.

Moving forward I will be more informed and thoughtful.\"\n\nLopez, 45, told Owens that while he is registered to vote as an independent, he identifies as a conservative. The father of three young children, he spoke to Owens about his family and the concerns he has about how some in Hollywood are parenting their children.\n\n\"I think if you come from a place of love you really can't go wrong, but at the same time, if you're three years old and you're saying you're feeling a certain way or you think you're a boy or a girl or whatever the case may be, I think it's dangerous as a parent to make that determination then,\" he said. \"It's sort of alarming, and my gosh, I just think about the repercussions later on.\"\n\n\"I think the formative years is when you start having those discussions and really start making these declarations,\" he continued. \"It's way too young [for a child to declare he or she is transgender]. I just personally think it's way too young.\"\n\nConversation erupted on social media, with some criticizing Lopez for his comments, and others defending him. \"Queer Eye\" star Jonathan Van Ness tweeted, \"If you're not raising a child who is part of the LGBTQ+ community you should really be quiet. You don't need to understand what you do not know. You both need to do better, your causal transphobia is par for the course. Christianity says leave judgment to god.\" His co-star, Karamo Brown, added that he was \"disappointed\" to read Lopez's comments.\n\n\"I don't think @MarioLopezExtra should be 'canceled'. But I do believe he should be given the opportunity to learn why his comments are harmful to trans youth and their parents,\" he added.\n\nHowever, Donald Trump Jr. stood by the host, calling him \"as reasonable and accepting as anyone could be.\"\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Lopez also discussed what Owens called \"radicalized feminism,\" and the hashtag #believewomen, which Lopez said he first saw around the time Christine Blasey Ford accused Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.\n\n\"I think blanket statements or hashtags like #believewomen ... [is] a very dangerous hashtag ... because people lie and sometimes those people are women,\" Lopez said. \"God forbid, you have a son out there and a girl may have felt a certain way about a situation, dismissed, hurt, whatever, and is feeling vengeful and just decides to tell a certain story that's not exactly true, come back and really hurt that individual.\"\n\n\"If we're just supposed to assume she's telling the truth without any sort of proof, evidence, that's incredibly dangerous,\" he continued. \"And the other way around too -- you can't just believe men either.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Jean Carroll defamation case: Judge denies Trump's motion for mistrial\n\nA jury ordered Donald Trump to pay Carroll  $83 million for defaming her.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, at the end of a five-day trial, has been ordered to pay $83.3 million in damages to former Elle magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll for defaming her in 2019 when he denied her allegations of sexual abuse.\n\nLast year, in a separate trial, a jury determined that Trump was liable for sexually abusing Carroll in the dressing room of a Manhattan department store in the 1990s, and that he defamed her in a 2022 social media post by calling her allegations \"a Hoax and a lie\" and saying \"This woman is not my type!\"\n\nTrump has denied all wrongdoing and has said he doesn't know who Carroll is.\n\nFollowing Judge Lewis Kaplan's instructions to jury members, the jury has retired to deliberate.\n\nThe judge gave the parties 45 minutes to get lunch, so the court will not accept a jury note or a verdict until starting at 2:25 p.m. ET.\n\nIf there is no verdict by 4:30 p.m. ET, court will break for the day unless the jury signals a desire to stay later.\n\nFormer President Trump has made a post to his social media account attacking E. Jean Carroll and Judge Lewis Kaplan as proceedings continue in his damages defamations trial.\n\nTrump, who left the courtroom during the plaintiff's closing statements but returned for the defense closings, repeated his claim in the post that he had never met Carroll, and accused her and the judge of having political motives.\n\nIn a brief rebuttal, Carroll's attorney Shawn Crowley accused Donald Trump's defense of advancing an antiquated argument that amounted to victim-shaming.\n\nReminding the jury Trump has already been found liable for assaulting and defaming Carroll, Crowley said that in the defense's eyes, \"even though he did those things, even though Donald Trump does whatever he wants, any harm Ms. Carroll suffered is her fault for speaking out.\"\n\nCrowley conceded more people know who Carroll is now, but she said that the idea that positive attention cancels out the harm Trump caused is \"nonsense,\" and she asked the jury to reject the defense argument that Carroll is somehow better off.\n\n\"Ms. Carroll did not ask to be called a liar, she did not ask for death threats,\" Crowley said. \"She did not ask to be accused of lying, of making up a story for money.\"\n\nDefending Carroll's quirky personality and her conflicting testimony about her feelings, Crowley argued that Carroll should not have to prove she was a broken wreck of a person at all times, in order to collect damages.\n\n\"You can be wrecked inside and also feel moments of triumph. You can be sad and also feel proud when people stand beside you,\" Crowley said.\n\nCrowley said Trump's defense amounted to \"she asked for it,\" and asked the jury, \"Are we really still doing that? Have we really not moved past that naïve idea?\"\n\n\"He wants you to hold Ms. Carroll accountable for his actions,\" Crowley said of Trump. \"He is not the victim.\"\n\nDefense attorney Alina Habba, delivering her closing argument, showed the jury a series of caustic tweets to make the case that E. Jean Carroll failed to prove she suffered the kind of reputational harm she said Donald Trump caused.\n\n\"As you can see, the total number of views of all these tweets that they feel best represents their case is a total of 143 views,\" Habba said. \"That's not evidence of reputational harm.\"\n\nHabba accused Carroll of enjoying the attention her accusation has created. \"Ms. Carroll loves her new reputation and her life. My client is not enjoying this,\" she said.\n\n\"Let's not forget Ms. Carroll is making more money now than she was in June 2019,\" Habba said.\n\nHabba said that in 2019, Carroll had hit \"financial and social rock bottom\" and decided to climb her way back to a lavish lifestyle with celebrity friends by making a public accusation against Trump.\n\n\"She made an allegation in the most public form by design,\" Habba said, adding that Trump had repeatedly made his position clear.\n\nThat drew an objection from the plaintiffs that was sustained by the judge, since Trump is not allowed to cause the jury to doubt an earlier verdict that held Trump liable for sexual assaulting and defaming Carroll.\n\n\"It is established,\" Judge Kaplan said.\n\n\"It is established by a jury,\" Habba added.\n\n\"It is established, and you will not quarrel with me,\" the judge said.\n\nWhen Habba resumed, she mocked the reputational repair expert who testified that rehabilitating Carroll would cost as much as $12 million -- particularly the idea that conservative commentators Joe Rogan and Candace Owens should be paid to help Ms. Carroll repair her reputation.\n\n\"What planet are we living on?\" Habba said.\n\nThe plaintiff's rebuttal will follow the defense's closing.\n\n\"I've paid just about as dearly as is possible to pay,\" E. Jean Carroll testified about her life after then-President Trump fiercely denied her rape claim in a series of defamatory statements in 2019.\n\nWhen New York magazine, on June 21, 2019, published an excerpt of Carroll's book that included her allegation that Trump raped her in a department store dressing room, she testified that she expected him to respond.\n\n\"I expected him to deny it but to say it was consensual, which it was not, but that's what I expected him to say,\" Carroll testified.\n\n\"Is that what he did?\" her attorney Roberta Kaplan asked. \"No,\" Carroll answered.\n\nAccording to a reporter's Tweet from 5:17 p.m. on June 21, 2019, which was shown in court, Trump responded to the allegation by saying, \"I've never met this person in my life.\"\n\n\"That is a lie,\" Carroll said. \"He said I made up an accusation to sell a book. That is a lie. He said I made up the accusation for publicity's sake. That is a lie. He said my accusation damaged the real victims of sexual assault. That is a lie.\"\n\nCarroll read additional statements by Trump reacting to her allegation.\n\n\"He said people like me, who make false accusations, are very dangerous, in very dangerous territory, that I shouldn't have done it for the sake of publicity. That is also a lie,\" Carroll said."

      "text": "Trump again publicly defends COVID-19 vaccines, but slams mandates\n\n\"If you take the vaccine, you're protected,\" he told a conservative podcast.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has again publicly defended the COVID-19 vaccines and their efficacy, but decried mask and vaccine mandates, in an interview posted online on Tuesday.\n\nHis remarks run counter to vaccine opposition among many of his supporters and come just days after he was booed for telling a conservative audience he had gotten a booster shot.\n\nThe vaccine \"was one of the greatest achievements; we did it in less than nine months,\" Trump told conservative political commentator Candace Owens in an episode of her web series, which is hosted by the Daily Wire conservative news website.\n\n\"Some people aren't taking it; the ones that get very sick and go to the hospital are the ones that don't take the vaccine, but it's still their choice. And if you take the vaccine, you're protected,\" Trump said.\n\nHe interjected those remarks after Owens claimed more people have died from COVID under President Joe Biden than under Trump and \"more people took the vaccine this year.\"\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccine was not widely available until early spring 2021, after Biden had already assumed the presidency, and many COVID-19 deaths were among unvaccinated individuals. Other factors such as the end of masking and social distancing mandates in many local jurisdictions, as well as new variants of the virus, have contributed to COVID-19 deaths in 2021.\n\n\"Look; the results of the vaccine are very good. And if you do get [COVID-19 after vaccination], it's a very minor form. People aren't dying when they take the vaccine,\" Trump said.\n\nBoth Trump and Owens expressed their continued opposition to vaccine and mask mandates, and Trump also claimed that prior infection from COVID-19 protects in a similar way to the vaccine. That claim is disputed by medical experts who say that the protection from the vaccine and a booster shot is stronger than protection from prior infection.\n\n\"Forget about the mandates, people have to have their freedom, but at the same time, the vaccine is one of the greatest achievements of mankind ... I came up with a vaccine -- with three vaccines,\" Trump said. \"All are very, very good; came up with three of them in less than nine months. It was supposed to take five to 12 years.\"\n\nDuring an appearance last weekend with former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, Texas, Trump -- who in the past has appeared hesitant to fully push the vaccines developed under his administration -- argued that his supporters should embrace them and \"take credit\" because \"we did something that was historic; we saved tens of millions of lives worldwide.\"\n\nTrump was asked by O'Reilly if he had received a booster and responded, \"Yes,\" triggering some boos. \"Don't, don't, don't,\" Trump replied to the crowd before pointing and saying, \"That's all right. It's a very tiny group over there.\"\n\nPresident Biden highlighted Trump's comments in his address to the nation on Tuesday about the omicron variant of the coronavirus, in a rare instance of Biden calling the former president by name.\n\n\"Just the other day former President Trump announced he had gotten his booster shot. Maybe one of the few things he and I agree on,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden also said that \"thanks to the prior administration and our scientific community, America is one of the first countries to get the vaccine,\" referencing Operation Warp Speed, a governmental effort that was meant to accelerate COVID-19 vaccine development.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki tweeted a clip on Thursday from Trump's interview with Owens, \"Just going to echo former President Trump here on the safety and efficacy of the vaccines. Merry Christmas eve eve. go get boosted\".\n\nBut at a press briefing on Thursday, she told ABC News' Alex Presha that \"the most effective voices are local voices\" and made it clear that a partnership between Biden and Trump to promote vaccination is not in the works.\n\n\"I don't know that we think it requires a partnership,\" Psaki said.\n\nABC News' Will Steakin, Ben Siegel, Ben Gittleson, and Justin Gomez contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

An ABC News analysis of COVID-19 trends across all states as well as Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico found there were increases in newly confirmed cases over the past two weeks in 28 states.\n\nThe public has not been made aware of any negative COVID-19 test taken by the president since his Oct. 1 diagnosis. Close-up photos of the president's right hand on Saturday showed flesh-color bandages.\n\nDr. Sean Conley, the president's personal physician, opened the door for the president to hold public events saying in a press release Thursday night that, \"Saturday will be day 10 since\" Trump's diagnosis.\n\nThe gathering was held on the South Lawn of the White House in conjunction with a previously planned event organized by conservative activist Candace Owens , whose campaign, BLEXIT, urges Black Americans to leave the Democratic Party.\n\n\"Every day more Black and Latino Americans are leaving behind left-wing politicians and their failed ideology,\" Trump said, speaking from the White House balcony as a sea of supporters cheered below.\n\nThose watching Trump from the White House lawn wore red MAGA hats and blue BLEXIT t-shirts. Most were wearing masks but they were not socially distanced.\n\nAt a certain point, the racially diverse crowd began chanting \"We love you!\" and Trump answered back, \"I love you too.\"\n\nIn the campaign-style speech, the president hit on familiar topics, from election fraud to Democrats' management of cities.\n\nTrump attacked Democratic nominee Joe Biden, falsely claiming he is a socialist.\n\nTrump urged the crowd to vote, calling this year \"this is the single most important election in the history of our country.\"\n\nWith just days separating the president from his stay at Walter Reed Medical Center, experts fear this type of event threatens to exacerbate the crisis already engulfing the White House and further spread the disease. On Wednesday, ABC News reported that the coronavirus outbreak had infected \"34 White House staffers and other contacts\" in recent days, citing an internal government memo. At least 14 people who attended a Sept. 26 Rose Garden event have tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nFor Saturday's event, all attendees were instructed to bring a mask, a source familiar with the planning of the event told ABC News. The attendees were expected to have their temperature checked and fill out a brief questionnaire, the source added.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Mark Meadows was seen on the driveway at the event wearing a mask.

On Wednesday, ABC News reported that the coronavirus outbreak had infected \"34 White House staffers and other contacts\" in recent days, citing an internal government memo.\n\n\"All attendees must bring a mask with them and will be instructed to wear it on the White House Complex,\" a source familiar with the planning of the event told ABC News. \"All attendees must submit to a Covid-19 screening tomorrow morning. This will consist of a temperature check and a brief questionnaire. The health and safety of all attendees is our priority and following CDC guidelines is strongly encouraged.\"\n\n\"The Trump administration continues to have disregard for the science,\" said Dr. Jay Bhatt, an ABC News contributor and practicing internist. \"This statement is premature given that we don't know what will happen between now and Saturday given that symptoms can pop at any time. He put many people at risk and we saw the aftermath. This can't happen again.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign also announced a rally on Monday night in Sanford, Florida. On Twitter, the president referred to it as \"a very BIG RALLY!\"\n\nThe Biden camp quickly responded to the news, with Mike Gwin, Biden's deputy direct response coordinator, saying in a statement, \"Donald Trump seems to be living in an alternate reality where he isn't sick and contagious with COVID-19 and where he didn't just hold what Dr. Fauci himself described as a super-spreader event at the White House that likely infected dozens more. This decision is stunningly reckless and irresponsible, and it's only the latest evidence that Trump has waved the white flag of defeat against this virus even as it kills thousands of Americans each week and batters our economy.\"\n\nDr. Sean Conley, the president's personal physician, said in a Thursday night press release that \"Saturday will be day 10 since [Trump's] Thursday diagnosis\" and opened the door to Trump hosting public events again after they were canceled following his diagnosis.\n\n\"Based on the trajectory of advanced diagnostics the team has been conducting,\" Conley continued, \"I fully anticipate the president's safe return to public engagements at that time.\"\n\nThe White House and Conley have faced criticism for deliberately misleading the American people, offering conflicting statements about the president's health status and treatment timeline after he tested positive -- leading to a crisis of credibility regarding those tasked with informing the public on the president's health.\n\nNews of the event -- and the number of expected attendees -- is sure to reignite concerns that the White House has not taken the steps necessary to stem the disease's spread.\n\nDr. John Brownstein, a Harvard epidemiologist and ABC News contributor, said that \"while the president continues to show improvements, we must remain vigilant about his health.\"\n\n\"We know that this illness can take unexpected sharp turn and providing such a positive forecast may only provide a false sense of security,\" Brownstein said.\n\nSeveral attendees of a Rose Garden ceremony to name Amy Coney Barrett as the next Supreme Court nominee two weeks ago have since tested positive - including the president, who was being treated at Walter Reed Medical Center last weekend.\n\nABC News' Elizabeth Thomas contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

And this may be one of those areas where Trump cannot control his base; the booing he got when he told Bill O'Reilly he got boosted was notable.\n\nStill, having Trump and Biden send the same message on a critical area of public health can't hurt. Biden's revised COVID-19 strategies still hinge on vaccinations plus boosters -- and, ultimately, on taking politics out of personal decisions.\n\nThe RUNDOWN with Averi Harper\n\nHeading into the new year, a high stakes election year, the path forward on federal voting reform is still unclear.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with \"World News Tonight\" anchor David Muir, Biden indicated that he would support making voting rights an exception to the 60-vote requirement to avoid the filibuster and pass legislation.\n\n\"I don't think we may have to go that far, but I would be if it's the only thing standing between getting voting rights legislation passed and not getting passed is the filibuster, I support making the exception of voting rights for the filibuster ,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden indicated that a bipartisan group of senators is negotiating on this point, but the fact remains that Democrats don't have enough votes to make a carveout for voting rights come to fruition. Both Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Sen Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., are opposed.\n\nStill, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said the Senate will consider voting rights legislation in January, as early as their first week in session.\n\nThe TIP with Meg Cunningham\n\nTwenty-two states have finalized their 2022 congressional maps, and with the pressure of cementing districts before primary season, New Jersey Democrats counted a win on Wednesday in advancing their new congressional layout.\n\nAlthough the new map will overwhelmingly keep Democrats safe, moderate Democratic Rep. Tom Malinowski's 7th district is turning redder after it was diced up to protect previously endangered incumbents.\n\nMalinowski, whose district is targeted as a pickup opportunity for Republicans, said on Thursday that he is evaluating a run for reelection after the maps were released, tweeting, \"The NJ redistricting gods haven't made it easy for us!\"\n\nAccording to a FiveThirtyEight analysis of the map, Malinowski's district now leans R+3, subjecting the vulnerable incumbent to a seven-point swing to the right.\n\nWHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW THIS WEEKEND\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden will visit patients and families at Children's National Hospital on Friday in Washington, D.C.\n\nDownload the ABC News app and select \"The Note\" as an item of interest to receive the day's sharpest political analysis.\n\nThe Note is a daily ABC News feature that highlights the day's top stories in politics.

The black and white designs included the slogan \"White Lives Matter\" on the back of the T-shirts. In addition to models wearing it during the show, Ye was also photographed Monday wearing the shirt alongside conservative political commentator Candace Owens.\n\nThe phrase has been described by the Anti-Defamation League and Southern Poverty Law Center as a white supremacist hate slogan that originated in 2015 as a racist response to the civil rights movement Black Lives Matter. The groups note that the phrase has been commonly used by white supremacist groups such as Aryan Renaissance Society and the Ku Klux Klan on everything from promotional materials to campaigns.\n\nOn Wednesday, in an Instagram post showing the black long-sleeve version of the top, the Yeezy founder wrote, \"Here's my latest response when people ask me why I made a tee that says white lives matter... THEY DO.\"\n\nIn a subsequent post , the \"Donda\" rapper said that everyone's interest in his shirt took away from other shows during Paris Fashion Week.\n\n\"My tee s*** on everybody's showssss. Nothing happened but my t-shirt... To the Arnaults that hire anybody that worked for me remember my one t-shirt took allllll the attention,\" he wrote, referring to the wealthy Arnault family, which runs the luxury goods company LVMH, subsidiaries of which include brands such as Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Bulgari, Dom Pérignon, Tiffany & Co. and Moët & Chandon.\n\nFollowing the reveal of West's \"White Lives Matter\" T-shirt on Monday, several celebrities, fashion industry writers and other notables spoke out against the statement-making garment.\n\nVogue editor Gabriella Karefa-Johnson shared a series of Instagram stories sharing her disgust with the show calling it \"hugely irresponsible.\" She also said, \"It didn't land and it was deeply offensive, violent, and dangerous.\"\n\nYe promptly responded to Karefa-Johnson's criticism by posting several images of the editor on his Instagram feed, which have since been deleted, insulting her style. \"This is not a fashion person You speak on Ye Ima speak on you Ask Trevor Noah,\" the rapper wrote.\n\nModel Gigi Hadid was also among those who called out the \"Gold Digger\" rapper on his commentary, writing in a since-deleted comment, \"You wish u had a percentage of her intellect. You have no idea haha.\"\n\n\"If there's actually a point to any of your s***. She might be the only person that could save u,\" she continued. \"As if the 'honor' of being invited to your show should keep someone from giving their opinion? Lol. You're a bully and a joke.\"\n\nRapper and actor Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith, attended the Yeezy show on Monday, but said on Twitter that he left before it concluded, writing in a series of tweets, \"I Had to Dip Lol,\" and \"I Don't Care Who's It Is If I Don't Feel The Message I'm Out.\"\n\nSmith also tweeted the phrase \"Black Lives Matter,\" in response to the controversy. The post has since garnered more than 246,000 likes and tens of thousands of retweets.\n\nABC News' Jacqueline Laurean Yates contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

The online outlet has stood by her over the years, despite her penchant for trafficking in extremist and dishonest rhetoric.\n\nBut since the October 7 Hamas terror attack on Israel, Owens has repeatedly waded into antisemitic waters as she fiercely criticized Israel, suggesting the Jewish government was committing \"genocide\" in Gaza and claiming there is a sinister \"small ring\" of Jewish people in Hollywood and Washington, DC involved in something \"quite sinister.\"\n\nIn November, Shapiro, who is Jewish, called out Owens for her \"disgraceful\" rhetoric, blasting her \"faux sophistication\" on the topic.\n\nWithout directly naming Shapiro, Owens responded that one \"cannot serve both God and money,\" a brazen dig at The Daily Wire co-founder that was drenched in an age-old antisemitic trope.\n\nAt the time, Shapiro hit back, \"Candace, if you feel that taking money from The Daily Wire somehow comes between you and God, by all means quit.\"\n\nOwens then attacked Shapiro in an interview with Tucker Carlson, the right-wing extremist who was fired last year from Fox News, accusing him of \"ad hominem attacks.\"\n\nIn recent days, Owens has continued to generate more controversy, liking a post on X in which a user accused a rabbi of being \"drunk on Christian blood.\"\n\nOwens' behavior earned her the praise of those pushing hatred of the Jewish community, which the Anti-Defamation League noted Thursday when it blasted her for pushing \"an antisemitic agenda\" and fueling \"the fire of hate.\"\n\nOwens responded by accusing the ADL of having \"turned their smear merchant guns\" on her.\n\n\"Their attacks will have the opposite desired effect,\" Owens said. \"Awaken world.\"\n\nWhile Owens will no longer have a home at The Daily Wire, she still maintains a large platform. Her extremist commentary has catapulted her to fame in right-wing circles and she boasts millions of followers across her various social media accounts. In September, she was suspended from YouTube for her anti-LGBTQ commentary after violating the platform's rules on hate speech.\n\nOwens has long been a supporter of former President Donald Trump, amplifying his culture warrior rhetoric to her younger, online audience. \"I truly believe that Donald Trump isn't just the leader of the free world, but the savior of it as well,\" she wrote in a social media post in 2018.\n\nLast month, she was photographed with Trump at a UFC event in Las Vegas. \"It's fight night,\" she wrote in a photo caption. \"Fighters only.\"\n\nThe Daily Wire's slate of hosts are no stranger to controversy and have frequently promoted anti-LGBTQ themes and tropes. Matt Walsh, another extremist commentator employed by the Nashville-based company, has demonized gay and transgender people on his program, calling for doctors who perform gender affirming care to be imprisoned or executed.\n\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

Ted Lieu of California played a clip of Candace Owens, of the conservative group Turning Point USA, discussing Hitler.\n\n\"In congressional hearings, the minority party gets to select its own witnesses. And of all the people that Republicans could have selected, they picked Candace Owens,\" Lieu said. \"I don't know Ms. Owens - I'm not going to characterize her. I'm going to let her own words do the talking. So I'm going to play for you the first 30 seconds of a statement she made about Adolf Hitler.\"\n\nLieu then played a clip of Owens describing Hitler's motive \"to make Germany great\" as \"fine.\"\n\n\"I actually don't have any problems at all with the word nationalism,\" Owens says in the clip. \"I think that it gets - the definition gets poisoned by elitists that actually want globalism. Globalism is what I don't want. So when you think about - whenever we say nationalism, the first thing people think about - at least in America - is Hitler. You know, he was a national socialist, but if Hitler had just wanted to make Germany great and have things run well, OK, fine. The problem is that he wanted - he had dreams outside of Germany. He wanted to globalize, he wanted everybody to be German, everybody to be speaking German.\"\n\nRelated article Racist and anti-Semitic comments flooded YouTube livestream of congressional hearing on white nationalism\n\nLieu asked witness Eileen Hershenov, a senior vice president at the Anti-Defamation League, \"So when people try to legitimize Hitler, does that feed into white nationalist ideology?\"\n\n\"It does, Mr. Lieu,\" Hershenov replied. \"I know that Ms. Owens distanced herself from those comments later, but we expressed great concern over the original comments.\"\n\nOwens accused Lieu a few minutes later of thinking that African-Americans are \"stupid.\"\n\n\"I think it's pretty apparent that Mr. Lieu believes that black people are stupid and will not pursue the full clip in its entirety. He purposefully presented an extracted clip,\" she said, before committee Chairman Jerry Nadler interjected.\n\nThe New York Democrat stressed that \"it is not proper to refer disparagingly to a member of the committee\" and \"the witness may not refer to a member of the committee as 'stupid,' \" telling Owens not to make such comments again.\n\nShe replied, \"I didn't refer to him as 'stupid.' That's not what I said. That's not what I said at all. You didn't listen to what I said.\"\n\nThe conservative activist accused Lieu of mischaracterizing her remarks and called Hitler \"a homicidal, psychopathic maniac that killed his own people - a nationalist would not kill their own people.\"\n\nLieu \"purposefully wanted to give you a cut-up similar to what they do to Donald Trump to create a different narrative,\" Owens added. \"That was unbelievably dishonest and he did not allow me to respond to it, which is worrisome and should tell you a lot about where people are today in terms of trying to drum up narratives.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

Owens is also in the midst of a tour with Turning Point USA, a conservative organization that has recently gained power in the Republican Party .\n\nThe Daily Wire did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A representative for Owens said she would have more information about her next venture soon.\n\nOwens has been a controversial, outspoken figure in right-wing media and has been known to share conspiracy theories. She also publicly clashed with Shapiro on X in the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack against Israel.\n\nOwens has been one of the few far-right pundits who has been openly critical of Israel's handling of the war in Gaza. Critics of Owens say that she has spread antisemitism.\n\nIn an X post on Nov. 13, Owens wrote, \"No one can serve two masters\" and ended her post by writing, \"You cannot serve both God and money.\"\n\nShapiro reposted Owens, saying, \"Candace, if you feel that taking money from The Daily Wire somehow comes between you and God, by all means quit.\"\n\nOwens then claimed Shapiro had \"been acting unprofessional and emotionally unhinged  for weeks now\" and went on to say Shapiro \"cross[ed] a certain line when you come for scripture and read yourself into it. I will not tolerate it.\"\n\nThe feud continued when Owens appeared on conservative commentator Tucker Carlson's X show, calling Shapiro's jabs \"ad-hominem attacks.\"\n\nThe Daily Wire was founded in 2015 by Shapiro and Boreing. The company calls itself \"one of America's fastest-growing media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment\" that is part of the \"right-of-center media landscape.\" Owens joined the company in 2021.\n\nIn addition to her escalating feud with Shapiro, Owens also recently spread unsubstantiated claims that French President Emmanuel Macron's wife, Brigitte Marie-Claude Macron, is a transgender woman.\n\n\"After looking into this, I would stake my entire professional reputation on the fact that Brigette Macron is in fact a man,\" she previously claimed in a post on X.\n\nThe French president addressed the claim about his wife earlier this month, according to t he New York Post . \"The worst thing is the false information and fabricated scenarios,\" Macron reportedly said. \"People eventually believe them and disturb you, even in your intimacy.\"\n\nKalhan Rosenblatt is a reporter covering youth and internet culture for NBC News, based in New York.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "YouTube demonetizes Candace Owens' anti-trans videos, says misgendering may fall under hateful conduct policy\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nYouTube said that it demonetized several videos on conservative pundit Candace Owens' channel for violating its monetization policies on hateful and derogatory content, which the company said may apply to instances of misgendering or deadnaming.\n\nYouTube does not publicly list any policy on misgendering but said in a statement that it considers deliberate misgendering as potentially violative of its monetization policy on hateful conduct.\n\nOn the Candace Owens Podcast channel Monday, Owens said YouTube gave her \"an option to delete every video that I've ever done pertaining to gender in which I have accurately gendered someone\" - referring to instances in which she's used pronouns not preferred by trans individuals. Videos in which Owens misgendered individuals were considered \"hateful conduct\" by YouTube, according to Owens in a segment in the episode titled 'I Have An Announcement To Make.'\n\nOwens' YouTube censorship claims come amid the ongoing cultural debate on free speech and anti-trans content published by conservative media online.\n\nWhile YouTube said it did not remove Owens' videos, Michael Aciman, a Google spokesperson, said that the company blocked ads on \"several videos on Candace Owen's channel for violating our monetization policies, including those against hateful and derogatory content.\"\n\nUnder its guidelines on hateful and derogatory content, YouTube may prohibit advertisements from running on a video that \"promotes discrimination, disparages, or humiliates an individual or group of people.\" Aciman noted this includes disparagement of the LGBTQ community.\n\nIn addition, Aciman said that this policy could include enforcement against videos that \"may include deliberate deadnaming or misgendering of transgender individuals.\"\n\nPreviously, YouTube has stated that misgendering is not part of its community guidelines, which dictate what videos can and can't be fully removed. Aciman's statement clarifies, however, that misgendering is a consideration when it comes to the company's decisions around the monetization of videos.\n\nMisgendering individuals can be used as a tool to harass transgender people, and it's one of the fault lines that have opened in an online culture war that some conservatives like Owens are pursuing against the LGBTQ community.\n\nOwens told viewers Monday that they might notice videos missing since last Friday, but she did not specify which channel the videos were removed from or how many videos were taken down.\n\nDespite her claims that YouTube was censoring her videos, many videos in which she debates trans rights and gender identity remain among the more than 1,200 videos on her podcast YouTube channel with 1.67 million subscribers. Some of these videos tagged with hashtags such as #pronouns, #trans and #transgender were available on the site Wednesday.\n\nIn a video released in August 2021 on YouTube in which Owens responded to trans activist Serena Daniari, she said the \"trans movement represents a caricature of what it means to be a woman.\" A video published April 2022 involves Owens reacting to new gender pronouns, while in a different episode released that month, Owens said a mother with a transgender son \"mutilated your once perfectly healthy growing son over a feeling that he had.\"\n\nA video in which Owens singles out a nonbinary child that was posted to YouTube on May 31 ahead of Pride Month in June is still up. During the episode, Owens referred to the gender of actor Rachelle Lechevre's nonbinary child as \"nonexistent.\"\n\nYouTube's policy on harassment says it protects against \"harmful behavior such as deliberately insulting or shaming minors, threats, bullying, doxxing, or encouraging abusive fan behavior,\" YouTube wrote in its community guidelines. The company can remove content that violates its policies on harassment and hate speech.\n\n\"All creators must follow our Community Guidelines, which prohibit content promoting hatred against protected groups, including the LGBTQ+ community,\" Aciman said in the statement.\n\nSpeaking about YouTube's recent actions against her content, Owens said, YouTube was stifling her ability to state the \"truth.\" Owens maintains a vocal stance against aspects of the transgender rights movement and facets of the LGBTQ community on social media platforms.\n\nRecently, Owens and the conservative outlet she's affiliated with, The Daily Wire, have been at the center of numerous controversies surrounding their claims about transgender people and how they are handled by social media platforms.\n\nIn her video about her own treatment by YouTube, Owens also accused the company of targeting Matt Walsh's channel after the release of the documentary \"What is a Woman?\" starring Walsh. The anti-trans documentary garnered the support of Twitter owner Elon Musk, who wrote \"Every parent should watch this\" in a thread on Twitter on June 2. Twitter initially moderated the release of the video on the platform, which Musk reversed, leading to the high-profile departure last week of the company's head of trust and safety, Ella Irwin.\n\nMusk reversed Twitter's policy banning users from misgendering people on the platform in April, a move that was criticized by LGBTQ advocacy groups, NBC News reported .\n\nOwens claimed YouTube demonetized Walsh 's channel and was now focusing on her and fellow Daily Wire host Michael Knowles' respective channels. \"I feel that (Walsh) was targeted because he has been hitting out on gender issues.\" Owens said on her podcast.\n\nFollowing YouTube's alleged wave of demonetization and pressure to remove certain content, Owens said in her Monday podcast that she would \"re-examine my viewpoints on how I talk about this topic and maybe abide by YouTube's policy fully in a way that allows me to rest my head on the pillow.\" She proceeded to display graphic photos of gender reassignment surgeries and play a video from a trans person talking about how she regretted the surgery.\n\nKhadijah Khogeer is an intern on NBC News' tech desk.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "YouTube tested, Trump approved: How Candace Owens suddenly became the loudest voice on the far right\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nIn less than a year, Candace Owens has gone from a rising political YouTube personality to one of the leading faces - and voices - of the conservative effort to win back the votes of young and minority Americans.\n\nOwens, 28, spends her days zigzagging across the country, speaking at GOP fundraisers and on college campuses as the communications director of Turning Points USA, the country's most prominent and contentious conservative student group.\n\nShe became the new darling of President Donald Trump at lightning speed last month when a video of her berating black protesters at the University of California, Los Angeles, as \"privileged Americans\" obsessed with \"shouting about slavery\" went viral. Shortly after, rapper Kanye West tweeted , \"I love the way Candace Owens thinks.\"\n\nI love the way Candace Owens thinks\n\nTrump called in to \"Fox and Friends\" and said Owens was \"the hottest thing out there right now.\" And this month, Trump followed a 20-minute face-to-face meeting with Owens at the White House with a tweet about the \"big impact\" she was having on politics: \"so good for our Country!\" he wrote.\n\nThe plaudits she's received from the right have been met with equal loathing from the left, which has called Owens out on social media, labeling her \" stupid ,\" \" token \" and \" exclusively reactionary, rage fueled and hyper emotional .\"\n\nIt's been a stunning ascent for a person who now loudly advocates for Trump but didn't vote for him, or anyone, in 2016. She didn't vote for Barack Obama in 2012, either.\n\n\"Yeah, I didn't vote exactly,\" Owens said in an interview with NBC News. \"This is the first time I've been politically inclined and active, and I think Donald Trump is a tremendous president. And I wanted to be educated. I wanted to do a deep dive before I started going out there and saying stuff as opposed to other people who mindlessly vote.\"\n\nOwens' conservative awakening embodies what the Republican Party hopes to see across the country - young people, minorities and women embracing the ideas of Trump's America.\n\nBut she's not doing that by softening any of the platform that has emerged on the far-right. Owens has called Black Lives Matter advocates \"whiny toddlers,\" advocated for the end of all welfare programs, and likened black Democrats to slaves on plantations.\n\nFor Owens, climate change is a lie used to \"extract dollars from Americans,\" abortion is the \"extermination\" of black babies, undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children should be immediately deported, and concern over rising white nationalism is \"stupid,\" an opinion she expressed after a white nationalist drove through a group of counterprotesters last summer in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing a woman.\n\nOwens cites George Soros and \" globalists \" among the country's most looming threats and has called for the imprisonment of Hillary and Bill Clinton, former FBI director James Comey, special counsel Robert Mueller and the TV anchors Jake Tapper, Rachel Maddow and Anderson Cooper, among others.\n\nThat contrarianism and aggressive Trumpian delivery, combined with a talent for angering those on the left, has led Owens to amass 560,000 Twitter followers in the last year, and her YouTube videos have racked up 7 million views. She's moved from appearing on fringe online conspiracy websites to guest hosting gigs on Fox News.\n\n\"Everybody in our immediate family has met Candace on multiple occasions,\" Donald Trump Jr. told NBC News, \"and deeply appreciates what she has done to bridge the polarizing delta left by leftist politicians and their media cohorts, who wish to see this country divided.\"\n\nOwens isn't just pushing buttons on the left. After she blasted the #MeToo movement for having \"turned sexual assault into a trend,\" predicated on the idea that women are \"stupid\" and weak,\" Charlie Kirk, her boss and the president of Turning Points, asked members in a group message not to walk out or boo Owens during her speech at an upcoming women's leadership conference. (Owens called reports of internal discord \"fake news, and says conservatives critical of her or her message generally are \"secret socialists.\")\n\nCandace Owens of Turning Point USA is having a big impact on politics in our Country. She represents an ever expanding group of very smart \"thinkers,\" and it is wonderful to watch and hear the dialogue going on...so good for our Country!\n\nShe recently dove into Twitter feuds with Fox News' Tomi Lahren over Kanye West and warned Ben Shapiro, the editor-in-chief of the popular right-wing news website Daily Wire: \"Don't talk down to me. Ever again,\" after he tweeted critically about the president's recent meeting with Kim Kardashian West, Kanye's wife.\n\nAt a time when the digital pundit economy rewards division over consensus, those episodes have only helped to magnify the profile of the self-described \"most controversial black woman in America.\"\n\n\"What is Ben Shapiro, the god of my thoughts, now that I'm a conservative?\" she asked. \"No. I'm Candace Owens.\"\n\nJust a couple of years ago, Owens was like many other 20-somethings in New York City.\n\nShe grew up in Stamford, Connecticut, and, according to her telling, was raised by her grandparents after her parents divorced. Owens rarely speaks of her immediate family, but often invokes her grandfather as a model black American.\n\nAt Turning Points events and in videos , she says her grandfather Robert Owens was born in segregated North Carolina, picking cotton and laying out tobacco from the age of 4 on a sharecropping farm. She says he went on to start a business, raise a family and eventually retire in North Carolina, buying the very land that he had once worked.\n\nOwens went to the University of Rhode Island to study journalism, but she said she was forced to leave because of an issue with her student loan. A representative for the university said Owens dropped out after her junior year.\n\nBy 2015, Owens was living and working in New York, paying off debt and looking for her next move when she and a co-worker founded Degree180 , a marketing agency that offered consultation, production and planning services. The site included a blog that featured writing from Owens on a variety of topics including anorexia, acne, breakups and dating - and occasionally politics. In one post, she wrote about the \"bat-shit-crazy antics of the Republican Tea Party,\" adding, \"The good news is, they will eventually die off (peacefully in their sleep, we hope), and then we can get right on with the OBVIOUS social change that needs to happen, IMMEDIATELY.\"\n\nIn the spring of 2016, the women of Degree180, led by Owens, launched a $75,000 Kickstarter campaign for a new website called Social Autopsy. The idea, according to the promotional video, was to create \"the first-ever search database that compiles and allows the public to easily access the digital footprint of individuals and companies.\"\n\n\"Wave goodbye to cyberbullies and trolls,\" it announced.\n\nThe project soon ran into problems. In the pitch, Owens claimed her team had already amassed profiles on thousands of individuals, using real Twitter, Facebook and Instagram posts. Privacy is one of the few topics that can unite the internet's warring factions, however, and Social Autopsy, to a lot of people, felt like an online destination for \"doxing,\" the malicious practice of posting a person's identifying details on the internet, usually with the implied invitation to harass the person in real life. These days, Owens acknowledges that the endeavor was \"well intended but totally naïve.\"\n\nIn response, people began to dox Owens, posting her address, family members, workplace, contact information and social media profiles. Owens received threatening emails and texts, many of them racist.\n\nThat led her to stumble into one of the internet events that helped fuel the so-called alt-right: Gamergate, which pitted progressive video game developers and their supporters against gamers who revolted against the move to make video games more inclusive.\n\nWith scant evidence, Owens blamed the progressive side of Gamergate for her doxxing and the ultimate failure of Social Autopsy's Kickstarter project, leading her to unexpected allies: the Gamergate faction whose anti-feminist, traditionalist positions often overlapped with politically conservative ones thanks to prominent Trump supporters Milo Yiannopoulos and Mike Cernovich, known for spreading conspiracy theories and far-right ideology.\n\n\"I reached out to offer some moral support, told her to keep her head up and not let the hate get her down,\" Cernovich told NBC News, referring to Owens.\n\nThe support Owens received from Cernovich and others on the far-right made an immediate impact.\n\n\"I became a conservative overnight,\" Owens said in 2017 on an online talk show hosted by Libertarian political personality Dave Rubin. \"I realized that liberals were actually the racists. Liberals were actually the trolls.\" At the same time, she explained, Trump's message of \"fake news\" began to resonate.\n\n\"Social Autopsy is why I'm conservative,\" Owens later explained .\n\nBy the summer of 2017, YouTube had become a destination, and a major funding stream, for a new crop of conservative political commentators, each with their own niche corner of the market. Armed with a new ideology, Owens quickly found a new home, alongside millennials, gays and gamers preaching right-wing politics in online videos.\n\nShe joined a handful of existing black conservative YouTubers, posting videos under the handle RedPillBlack, a reference to her race and the internet-speak favored on manosphere and conspiracy sites meaning she had discovered some secret truth. In her first video, \"Mom, Dad ... I'm a conservative,\" Owens acted in a one-woman sketch announcing her new identity to her parents (played by herself) and effectively the world.\n\nOwens started new Facebook and Instagram pages, a YouTube channel, a Twitter feed and a connected patreon account, a subscription service where she collected monthly donations in exchange for content. Her videos quickly started to attract attention, but it was \"I Don't Care About Charlottesville, the KKK, or White Supremacy\" - her response to the media coverage of the deadly white supremacist rally last summer - that went viral and attracted the notice of InfoWars' Alex Jones and Paul Joseph Watson, Rubin and Jesse Watters of Fox News.\n\nMore recently, Owens has started to eschew those fringier parts of the far-right media. She refused to speak negatively of InfoWars or its hosts, but has distanced herself from the site since finding mainstream success. Jones told viewers last month that Owens had ghosted him after the Kanye tweet.\n\n\"It does hurt your feelings,\" Jones said.\n\nOwens' tweets regularly rack up thousands of replies, likes and retweets, but it's not clear whether her message resonates outside of the far-right echo chamber.\n\nAt a Turning Points USA event at Stanford in May, Owens took the stage in front of roughly 300 people. Despite Turning Point president Kirk's saying on Instagram that the free event had attracted a \"sold-out crowd,\" some 100 chairs sat empty in the hall.\n\nDressed in a starched white button-down shirt and Adidas track pants, and wearing purple matte lipstick, Owens talks quickly in sound bites and statistics. Speaking with her about her issues feels less like a conversation than an admonishment. She punctuates each talking point with a rhetorical, \"Right?\"\n\nOwens said that her goal with Turning Points is twofold: to \"level the playing field\" for young conservatives (\"If you say that you believe in free markets and capitalism, you get called a white supremacist\") and to \"wake up black America, that we have been lied to and that racism is now being used as a way to control us, to instill fear in us.\"\n\nThe main problems for the black community, as she explains it, are \"a system of government dependency\" and a lack of fathers in African-American homes. When asked about specific policies that might improve life for black Americans, Owens demures.\n\n\"I'm not a politician, I'm not in Congress. You know what I mean?\" she says. \"I'm just a black girl that makes YouTube videos and tries to teach dialogue in campuses so they think before stepping into a voting booth.\"\n\nThe crowd was a mix of Stanford College Republicans, curious nonpolitical students, and local Trump supporters, including 20 men in black-and-gold Fred Perry polo shirts - members of the Bay Area Proud Boys, a fraternity of self-described \"Western Chauvinists,\" founded in 2016 and designated a hate group this year by the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nCollege campuses may have become a political flashpoint, but for all her online contrariness, Owens' found little opposition at Turning Point's \"Make Stanford Great Again\" event. It could have been that liberal students on the Palo Alto campus were busy studying for finals. Perhaps the Stanford College Republicans' purge of suspected infiltrators had done its job. Or maybe, as the college conservative hosts boasted on Facebook , \"the Stanford Left had lost its will to resist.\"\n\nBut for whatever reason, no one had come to protest Owens.\n\n\"She's the opposite of what you'd expect,\" Erin Smith, a Californian by way of Mississippi said before Owens arrived. Smith, 38, is a transgender woman with hazel eyes and a nose ring. A Yellowstone National Park hat sat atop her long red hair. She said she likes Owens for the same reason she likes Trump: They're \"framing the debate.\"\n\nOwens took the stage with Kirk, sitting on chairs in front of five painted banners meant to serve as a kind of road map for the hour-and-a-half-long talk. Backlit by Silicon Valley's setting sun, the banners read: \"White privilege is a lie; There are only two genders; guns save lives; Build the wall; and Trump is great.\"\n\nIn front of the Stanford audience, Kirk laid bare the reasoning behind Owens' power. \"Candace is such a threat to what I consider to be the largest potential to break the Democrat Party in modern history,\" Kirk said, using a party name many Democrats consider derogatory.\n\n\"Thank you, and that is the goal,\" Owens replied, before pivoting to the point that black Americans were \"doing better\" when Jim Crow laws codified racial inequality in the segregated South.\n\n\"I can't think of the last Asian that I ran into that talked about internment camps,\" she said to the crowd. \"But black people always want to talk to me about slavery.\"\n\nTwo African-American women sitting near the back row audibly gasped and shifted in their chairs. Before the event had begun, one of the women, a 19-year-old student named Alexia who identified herself as liberal, explained she had come because it was \"important to understand both sides.\"\n\nAfterward, she shook her head.\n\n\"That was pretty ignorant.\"\n\nOwens has adopted a variety of Trump's political positions and style - including a distaste for the media.\n\n\"I don't get why they hate us so much,\" she said in a text message.\n\nOwens and I had been speaking for weeks - in person, through emails and by phone - mostly about the media. Owens feels like the national news media has a liberal bias that she says leads to unfair coverage of her and conservatives like her. Recently, Owens shared with me an email from a fashion website reporter who wrote to apologize in advance for a profile that became in Owens' estimation \"a hit piece.\"\n\nAdd it to the pile, Owens says.\n\nThe press has labeled her an opportunist and a neo-Nazi defender . Even the National Review, ostensibly on her side of the political debate, \"carefully painted me as a moron,\" Owens says.\n\nBut in her own words, Owens \"punches back.\" Owens says she's writing an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal on \"how journalists have become closet sadists.\" But to really punch back, Owens relies on a small but reliable set of fans who religiously watch her videos, comment on her Twitter and Facebook profiles and mobilize en masse against reporters and critics.\n\nAnd for a woman who detests groupthink, Owens revels in the power of a horde. When NBC News tried to verify biographical details provided to the Stanford audience by Kirk, she tweeted to her followers, knowing that they would be keen to direct vitriol at a reporter.\n\n\"Don't worry,\" Owens emailed. \"I'm not going to throw you to the wolves.\"\n\nOwens' mission at the time she joined Turning Point USA was to expand the group's efforts into black communities, black colleges and inner cities. That's a tall order. African-Americans are considered the Democrats' most reliable racial voting bloc, and an overwhelming majority disapprove of the president and think he is a racist, according to recent polls . Still, it's not impossible.\n\n\"Someone like Candace could be effective in shaving into or creating a pathway and making it not toxic to be a black conservative,\" said Van Jones, a progressive commentator with a twice-monthly show on CNN, on which Owens was supposed to appear in June. She missed out when her plane was delayed on the flight back from Kanye West's listening party in Wyoming.\n\nJones, once a fiery activist himself, has softened his tone in recent years, and now stresses the importance of \"bridging the gap\" between the ideologically opposed as a way to bring about change.\n\n\"We don't have to agree,\" Jones said, \"but we have to understand.\"\n\n\"She's going through a honeymoon phase on all sides,\" Jones says of Owens. \"Right now the Republicans like her because she's new and she's fresh and she's good at her job. The Democrats don't know what to make of her because she's not a big enough deal yet to go after her in any way.\"\n\nSeveral conservatives declined to be quoted on the record for this article, while expressing concern over Owens' antagonistic style and limited political knowledge.\n\n\"There's a tendency in the conservative movement to embrace anyone who is a minority whether they know anything about conservative principles or not,\" said one conservative who knows Owens and spoke on condition of anonymity in order to speak freely. \"Which is ridiculous because there are legit thinkers who tend toward conservatism and are black but they don't fit the Fox News model.\"\n\n\"She's either going to get better in which case she deserves to survive in this place or she's not and she deserves to blow herself up,\" said the source, recalling the fall of Yiannopoulos, the former Breitbart editor.\n\nJones sees staying power in Owens.\n\n\"I think she's going to be around for a long time,\" he said. \"She could be the next Megyn Kelly.\"\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Candace Owens, Harry Styles' Vogue cover and the tyranny of the gender binary\n\nFollow think\n\nMORE FROM NBC\n\n© 2025 NBCNEWS.COM\n\nIf \"the clothes make the man,\" then, for conservative commentator Candace Owens , those clothes better be \"manly.\" Indeed, she argues, human civilization depends on it.\n\nOwens' remarks, broadcast in a series of tweets, were in response to British pop star Harry Styles' donning a Gucci gown replete with lace and ruffles, under a black blazer, for the cover of Vogue's December issue . She called Styles' attire, reflecting what she referred to as \"the steady feminization of our men,\" \"an outright attack\" on society. She finished her thought with a declaration: \"Bring back manly men.\"\n\nThere is no society that can survive without strong men. The East knows this. In the west, the steady feminization of our men at the same time that Marxism is being taught to our children is not a coincidence. It is an outright attack. Bring back manly men. https://t.co/sY4IJF7VkK\n\nAt a time of intersecting crises - a global pandemic that is devastating lives, police violence against Black people and inflamed racism , an autocratic president who threatens American democracy by refusing to concede the election - devoting energy to criticizing a magazine cover feels a bit strange, even misguided. But the fact that the tweet racked up close to 100,000 likes in a few days indicates that Owens - for better or worse - has hit a nerve.\n\nFor Owens (as well as for the tens of thousands of people who liked her tweet) the continuation of \"society\" wholly depends on the impermeability of classes and castes - from gender to race to economic. This is why she very strangely includes a quip about Marxism - that \"the steady feminization of our men at the same time that Marxism is being taught to our children is no coincidence.\"\n\nConservatives like Owens, on the other hand, fear the destruction of boundaries and of borders that maintain the traditional social - gender and racial - hierarchy.\n\nMarxism, at its simplest, is an ideology that espouses the creation of a classless society; it provides the framework for communism as practice. People like Owens, on the other hand, fear the destruction of boundaries and of borders that maintain the traditional social - gender and racial - hierarchy. This terror of this loss of supremacy is manifest in a variety of policies and tactics, from vilifying Black Lives Matter to punishing migrants and refugees and throwing their children in cages.\n\nGender, specifically as a category that enables discrimination based on bodily appearance, is arguably the most ancient human boundary. Conservatives, consciously or not, view traditional boundaries as fundamental not only to society's permanence but also to their very own understanding of their individual selves. It's no surprise they express panic when gender becomes a disco.\n\nThe gender binary as a worldview states that a man is defined by his masculinity, which is based upon traits and appearance and actions of dominance. Conversely, a woman is defined by her femininity, in accordance with submissiveness. It is not that men innately are more powerful. No. Rather, it is that dominance is understood as powerful. That men have exacted forms of dominance over time - through expressions of violence, aggression and virility; from war to genocide, rape to lynching - has instilled the belief that man is biologically powerful and that masculinity is expression of this power. Femininity, situated as the essential, binary opposite of masculinity, must be continually policed so masculinity remains impenetrable and unquestioned.\n\nAnd yet what has been all too revealing, especially during this pandemic, is how differently, and much more effectively, power is wielded by women. For women like Germany's Angela Merkel, New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern and Taiwan's Tsai Ing-wen, leadership means harnessing the powers of their offices to protect their people by putting their lives first. It is no wonder that many woman-led countries have better controlled the pandemic - especially when compared to countries lead by autocratic, power-hungry men.\n\nIt has been the work of feminists not only to show how this gender binary has functioned in society but also to underscore how arbitrary - how, to use academic-speak, \"constructed\" - this binary is.\n\nThis is why something so seemingly innocuous as a photo of a former boy-bander in a dress causes such gender panic - because it exposes the artificial boundaries of our society. Historically, clothing has been codified, even regulated by law, to represent the two traditional genders. Dresses represent femininity, which allegedly should be expressed only by women. This thinking relied heavily on the moral policing prescribed by religious doctrine; in Christian societies, Deuteronomy 22:5 explicitly states: \"A woman shall not wear man's clothing, nor shall a man put on a woman's clothing; for whoever does these things is an abomination to the Lord your God.\" (This is all a bit odd, since Christian iconography has everyone - male and female - in dress robes. There are no pants in sight!)\n\nFor Styles, \"clothes are there to have fun with and experiment with and play with,\" he says in his accompanying Vogue interview . \"When you take away 'There's clothes for men and there's clothes for women,' once you remove any barriers, obviously you open up the arena in which you can play. ... [A]nytime you're putting barriers up in your own life, you're just limiting yourself. There's so much joy to be had in playing with clothes. I've never really thought too much about what it means - it just becomes this extended part of creating something.\"\n\nWhere people like Styles find freedom in the in-between, in crossing borders and boundaries, others, like Owens, find destruction - and, it appears, Marxism. These competing worldviews represent two very distinct notions of freedom. But while Styles advocates a type of freedom embodied by creative expression and creative independence, Owens - a conservative who drapes herself in the American flag - espouses a freedom based in constraint and male dominance.\n\nMarcie Bianco is a writer and editor based in California.

      "text": "Candace Owens doubles down on her absurd fight against inclusion\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nActor Christina Applegate took right-wing pundit Candace Owens to task this week for resurfaced disparaging and ableist comments Owens made in 2022, in which she criticized Skims, Kim Kardashian's shapewear line, for running ads with an underwear model in a wheelchair - comments Owens doubled down on on Wednesday.\n\nApplegate, who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2021, and whose quality of life has been dramatically affected by the disease, tweeted: \"This Candace person making comments about companies who see we need help. It's f---ing gross. I thank skims ... for seeing us.\" In a subsequent tweet, Applegate explained how she needs help getting dressed since the deterioration of her MS, and praised Skims for promoting \"accessibility clothing for me and my community.\"\n\nThe episode exposes some telling points about the right's antagonistic relationship to inclusion and the reality of the perceived threat (spoiler alert: There isn't really one).\n\nOwens, in typical fashion, unleashed a series of hateful screeds in attacking the inclusion of minorities in modeling campaigns.\n\nIn a number of her Daily Wire podcast-cum-YouTube videos, Owens, in typical fashion, unleashed a series of hateful screeds in attacking the inclusion of minorities in modeling campaigns, and used bad faith arguments to lash out at her detractors. In her most recent episode, published Wednesday, Owens shared that one viewer who uses a wheelchair wrote to the host and explained the Skims ad campaign made her believe she could fulfill her lifelong dream of being a model. Owens responded: \"Okay, so what you're saying there is you want to be patronized. You want people to essentially hand out participation trophies - you're perhaps not the best person suited for this particular role, but you want people to give it to you anyways ... you're seeing Victoria's Secret fashion shows with clinically obese people.\" Companies do this in part to pander to liberals, Owens contends, but also to \"placate the literal mob,\" who threaten violence unless they get their \"token Black person, token fat person, a person that is disabled, [and] the trans person\" in ad campaigns.\n\nOwens escalated the absurdity : \"People were accusing me of not wanting disabled people to wear underwear. ... That's true, everybody knows that I can't stand that. Everybody knows you have to see a model doing something to know that you're allowed to do it. Until I saw a Black woman wearing clothes on a billboard, I was naked my whole life. I was just butt naked walking around. Until I saw Tyra Banks on Top Model, I was butt naked. So, thank you, representation matters.\"\n\nOK, Candace ...\n\nBut this whole conversation touches on an increasingly fundamental tenet of the right-wing culture wars: \"Diversity\" as a boogeyman has entered every facet of the far-right zeitgeist and become an obsession, a catchall scapegoat for reactionary pundits and politicians across the country.\n\nOn Thursday, World Athletics announced a total ban on transgender women competing in the female category for international events (there are currently no trans female athletes competing internationally). Self-penned anti-woke leader Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis blamed the fall of Silicon Valley Bank diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives .\n\nScapegoating minorities and associated fear-mongering is not a new tactic. It's a trusted go-to in the reactionary playbook. But as inclusion, perceived increased influence of minoritiesand DEI initiatives gain more steam than ever, we're seeing a predictably loud retaliation from the right.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the right's fear about the threat of inclusion and diversity is, well, not real. Yes, improved inclusion can help on the margins. Endless studies have made the case that diversity can help avoid \"groupthink\" and promote innovation and creativity. And, generally, giving marginalized populations opportunities they've historically not had is a good idea. But, as I made the case in my article about Rishi Sunak's ascent as the U.K.'s first prime minister of color, we often confuse tokenism with meaningful diversity, and simply including more minorities in systems designed to oppress them is not progress.\n\n\"Diversity\" as a boogeyman has entered every facet of the far-right zeitgeist and become an obsession, a catchall scapegoat for reactionary pundits and politicians across the country.\n\nA 2020 Harvard Business Review paper titled \"Getting Serious About Diversity: Enough Already with the Business Case,\" makes the case that \"there is no research support for the notion that diversifying the workforce automatically improves a company's performance. ... To fully benefit from increased racial and gender diversity, organizations must adopt a learning orientation and be willing to change the corporate culture and power structure.\"\n\nAnd here is the crux of the issue. Institutions and power structures predicated on white supremacist, patriarchal, ableist, heteronormative systems designed for the dominant classes cannot fundamentally be reshaped by the simple inclusion of women and minorities.\n\nBuilding on the work of Black, lesbian and radical feminists, author and cultural critic Marcie Bianco makes this case in her forthcoming book, \" Breaking Free: The Lie of Equality and the Feminist Fight for Freedom .\" The proclamation that inclusion equates equality is a lie that merely helps expand the harmful systems we want to \"smash,\" Bianco rightly contends.\n\nSo, yes, empowering oppressed classes is, in theory, threatening to those in power. But, no, the extent of the right's fear is not warranted. The inclusion of an underwear model in a wheelchair in a Skims ad campaign and general DEI initiatives are not going to lead to the French Revolution. But the sheer terror, fear and hatred exhibited by the right every time DEI initiatives make modest advances speaks volumes about how tenuous they believe their own power to be.\n\nNoor Noman is a writer focused on culture, race and LGBTQ issues.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Influencers and popular podcasts fuel election disinformation among Black voters, report shows\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nAt least 40 million Americans may be regularly targeted and fed disinformation within Black online spaces by a host of sources across social media, fueling false information around the election, according to a new report published Tuesday.\n\nTouted as the first deep dive into understanding disinformation targeting Black America, the report, published by Onyx Impact , a nonprofit organization working to combat disinformation within the Black community, identified half a dozen core online networks \"reaching or targeting\" Black Americans online with false and misleading narratives.\n\nConservative commentators like Candace Owens are among the most influential distributors of false information, according to the report, followed by a variety of sources, such as platforms geared toward the Black manosphere, like the \"Fresh and Fit\" podcast. Some episodes of the show have outright challenged women's intelligence and allowed guests to share false and harmful narratives without pushback.\n\nThe report identifies some platforms like the nationally syndicated radio show, \"The Breakfast Club,\" as a \"gateway influencer\" or an authentic online space that holds critical space for stemming the tide of disinformation. These platforms, however, are also often targets for \"bad actors to introduce harmful narratives,\" according to the report.\n\nThree other effective sources of disinformation, the report notes, are extreme Black nativists and separatists, like Foundational Black Americans who don't believe in the concept of pan-Africanism and have stressed that people who are not descendants of enslaved people should not speak for or on behalf of Black Americans, as well as health skeptics such as Rizza Islam, an activist and self-proclaimed intellectual extremist, who has said without evidence that childhood vaccines \"destroy the brain chemistry\" and lead to autism and other disabilities. According to the CDC , this is not true. None of the other individuals or platforms listed above responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe report also identified foreign actors \"that seek to influence U.S. political discourse,\" like the digital media company African Stream.\n\nAfrican Stream denied spreading misinformation, adding that they \"present an authentically African perspective.\"\n\n\"We have a vigorous fact-checking process, which means work is checked by three different trained journalists three times before posting on our platforms,\" the Nairobi-based company said in a statement, describing their work as a \"Pan-African digital media platform covering affairs concerning Africans at home and in the diaspora.\"\n\nOnyx Impact found those six sources collectively have a potential reach of nearly 41 million Americans, adding that each represents spaces where skepticism, anti-Black rhetoric and deception of truth run rampant. For context, that figure is equivalent to nearly every Black person in the country, according to the latest census data.\n\nOver four months, a team of researchers for Onyx Impact identified 2,500 online accounts creating, sharing or amplifying disinformation to Black communities. The researchers also held seven national focus groups of Black audiences to understand how those narratives were showing up in offline spaces. The point of the effort was to gauge the impact of the information, said the founder of Onyx Impact, Esosa Osa, an alumnus of the voting rights group Fair Fight.\n\nConstant repetition of false or misleading information, \"no matter how kind of absurd that disinformation is,\" said Osa, can be effective across audiences, regardless of income, education or class. \"Disinformation works because the more times that we hear something, the more likely we are to believe that it is true,\" she said.\n\nNarratives with the highest reach and impact across the networks, the report says, include misleading narratives focused on promises that these networks say President Joe Biden has broken, civic engagement and issues that stoke division.\n\nEarlier this year, for example, Owens tweeted without evidence that vaccines cause an \"explosion\" of childhood cancer. But experts, through data , have denied that any link exists. In another instance, Owens shared inaccurate information that the shooter that killed 21 people, including 19 children, at Robb Elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, in 2022 was transgender, an assertion that was based on the wrong photos of the shooter.\n\nCritics have also repeatedly slammed the popular gossip site The Shade Room for being a hub for disinformation, particularly on issues related to Biden. The outlet once reported about a Biden-backed program to distribute \"crack pipes\" to promote health equity. The site ran with an article by The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website. The post quickly went viral, and the White House called it \"misleading and misinformed.\" In reality, the program was harm-reduction program meant to reduce drug overdoses. The Shade Room corrected the information in a follow-up post and took the original post down, but for many , the misinformation had already spread further than the truth.\n\nThe Shade Room did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe report noted that \"confronting the challenges created by misinformation\" is \"crucial to ensuring the health and stability of our democracy.\"\n\nWhen it is left unchecked, experts said, disinformation can have devastating effects on the most marginalized communities, including harming physical and mental health.\n\nTimothy Welbeck, a civil rights attorney and director of the Center for Anti-Racism at Temple University, said disinformation presented as fact has the \"heightened ability\" to influence Black communities' decision-making in ways never before seen, particularly less than five months from a presidential election.\n\n\"It can either encourage [voter] apathy or potentially encourage people to vote differently than they would have already,\" Welbeck said, noting that Americans' biggest issues, from the economy to Israel's war with Hamas to federal judicial appointments, will greatly be affected by who becomes president in November - in his eyes, a direct byproduct of how successful disinformation continues to spread.\n\nOnyx Impact offered strategic guidance in the report to those combating disinformation to engage with those platforms by identifying trusted messengers and discrediting bad actors. While there is no evidence that African Americans are more susceptible to disinformation than any other ethnic group, Osa said, consistent targeting of any group has a way of breaking through.\n\n\"Black voters are likely less susceptible to many disinformation narratives given their deserved higher levels of skepticism in institutions and government overall,\" she said, \"but just like other communities, when disinformation is targeted and comes from messengers with standing, it can be incredibly effective and dangerous.\"\n\nPolling shows that disinformation remains a concern for most Americans.\n\nA national survey published this month by the media reform group Free Press found that 79% of adults in the U.S. worry that what they read online includes \"fake\" or \"false\" information with the deliberate goal to \"confuse.\" The poll of 3,000 people across the U.S. also found that 76% of respondents are concerned that they were reading misleading information online about the presidential election. Black Americans, in particular, are also disproportionately more likely to get their news from social media, the Free Press survey found.\n\nOsa said there is nothing new about increased disinformation and misinformation ahead of recent presidential elections. In 2016, Russia set out to interfere with the election by spreading propaganda on social media, hacking into campaigns and probing state voter databases, according to a Senate report . In 2020, there were coordinated efforts to deter Black voters from going to the polls more systematically, including conservative activists' making more than a thousand fake robocalls to deter Detroit voters, who are overwhelmingly Black, from voting by mail.\n\nToday, however, Osa said, the way disinformation is presented to a population with outsize political power and influence continues to be more sophisticated. Black Americans are projected to account for 14% of eligible voters in November and have a higher turnout rate than Latino voters, despite making up a lower share of the U.S. population.\n\nRecent outreach to Black voters by Biden and former President Donald Trump is evidence of an emphasis on capturing the demographic.\n\nThe latest NBC News poll found that 2 in 3 Black voters ages 18 to 49 support Biden, as well as 88% of older Black voters.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has garnered support from 1 in 4 young Black voters ahead of this year's election and 6% of older Black voters, according to the NBC News poll, in an election in which even minor changes in voting patterns in battleground states could decide the race.\n\nBy comparison, in 2020, no less than 78% of Black voters chose Biden, according to exit polling data .\n\nBut not all experts believe disinformation efforts have substantial influence now or will have it in the future.\n\nDeen Freelon, a presidential professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania and an expert in digital politics, remains hesitant about overstating how deep misinformation runs within the Black community.\n\n\"It is incredibly difficult to draw a straight line between any kind of communication ... and the kinds of attitudinal and behavioral changes that people would like communication to have,\" he said. \"It's just very hard to change people's minds and their behavior in substantial ways from what they're already doing.\"\n\nHowever, Freelon acknowledged that even a slight change in behavior could tip the race to Biden or Trump.\n\n\"The vast majority of people who consume [disinformation] is a small group of people, but in a close election, a small group of people can be sufficient to, at least potentially, sway the election one way or the other,\" he said.\n\nCORRECTION (June 26, 2024, 12:17 a.m. ET): An earlier version of this article misclassified The Breakfast Club, according to the report's criteria. The report classifies it as a \"gateway influencer,\" not as an outright distributor of false information.\n\nFor more from NBC BLK, sign up for our weekly newsletter .\n\nMarquise Francis is a correspondent for \"Stay Tuned.\"\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Many of them used the phrase \"echo chamber\" when discussing their concerns about the platforms.\n\n\"I think the challenge that a lot of these newer ones have is to not be an echo chamber for people who hold similar beliefs,\" said Alex Weber, a content creator who was embraced by conservatives online after posting videos criticizing mask mandates, vaccine mandates and the mainstream media. \"I think why Instagram and Facebook and all these are so impactful is because you've got all different types of people.\"\n\nAs anti-Big-Tech sentiments have gained popularity in recent years among conservatives, a smattering of new platforms have popped up, attempting to take advantage of a market of social media users who may be looking for alternatives to big names like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nThose platforms have attracted some users and conservative influencers, but they remain far smaller than their larger rivals and have so far proven unable to attract mainstream audiences, through which many conservative influencers have amassed major followings.\n\nIt hasn't been for lack of support from big-name Republicans. Former President Donald Trump's app, Truth Social, made its debut on Apple's App Store in late February and received high-profile name checks at CPAC from speakers like Kimberly Guilfoyle - Donald Trump Jr.'s partner and a former adviser to Trump. Gettr, another app that bills itself as a free speech alternative to big social media platforms, was a prominent sponsor of the conference.\n\nConservative influencers do use these platforms. Isabel Brown, who has over 100,000 Instagram followers, got her start while working with the conservative campus organization Turning Point USA, and now she is a full-time content creator.\n\nBrown livestreams on Gettr and said she's been impressed with the engagement on the site thus far. She's also been vocal about her hesitancy to embrace a move off of big social media platforms.\n\nIn a February episode of \"Candace\" - a show hosted by conservative personality Candace Owens - Brown disputed the idea of a new conservative internet, calling upstart platforms \"echo chambers\" of \"conservative thoughts, statements and values.\"\n\n\"I think it's a mistake for us to abandon where the rest of culture is,\" she said in the episode. \"How are you supposed to grow your movement if you're not reaching other people where they're at in a language they understand.\"\n\n\"I just think it's really important that conservatives not only create a better alternative, where censorship isn't so much of a problem, but they fight to make sure censorship isn't a problem where the rest of culture is too,\" she told NBC News.\n\nBrown described the world of conservative influencers as the \"Wild West,\" saying there's no real industry standard of success. Brown said she makes her living primarily through independent contractor agreements with conservative organizations like Turning Point USA, which has paid her to advocate for conservative causes in the media, and sales of her book on Amazon.\n\nAs with most influencers, a large audience is key to building a monetizable brand. Long-term follower growth on alternative platforms may be hard to come by, according to a January Washington Post analysis that found little follower growth on alt platforms in the last year for many top conservative influencers.\n\nIt's not just content creators who have mixed feelings about the platforms.\n\nCristian Clementi, 25, is a Turning Point USA field representative in Miami, working to activate young people around conservative causes. He was frustrated by Truth Social's waitlist and said he thinks most alternative platforms are echo chambers.\n\n\"The people that they're trying to reach are on the major platforms,\" he said. \"I think it's kind of counterintuitive to make your own platform, but it's all everybody that agrees with you rather than the people that might be in the middle or don't agree with you at all.\"\n\nClementi said the creation of the new apps probably won't help with recruitment for Turning Point USA.\n\n\"We're trying to reach a lot of students that either haven't heard of us or aren't familiar with us,\" he said. \"And those people probably aren't the most politically inclined, which means they're not on these other social media apps.\"\n\nBen Goggin is the deputy tech editor for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "This lefty commentator goes calmly where others dare not. Has he bridged the internet's toxic divide?\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nDavid Pakman can't remember the last time he lost his cool.\n\nThat's pretty rare for someone who makes a living talking about politics online, which Pakman has done for more than 13 years. Look across YouTube or TikTok and you'll find videos of him forcefully but calmly making the case for progressive politics, sometimes in digital venues where those politics are not particularly popular.\n\nThat's given Pakman, 39, a peculiar profile. He's one of the few liberal pundits who is more likely to get name-checked by Steve Bannon than Rachel Maddow. He's a more familiar figure to fans of Joe Rogan than Ezra Klein.\n\n\"I don't get into the shouting matches or the screaming matches,\" he said in a recent video interview from his home, part of which also doubles as the studio where he records \"The David Pakman Show.\" \"I don't really consider that I'm playing a character when I do what I do. It's really just my genuine demeanor. But it's also calculated in the sense that I don't think the audience is well served if I get into those shouting matches.\"\n\nAnother surprise is where you won't find Pakman. He's a liberal - a progressive social democrat, as he puts it - but he rarely pops up in many of the places to which most lefty pundits aspire. He's never been on MSNBC (NBCUniversal is the parent company of NBC News and MSNBC) or written for The New York Times. Yes, he's on Twitter (where he has 254,000 followers), but he doesn't engage in the kinds of fights that could raise his profile.\n\nInstead, he's made his mark in places where liberal commentators have either struggled to gain traction or hesitate to go. Many are podcasts or web shows that aren't household names but have dedicated fan bases that skew young and male. An incomplete list of his most notable appearances: Joe Rogan's podcast (twice), the Lex Fridman Podcast, the Pomp Podcast, Modern Wisdom and PBD Podcast.\n\nPakman said he is not on a crusade to reach people who might not otherwise encounter progressive politics, although he does hope to do just that. Rather, Pakman said he built an audience outside the mainstream, partly as a function of his style, which provides some relief to people who have grown tired of the toxicity of internet-based political discourse . He wrote a guide available for free called \"Building Arguments Without Burning Bridges.\"\n\nWhich is not to say Pakman pulls his punches or is above a little snark. Many of his videos focus on Republicans and conservative media with a certain measured snark. In a recent video about Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' presidential announcement on Twitter, he called the event a \"global humiliation\" alongside a few wry chuckles.\n\nPakman's home base is YouTube, where he has 1.7 million subscribers, followed by TikTok, with more than 485,000 followers.\n\n\"I'm sort of in a different space,\" he said. \"And so the folks that are going to pay me six bucks a month for my premium content, there's some overlap, but it's not necessarily the same people who just have MSNBC on from 7 to 10 p.m. every day.\"\n\nPakman is a small part of a large and thriving world of online media that is either focused on politics or dabbles in it. Much of this media takes the form of shows that resemble the political radio programs of years past, anchored by magnetic personalities who have gained significant followings usually through some combination of YouTube, podcasting and, increasingly, TikTok.\n\nAnd like the radio world, there's a political imbalance, with conservative and right-wing commentators finding much more success than their liberal counterparts. The subscriber numbers of Pakman and most other lefty online commentators are dwarfed by those of Ben Shapiro (2.3 million YouTube subscribers), Steven Crowder (5.9 million YouTube subscribers), Candace Owens (3.7 million Twitter followers), Matt Walsh (2.5 million YouTube subscribers) and others. It's a digital media world so lucrative Shapiro and Crowder recently engaged in a public feud over a contract offered to Crowder worth $50 million.\n\nThe conservative part of that world is also far more interconnected than its liberal equivalent, both in terms of behind-the-scenes support from conservative donors and with more mainstream media like Fox News, according to Reece Peck, an associate professor in the department of media culture at the City University of New York. That's something creators like Pakman can't bank on.\n\n\"It's just very difficult for progressives to get funding,\" Peck said. \"They just don't have that advantage, and so they have to live and die by the algorithm and by their audiences.\"\n\nPakman, who was born in Argentina and moved to the U.S. when he was 5, started his show when he was an undergraduate at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst on WXOJ, an independent nonprofit radio station based outside Springfield. Meeting Cenk Uygur, host of \"The Young Turks, \" at a media conference convinced him to give YouTube a shot, launching his channel in September 2009. Uygur and his show went on to become one of the most successful news shows on YouTube, now counting more than 5.4 million subscribers.\n\nSince then, it's been a relatively slow grind to where he is now. Pakman's YouTube channel stats show more than 30,000 videos uploaded, which have accrued more than 1.5 billion views. He hasn't had any particularly viral moments that have propelled him suddenly into the spotlight. Pakman said even some of his most high-profile appearances offered only modest subscriber bumps, but he did see considerable growth during the pandemic.\n\nPakman said he sees his primary audience in three groups: die-hard fans who may support him vocally online and possibly financially, then more casual consumers of politics and news content who sometimes encounter him in places where he receives vehement opposition, and, lastly, people who completely disagree with him.\n\nThe audience for online news has continued to grow, particularly among young people , many of whom list YouTube and TikTok as parts of their media diet. That audience has become more lucrative as social media platforms became more commercialized, said Becca Lewis, an academic who has studied digital political subcultures.\n\nLewis added that many of those creators have flown under the mainstream radar, but that this dynamic is shifting.\n\n\"Some of these figures, I would say someone like Ben Shapiro or Joe Rogan, they've kind of become household names in a certain sense,\" Lewis said. \"But a lot of people who are really popular and do have massive viewership, that really devoted viewership, don't always get that household name recognition. It's a different variety of fame, in a way.\"\n\nLike many internet-based content creators, Pakman has a few income streams that he said are relatively even: direct sales to advertisers, ads on platforms like YouTube and subscription memberships sold through his website, which are $5 per month.\n\nIt's lucrative enough that Pakman said he has no plans to try to use his current platforms to move into a more mainstream role. He said he values the freedom he has with his own operation and being able to set his own schedule, which includes taking time to be a father to his first child, who turns 1 in June.\n\n\"To be totally honest, 10 years ago, using this show to become a regular guest on some network to maybe eventually become a guest host to maybe eventually get a show would have seemed like a reasonable path,\" he said. \"At my current level of success, it's no longer appealing.\"\n\nJason Abbruzzese is the assistant managing editor of tech and science for NBC News Digital.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Ron DeSantis, who immediately said the brothers were not welcome in the state. State Attorney General James Uthmeier, who is the governor's former chief of staff and close political adviser, said the state would open a criminal investigation into the men, although he did not outline specific allegations.\n\nAndrew Tate announced Thursday that he was leaving Florida - saying he'd be back \"in a few years\" - which likely ends any potential investigation. (His brother also posted a picture from a plane.) But the political impact on DeSantis' future might last longer.\n\nDeSantis' decision to antagonize some on the right by going hard after the Tate brothers puts him at odds with elements of the MAGA movement - including some allies of the president - who are still upset with him for challenging Donald Trump in the 2024 election.\n\nTrump himself has avoided talking about the return of the Tate brothers or the Florida investigation into them, but the issue has put DeSantis and Uthmeier at the center of a fight on the political right over whether the men, who hold dual U.S.-British citizenship, were being unfairly targeted since there have not been any criminal allegations against them in Florida, or if the Florida effort was squarely in line with conservative values to investigate two men accused of abusing women and girls.\n\nThe White House did not return a request seeking comment, but a Trump adviser brushed off the Tate issue, suggesting the investigation was just DeSantis' attempt to remain politically \"relevant\" after his failed presidential run against Trump.\n\nThe Trump orbit in the past has expressed support for the Tate brothers.\n\nAndrew Tate and Donald Trump Jr. appeared in a discussion on X last summer focused on Hunter Biden's legal problems.\n\nTrump Jr. called Tate \"buddy,\" and Tate called him \"friend.\" During the event, Trump Jr. said that Tate was being unfairly attacked.\n\n\"You have people attacking you as far as I'm concerned. ... They just want to silence you,\" he said. \"You have entered the arena by speaking out.\"\n\nAlina Habba, a counselor to the president, said in January during an interview with Andrew Tate that she was a \"big fan.\"\n\n\"I think your anger is the same that President Trump has for our country. And the time is now for us to stop being wimps,\" she said to Tate. \"I also have to say that I sympathize with you because I think you go through a lot of the same 'show me the person, I'll find the crime' that President Trump has gone through.\"\n\nBeyond the legal fight, the issue brought on renewed layers of political intrigue since the Tates arrived in Florida.\n\nRic Grenell, the Trump administration's presidential envoy for special missions, reposted an X post from Andrew Tate that accused DeSantis of attacking him because he \"was worried\" that Tate would support Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., in the Florida 2026 gubernatorial race. DeSantis has a notoriously icy relationship with Donalds, who has been endorsed by Trump, while his wife, Casey DeSantis, is considering her own run for governor against Donalds.\n\n\"Interestingly, I had no interest in Florida politics until I learnt how communist the DeSantis admin is,\" Tate said in the post elevated by Grenell. \"The game is on.\"\n\nOver the past week, DeSantis supporters have pressured Donalds to comment on the Tate issue. On Wednesday, he did, siding with DeSantis' position and against the Tates.\n\n\"I think those allegations have to be fully investigated, and that we go from there,\" Donalds told CBC News . \"The key thing is, we don't tolerate the trafficking of women, or frankly, the abuse of women. We do not tolerate that.\"\n\n\"If the attorney general finds cause under Florida law to investigate that, then I wish him the best, and I support whatever he's going to do on the matter,\" he added.\n\nThe Tate brothers, both former kickboxers, rose to fame as leaders of the \"manosphere\" movement, a misogynistic culture that elevates men and works to push back against feminism. They have built significant wealth and an intense international following advocating for those positions.\n\nIn 2017, Andrew Tate tweeted that women should \" bare some responsibility \" for being sexually assaulted.\n\nThe office of Uthmeier, the DeSantis-appointed state attorney general, said it has executed search warrants against the brothers and was pushing forward with its investigation.\n\n\"These guys have themselves publicly admitted to participating in what very much appears to be soliciting, trafficking, preying on women around the world, many of these victims coming forward, some of them minors,\" Uthmeier said Wednesday. \"People can spin or defend however they want, but in Florida this type of behavior is viewed as atrocious.\"\n\nUthmeier's office did not return a request for comment on the status of the investigation now that Andrew Tate has said he left the state.\n\nAndrew Tate, the more prominent of the brothers, used his X account, which has 10.7 million followers, and friendly podcasts to aggressively push back against the Florida investigation, framing himself as being unfairly targeted.\n\nIn one post , Tate likened DeSantis and Uthmeier to Lavrentiy Beria, one of the secret police chiefs of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.\n\nIn an interview Wednesday with right-wing podcaster Candace Owens, Andrew Tate said that he has had \"all his phones and laptops seized,\" an assertion that the Florida attorney general's office has not confirmed.\n\nLast week, Joseph McBride, the brothers' U.S.-based attorney, said the two men planned to return to Romania at the end of March to meet with prosecutors, with plans to eventually come back to the U.S.\n\n\"They feel secure in America for several reasons, the primary one being that Donald Trump is the President,\" McBride said in a statement. \"As a result, they are excited to call America their home again.\"\n\nAndrew Tate did not say where they were heading in his X post, and McBride did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nIt remains unclear how or why Romania relaxed travel restrictions imposed on the Tate brothers after their arrests in 2022. Romania officials have denied any outside influence, including from the Trump administration, even as they have offered no explanation.\n\n\"I have no knowledge of any pressure,\" Justice Minister Radu Marinescu told Public Record . \"Authorities from other states have made no official request.\"\n\nMatt Dixon is a senior national politics reporter for NBC News, based in Florida.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Glenn Youngkin and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp will be among the speakers appearing at Washington and Lee University's Mock Convention next month - a student event that has often hosted future presidents and presidential candidates in the past.\n\nThe event occurs every four years and models itself after the nominating convention for the out-of-power party seeking a return to the White House. The last day of \"Mock Con,\" which will be held Feb. 9-10 this year, features a prediction by students of who will be nominated at the actual Republican convention in Milwaukee later this year.\n\nAlso headlining this year's event are former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who ran for president but dropped out earlier this month, former White House press secretary and current Fox News host Kayleigh McEnany, Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk and conservative activist Candace Owens.\n\nYoungkin, Kemp and Pompeo were all subject of presidential speculation earlier in the 2024 election cycle, but each of them declined to run for president this time around.\n\n\"The main goal of this convention - both from an educational and an entertainment standpoint - is to represent a wide breadth of beliefs within the party,\" said Madison McGinley, a senior at Washington and Lee who is serving as speaker's chair of this year's Mock Convention. \"That's kind of how we landed on names like Asa Hutchinson, but also Donald Trump Jr.\"\n\n\"We're trying to inform the student body of what the party is looking like and how this election is going to go,\" McGinley added.\n\nMcGinley and other students in charge of organizing the convention began reaching out to potential speakers two years ago.\n\n\"The difficulty with that, especially with elected officials, is most of them don't make their schedules until about a month or two out. So, the most important part of it was keeping our names at the top of their mind,\" McGinley said.\n\nThe university has been hosting this convention every four years since 1908, with the main goal of predicting the out-of-power party's nominee, Mock Convention press secretary Addie-Grace Cook told NBC News.\n\n\"Since 1908, we've been right 75% of the time overall, and since 1948, we've had 100% accuracy in predicting Republican nominations,\" Cook said.\n\nIn the past, the convention has also hosted future presidents, candidates and ticket-mates among the speakers, including then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, then-Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter, then-Delaware Sen. Joe Biden, and then-Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater. Former President Harry Truman and former Vice President Dick Cheney have also spoken at the event in the past.\n\nThis was a fact that went into the group's decision making about whom to invite to speak this year, McGinley told NBC News.\n\n\"That was definitely a conscious part of the process,\" McGinley said, adding: \"We've had a lot of former presidents. And obviously that is a legacy we want to continue to uphold.\n\nAlexandra Marquez is a politics reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Media\n\nWelcome back to Semafor Media, where the news doesnât care about your summer vacation.\n\nThe political news cycle â and the politicians â have finally caught up with a decade of radical shifts in media.\n\nThe new faces in presidential politics, JD Vance and Tim Walz, are far closer to this generationâs news media. Vance, to his political benefit and detriment, is very online. His media fluency helped propel him to conservative stardom, but could be a political risk among a wider audience. Walz is a folksy master of the cable TV cycle, but also a guy who spent a lot of time with reporters on Capitol Hill, and his addition to the ticket was partially the result of a concerted campaign by his team to raise his profile over the last two years.\n\nAll of it amounts to a fascinating and, letâs be honest here, exciting moment for a political news media that has been pretty parched over the past few years. And as the presidential cycles swallows the news over the next few months, itâs one weâll be navigating here â please respond to this email if youâve got story ideas, or other ways we could make this product better.\n\nAlso : This week, I used Benâs absence as an opportunity to write about a thesis he didnât get quite right during the Biden era: the struggles of independent conservative publishers, which have benefited less than they hoped from the Biden years. Plus Nancy Pelosiâs book tour, a wrinkle for Smartmatic, and more British media news in America. (Scoop count: 5)\n\nItâs hardly a surprise that Ben Shapiro is working on another book. Publishing remains one of the most lucrative elements of a successful media career on the right, and the Daily Wire co-founder is at the top of the list of in-demand voices. The new book will be a payday for the commentator, already a multiple-time New York Times bestselling author.\n\nBut Shapiro would apparently rather be the author of the book than its publisher.\n\nJust three years after its splashy launch, the Daily Wireâs publishing arm has largely wound down its operations. Alyssa Cordova, who was brought on to lead the imprint when it launched in 2021, is now a communications person for the media company. Plans for books by Candace Owens never materialized after she flamed out and parted ways with the company. And when Shapiro publishes his next book, it will likely be with a major publisher, not his own imprint.\n\nâDaily Wire was actually quite successful with the books we did publish by industry standards, but traditional book publishing is high effort and low margin and doesnât make sense for the pace of our business right now,â Cordova told Semafor in an email. âWe are still positioned to publish books in-house that make sense for us (for example, specialty books like Johnny the Walrus by Matt Walsh â which has sold over 150,000 copies â and kidsâ books tied with our childrenâs entertainment content) but, for now, current events nonfiction books by our hosts make more sense to outsource.â\n\nThe Daily Wireâs pivot reflects a broader realization on the right, as publishers have struggled to recreate the book sales of the conservative imprints at major publishing houses.\n\nPeople close to Donald Trump launched Winning Team Publishing in 2021 with the goal of circumventing major publishers and self-publishing books by the former president and members of his political coalition. But the company hasnât had much luck selling books beyond those written by its signature author.\n\nItâs difficult to tell how many books Winning Team has sold because the publisher sells many of the titles directly to customers, meaning its sales donât show up in BookScan, which tallies sales from Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and other retailers. But Fox News host Judge Jeanine Pirro, whose last book with Hachette sold 75,000 copies, published a book via Winning Team in 2023 that sold 18,000, according to BookScan. Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirkâs 2022 book with the Trump family publisher sold just more than 15,500 copies, while his latest book released in June has sold just 6,000. When Kirk released his 2020 book with HarperCollins, it sold nearly 60,000 copies. Still, others did worse: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greeneâs Winning Team-published book sold just under 4,000 copies in major retailers, per BookScan.\n\nThe publisher has brought in some real revenue selling high-priced Trump books as, essentially, collectorsâ items. BookScan said it sold nearly 47,000 copies at $99 each, and 42,000 copies of Trumpâs Our Journey Together at $74.99 per book. Thatâs a lot of money for a self-publisher, though it is nowhere close to the sales numbers of other recent presidential memoirs; Barack Obamaâs post-White House memoir sold several million copies, while Michelle Obamaâs book did even better.\n\nSteve Bannonâs War Room Books imprint hasnât fared much better. Conservative internet personality and conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec â though currently a New York Times bestseller â has sold 23,000 copies of his book Unhumans: The Secret History of Communist Revolutions (and How to Crush Them) since it was released last month. But other books, like a biography of Trump attorney Roy Cohn, have sold just a few hundred copies in major online and physical retailers, according to BookScan.\n\nThe numbers stand in stark contrast to sales by the major imprints, which have been much higher over the same period.\n\nMark Levinâs book, published by Simon & Schusterâs Threshold Editions late last year, has sold more than 310,000 copies. Philip C. McGraw, better known as Dr. Phil, has sold 100,000 copies of his anti-cancel culture book this year, while Kellyanne Conwayâs book is nearing 80,000 copies sold. Fox News personalities Harris Faulkner and Shannon Bream published books over the last two years that cleared 369,000 and 325,000 copies, respectively, as did Pete Hegseth, who has sold more than 300,000 copies of his last two books (all three published with HarperCollinsâ imprint Broadside).\n\nOther conservative upstarts have found that the nonfiction book publishing business is thorny and can occasionally be complicated by real-life events.\n\nAll Seasons Press, started by former executives from Simon & Schuster and Hachette, has been embroiled in a series of lawsuits with some of its own authors, including former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows. The publisher has spent the last year trying to claw back its $350,000 book advance, saying that Meadows violated his contract with the publisher by telling U.S. special prosecutor Jack Smith that he never believed Trumpâs election fraud claims, a contradiction of what he wrote in his 2021 book. The publisher was recently acquired by Skyhorse, another independent publisher that over the last several months has hoovered up conservative publishers, including Regnery.\n\nRead on for details on the rightâs publishing ambitions and Maxâs View .  â\n\nRead on for details on the rightâs publishing ambitions and Maxâs View .  â\n\nInside the biggest stories transforming the Arabian Peninsula and the world .

The former House Speaker has been on a media tour this week promoting her new book The Art of Power amid intense media interest in the former speaker, who helped play a role in pressuring Joe Biden to step aside and advocating for Vice President Kamala Harris to select Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate.\n\nIt hasnât gone unnoticed by Pelosiâs allies, who have privately congratulated her on helping put together a Democratic ticket that seems poised to compete with Trump in November. During one of her media stops earlier this week in New York, a Semafor tipster could overhear Pelosi on the phone with a close confidante who congratulated the former speaker, telling her: âThis is your ticket. You created this.â\n\nPhoto finish: Will we ever see the photos taken of Joe Biden and his family as he mulled over whether to drop out of the race? In late June, The New York Times reported that much of the Biden family had gathered in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware to be photographed by Annie Leibovitz. It was remarkable timing for the iconic American portrait photographer, who is responsible for some of the most memorable images of American presidents. It turns out the photos may not be seen for a while. According to one person familiar with the photoshoot, it was not for a Conde Nast publication (where she publishes the majority of her news-focused portraiture) but rather a personal project for the family.\n\nVoguing: JFKâs viral grandson Jack Schlossberg, newly a campaign correspondent for Vogue, is proving that even in the era of fragmentation, members of the news media can still be celebrities on the campaign trail.\n\nBritish Invasion: The BBC is bringing on Ben Goldberger as GM and GM & Executive Director of Editorial Content at BBC Studios to head up the companyâs editorial strategy outside the United States. Goldberger, who joins the organization in September, is currently an executive with Time. Itâs the latest move for the British news organization which has increasingly looked to grow its US news presence. Last year, the company expanded its Washington, D.C. primetime evening programming, launched a daily podcast aimed at North American audiences, debuted its first ever brand campaign outside the UK, and relaunched its North America website.\n\nâIâm delighted Ben is joining BBC Studios. He is a rare, brilliant talent, combining editorial excellence with commercial experience. He has a track record of digital innovation and will be a huge asset to the business,â Deborah Turness, CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, said in a statement first shared with Semafor. âI look forward to partnering with him to grow our international news offer - particularly in the US market. This is a hugely consequential time in the US with the countdown to Novemberâs election, and the BBC is the most trusted brand that rises above Americaâs polarised politics to deliver facts, not opinion.â\n\nDept. of Reputational Harm : Ben and Semaforâs Shelby Talcott got the scoop , back before we launched, about an federal investigation into allegations that the voting machine company Smartmatic corrupty obtained a contract in the Philippines. Now two executives at the company have been indicted â a move greeted with relief at Fox Corp,, which faces a defamation lawsuit similar to the one that it paid $787 million to Dominion Voting Systems to settle in 2023. Smartmatic lawyer Erik Connolly told Semafor, however that while the company takes the charges âseriously,â they âshould not impactâ the case: âThe recent development does not change the fact that these defendants lied about the 2020 election, the lie injured Smartmatic, and they need to answer for the consequences of their actions.â\n\nItâs on: Trump reversed course this week, agreeing to an ABC News-hosted debate with Harris after backing out late Saturday evening. But as we wrote last week, while ABC has the only confirmed debate, NBC News is in discussions with both campaigns about a potential additional contest.\n\nOlympic jump: This yearâs summer Olympic broadcasts have been a major bounceback for NBC from a disappointing 2021 Tokyo broadcast. NBC averaged 32.2 million viewers across its TV and streaming platforms, a 76% increase from 2021, and accounted for 8 of the top 10 most streamed days on Peacock.\n\nSports talk: Vox Media is continuing to build out its high-level sports podcast business. We reported earlier this week that Pittsburgh Steelers defensive tackle Cam Heyward was bringing his podcast to Vox Media (it was previously distributed by ESPN), the second sports podcast it has signed in three months following the relaunch of Megan Rapinoe and Sue Birdâs show. While ESPN remains by far the biggest game in town, some more outspoken athletes have found that dealing with a media partner who doesnât have broadcast rights can be an appealing offer for more editorial freedom.\n\nSetting things straight: After a union walkout this week, Crooked Media and its employee union settled their labor dispute, releasing a joint statement saying they were âready to channel the immense talent, passion, and creativity into calling JD Vance a creepy weirdo.â\n\nOthello in the Desert: Our colleague Liz Hoffman reported recently on Daniel Craig and Bond producer Barbara Broccoliâs quest to find money â and perhaps a location â in Qatar to finance a passion product of Craigâs, a version of Othello set in an American barracks in Iraq. Now the project seems to have some momentum: A Bond fan tipped us off to a British filing by Broccoliâs Eon Productions, registering a new Othello Film Company Limited . Craig and Broccoli, along with director Sam Gold, are â a person familiar with conversations told us âare hoping to bring the 2016 limited run of the show, which got rave reviews, to the screen. The filings are silent on another question: Whether the Qataris could use the talks to get Broccoli to set part of a bond film in Doha.\n\nNovel idea : Bad earnings reports from Warner Brothers Discovery and Paramount last week were a reminder that the cable news business continues to be a bad one. At Business Insider, Peter Kafka makes the case for why Apple should use WBDâs cable woes as an opportunity to buy the company at a discounted price, potentially spinning off the declining assets and keeping the studio and streaming service.\n\nProrated: The Atlantic, Time magazine, the Financial Times, and other publishers have struck deals with the AI company ProRata, which is launching its own chatbot/search engine that will identify content generated by AI.\n\nRight on target: DotDash Meredith is touting its cookieless ad targeting tool, saying it was responsible for its second straight quarter of double digit ad revenue growth.\n\nWhat do the social media teams at Netflix, Apple, and Disney have in common?

The publisher was recently acquired by Skyhorse, another independent publisher that over the last several months has hoovered up conservative publishers, including Regnery.\n\nIn late 2021, Shapiroâs conservative digital media company, the Daily Wire, announced it was launching a book publishing arm with an ambitious goal: break the stranglehold the traditional book publishing houses had on conservative books.\n\nThe strategy, which mirrored the one laid out by the founders of All Seasons Press, was both practical and ideological. Shapiro understood that conservative books made money and represented legitimate revenue for the five major book publishing houses. A company like the Daily Wire, with its large online audience, could use its distribution to sell copies to its audiences without needing promotion in mainstream outlets or major airtime on Fox News, which remains one of the best ways to sell a conservative book.\n\nThere are some successful examples of this. The Daily Wire had a hit with a book by one of its personalities, Matt Walsh, who sold 115,000 copies, according to BookScan. I was personally surprised that All Seasonsâ Peter Navarro book cracked 80,000 copies sold, given that he has been a more fringe player within the Trump universe.\n\nWhile the publishing houses had their own conservative labels, conservatives increasingly felt that they were being isolated and censored at major publishers. Staff and other authors were organizing boycotts or raising concerns about conservative authors, particularly those who had stood with Trump or made excuses for his actions on Jan. 6.\n\nSemafor editor-in-chief Ben Smith, then The New York Timesâ media columnist, wrote that internal tensions at the major publishers following the riot on Jan. 6 represented a shift that could change conservative book publishing. New independent publishers could â have their pick of the MAGA litter, â and while conservative authors wouldnât get the huge advances offered by major publishers, internal uproars from left-leaning staff might slow the publication of major titles to a trickle.\n\nThe opposite has happened. The Biden era hasnât been the kind of boon to the conservative book publishing world that the Obama or Trump administrations were. But conservative imprints at major publishing houses have continued to publish a steady stream of titles that have put up impressive numbers.\n\nAnd the continued outperformance of books released by the traditional publishers demonstrates the edge that the traditional big players have in author selection, strategy, press, and distribution. The big playersâ scale also has allowed them to withstand flops, while the upstart indie publishers still need hits in order to justify the advances they need to woo authors away from the Big Five publishers.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor media"

      "text": "The new anti-Israel rightâs failure to launch\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nIn four days, Democratic voters will settle the most expensive House primary in American history, capping off a long season of brutal fights over Israel. Most of the money â $14.5 million and counting â has flowed from the pro-Israel group AIPAC, which has spent across the country against Democratic critics of the war in Gaza.\n\nThe group has spent less than $400,000 against Republicans, all of it targeting Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, a longtime opponent of foreign aid. âThe reason theyâre mad at me,â Massie told Semafor, âis that Mike Johnson keeps bringing votes on Israel to the floor to try to catch the Democrats in what I call sticky traps.â His own votes stood out, he said, because no other Republican was applying the partyâs Trump-era skepticism of foreign entanglements and spending to Israel.\n\nNine months after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, support for the war has been slipping. But calls for ceasefires and conditions on US aid have been concentrated among Democrats. Republicans, and the most powerful conservative groups, have largely spoken with one voice while shoving a relatively small minority of dissenting voices to the side with little incident.\n\nâThe vast majority of Republicans are resolutely pro-Israel,â said Turning Point Action founder Charlie Kirk, in an interview at the groupâs âpeopleâs conventionâ in Detroit last week.\n\nNick Fuentes, an antisemitic influencer, was turned away from the conference, dubbing it âIsrael-occupied territory.â Kirk had already been confronted by young anti-Israel activists on the right for years, and surmised that they were getting no traction in his party.\n\nâThe only objections you might hear on the right is about the amount of money being spent, or whether there should be strings attached,â Kirk said. âYou do not hear anywhere in the conservative base that we should not support Israel in their war against Hamas. We will disagree on how that support should look, but not on who is in the right.â\n\nRepublican presidents were tougher on Israel in the past; even George W. Bushâs administration clashed with its leaders at times over its push for a two-state solution. But since 9/11 and the Second Intifada, the conservative consensus has consistently moved in one direction â toward strong, full-throated support for Israel as its standard position.\n\nOne Israel critic who did make it into the conference, wearing a T-shirt that read âfrom the river to the sea, Palestine shall be free,â kept stopping to have conversations with conservative activists about how this was the true America First position. Every time I saw him, he was outnumbered, firmly being told that Palestinians had no right to the land God granted to the Jews.\n\nCommentators on the right with more critical views, like Massieâs, have found little pick-up in the broader movement. The post-Fox Tucker Carlson has accused some Israel-focused conservatives of being âfocused on a conflict in a foreign country as their own country becomes dangerously unstable.â That has not become the popular view on the right.\n\nâIsrael is like abortion for the left: A unifying issue that has major fundraising potential for the right while also simultaneously splitting opponents,â said Saagar Enjeti, the right-leaning co-host of the Breaking Points podcast, who got blowback for the comments Carlson made in their interview. âEven those who may not agree with Israel 100% stay silent because watching opponents tear each other apart is more politically advantageous.â\n\nDonald Trump, who has immense power to shape the Republican conversation, has largely stayed out of this one. He criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for being taken by surprise on Oct. 7, but never detailed what heâd do now. On an episode of the All-In podcast this week, when asked about âthe right pathâ to end the war, Trump said âit would have never happenedâ on his watch, insisting that his pressure on Iran would have starved Hamas of resources.\n\nIn this article:\n\nOn paper, thereâs room for Israel critics to make inroads with the Republican Party. Twenty years ago, âneoconâ was a slur used by liberals with dark connotations that Republicans defended their party against; in the Trump GOP, itâs a name for the war hawks who MAGA kicked out of the party. Some of Trumpâs more populist supporters like to argue that heâll keep the US at arms length from foreign conflicts.\n\nThe party also includes plenty of rank-and-file voters who want to stop funding Israelâs war â one in three Republicans, according to a Fox News poll this week. Itâs a fair subject for the newer media (podcasts, Twitter, TikTok) that are popular with the younger, skeptical, anti-politics members of the Trump coalition who are more receptive to anti-war pitches that sometimes overlap with the anti-Biden left.\n\nBut the movement has gotten no serious traction inside the GOP. One reason: Good, old-fashioned negative polarization. The Israel question divides Democrats, not Republicans, and the sort of pro-Israel resolutions regularly passed by the GOP House â like defining âantisemitismâ as anti-Zionism â have become renewable sources of left/liberal infighting.\n\nThere hasnât been perfect unity: Some Republicans opposed a bill to expand the definition of antisemitism on campus, arguing it was too broadly worded; some conservatives also waged an unsuccessful fight to offset Israel aid with domestic cuts elsewhere. But none of these debates have really cut to the question of whether Israelâs war is just, whether the US should play hardball to end it, or the status of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. When Netanyahu comes to Washington next month, heâs expected to receive an extremely warm welcome from Republican members âÂ and protests and snubs from many Democrats.\n\nThe anti-war movement is overwhelmingly organized by left-wing activists that Republicans already dislike, especially on campus. Trumpâs spoken in far more detail about the protests (âraging lunatics and Hamas sympathizersâ) than he has about an end to the war; Kirk said that the situation on campus was âa volcano waiting to erupt,â exposing all of the beliefs about âsettler colonialismâ that he already knew about, and voters would be repulsed by.\n\nâIsrael is our ally, she needs to be defended,â Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford told activists at the Faith & Freedom Coalitionâs annual conference in D.C., on Friday. It needed to be defended, in particular, from âactivists [who] scream âfrom the river to the seaâ and call for the annihilation of the Jewish people.â\n\nThat disgust has strengthened the already-robust Republican support for Israel, which has long united both religious conservatives and national security hawks. The anti-Jewish activists who tried to talk their way into Kirkâs convention were immediately booted; no one inside the event could hear Fuentes as he accused Miriam Adelson , a major Trump donor, of buying off the GOP and making it put Israel first.\n\nCandace Owens and Alex Jones, who have both criticized Israel on their usual media platforms, said nothing about it at the conference. In March, Owens left a prominent perch at The Daily Wire amid an ugly public fight with co-founder Ben Shapiro over Israel. Shapiro had earlier called Owenâs commentary, which had veered into remarks that were widely condemned as antisemitic while discussing Israel, âdisgraceful.â\n\nThe Owens affair points to a related issue: To the extent thereâs been a debate over Israel within the right, it overlaps significantly with a separate internal fight over whether to purge fringe activists who have expressed antisemitic or white nationalist views. A study of voter opinion by political scientist Michael Tesler found opposition to Israel aid within the GOP was heavily concentrated among voters who also view Jewish people unfavorably. This isnât to say opposition to Israel policy on the right is inherently antisemitic or confined to antisemites, but people who buck the overwhelming default position among conservative activists tend to have a strong reason for disagreeing.\n\nâA few years ago, any candidate â Republican or Democrat â could get on stage and say, âI stand with Israelâ, and it was an automatic applause line,â said Sam Markstein, Republican Jewish Coalition national political director. âThese days, if you did that as a Democrat, youâd be booed.â Markstein predicted that his party wouldnât budge: âRepublicans know Israel must be given the time, space, and support it needs to win this war of good versus evil â Democrats, unfortunately, have totally lost the plot.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "Democrats never expected this Senate primary to have such high stakes\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nSILVER SPRING, Md. â On Wednesday afternoon, nine Latino Democrats gathered outside the Veterans Plaza polling place here to explain how a 68-year-old white congressman had won their vote.\n\nThey trusted Rep. David Trone, the wealthy founder of Total Wine; they didnât trust Angela Alsobrooks, the Prince Georgeâs County executive. She took Latinos âfor granted,â protected âracist police,â and didnât work quickly to end âracistâ immigration enforcement policies. Alsobrooks, who if elected would be Marylandâs first Black female senator, didnât celebrate diversity like Trone did.\n\nâItâs important to him,â said Celina Benitez, the mayor of Mount Rainier. âWhy else would you have so many elected officials, of varied diversity, here supporting him?â\n\nTwo hours later, four former state Democratic Party chairs came to the same plaza, warning that Trone had gone too negative and that non-white Democrats might struggle to support him.\n\nâItâs really difficult,â said former chair Susie Turnbull, referring to an incident when Trone meant to use the word âbugabooâ but said a racial slur instead , apologizing immediately. âHis excuses for things have been apologies with a âbut.â Using a term that is horrendous, and then you say âIâd never used that word before?â Heâs my age. I know heâs heard that word before.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nMarylandâs Democratic primary is the most expensive in the country, thanks almost entirely to Trone; heâs sunk $61.8 million into this race, after spending tens of millions of dollars on four House campaigns, blanketing airwaves and YouTube with his Horatio Alger story. Alsobrooks, who went on the air in February, has spent a tenth as much.\n\nAt a Tuesday night rally at Silver Springâs AFI movie theater, where California Rep. Adam Schiff praised Troneâs âunderstanding of our economyâ and ability to âdefend our democracy,â Troneâs ads played on the big screen while a few dozen voters took their seats â so many that over 15 minutes of âI approved this messageâ-ing, no ad was played twice.\n\nYet the race remains close. Its final weeks have become an increasingly personal, tense contest between candidates battling over intertwined issues around race and who is best positioned to defend what until recently had been considered a safe seat.\n\nRepublicans havenât won here since 1980, and the Donald Trump-led GOP is practically designed to lose in Maryland: Montgomery and Prince Georgeâs counties, D.C. suburbs that cast nearly a million votes in 2020, gave less than 150,000 of them to Trump.\n\nBut the surprise decision by popular former Gov. Larry Hogan, a moderate anti-Trump Republican, has turned the general into a tossup. For the Democrats, thatâs exponentially increased the stakes of their primary.\n\nâHoganâs entrance ended our complacency about the fall election,â said Rep. Jamie Raskin, who has endorsed Alsobrooks, and beat Trone in 2016 to win his safe Montgomery County seat. (Trone got to Congress by spending $18 million in the neighboring, competitive 8th District.)\n\nSince Hoganâs entrance in February, Trone has made his personal fortune a centerpiece of his pitch: If he wins the nomination, Democrats wonât have to spend cash in Maryland that theyâd earmarked for Ohio, Montana, or other competitive states.\n\nâIt will give them a lot more flexibility to spend money elsewhere,â Trone told Semafor on Tuesday. âIâm sure that will appeal to Leader Schumer.â\n\nThe deep-pockets argument, along with Troneâs years of party donations and go-everywhere campaigning, helped him win over many Democrats who repeat his argument: He has more relevant experience than Alsobrooks, and he can win. But most of the stateâs congressional delegation has stuck with Alsobrooks, confident that Hoganâs support will fade by November and wary of once again telling Black voters â who make up a third of the stateâs electorate â that itâs not their turn yet.\n\nMaryland Democrats previously rejected Black candidates when Senate seats opened up 2006 and 2016 â agonizing about it the whole time, then winning the general anyway. Neither of those races divided elected Democrats like this; Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, the winners in those years, had most of the establishment behind them. But Gov. Wes Moore, the first Black Marylander to hold that office, endorsed Alsobrooks six months ago; Adrienne Jones, the first Black female state House Speaker, beat him to it.\n\nMoore told Semafor that the electability concerns about Alsobrooks, who has out-raised Hogan, were misplaced: âRegardless of what happens in a primary, every single one of us are going to be all in to make sure that our nomineeâ wins the race.\n\nAlsobrooks goes further, suggesting she may be better positioned to unite the partyâs diverse wings come the general.\n\nâWhatâs going to be needed is a coalition of people from all backgrounds who will come together to defeat Larry Hogan,â Alsobrooks told Semafor after stopping to talk to voters at an early voting site in Bowie. âIâm the person who has the experience of doing that.â The evidence that Troneâs wealth wasnât insurance against a Hogan win, she said, was that Trone had outspent her all year, and sheâd closed the gap.\n\nTrone, for his part, has consistently highlighted support from non-white and female Democrats in his omnipresent TV spots; Black men whoâd benefited from his investments in criminal justice reform, women of all races who were helped by his support for family planning. He could even get to the county executiveâs left on some issues. Trone had always opposed the death penalty; Alsobrooks would only say, passively, that Maryland had banned it.\n\nThe candidates didnât disagree on much else, so Alsobrooksâs supporters homed in on how Trone â and his surrogates âÂ talked. In March, after Prince Georgeâs County Council Member Ed Burroughs said in one Trone ad that the Senate was not a job for people with âtraining wheels,â more than 600 Black women co-signed a letter that denounced its âtones of misogyny and racism.â\n\nThat comment was struck from the ad, but the attention hurt Trone. In Silver Spring, pressed on the âtraining wheelsâ quote, Trone noted that he didnât say it in the ad; when a reporter pointed out that Trone had used the same phrase, the candidate said that âwe stand by the fact that Burroughs made the comment, and, frankly, she doesnât have the experience at the federal level.â What mattered, he explained, was what he was going to do with the Senate seat.\n\nâI have supported wonderful women and diverse candidates all over this country, and will continue to do so,â Trone said. âBut what the voters keep saying, time and time again, is look at what I can do for you.â\n\nBut as early voting wrapped up, Troneâs non-white surrogates kept saying what heâd been told not to say: Alsobrooks wasnât ready for the job, or sensitive enough to other non-white Democrats. âWe need someone who can be effective from day one,â Prince Georgeâs County Stateâs Attorney Aisha Braveboy said on Thursday, when pro-Trone Democrats gathered at a union hall to support him to argue that voters needed to look past the candidatesâ race.\n\nâI wouldnât vote for Candace Owens, no matter what she was running for,â said Krystal Oriadha, another county council member whoâd rejected Alsobrooks. âThe idea that we just have to vote for someone because of their gender, because of their color, negating any other issues, is insulting to us as a community.â (Owens is a high-profile Black conservative pundit.)\n\nOn the stump, Alsobrooks didnât lead with her race or gender â and didnât really need to. âShe would certainly make history, but more importantly, she will make a difference,â Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock told reporters after a meeting with the candidate and Black pastors, redirecting a question about race to talk about the investments made by the Democratic Senate.\n\nâMy basic thought is positive politics, high road politics is what wins in Maryland,â Raskin said, asked about the challenges of facing the self-funding Trone. âIâve told that to all the candidates. I think that that is the way to go.â\n\nPat Moran, a Democrat who voted for Alsobrooks this week, said she was drawn to the candidate because of her experience fighting crime in the county. âYou know what the crime is like; itâs off the chain,â she said. But the candidateâs identity mattered, too. âWe need an African American in the Senate. We do need a balance of power in the Senate.â\n\nNagender Madavaram, an engineer who was supporting Trone, said that he made his mind up after watching the Democrat bring money back to Maryland and make his own charitable donations to good causes. âHeâs allocated $300,000 to protect the rights of Muslims,â Madavaram said, âeven though he married a Jewish lady. Heâs a great guy. He never hesitated.â\n\nâThe Trone-Alsobrooks primary has quickly become the nastiest in the country,â said NRSC Spokesman Tate Mitchell. âMeanwhile, Governor Hogan has been traveling Maryland with a positive vision for bringing change to Washington. Larry Hogan remains overwhelmingly popular in the state, and itâs clear Marylanders are eager to see him represent them in the Senate.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "âThis kind of crap canât be tolerated.â Or can it? Harris navigates talk of race and sex as campaign begins.\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nRep. Tim Burchett, a conservative Republican from Tennessee, labeled Vice President Kamala Harris a â DEI hire. â Wisconsin Rep. Glenn Grothman told reporters Democrats âhave to stick with her because of her ethnic background.â And Donald Trump gestured to the often crude conservative discussions of her relationship with former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown three decades earlier.\n\nâThese are attacks that none of us are surprised by,â Senator Laphonza Butler, a California Democrat and close Harris ally who is the only Black woman in the upper chamber, told Semafor. âWe have to have her back at every turn because this kind of crap canât be tolerated.â\n\nBlack Democrats say they are watching the conversation on the right around Harris and preparing to defend her from criticism that they say unfairly diminishes her achievements based on race and gender. Butler said sheâd call out political arguments that were âtrying to convince the American people that the place for women is in the kitchen or in the bedroom.â\n\nBut the party is also torn over how to respond, with some worrying about being baited into a debate over racism and sexism that could consume the campaign just as theyâre re-introducing Harris to the broader electorate.\n\nâWhile we need to call out that racism and sexism, we cannot let it distract from talking to voters about whatâs at stake in this election, including how their policies harm Black people and women,â Rep. Jennifer McClellan of Virginia told Semafor.\n\nâI think as Democrats we must keep our eyes on the prize â that is defeating convicted felon Donald Trump,â Rep. Nikema Williams of Georgia said.\n\nNew Jersey Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman suggested that Democrats like herself could take the lead in defending Harris, freeing the candidate up to focus on her national message.\n\nâShe doesnât have to speak to that issue,â she said.\n\nOne Democratic pollster said they did not expect âDEIâ attacks to resonate outside circles already committed to voting against Harris and that Democrats should be âfocusing on the positivesâ in her biography to build up her image. Another Democrat predicted Republicans would inevitably hurt themselves by walking into a conversation about race and gender that would distract from the GOPâs own economic message.\n\nRep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, currently running for Senate in Delaware, offered up one potential model to respond: Defend Harris and then pivot to bread-and-butter issues.\n\nâRepublicans are attacking the Vice President because they are scared of her ability to prosecute the case against Donald Trump for the American people,â she told Semafor. âKamala Harris is qualified, experienced, and effective â thatâs why President Biden picked her as Vice President because together, they have accomplished so much, from lowering the price of prescription drugs, pushing for an economy that works for everyone, and fixing our roads and bridges.â\n\nHarris isnât the first candidate to confront these issues and her reaction will shape the partyâs response the most. Barack Obama, on the campaign trail, largely ignored attacks his campaign believed were racist. Hillary Clinton sought to redirect the conversation to challenges faced by ordinary women.\n\nBoth faced similar tactical questions to Harris: Is there more electoral advantage in rallying Democrats âÂ or swing voters âÂ to her side as the victim of out-of-bounds attacks? Or does she believe that her path lies in strictly talking about abortion, taxes, and other agenda items that Democrats are desperate to push back to the top of the publicâs priorities?\n\nIn this article:\n\nDemocrats arenât the only ones who are warily gaming out the new political calculus around Harris.\n\nWhile conservatives protest that itâs unfair to label discussion of Harrisâ qualifications as out of bounds when Biden emphasized gender and race in making his decision, Republican campaign officials so far seem to view discussing Harrisâ record in demographic terms as a political dead end.\n\nâItâs certainly not something Iâm going to say,â National Republican Congressional Committee chair Richard Hudson told Punchbowl News when asked about the âDEIâ conversation. âIâm going to remain focused on the policies.â\n\nEarly opposition research and strategy papers from the Trump campaign and other Republican groups have all emphasized more conventional attacks on Harris: Tying her to Bidenâs record on immigration and inflation, accusing her of covering up his aging, and portraying her as closer to the left on issues like crime and the environment than the candidate she replaced. One memo by the National Republican Senatorial Committee suggested labeling her âweirdâ â Trump calls her âLaffinâ Kamala,â a reference to her signature chuckle âÂ but focused on her âextreme agenda.â\n\nRepublicans this cycle have eagerly sought to capitalize on polling gains with Americans who have previously been cool to Trump, especially nonwhite voters. The Republican National Convention was retooled to emphasize âunityâ after the Butler shooting and present Trump as an elder statesman rather than a culture warrior. The programming included a speech from hip hop influencer Amber Rose rebutting accusations of racism against Trump, along with a number of speakers who emphasized their immigrant backgrounds and assured voters that Republicans are only concerned about border security.\n\nBut campaign officials can only exert so much control over a broader conversation that will be driven as much by Elon Musk and Candace Owens as any professional operative. And the person who will ultimately set the tone for the party the most is Trump himself.\n\nAlready there are some signs the former president has personally changed his thinking from the 2020 race, which featured Harris as Bidenâs running mate. He did not bring up the Willie Brown story at that time; this month he said on Truth Social that people should ask Brown why Harris is regarded as a âhighly talentedâ politician, in quotes. In conservative circles, thereâs an overtly sexualized version of this discussion: Commentators like Megyn Kelly accused her of sleeping with Brown to advance her professional prospects. (Brown wrote in 2019 that heâd helped many Democrats with their careers: âThe difference is that Harris is the only one who, after I helped her, sent word that I would be indicted if I âso much as jaywalkedâ while she was D.A.â)\n\nOne attack that Trump did briefly touch on with Harris in 2020, however: Falsely questioning her eligibility for the presidency , an echo of the âbirtherâ case he made against Barack Obama, as well as related attacks against Republicans Nikki Haley and Ted Cruz.\n\nWhile Trump has not referenced the topic again, some of his close allies have already picked it back up: Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, shared an old op-ed this week by former Trump attorney John Eastman questioning whether Harris, who was born in the US, should be legally barred from the White House because her parents were immigrants.\n\nMarc Short, a longtime advisor to Mike Pence, said that Trumpâs former running mate was not given instructions to avoid âoff limitsâ attacks on Harris in 2020 while preparing for their debate that cycle, noting that itâs just ânot Mikeâs styleâ to engage in that way. But the circumstances have also changed: The goal for both Trump and Pence was to focus attacks on Biden and defend the incumbentâs record.\n\nâIt feels like if youâre attacking number two, then youâre taking your eye off number one,â he said. âSo, I do think itâs a little bit different.â\n\nThe political conversation on the right has also changed since 2020. The party has embraced a broader âanti-wokeâ backlash and conservatives have become far more confident accusing all kinds of institutions, from political parties to TV studios, of unfairly promoting women and minorities.\n\nThese claims have at times become an annoyance for Republican campaign officials. Over the weekend, top Trump campaign aide Chris LaCivita strongly rebutted a widespread meme on the right alleging that the Butler shooting was exacerbated by the US Secret Service assigning women to guard the president.\n\nAt the same time, Trumpâs running mate JD Vance has often attacked race-based requirements and claims of white âprivilegeâ as unfair.

First pancake, Ben. How do you feel?\n\nBen Smith: First pancake? I donât know what that means.\n\nNayeema: Itâs like when you make pancakes, your first pancake is always the not good one.\n\nBen: No, but this is going to be really good. This is going to be really good.\n\nNayeema: Okay. Set our expectations low.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nBen: Iâm Ben Smith.\n\nNayeema: Iâm Nayeema Raza.\n\nBen: And this is Mixed Signals from Semafor Media.\n\nNayeema: Today weâre going to visit the media circus surrounding the weekâs biggest story, the hush money case against former President Donald Trump. And really the question here is: is there anything new to learn? Which is something we pose to Trump biographer and senior political correspondent for the New York Times, Maggie Haberman.\n\nWeâre also going to be discussing the latest battle in the work wars: Vivek Ramaswamy will actually be joining us today to talk about his activist bid to remake the Iconic and fading millennial brand BuzzFeed, which is actually your former employer.\n\nBen: Yeah, and I, I mean, I think I was sort of trying to approach it as a job interview, but\n\nNayeema: Oh!\n\nBen: Iâm, Iâm not sure how thatâs gonna work out...\n\nNayeema: already on your way out on our first episode, Ben. Thatâs how we like it.\n\nBen: Itâs been, itâs been a rough morning.\n\nNayeema: Um, and finally weâll have Max Tani here joining us to talk about blind spots. These are the stories youâre not seeing inside your media bubbles.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nNayeema: But first Ben, we should probably explain what Mixed Signals is because, you know, the artwork, it looks like a dating podcast, it sounds like a dating podcast, it is not a dating podcast because otherwise I would be hosting with like Trevor Noah, I think.\n\nBen: Among so many other reasons, but yes, thatâs right, Nayeema. No, I mean, Mixed Signals is our attempt to navigate this very strange media environment we all live in right now in which we have an enormous amount of information and claims coming in. But, but itâs very hard to tell, even for those of us who, who inhabit this world, very hard to tell who to trust.\n\nAnd, and I think this kind of pervasive sense that youâre often being manipulated and you donât understand how decisions are getting made.\n\nNayeema: And this isnât. necessarily a new phenomenon, but it feels bigger because of the fragmentation of media, the hyper-partisan nature of media, the kind of social engineering of media as it exists today.\n\nBen: I think itâs worse than itâs ever been. Itâs more confusing. As somebody who writes about media and has done it for a while, it is more confusing than itâs ever been.\n\nNayeema: Yeah. And our job here isnât going to be, weâre not providing media criticism. Weâre not here to tell you about the trades, about whoâs getting fired, whoâs getting hired.\n\nWeâre really here to talk about media as a window into politics, culture, technology, because media intersects with. with all of that. And it kind of gets lost. I mean, many of the biggest political stories of our times are media stories, including one that weâll be discussing today, if not two, actually, that weâll be discussing today.\n\nBen: I think Vivekâs story is interesting. Heâs a guy who, through exposure to politics, got obsessed with the media business because in some sense, contemporary politics, like a lot of businesses, are themselves the media business.\n\nNayeema: Yeah. I think what weâre going to hopefully do in the process here is really shed some light into why youâre seeing the things youâre seeing reported the way they are.\n\nBecause people have this. What you describe as a conspiracy theory when we first started talking about it.\n\nBen: Yeah, I think, you know, I mean, you and I met working at the New York Times, which people think about, write about, speculate about constantly. And there is, I think, a broad sense that media is some kind of conspiracy, that there are decisions being made that you donât quite understand that have consequences for our real lives.\n\nAnd, you know, and the reality is, you know, in some ways, media is a conspiracy. Itâs, you know, mostly, unfortunately, a conspiracy to make money.\n\nNayeema: In that case, itâs really failing that I have to say thatâs probably the least successful conspiracy...\n\nBen: Not the worldâs most successful conspiracy, but you really can, you know,, as... if you know your way around this world, you can go and ask the right questions and figure out what is actually happening, not what the speculation is.\n\nNayeema: I mean, your latest Semafor Media newsletter was actually a really good example of this, because there had been a lot of speculation in the story of the flags outside Justice Alitoâs house.\n\nThere was some speculation that, oh, you know, The Washington Post had this story years ago and didnât run it.\n\nBen: Yeah, there were rumors flying everywhere about why hadnât the Washington Post run it. Specific rumors that, um, that the Justice Alito had called somebody very senior at the Post and pressured them.\n\nAnd the answer, which in some ways was unsatisfying but so telling, was that actually Marty Baron, the editor in chief never heard about the story. The reporter who got it, who was kind of an old school cover of the Supreme Court in an old fashioned kind of institutionalist way, not getting into the neighborhood disputes of the justices, didnât really like the story, didnât really see it as a story, wasnât sure what was going on.\n\nSo the result was that this story was just obviously a story. Itâs a flag flying upside down outside your house. Thereâs no more public statement that you can make than the flag you fly at your home.\n\nNayeema: So sometimes itâs not a conspiracy, itâs just an error, or silos, or operational inefficiencies, which is less sexy than the conspiracy...\n\nBen: Yeah, yeah, or a kind of ideology and way of looking at the world.\n\nNayeema: Weâre kind of like in the world like Mulder and Scully, if you ever watched The X Files. Weâre here...\n\nBen: Obsessively.\n\nNayeema: The truth is out there. Weâre here to find it. So here we are, our first big story from Mixed Signals, and just two blocks from where weâre sitting at Semaforâs New York offices, the former president of the United States has just been convicted of, uh, on a set of charges that really at their heart are about media conspiracy.\n\nThis is specifically Trumpâs efforts to promote his own election by deploying the National Enquirer to catch and kill stories and then make payments that were concealed.\n\nBen: And this trial has been a genuine old fashioned media circus. We were, we went out there a couple of times this week. There were, I think we counted 16 live trucks, dozens and dozens and dozens of cameras, foreign press, domestic press, some kid who claimed he was reporting for Wikipedia and asked us some odd questions. I mean, yeah, please email us. Iâm sure he was actually writing for Wikipedia.\n\nNayeema: Donât forget the protesters. There were protesters who were largely silent and waiting until a camera kind of approached them and then they would point at you and say, fake news.\n\nBen: I mean, it was a real media scene. Thereâs no parking for my Kia Niro. I mean, it was, you know, there was, there was just a lot of\n\nNayeema: Log all your grievances here, Ben.\n\nBen: And. And yet there was this question hovering over the journalists outside and doing the standups inside, tweeting and blogging and writing, which was, you know, this is the trial of the century.\n\nAnd yet there was this, it felt, I think, to all of us that everything being kind of beamed out of that courthouse wasnât really connecting. And I think that is now with this explosion of interest in the guilty verdict. Thereâs just going to be this question of, you know, Did we learn anything? What did, what did it mean?\n\nNayeema: But in many ways, thatâs so unsurprising, right, Ben? Because this has been the mood of this entire election and this whole rerun of election in TV terms, right? The trial was not televised. Voters are disengaged. Weâre seeing polls that two thirds of Americans feel that democracy is at risk in this election and only one third of Americans are tuning in very closely to the political news.\n\nBen: Thatâs incredible contrast.\n\nNayeema: Yeah, and there will be so many polls trying to unpack what this verdict means, right? Thereâll be this huge media circus, just like there was outside the courts, around the verdict itself. Thereâll be reporting around the jurors, etc. The polls that weâve already seen about the verdict are mixed, theyâre ambiguous, and we thought maybe the leading indicator of what there is to learn from this trial is the person who knows the most already.\n\nOur former colleague, Maggie Haberman, this is a New York Times senior political correspondent. She is the Trump biographer, and we went out to speak to her on Thursday, just hours before the verdict landed. Hereâs the tape.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nBen: I think itâs a very unusual situation from going and writing a 600 page book about Donald Trump to heading into a courtroom to cover him. Moment to moment. I think the thing thatâs like driving everybody crazy is itâs so hard to move the needle like everybody thinks they just know everything about him that this is the trial of the century and yet isnât rating that well.\n\nPeople arenât really clicking on it. And I think itâs because we all feel like: âyou know what, I get it. I get who he is.â And you, I think, probably more than anybody get who he is. And Iâm curious if youâre learning anything? Do you come into that courtroom and think âIâm learning something,â or are you just like...\n\nMaggie Haberman: No, Iâm reliving something. I mean, this is like, no, in all seriousness, because this is essentially reliving 2016 and actually like the, the sort of worst part of 2016, which was the Access Hollywood tape and the, the aftermath from it. And, and I covered Michael Cohenâs FBI search of his house and his hotel room and his office pretty aggressively.\n\nThere is almost nothing, there are a couple of details that Iâve learned where Iâve said, I donât even know where they are, cause, Theyâre not that striking, but there have been a couple where I remember being like, Oh, thatâs interesting, but nothing. Thereâs no new narrative arc here.\n\nBen: So how do we persuade people to pay attention if, in this, when everybody feels like they know everything and maybe they do, they read your book, they watched 10,000 hours of cable news.\n\nDoes that make it at all, like. I feel futile and frustrating to wake up at six in the morning and go stand online?\n\nMaggie: No, Iâm pretty sure people are reading my coverage. I feel okay.\n\nNayeema: David Pecker has now testified that, in fact, the National Enquirer was involved in this catch and kill campaign with a presidential candidate.\n\nIt strikes me that for Trumpâs followers, thereâs such a distrust of media in general. So, the conspiracy at the center of the case. those facts having been established now in a courtroom. Has that made a dent at all with his crowd?\n\nMaggie: Well, I think it would require someone like Ted Cruz, who actually really was impacted by what the National Enquirer was doing and the lies that was spreading in 2016.\n\nRemember, one of the things that Pecker testified about is the fact that he was running stories with like a mashed up photo. Manufacturing the idea that Ted Cruzâs dad had somehow been tied to the Kennedy assassination, which for those of us who covered that primary was deeply painful for Ted Cruz, whoâs very close to his father.\n\nTed Cruz has made clear heâs still pretty upset about that because he did an interview on CNN recently, but heâs also controlled in his anger and heâs not really waving it at Donald Trump. And so I think it just would require more people pushing publicly. And one of the things that Trumpâs lawyer, Todd Blanche, has tried to do is sort of imply but not really say that.\n\nEveryoneâs the same, the National Enquirer standard operating procedure, you know, people talk for stories, people deal with the media, Michael Cohen dealt with the media, yeah, no, this was not the same, and maybe in Todd Blancheâs understanding thatâs the same, but itâs not how any normal press function works.\n\nNayeema: Yeah, he also said every campaign is a conspiracy to win an election.\n\nMaggie: Well, itâs certainly true that every campaign tries to win an election, but boy, this is the first time in twenty-six twent-eight years of watching and covering this stuff that Iâve heard an election described as a conspiracy.\n\nNayeema: First time Iâve heard an election described as a conspiracy in the United States, too.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nBen: You know, I do not envy her that beat. I mean, I think, you know, she came up covering courts and has a lot of patience, but I mean, the sort of frustration of sitting in there, as she said, reliving stuff that we all knew and saw, and then trying to explain to people why they need to pay attention to something, why theyâre going to learn something from this.\n\nI do think sheâs right that actually, The process story, the story of the trial, the things the lawyers say does sometimes shed light on how folks think about themselves and honestly, how they think about us, the media. It is in the end. In the end, it is, you know, itâs about us.\n\nNayeema: I donât know if itâs about us, but the media is on trial too, in some ways in this case, by both sides, right? And so. In some way.\n\nBen: I just, I just want to say not guilty.\n\nNayeema: Good. I plead the fifth.\n\nBen: Yeah. The other thing that did strike me is when I said, uh, you know, is it futile? There is something that you and I probably remember from the New York Times that even the stories that are hardest to get anybody to pay attention to, if theyâre in the New York Times, you know, they will be injected directly into the veins of, of a, of a whole set of Americans.\n\nUm, no, thatâs not really true. Your worst stories donât go anywhere, but people always read Maggie.\n\nNayeema: Some optimism for journalism that stories are making a dent and more optimism for journalism after this break because weâre going to be talking to Vivek Ramaswamy, the former Republican presidential candidate, whoâs here to talk to us about why he bought more than 8 percent of BuzzFeed.\n\nThatâs after the break.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nNayeema: Okay, our next story. Vivek Ramaswamy has acquired an 8. 37 percent stake in BuzzFeed. Vivek is kind of an interesting character. He came up as an entrepreneur, has built several companies, ran for office in, uh, for the 2024 presidential elections, obviously did not make out well there, dropped out of the race and is now coming back as a activist media investor.\n\nAnd youâre a character in this story, actually, so we should discuss you too, Ben. You were the founding editor in chief of BuzzFeed News, which has been shuttered. Right.\n\nBen: Yeah. And, you know, I think Vivek, like a lot of political candidates, he was, you know, a failed politician, but actually a very successful media figure and was great at figuring out how to take, you know, his kind of standing as a basically anonymous rich guy and turn himself into a real national figure with a pretty decent shot of being in the Trump cabinet.\n\nBut along the way, I think he really got the bug and acquired kind of interest in media, how it works. Um, and now has acquired a share of my old company, which\n\nNayeema: I wonder, yeah. I think he actually acquired the bug before the campaign because I happen to know that he was courted, uh, by Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and others to, to kind of take on some media internet entrepreneur.\n\nIs that a scoop? We should test it with him in the interview. But he did take that meeting and that would have been end of 2020 and we should ask him about that in the interview.\n\nBen: I think thereâs a question of, you know, is this basically kind of an anti-woke publicity stunt from the author of Woke, Inc.?\n\nIs it a serious business proposal? You know, is it a stunt thatâs going to wind up with him owning BuzzFeed by accident? There are a lot of possible outcomes here.\n\nNayeema: And BuzzFeed now is a very different organization than when you were there, right? BuzzFeed. IPOâd in was it 2021, at a valuation of something like 1.5 billion dollars. That stock is down 90 percent now. They still have some interesting assets. They have, they donât have BuzzFeed News, which has been shuttered, but there is Huffington Post, HuffPo. There is Hot Ones, which was acquired in a deal to do Complex, the spicy interview show. And so there are some real assets here.\n\nAnd Vivek has outlined this plan. He has shared the seven-page letter that went first to Fox Business. And... the plan is really three prong. It says one, you got to right size this company, got to downsize get it back to kind of startup numbers in terms of employees, etc. Two, you got to pivot to audio and video. And three, heâs called for a diversity of thought, embracing creators from Candace Owen to Destiny, Tucker Carlson to Bill Maher. Aaron Rodgers to Charles Barkley and also diversifying\n\nBen: Far-right to center-left, according to that list. Although we can ask him about,\n\nNayeema: yeah, we should ask him about that diversity, but also diversify their newsroom.\n\nRight. And, and, and heâs, heâs called for, you know, BuzzFeed to apologize for what Ramaswamy characterizes past reporting errors that I think you might take a little personal.\n\nBen: Yeah, this, this part of the letter kind of bugged me. He just picked some things, some articles that have been criticized kind of amusingly more from the left than from the right.\n\nI donât think he was reading very closely just to take shots at, to make the case that, you know, you got to do journalism that nobody criticizes, I guess. I donât really, I donât really follow that.\n\nNayeema: Well, I think it was like the whole idea is kind of take this Trojan horse of the, of BuzzFeed brand, which is, has a huge brand name, but no one knows...\n\nBen: Without a very sharp identity.\n\nNayeema: Yeah, without a sharp identity or even a sharp offering right now, by the way. What is a BuzzFeed offering? Whatâs the last BuzzFeed thing I saw? I couldnât tell you. And use it to morph into what some would, you know, worry is going to be a very unique media organization, shaped in some part by somebody who has very particular political views, Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nBen: Yeah, and I think we should try to pin him down on what heâs talking about.\n\nNayeema: Letâs do that.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nNayeema: Explain what youâre trying to do with BuzzFeed. Is this a play to, to kind of achieve what Elon did with Twitter, but with lower stakes and a lower price tag?\n\nVivek Ramaswamy: Well, look, I laid it out pretty clearly in the letter I sent to the board. I enjoy creating value. That is something that Iâve done in my career as an entrepreneur.\n\nIâve always had an instinct as a value investor as well. And I see a lot of value destroyed by the way this business has been run. Iâm not in the phase of casting blame or pointing fingers at one individual versus another. But the fact is, this was a potentially very valuable business at the time it went public.\n\nCertainly a lot of people with a lot of money backed it on that premise. And it has cratered on the back of a lot of business failures that I believe are still correctable.\n\nBen: Well, as somebody who cares a lot about BuzzFeed, all that abstract stuff sounds great. But a lot of people do think that this, this venture is a bit like your campaign and that itâs a lot of money, a lot of attention, but ultimately thereâs no way for you to get the votes. Itâs Jonah Peretti votes 64 percent of the stock. Howâs that going to work?\n\nVivek: You know, I think that this is, thereâs, thereâs so many, um, you could say circular references that Iâve had, even in the 48 hours since my stake was initially reported and since my letter went into the board, the mediaâs reporting of it, that actually almost proved my thesis for how broken and in some cases idiotic, like downright low IQ the media really is in situations like this.\n\nBen: Wow, thank you.\n\nVivek: Well, I, I, you know, you can get it out in the paper.\n\nBen: I think that was a pretty straightforward question, Vivek. This is a, this is a company with two classes of stock.\n\nVivek: Iâll give you a straightforward answer, right? And, and I think that this is, what I, what I mean by this is, I was a preamble to an obvious point that Iâm just disappointed that people in the media canât take notice of because thereâs a gap in a business understanding.\n\nSo ordinarily, if you have super voting shares, yes, absolutely. Youâre the person who decides the governance of the company. Thereâs a curious fact about this company that the entire reporting of that line of thinking completely missed, which is, I would add to a list of journalistic failures that grows every day.\n\nThis is a company that has more debt than cash. That debt comes due this December. So anybody who thinks that Jonah Peretti is the person in control of this business because some piece of paper says he has voting rights over the shares is delusional. To borrow a word from the subtitle of your own book describing the same industry, Ben, is delusion.\n\nI laid out my current views in the letter, and hopefully you can share that with your audiences because I do think, you know itâs, you know, itâs like six pages or so, but itâs not exactly the way that CNN characterized the letter. Itâs, thatâs a funny point we can come back to.\n\nNayeema: I think itâs seven pages, but, and we did read the letter.\n\nVivek: Seven pages, good. Good. I like the fact check. Thatâs great.\n\nNayeema: We did read the letter, and you kind of outline a three-pronged strategy. So you want to cut costs, you want to pivot to audio and video, and you want to bring a diversity of thought into the, uh, the BuzzFeed equation. You mentioned publishers, content creators like Tucker Carlson, Candace Owen, you know... perhaps Aaron Rodgers. But I want to ask you Vivek because thereâs this wave of conservative media...\n\nVivek: Can I just pause right there? Because that was what you just described was exactly consistent with the rest of the mediaâs reporting on this, which the headline said to bring Candace Owens and Tucker Carlson. And you said you quoted my letter. Iâm going to ask you to quote it correctly. I did not say Candace Owens, Tucker Carlson, Aaron Rodgers.\n\nI said, what you need is to have the courage to engage with the full cultural and political spectrum, from Candace Owens to Destiny, from Tucker Carlson to Bill Maher, from Aaron Rodgers to Charles Barkley. And so itâs interesting that you just did the exact same thing that nearly every other reporter did in characterizing Trump.\n\nBen: Can I, can I actually, let me actually try to engage that, because I think thatâs an interesting point. But I think the reason, the reason that thatâs the headline is because if I said âI want Fox News to engage with Vivek,â thatâs not news and thatâs extremely boring because itâs obvious. And if I say âI want Fox News to engage with, um, and to give Hunter Biden a show,â thatâs news cause thatâs pretty surprising. And news is often about things that are surprising rather than things that are obvious.\n\nVivek: I think the thing thatâs actually really interesting is the idea of forget whether youâre platforming one individual or another, the whole thesis of that section of the letter, and what I... remain in my view as a good opportunity for BuzzFeed to pursue, is to be bold by saying that âwe will engage with ideas across the cultural and political and lifestyle spectrum in a way that no major media business is doing today.â\n\nNayeema: You said that you got interested in media about a year and a half ago, but as I understand it, youâve kind of been here before. I donât, I donât think this has been previously reported, but you had a call, I think, in late 2020 with, uh, Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, and others about rolling up a big internet company that would have included Parler and been an alternative to AWS, I believe. And you would have been CEO.\n\nVivek: Yeah, I think Iâve played around with a lot of concepts. One of those led to the birth of Strive, which is the financial services ecosystem. But youâre right, I briefly was intrigued by media. I decided to go the direction of financial services as my next stop. And so, my own view is when you think about driving change through the private sector, thereâs two sets of rails that really matter: communications and financial services. And I, I worry, also for our culture, that those are two of the rails that often lend themselves, forget who the government is in charge, but lend themselves to problematic government capture. Which is why you need robust, competitive, well run, private alternatives that prevent single viewpoint domination in either of those sets of rails.\n\nSo I went in the direction of financial services, started a business called Strive to compete against BlackRock, and then ran for president. After the presidential campaign, though, I interfaced so much with the media that it kind of pulled me really back in to say, Hey, You know what? If I was solely focused on, you know, personally maximizing the size of my bank account, Iâd probably pick other industries.\n\nBut within media, is there an opportunity to really drive change and still maximize value relative to the price at which a business like BuzzFeed is trading and show that something can be run successfully with an alternative vision? Yes, thatâs kind of what pulled me back in.\n\nNayeema: Vivek, you keep coming back to this idea of diversity and youâre mentioning Bill Maher and Destiny, which were very much in your letter, but would you be open to more liberal, more progressive voices coming on the platform as well as youâre talking about diversifying it?\n\nVivek: Of course.\n\nNayeema: So youâre, but you didnât mention any of those people in the, in your letter that are kind of, letâs say, extreme left.\n\nVivek: I consider destiny maybe in that, in that category.\n\nBen: Should we get Mehdi Hassan on there?\n\nNayeema: Yeah, would you have Mehdi on there?\n\nVivek: Sure!\n\nNayeema: Zeteo?\n\nVivek: Heâs a smart guy. Yeah, right. I think heâs a smart guy.\n\nNayeema: Yeah,\n\nVivek: Absolutely. You know, I, I think that we, we, we, we would, we had bo we would pick at certain bones where we disagree with each other, but the, the, the screen would be quality. âcause I think quality matters, right? You have bad quality on the right and you got bad quality on left screen for actual quality. But above that filter for quality, own the brand of saying that. Weâre actually fostering as much diverse ideational exchange as we possibly can have.\n\nNayeema: But thereâs also the basis of fact, right? You were on a presidential stage. You were saying that January 6th, quote, now does look like it was an inside job, something that has, you know, No basis in fact, how would you\n\nVivek: We can we can we can go on the substance of that if youâre interested I donât think...\n\nNayeema: But it is a job of journalists to fact check things like that. So where do you as someone whoâs been in the political machine? Somebody who has a now well articulated public point of view out there. How is that point of view going to come into the operations of this business? You either need to be the person saying the false things, the things the public wants to hear, or you need to be the person checking those things, catching those things, right?\n\nVivek: Let me just say, like, thereâs something that this is just personally getting to know me, right? So this idiosyncratic and not, but itâs fun anyway to say, like, whenever somebody, um, And this happened a lot in my life. Itâs probably happened to a lot of people, every person is watching this, too, right? And this is outside of politics, but maybe in the realm of, like, career advice, unsolicited as it is, is anytime somebody tells you shut up, sit down, stay in your lane, I naturally recoil at that.\n\nI think some of the greatest things that have happened in American history and some of the greatest\n\nBen: But this is such an abstract way to respond to a question about having said...\n\nVivek: Come from people who are crossing different boundaries. And so, no, no, no, itâs not an abstract way. Sheâs saying, you know, youâre, you picked a lane. For a year I was a presidential candidate and I ran openly as an entrepreneur. I said, you know, you, you describe it as part of the political machine for anybody in the Republican Party who understands the way I ran, the idea of calling me in any way...\n\nBen: You visibly felt the temptation that is unavoidable at every level of politics to tell people what they want to hear when they want to hear it.\n\nVivek: Thatâs I disagree with you, Ben. I think, I think that. If you want to adjudicate my campaign, we can have the, um, we can have that debate, but I donât think thatâs that Iâm happy to go that way. I donât think...\n\nBen: You know, weâll have it when you when youâre my boss at new anti-woke BuzzFeed.\n\nNayeema: I am curious...\n\nBen: I hope this job interview went well.\n\nNayeema: Iâm curious. Would you bring Ben Ben back to run? Are you going to re-launch...\n\nVivek: Hereâs what I would say. Iâm not, Iâm not planning or volunteering to be a CEO of anything, but letâs just play this out. Letâs say this was that kind of conversation. This is the kind of conversation I want to be having within a media company.\n\nNayeema: But these conversations happen. I think thatâs the thing, Vivek, these kinds of conversations happen at media companies.\n\nVivek: I donât, I donât think that thatâs possible, Nayeema, in a context in which 99.5 percent of your employeesâ political contributions are going in a direction that 50 percent of your country disagrees with.\n\nAnd I think it is no accident that the first paper, the first publication to break the Steele dossier, that would have not happened if it was 99.5 percent or 70 percent or even 50 percent in the other direction. I think there would be inherent checks and balances in creating a culture of debate.\n\nBen: I mean, I do think youâll have hopefully interesting conversations with Jonah Peretti about this because itâs, I think the ideology of journalists is often, you know, demented in various ways, but rarely on a left right spectrum. My own, in fact, is like in my own self criticism here is a sort of like radicalism about publishing the thing sometimes, you know, in any direction. But I do think that, well, I mean, I think I look forward to your digging in a little on this more because I think people who come out of politics often kind of project political motives the way journalists often project political motives onto entrepreneurs. I look forward to the, uh, the education of Vivek Ramaswamy on the inside of media businesses.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nNayeema: What you just heard was just a snippet of the conversation that Ben and I had with Vivek Ramaswamy because we actually ended up going very long, uh, 30-plus minutes.\n\nBen: He is a media critic, but also very generous with his time with the working press. And weâll have a, weâll have a full transcript with the Semafor Media newsletter on Sunday.\n\nNayeema: We will. Uh, in the meantime, what did you make of what he said? Because generous with his time, What do you think on the specifics?\n\nBen: You know, itâs funny. I, everything he said that was totally abstract, made total sense and could, some of the more concrete points I...\n\nNayeema: I mean, look, this is what we, we know now. He said that heâd invite in greater diversity than originally articulated in that letter. Yeah. So heâs open to Mehdi Hassan. We, you know, Zeteo News is going to be on BuzzFeed, perhaps in a Vivek Ramaswamy world.\n\nBen: He has a sort of idea about a kind of wide left-right spectrum. I think his strongest and strongest, most strongly-held views are really about ideology politics And I think doesnât realize that to some degree like this particular model of trying to get a spectrum of creators on your platform, and... something, something, something profits is another model that is on fire all across the industry right now, hemorrhaging money in the way the BuzzFeed was at its worst.\n\nNayeema: If I were Vivek Ramaswamy, I would kind of double down on my podcast and try to be the biggest creator I could be. Like why create a publisher, not a platform, but a publisher for the Tucker Carlsonâs of the world versus becoming a Tucker Carlson?\n\nBen: And that is. thatâs the problem with the businesses in that situation, itâs Vivek is Vivek who makes all the money, not Vivek as the owner of the podcast, begging Vivek to come on his his platform and do so.\n\nNayeema: Mm-Hmm.\n\nBen: So, yeah, I, yeah. And I guess the other thing about that conversation, which I often find talking to really smart people about media is that. Some things that seem really obvious, like some employees of BuzzFeed, not journalists, by the way, because I donât know the journalists give contributions, but apparently heâs counted up donations, which went to Democrats, and he draws a line, which is not unreasonable to, well, thatâs why BuzzFeed specifically was the first to publish, with lots of caveats, the unverified Steele dossier. I mean, as the person who made that decision, that doesnât happen...\n\nNayeema: Was it because of your political donations?\n\nBen: No, I mean, I have my own, like, and I wrote about this a lot, like thoughts about which Iâve revised a bit about, like, when should you publish the thing that everyone is talking about that the government is talking about, but also contains unverified allegations?\n\nLike, thatâs a complicated question on which I, at the time, had pretty radical views, but not on the left-right spectrum. It was, and I think itâs easy to come from politics and project that kind of political decision making into media, when often our good decisions and our terrible mistakes just are motivated differently.\n\nNayeema: Yeah, are organizational decisions and not vast conspiracies, as it were.\n\nBen: Yeah.\n\nNayeema: Except the conspiracy to make money.\n\nBen: Again, going terribly.\n\nNayeema: Going terribly. But maybe Vivek Ramaswamy can figure that out, given his business background.\n\nBen: That is a kind of conspiracy. Money and attention are things heâs been good at harvesting.\n\nNayeema: But speaking of business, Ben, we got to get some business here, which is that this podcast does not pay for itself. This is the other secret of media, which is that it is paid for by advertisers, subscribers or advertisers. And we often donât like to discuss the advertising of it all. And in this show, though, we are going to discuss it.\n\nAnd are you going to... are you going to now, like, tell us about Saatva mattresses or the green juice you really love?\n\nBen: You know, one of the real triumphs of this show, from my perspective, is that I do not have to pretend to like green juice. It turns out that it is possible to make podcasts without pretending to like green juice. I know this is\n\nNayeema: I actually like green juice.\n\nBen: You can do that on your wellness show, but this is a podcast about media. And you canât talk about media without talking about what funds a lot of it, which is advertising. So itâs really fitting that our sponsor for this show is itself all about advertising.\n\nThink with Google is this platform thatâs a very useful resource for great marketers. Some of the smartest people in the industry are regular contributors. Included among them is Josh Spanier, a guy Iâve known for a long time. Heâs a go-to for me on, you know, marketing-related questions of all sorts. And he, Josh has a huge job, he runs Googleâs marketing campaigns globally, just launched his own podcast, Modern Marketers, which you can check out after this episode. And starting this week and every week, Iâll catch up with Josh, about something curious Iâve noticed in the field of marketing, get his expert take on whatâs really going on.\n\nNayeema: What did you and Josh talk about this week?\n\nBen: This week, Josh breaks down how brands can square Gen Zâs obsession with authentic marketing and with authenticity with the rise of AI.\n\nNayeema: OK, letâs hear you and Josh in conversation and when weâre back, weâll have Max Tani join us for blind spots, stories youâre missing in your media diet.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nBen: You said recently on Think with Google that authenticity is the core of modern marketing, and that Gen Z consumers are obsessed with authenticity and how to, how do brands square that, in particular, with the rise of AI?\n\nJosh Spanier: So authenticity clearly incredibly important. It means different things in different contexts. The most important thing is that you show up as a brand as a marketer and true to yourself.\n\nThat means you kind of need to know who you are and what youâre trying to do and what your strategy is and what your selling proposition is. And then probably not overdress for it, right? The old joke used to be about you donât want to be the, you know, the cool uncle who turns up with a leather jacket to the to Christmas or whatever. The authenticity is if you actually represent your products in a relevant, resonant, and truthful way, people will pick up on that.\n\nMost people donât, donât really want to engage with brands per se, right? I mean, there are some magnetic brands out there. Iâll put Google as one of them. Nike or, or Under Armour in the sports category. People really want to lean into, into that because of the, the cachet those brands have. But for most marketers, theyâre not looking for that level of sort of sheen and, and, and, and shine.\n\nThey just want people to review their products, like them, and use them. That means we should be authentic about how we talk about them and, and pitch them. Not over claim, over promise, and, and be true to what the audience is actually really looking for.\n\nBen: Does AI play one way or the other into these questions about authenticity?\n\nJosh: Iâm not sure that it does, if Iâm honest with you, Ben. AI is a means to an end. And weâre in this period of time where just doing something with AI, everyone wants to talk about it. But if you imagine two or three or four years from now, AI is going to be so built into the system that youâre not going to necessarily notice it.\n\nIf youâre using AI to make something thatâs fake and not telling people, I think that could be a problem because then youâre not actually being, um, authentic. So I think as an industry, weâre still working through how we show up, certainly using generative AI and what that all means, but AI is incredibly important.\n\nAnd yet in some ways, almost a distraction in that youâve got to be focused on what youâre building, what youâre producing, what youâre making. And AI is the tool to do that in part, as much as many other elements of the marketing process.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nNayeema: All right. Now that youâre speaking about Gen Z, weâre back. We have our own resident Gen Z, Max Tani, whoâs actually not actually Gen Z.\n\nBen: That is the first real fake news of the show.\n\nMax Tani: Iâm not, just to be clear, Iâm not Gen Z, but I am, uh, our, our ambassador to Gen Z. I do have a theory: I live in New York, which I think ages you back five years, which I think technically puts me at the, uh, would put me on the cusp of Gen Z. I would be solidly Gen Z.\n\nBen: You were born too soon.\n\nNayeema: If I leave and come back, can I become Gen Z too?\n\nMax: Yeah, maybe. I donât know. I definitely am not, though, because we, here in our office, weâre right above a, like, a co-working space for Gen Z people, and you can tell which one people in the office are.\n\nNayeema: Oh, yeah. Alli was, our producer Alli was telling us that she heard them partying on her way out last night.\n\nBen: Yeah, and just to be clear, Max is our media editor and one of the great media journalists of his generation, which is not Gen Z. Yes, this is true, Max. We wonât say what it is.\n\nNayeema: That is true.\n\nBen: Itâs a little embarrassing.\n\nNayeema: What that heâs a millennial?\n\nBen: Yeah.\n\nNayeema: Oh, gosh.\n\nMax: Solidly millennial.\n\nNayeema: Itâs not embarrassing at all. Okay.\n\nMax: Howâs it been going so far? Howâs the pod?\n\nNayeema: What do you think? Uh, well, Ben applied for a job at BuzzFeed with Vivek. With Vivek. So that kind of gave him a cold shoulder. So itâs going great. Itâs going great. So there might be a spot for you here. Your promotions just keep on coming, Max.\n\nMax: Maybe. Yeah. Exactly. By law of attrition, maybe Iâll run Semafor. Thereâll be a lot of big changes around here. Oh. Haha.\n\nNayeema: Starting with more Gen Z parties with the mixers with the downstairs crowd. Um, but tell us Blind Spots.\n\nMax: Yeah. So on the show, weâre, weâre going to do this every week, which is a segment where we talk about, you know, in the era of fragmentation where, um, you know, everybody has their own individualized kind of media ecosystem.\n\nWe want to do some fun stories that basically, um, pierce the, uh, the ideological, uh, bubbles and kind of get outside.\n\nNayeema: And what are our Blind Spots this week, Max?\n\nMax: This week for, for Blind Spots. On the left, the scolds in the liberal media for years have been saying that we shouldnât look at our screens hours before bedtime because it disrupts sleep.\n\nIâm sure youâve heard this maybe from a spouse, from a partner. Uh, âput your phone down,â you know, âread a book,â do something like that. But, a new study reported on in the Wall Street Journal says that actually, screen time may not be bad for sleep after all, and the link between use of technology and sleep is actually much more nuanced than we thought.\n\nSo, you know, you guys, Iâve deduced, both spend a little bit of time looking at screens sometimes, on occasion. Are you looking at your phone right before you go to sleep?\n\nNayeema: I try to sleep with my phone outside of my bedroom.\n\nBen: This is for your wellness podcast I have my phone right by my bed and I sleep like a baby, so this totally confirms my prejudices.\n\nMax: Okay, but so, so is it a, is it a, you put the phone down and then you go immediately to sleep or how, how often or Nayeema, how often?\n\nNayeema: I have another phone. I have a bedroom phone.\n\nBen: Oh no.\n\nNayeema: Which is, this is like sad. I do. I have a phone thatâs just for alarm clock. It has like nothing, it doesnât have a sim in it. Itâs just for the eighteen alarm clocks I need to like get up.\n\nBen: But it still has to be a phone...\n\nNayeema: Yeah, because itâs like a...\n\nMax: It canât be an actual...\n\nNayeema: how, I donât, I actually ha, I have bought one of those clunky little alarm clocks from Amazon, but I do not use it, you know, like the $10 bright blue.\n\nBen: But this is actually a total media story because people love that, a certain genre of often very thinly-sourced study that confirms their prejudice. I mean, there is this whole moral panic right now about social media and phones.\n\nNayeema: Mm-hmm.\n\nBen: That is based on kind of thin correlations. But one of the best-selling books in America right now, Jonathan Gatesâ The Anxious Generation .\n\nAnd thereâs a lot in there that I agree with. Thereâs a lot that I intuitively agree with. And whenever you intuitively agree with something, itâs usually wrong.\n\nNayeema: But is this a liberal media sensation that this idea or are conservatives worldwide sleeping with their phones?\n\nMax: Yeah, this is total nanny state liberal âoh, put your phone down, read a book. Have a conversation....â You donât hear about this on Fox News. Theyâre not talking about put your phone away and have some holistic, uh, sleep, uh, you know, approach methods. For me, it also, but, but I agree with Ben. The reason why I selected this is it is confirmational for me. I am someone who famously, uh, looks at my phone until exactly before I need to go to sleep and I, I actually think\n\nNayeema: Is this the kind of editor you are where youâre going to be bringing stories that validate your anecdote?\n\nBen: Yeah, Max breaks, Max breaks a lot of news late at night.\n\nMax: I do like I am. I am. I am a night owl. Uh, this, uh, you know, the, the, uh, the early morning call time today was, uh, was a little difficult for me. The really, truly sad thing for me is itâs not my phone thatâs keeping me up. Itâs really like, once I put away my phone, itâs my thoughts, uh, really keeping me up at night.\n\nBen: Yeah, the phone is a great way to solve that.\n\nMax: The phone is great. Yeah, exactly. If Iâm thinking about something on my phone, itâs fine.\n\nNayeema: Exactly. Itâs a great numbing tool. So thatâs what the left isnât seeing. The left side of the media isnât seeing these days. What is the right not seeing?\n\nMax: Well, certainly, uh, conservative media is not talking about, uh, the new consumer confidence, uh, index, uh, from April.\n\nAnd this is according to CNN, um, that, uh, Americans attitudes towards the economy actually improved this month for the first time since January, primarily thanks to better perceptions about the job market. Um, and it kind of got me thinking, uh, is this maybe the best news for, you know, Biden and, and Democrats in, in months?\n\nI certainly, uh, looked on Fox News, did not see anything regarding the, uh, strong consumer confidence. I donât know, what do you guys think? Do you think that this is, this is good news?\n\nNayeema: We hear from the Biden administration, and in fact, a lot of data suggests that the economy is better than peopleâs perception of the economy is, and yet, I donât I think that the perception does matter here in a big way.\n\nAnd certainly one of the pieces that I was most struck by this week was this piece in The Cut around âthe millennial midlife crisis,â right?\n\nMax: You snuck it in!\n\nNayeema: I snuck it in. I snuck it in. Iâve been desperate to talk about âthe millennial midlife crisis.â But I, but I, but I do think...\n\nBen: This is the most millennial...\n\nMax: This was one of those pieces that we rejected.\n\nNayeema: I will say it is, it is fascinating. And I think a theme that we should explore on a future episode of this show is the mediaâs role in the kind of framing of the perception of the economy, how actually the coverage impacts what you think the economy is like, Iâm curious to see this index increase, which I did not know about until Max, you, um, youâve told us about it. If it makes me feel better about the economy going forward.\n\nBen: Right. This is actually a survey of consumer perceptions.\n\nNayeema: Yes.\n\nBen: Themselves driven in part by partisanship, in part by us in the media.\n\nNayeema: Mm-hmm.\n\nBen: I mean itâs a, thereâs this strange circularity to it and you wanna believe and hope that ultimately elections can be decided on more on peopleâs experiences of their own lives than what they see.\n\nThen that you know...\n\nNayeema: When they perceive that they should see...\n\nBen: When they think, and there, you know, and there always is that gap. But yeah. I wonder as sort of millennials start to take over the media, if itâs just gonna be complaining 100% of the time about everything.\n\nNayeema: I donât know if itâs gonna be complaining all the time. Itâs definitely gonna be about us all the time.\n\nMax: That is certainly true. I have many complaints that I could bring to the show in future episodes. One of the things thatâs most interesting that this got me really thinking about is, you know, you hear a lot from both the Biden campaign and Democrats.\n\nActually, the economy is doing really well right now. And itâs like, thatâs like, that is literally, factually true. Itâs not an amazing message to put out there that, oh, no, no, no, that thing that youâre feeling, the fact that groceries are prices are higher and housing costs, which are the two things that are actually, um, you know, consumers are still not, not feeling great about, uh, you know, those are, those things actually donât matter because, you know, most people have jobs,\n\nBen: Your wages went up, your mortgage has been deflated a bit. Itâs yeah... unemployment... unemployment is, Itâs incredibly low. But of course, thatâs only something that affects you if youâre looking for a job, which is not most people most of the time. And it is, yeah, itâs a very, itâs a very sort of strange paradoxical situation. It is also always a dilemma in the White House.\n\nI remember talking to Austan Goolsbee, Obamaâs advisor back in 2010, in some White House elevator and he wanted to come out and say, âWell, thereâs a recovery, things are going great!â And other voices were in the White House were sort of saying, âNo, people are going to feel that you lack empathy if you say that.â\n\nSo it is an eternal debate. I mean, you know, George H. W. Bush lost an election with Bill Clinton telling everybody how terrible the economy was in 1992, when in retrospect at the beginning of one of the great recoveries in American history. So itâs a, itâs a, itâs a perpetual problem.\n\nNayeema: That was a Gen X history lesson for us millennials.\n\nMax: I certainly didnât know it. I was born in the 1990s.\n\nNayeema: I uh, feel like there were many blind spots.\n\nBen: My memory goes back to the 1990s.\n\nNayeema: Oh wow. Thatâs amazing.\n\nBen: Weâre going to be revisiting that decade over and over here on Mixed Signals.\n\nNayeema: Mixed Signals, here to crush your millennial dreams. All right. Thank you so much, Max, for Blind Spots. Is there anything else that weâre missing?\n\nMax: I donât know. I think that actually between the three of us, do we miss that much? I feel like thereâs a\n\nBen: No, thatâs why we stay up on our phones all night is so we miss nothing.\n\nNayeema: Not me. I donât stay up on my phone. I stay up on my other phone.\n\nMax: That is truly shocking.\n\nNayeema: I know.\n\nMax: Itâs true.\n\nNayeema: Thanks for listening to Mixed Signals from Semafor Media.

      "text": "Transcript: Vivek Ramaswamy on BuzzFeed, politics and media\n\nSign up for Semafor Media: Mediaâs essential read. Read it now .\n\nNayeema Raza: So first question: Explain what youâre trying to do with BuzzFeed. Is this a play to achieve what Elon did with Twitter, but with lower stakes and a lower price tag, or something else?\n\nVivek Ramaswamy: Well, look, I laid it out pretty clearly in the letter I sent to the board , I enjoy creating value. That is something that Iâve done in my career as an entrepreneur, Iâve always had an instinct as a value investor as well, and I see a lot of value destroyed by the way this business has been run. Iâm not in the phase of casting blame or pointing fingers at one individual versus another.Â\n\nBut the fact is, this was a potentially very valuable business at the time it went public. Certainly a lot of people with a lot of money backed it on that premise. And it has cratered on the back of a lot of business failures that I believe are still correctable. Thereâs a lot of different businesses and a lot of different industries that could fit that description, but my particular interest in the media did come from my interface with the media over the last year and a half, that taught me a lot of things about how the media landscape works.\n\nAnd so for me, itâs a combination of a mission orientation to create the kind of media company that I think the public deserves, but to do it in a way that creates what I view as potentially massive shareholder value. Itâs a lot of fun, itâs also productive. But I think thatâs going to require massive, drastic, strategic change to a business that is patently in trouble. I think that this is a business that has admitted some of its failures from a business perspective, but theyâre really just rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic, when I think a complete overhaul is required. And when I saw nobody else stepping up to the plate to do it, I saw an opportunity. And I believe in driving change through the private sector for the better, creating value in the process, and thatâs what Iâm trying to do here.\n\nBen Smith: Well, as somebody who cares a lot about BuzzFeed, although all that abstract stuff sounds great for me. I should say, I was also there probably for the single worst business decision we made, which was not selling to Disney for $500 million back in 2014, so I will not lecture you on value creation. But a lot of people do think that this venture is a bit like your campaign in that itâs a lot of money, a lot of attention, but ultimately, thereâs no way for you to get the votes. Jonah Peretti votes: 64% of the stock. Howâs that gonna work?\n\nVivek: Thereâs so many circular references that Iâve had even in the 48 hours since my stake was initially reported, and since my letter went in to the board â the mediaâs reporting of it â that actually almost proved my thesis for how broken and in some cases idiotic, downright low-IQ, the media really is in situations like this.\n\nBen: Wow, thank you. Was it that good a question? I think that was a pretty straightforward question, Vivek. This is a company with two classes of stock.Â\n\nVivek: And Iâll give you a straightforward answer. It was preamble to an obvious point, that Iâm just disappointed that people in media canât take notice of, because thereâs a gap in business understanding. So ordinarily, if you have super-voting shares, yes, absolutely, youâre the person who decides the governance of the company.Â\n\nThereâs a curious fact about this company that the entire reporting of that line of thinking completely missed, which is â I would add to a list of journalistic failures that grows every day â this is a company that has more debt than cash. That debt comes due this December. So anybody who thinks that Jonah Peretti is the person in control of this business because some piece of paper says he has voting rights over the shares is delusional, to borrow a word from the subtitle of your own book describing the same industry, Ben. Itâs delusion.\n\nIâll leave it at this for now: The game theory of a traditional situation, where you have founder-controlled shares versus an outside shareholder, changes completely when you have debt that comes due thatâs deeply underwater from its conversion price, and that comes due at a moment where the company has less cash than debt [and] is losing money on a growing basis. Iâll leave it at that for now. But I think somebody who has basic intuitions of how those situations play out would maybe rethink the idea that Jonah actually has full control of this company.\n\nBen: Just playing that out, thereâs sort of an obvious logic to taking the company private in that situation. And Iâm curious if thatâs the direction youâd want to take it.\n\nVivek: Look, I think thereâs a menu of options available. Frankly, I havenât had my first meeting with the company yet. Iâm always a big believer in any issue, business issues included, to make sure you get the best arguments for the other side, air them, understand them deeply as though theyâre your own, to really figure out whatâs best, especially in building a business. I think thatâs critical, right? If the goal is actually creating shareholder value, you want to understand. Iâm looking at this from the outside, and I do think that weâre in a moment of this businessâs life where an outside perspective would be useful. Itâs hard to argue with how the stock price has performed and the business performance that some massive change is needed. So Iâm hopeful that Iâm bringing that fresh outside perspective.\n\nNonetheless, Iâve got to acknowledge that I donât have all of the information and history and context that the existing management does, too. And so Iâm going to hear that out, wear that argument as though Iâm in there with them, and then come to what I believe is actually the right, best [conclusion]. You could think about a range of tracks for the plumbing of this. People talk about going private. Are there things to do with the debt? Are there things to do with other ways of financing or growing or shedding parts of the business? I laid out my current views in the letter, and hopefully you can share that with your audiences, because I do think â itâs like six pages or so, but itâs not exactly the way that CNN characterized the letter.\n\nNayeema: I think itâs seven pages. And we did read the letter. You kind of outline a three- pronged strategy. You want to cut costs, you want to pivot to audio and video, and you want to bring a diversity of thought into the BuzzFeed equation. You mentioned publishers â content creators like Tucker Carlson, Candace Owens, perhaps Aaron Rodgers. But I want to ask you, because thereâs this wave of conservative mediaâ\n\nVivek: Can I just pause you right there?\n\nNayeema: Of course.Â\n\nVivek: What you just described was exactly consistent with the rest of the media reporting on this, which the headline said [that Iâd] bring Candace Owens and Tucker Carlson in. Iâm just gonna pause right there for one second, because I think itâs really, really important. Since you quoted my letter, Iâm gonna ask you to quote it correctly. I did not say Candace Owens, Tucker Carlson, Aaron Rodgers. I said, what you need is to have the courage to engage with the full cultural and political spectrum, from Candace Owens to Destiny, from Tucker Carlson to Bill Maher, from Aaron Rodgers to Charles Barkley. And so itâs interesting that you just did the exact same thing.\n\nBen: Let me actually try to engage that criticism, because I think thatâs an interesting point. But I think the reason that thatâs the headline, is because if I said, âI want Fox News to engage with Vivek Ramaswamy,â thatâs not news, and thatâs extremely boring, because itâs obvious. And if I say, âI want Fox News to engage with, and to give Hunter Biden a show,â thatâs news, because thatâs pretty surprising. News is often about things that are surprising, rather than things that are obvious. And the reason I think, at least from my perspective, that itâs more interesting that you would bring Tucker Carlson to BuzzFeed than you would bring kind of a center-left mainstream person to BuzzFeed is because itâs surprising. Thatâs what defines news.\n\nVivek: Itâs a good conversation here. I just want to say one thing in response to that, right. Because Ben, youâre a smart guy.\n\nBen: Flattery will get you everywhere.\n\nVivek: Iâll give you that. But I think itâs important to recognize this â I donât say this as a compliment here, I say it as somewhat of a criticism â is that youâre able to elide the essence of what just happened there, and the essence of that media reporting, because youâre right.\n\nBen: No, I think youâre saying that weâre being unfair to you by saying that the most interesting thing about your letter was the sort of rightward turn toward BuzzFeed. And I think that was authentically a really interesting thing. Can I ask you about the substance of it?\n\nVivek: The essence of the point, just to smoke it out: I think the thing thatâs actually really interesting, is the idea â forget whether youâre platforming one individual or another, the whole thesis of that section of the letter, and what remains, in my view, a good opportunity for Buzzfeed to pursue â is to be bold by saying that we will engage with ideas across the cultural and political and lifestyle spectrum in a way that no major media business is doing today. [Itâs] not dunking on BuzzFeed by dancing on their grave with conservative voices. No.\n\nNayeema: In fact, thatâs not what youâre doing.\n\nVivek: Itâs engaging in dialogue which I think weâre missing, and itâs useful, I hope.\n\nNayeema: It seems that part of the thesis that you have for a broadened media platform is that some of these conservative media platforms that have risen that would have only contained the three voices I just named â places like Parler, Gettr, Rumble, even Truth Social â they are struggling as a business. So this idea of catering to a single audience, as it were, is not working. Is that part of your premise of investment, that you really want it to be broad?\n\nVivek: There is an opportunity thatâs untapped. And the untapped opportunity, I think, is to have one platform where, on the same platform, you have different voices engaging. And I use the word platform a little bit imprecisely there, because what weâre talking about here is actually a publisher, right, which is different than an X, or a Truth Social or any of these other platforms. Itâs the unique opportunity to create a publisher that actually does the service for its audience for screening for quality of content. Thatâs an important service.Â\n\nBut it seems that every other publisher whoâs providing that service is providing another service that many audiences donât love, which is also screening for the ideology of what theyâre able to hear. So if you could separate those two things â of screening as a quality filter for what their audiences get, but affirmatively actually engaging with dissenting voices, not just on questions of news or politics, but across the cultural, ideological, sports, lifestyle spectrums â thatâs interesting to me. And the collective of all of those things that you named, in terms of actually incorporating diversity of thought into your own ranks, into the voices that you platform as a publisher, in terms of moving in the direction of content creation, and going in the direction of the creator economy, which I think is a more promising business direction than digitized print â you actually create something that BuzzFeed is missing today, which is really the only way for one of these businesses to differentiate itself. Which is a brand.\n\nRight now, most people know BuzzFeed, the name. Nobody knows what it actually means. And I think the ability to use some of the things that I suggested doing in the letter with humility, with an actual sense of grace and honesty, admitting some of the prior failures â the failures are obvious. Itâs like the ketchup stain on your shirt phenomenon; everybody sees it, but you actually can win your audience over if youâre the person to admit it. Use that sense of vulnerability and honesty to build a brand that not only BuzzFeed but so many other media companies like it lack today.\n\nTo the extent youâre gonna have a corporate player in media at all, I think brand is essential, because pretty soon, itâs all going to be commoditized, if it isnât already, if not by AI already, by human beings who are behaving like AI, doing same same cut-and-paste reporting. The thing thatâs really going to differentiate a media company in the future is actually going to be the brand created by that human honesty, and using AI and other tools to actually manage the costs, in a way that this business just hasnât done to date. And so thatâs the way Iâm thinking about this.\n\nBen: I mean, itâs a tough business that youâre thinking about getting into, and one in which there are no new ideas. So we wish you luck, to the degree that we can figure [it out].\n\nNayeema: Vivek, you said that you got interested in media about a year and a half ago, but as I understand that youâve been here before. I donât think this has been previously reported, but you had a call, I think in late 2020, with Peter Thiel, Elon Musk and others, about rolling up a big internet company that would have included Parler and been an alternative to [Amazon Web Services], I believe. And you would have been CEO.\n\nVivek: Iâve played around with a lot of concepts. One of those led to the birth of Strive, which is the financial services ecosystem. But youâre right. After I left my job in biotech, ... I started a company in 2014, led it as CEO for seven years, ran it according to decentralized principles â [and] I see an opportunity to run a media company in the same way, give people skin in the game, bottom-up, align incentives. And thatâs a $8-$9 billion publicly-traded company today, thatâs returned over a billion and a half dollars in cash to shareholders, and itâs traded on the NASDAQ. We just celebrated the 10-year anniversary of the company last month.\n\nOne of the things Iâve been interested in for a long time is, how can I use some of those experiences to drive other change to the private sector. I briefly was intrigued by media. I decided to go the direction of financial services as my next stop. And so my own view is, when you think about driving change to the private sector, thereâs two sets of rails that really matter: communications and financial services. And I worry, also for our culture, that those are two of the rails that, forget who the government is in charge, lend themselves to problematic government capture, which is why you need robust, competitive, well-run private alternatives that prevent single viewpoint domination in either of those sets of rails. So I ended up dedicating myself actually, I threw the towel in media. Like you said, Ben, if youâre doing it just for the pursuit of profit, thereâs better places to do that than in the media business. â¦ So I went in the direction of financial services.\n\nBen: Pragmatic choice.\n\nVivek: After the presidential campaign, though, I interface so much with the media, that kind of pulled me really back in to say: You know what, if I was solely focused on personally maximizing the size of my bank account, Iâd probably pick other industries. But within media, is there an opportunity to really drive change and still maximize value relative to the price at which a business like BuzzFeed is trading and show that something can be run successfully with an alternative vision? Yes, thatâs what pulled me back in.\n\nNayeema: In retrospect, is that idea that you discussed with Peter and Elon and others an attractive idea? This kind of roll-up.\n\nVivek: I said this in the letter as well â people make this mistake. The idea of rolling up assets or divesting assets: thatâs not a strategy, thatâs a tactic. Right? You need a baseline strategy of what youâre actually doing. And so, does the broad strategy of platforming multiple different kinds of voices and pursuing truth through the open exchange of ideas in a marketplace that lacks it? Is that a good strategy? I think it is, actually. I think a lot of consumers are hungry for it. I think it doesnât exist today. Thereâs periods in the past in media where itâs existed. I think it can exist in the future, but in the context of a new media content distribution landscape, nobodyâs really tapped that yet. So do I believe that strategy can work? Absolutely. And do I think running it as this multi-manager platform, which is the core model that I suggest for BuzzFeed to run itself â decentralized, give creators skin in the game, so you donât have to pay large upfront costs, give people that autonomy, rather than centrally mandating what they do, or donât do? Yes, I think that this is an opportunity to build a multibillion-dollar business. Itâs never going to be, probably, a trillion-dollar company as a publisher, but a multibillion-dollar business. I think that opportunity absolutely exists.\n\nNayeema: [The Free Press, the publication run by] our former colleague, Bari Weiss, raised a concern about the kind of revolving door of media and politics. [The Free Press] said this: âA healthier political environment would be one in which politicians are politicians, and the media is the media.â Vivek, which team do you want to be on? That was [their] question to you. Whatâs your answer?\n\nVivek: I didnât see that. On the basic intuition of it, I generally tend to share [with] anybody who has a revulsion to a revolving door between politics and industry broadly, especially after youâve been in the seat of actually making public policy. I have deep aversion to [that]. And I think that thatâs not a left- or a right-wing intuition. I think thereâs people on the left and right who both share that. And so, you know what, if Iâd been the President of the United States, which is where I was running for, or if Iâd been in a policymaking position in the Senate, I probably shouldnât come back to the very industries that I had oversight over. I donât favor that kind of thing, all else equal. I mean, there could be exceptions here or there, maybe, but all else equal, as a general rule I agree with Bari, Iâd be against that.Â\n\nI am the other way around. Iâm an entrepreneur who volunteered to run this country, as U.S. president, as somebody who is patently outside of politics. And the beauty of our process is the people of this country get to decide who actually leads the country. But Iâm an entrepreneur at my core. And so I am continuing to do the thing Iâve been doing for the last 15 years, which is building businesses, investing, writing books â Iâve written three books in the past three years, and working on my fourth now â so the combination of that type of content creation, combined with business creation, makes the media a natural place not to ignore.\n\n(After this conversation, Vivek read the Free Press piece and realized heâd misunderstood the context of the phrase ârevolving doorâ in our conversation. He emailed: âIâm against the ârevolving doorâ between people who have served in the government and who go on to specifically monetize their government connections in public service through private business activities. To be clear, I have absolutely no problem with private sector leaders who go on to serve in government, or former public servants who go on to succeed in the private market independently â Iâd love to see more of both! But using your connections gained during government service to later enrich yourself is something I donât like.\n\nâBut I see no philosophical problem with someone who aspires to public office becoming a publisher of content, or a publisher of content later running for public office. Our Founding Fathers certainly didnât see a problem with that. Alexander Hamilton founded the New York Post. Thomas Jefferson or Benjamin Franklin would certainly count as a âpublisherâ or âcontent creatorâ in modern times - not to mention engineer, inventor, and entrepreneur too. They were polymath intellectuals who werenât confined to the lane of âpolitician.â I think we could use more of that Renaissance spirit in the class of people who lead our country today.â\n\nBen: I think what [The Free Press] was talking about, though, was journalism. Almost everything you said right now, probably could have come out of my mouth or out of the mouth of the guy who runs CNN, or the New York Times editor: âWe believe in having diverse voices.â\n\nVivek: Ben, may I justâ\n\nBen: Yeah, of course.\n\nVivek: Weâre having a fun debate here.\n\nBen: But I mean, how abstract it isâ\n\nVivek: You used to run BuzzFeed News though, right?\n\nBen: Let me get to that. I promise Iâm getting there, and we can argue about the specifics, because I would just love to take it to specifics for a minute. The point I was just trying to make was that, I think when people talk about media news in the abstract, we all sort of say the same words. And thereâs actually a lot that I really liked in your letter in that context.\n\nBut I would say the thing that disappointed me a little were some of the specific criticisms. Because it seemed like somebody had sort of Googled âcriticism of BuzzFeed stories,â a lot of it actually from the left and almost totally at random, and said, âWell, look, the World Wildlife Foundation was upset that BuzzFeed News reported, and then the Trump administration acted, on these questions on the way in which they were working with rangers who were killing people.â It was a pretty good story. If that person that Googled it had read the Guardian story they linked , they would have seen that they conceded most of the substance of it. Similarly, there was a dispute with Robert Mueller. I was sort of surprised to see you on his side of it, but sure. There was a big dispute about the Steele dossier that I think is a totally reasonable one, that Iâve written about at length.\n\nBut a really core part of owning, of working, in media, and working with journalists, is to have the backs of the reporters that youâre working with. And to come in with what really seemed like pretty random and not particularly deeply researched criticism saying, âHey, thereâs been criticism of a bunch of these stories, most of it from the left, some of it from the right,â which sort of surprised me too â that just felt kind of facile, honestly, and not the way that somebody who wants to employ journalists ought to approach it.\n\nVivek: If I may respond â as you would acknowledge, of course, youâre not an impartial observer of this.\n\nBen: No, no, of course not. Thatâs literally true. And I do care a lot about that place.\n\nVivek: You were the editor of BuzzFeed News at a time when many of those criticisms came out. So, look, we all have our vantage points, and I just think itâs worth acknowledging.\n\nBen: Sure, but mine is very close to the page on those. Thatâs why I guess Iâm reacting. I have a very detailed knowledge.\n\nVivek: Which is a useful, thereâs, thereâs pros to being close to it too.\n\nBen: Understanding the details is a pro.\n\nVivek: You thought it was a facile criticism. Let me know when youâre ready for a non-facileâ\n\nBen: Iâm ready for a profound response. Go for it.\n\nVivek: I canât promise profound, but I could promise you what I actually believe, which I think is a little bit more nuanced than what you laid out. First, the notion of saying that youâd be surprised to see me offer criticisms from the left and from the right, itself reflects a misunderstanding of the intention. It reflects the same reason why you hear people airlifting Candace Owens and Tucker without mentioning Destiny and Bill Maher, which also came in the letter.\n\nBen: I think people mostly know you as a conservative political activist running for president.\n\nVivek: The point I was making is, there is a series of examples that have lost [BuzzFeedâs] audienceâs trust. And BuzzFeedâs audience did lose its trust in BuzzFeed. And at the time you left BuzzFeed News, I think you said something to the effect of âBuzzFeed is in great shape, but I know that Jonah has committed to news.â Within two years later, their stock price is in the toilet, theyâre loaded with debt, and they have shed their entire news business. So in a certain sense, whatâs the message to the journalists? Itâs: That model isnât working. Right? The historical model failed many journalists, who now do not have their job, because BuzzFeed News as a division does not exist.\n\n[crosstalk] BuzzFeed News does not exist, in part, because of those failures. And so itâs not a left-wing or right-wing point or that I agree with Robert Mueller, or I agree with the left-wing critics of the WWF story. [The] point is that an audience[âs] trust has been betrayed. That was an asset that was lost, that in part contributed to the closure of this news division.\n\nThe final point here is, I view all of this as the symptoms. You said Iâm saying the same thing that you might say or the head of CNN might say, or whatever, Mark Thompson or whoever else. Well, not quite, actually. I think that everything weâre talking about, including a lot of those â what I would call, certainly, some journalistic failures. I give you credit, I read your piece in The Atlantic, you acknowledge you would have done some things differently. By the way, if Jonah said the same thing on behalf of BuzzFeed now, I think that would accrete massive trust and value to his business. But I donât think I am saying quite the same thing. Because if you say, âtalk about diversity of thought,â everybody says it. In that sense, youâre right about it. I believe in facts. You said you want to get the facts. Letâs get to hard facts. [crosstalk]\n\nIf you look at the employee contributions, where do employees contribute? Thatâs public data, thankfully. Of all of the employee contributions that BuzzFeed has recorded publicly since 2010, itâs not that 50-50 was to Democrat or Republican. Weâre talking over 99% in one direction, and less than 1% to Republicans. And Iâm not saying it has to be 50-50. But if youâre running a business that claims to have diversity trainings, right â they offer mandatory diversity trainings â proclaims the importance of diversity of thought, as BuzzFeed does, and yet, 99.9 or 99.5% of your employee political contributions go in one direction? [crosstalk] And then you look at those journalistic failures through that lensâ\n\nBen: You should see their audienceâs political contributions. Like, really. I think, if you look at the audience of Huffington Post, you might also find that their political contributions tilted left. â¦ I suspect the audience is in a similar place, which could be a problem when youâre operating it.\n\nVivek: Thatâs a self-fulfilling cycle, and that audience is shrinking versus what Iâm saying.Â\n\nBen: So do you fire the audience?\n\nVivek: You donât fire the audience, far from it, you attract the audience. You have already fired the audience. Thatâs actually whatâs reflecting itself, is a business that is going down.\n\nBen: I think there are a lot of good points here, genuinely, but also this is, I do think that this was a bit of a kitchen sink, and having literally written the book about why the social news companies collapsed â honestly, I wish I could say it was because they were doing combative journalism that sometimes made people unhappy. But I think they couldnât afford that journalism, for a bunch of really interesting reasons you probably understand better than I do, because you went to business school, but that were fundamentally about a bad bet on the shape of the internet. And I agree with you, in some ways, about the way itâs going. I think figuring out how media companies make money out of that is a complicated thing for another podcast.\n\nNayeema: Vivek, you keep coming back to this idea of diversity. And youâre mentioning Bill Maher and Destiny, which were very much in your letter. But would you be open to more liberal, more progressive voices coming on the platform as well, as youâre talking about diversifying it?\n\nVivek: Of course.\n\nNayeema: But you didnât mention any of those people in your letter that are kind of, letâs say extreme left.\n\nVivek: I consider Destiny maybe in that.\n\nBen: Should we get Mehdi Hasan on there?\n\nNayeema: Yeah, would you have Mehdi?\n\nVivek: Sure. Heâs a smart guy, right? I think heâs a smart guy, absolutely. You know, I think that we would pick at certain bones where we disagree with each other, but the screen would be quality, because I think quality matters, right? You got bad quality on the right, you got bad quality on the left. Screen for actual quality, but above that filter for quality, own the brand of saying that weâre actually fostering as much diverse ideational exchange as we possibly can have.\n\nBen: But thatâs what I want Semaforâs brand to be. You canât be giving them this advice.\n\nNayeema: Vivek is a millennial, taking back the millennial brand of BuzzFeed in a lot of ways.\n\nVivek: Thereâs room for an ecosystem here.\n\nNayeema: There is one specific thing I want to say, because itâs not just about being governed by the audience, or the people making the content, but thereâs also the basis of fact, right? And this is where I think [the] question of the revolving door comes in. Because what role would you play in this new ecosystem? You were on a presidential stage. You were saying that Jan. 6, ânow does look like it was an inside job,â something that has no basis in fact.\n\nVivek: We can go on the substance of that if youâre interested.\n\nNayeema: It is the job of journalists to fact-check things like that. So as someone whoâs been in the political machine, somebody who has a now well-articulated public point of view out there â just like what youâre saying 99.5% of BuzzFeed employees have, you have a very particular point of view. How is that point of view going to come into the operations of this business?\n\nVivek: Iâll tell you what some of my own experiences have been in life and building businesses. If you look at, for example, the company that I mentioned before, a NASDAQ-traded multibillion-dollar business, by any measure, in 10 years, one of the most successful companies in the industry in a 10-year period â my number two, who became the number one â¦ has probably more different political perspectives from me than either of you on this call. And yet, we worked incredibly well together to challenge each other and push each other to create a common purpose and mission in something that had nothing to do with the areas where he and I continue to spar, like good friends. Weâll spar with bare knuckles today.Â\n\nAnd I miss that culture in America, actually, I miss that. That used to exist. I mean, thatâs part of who we are. I mean, our founding â this country was that, right? Thomas Jefferson and John Adams were sworn political enemies, but then spent the latter half of their lives writing letters to each other, that weâre able to read for posterity. And those end up being better-written articles of opinions than anything we see in the modern landscape. So I want to bring that back. And so what I would say is the way Iâd want to run â Iâm not proposing to be the CEO of anything at this point.\n\nNayeema: Well, Elon and Peter thought you were good enough to be a CEO of a much bigger company.\n\nVivek: Iâve been a CEO.\n\nNayeema: Of a media company, I should say, a bigger media company.\n\nVivek: The way I think BuzzFeed has an opportunity to run itself with the strategy that Iâve offered here, is one in which its board, its management and its talent base include the best and brightest across â itâs not just left versus right, because then weâre just talking politics â across a wide range of axes, to create the kind of discourse that weâre just missing today. And I think social media fails a little bit on this mark. I think the algorithmically supercharged nature of how the platforms are run lose[s] that filter of quality, which I think is a service to an audience.\n\nBen: Now youâre singing our song. Every time you speak abstractly, I love it.\n\nNayeema: But the specifics matterâ\n\nVivek: I think we start from first principles. Sometimes all of us, myself, Iâm sure, included, are clouded by the strong feelings we have on a particular content-driven debate. â¦ You could say, was it maybe even a bad idea to get into some of the specifics in the letter? If you look at how much it distracted people relative to whatâs in the heart of there, maybe I should have just left those out in the first letter. But the whole point is, I want to actually start from a bare-bones set of first principles, right? Whatâs the principle? We believe in pursuing truth. We pursue truth through open ideas. Donât trust us. Trust the people you listen to and donât trust any one of them. Listen to all of them.\n\nNayeema: But hereâs the thing. Vivek, I agree with you on these principles. But you, as a presidential candidate, you either need to be the person saying the false things, the things the public wants to hear, or you need to be the person checking those things, catching those things, right? Thatâs the Bari Weiss question.\n\nVivek: Nayeema, let me just say. This is just personally getting to know me, right? This is idiosyncratic and not, but itâs fine â¦ Whenever somebody â and this happened a lot in my life, itâs probably happened to a lot of people, every person is watching this too, right, and this is outside of politics, but maybe in the realm of like career advice, unsolicited as it is â anytime somebody tells you, âshut up, sit down, stay in your lane,â I naturally recoil at that. I think some of the greatest things that have happened in American history and some of the greatestâ\n\nBen: This is such an abstract way to respond to a question about having saidâ\n\nVivek: Crossing different boundaries. And so no, itâs not an abstract question. Youâre saying you picked a lane. For a year, I was a presidential candidate, and I ran openly as an entrepreneur. I said, you know, you described me as part of the political machine. For anybody in the Republican Party who understands the way I ran well, calling me in any wayâ\n\nBen: I think itâs that you visibly felt the temptation to tell an audience what they want. To feel the temptation, that is unavoidable at every level of politics, to tell people what they want to hear when they want to hear it. Anyone who watches and I donât even mean this, anybody who watches any political campaign sees this.\n\nVivek: We can have that debate. But I donât think thatâsâ Iâm happy to go that way.\n\nBen: You know, weâll have it when youâre my boss at that new (inaudible) BuzzFeed. I hope this job interview went well.\n\nNayeema: Iâm curious, would you bring Ben Smith back to run? Would you, are you going to relaunch?\n\nVivek: Iâm not planning or volunteering to be a CEO of it, but letâs just play this out. Letâs say this is the kind of conversation â this is the kind of conversation I want to be having within a media company.\n\nNayeema: But these conversations happen, Vivek. I think thatâs the thing, Vivek. These kinds of conversations happen at media companies.\n\nVivek: I donât think that thatâs possible, Nayeema, in a context in which 99.5% of your employeesâ political contributions are going in a direction that 50% of your country disagrees with. And I think if youâre really premised on the true, open exchange of ideas, that just couldnât possibly be the case on the fact thatâ Iâm not saying it has to be 50%, but it is a joke. It is a farce. And I think it is no accident that the first paper the first publication to break the Steele dossier, that would have not happened if it was 99.5%, or 70%, even 50% in the other direction. I think there would be inherent checks and balances in creating cultural debate.\n\nBen: I do think you reallyâ\n\nVivek: The goal is to cross start from a blank slate and ask whatâs possible if youâre starting from first principles.\n\nBen: I mean, I think youâll have an interestingâ\n\nVivek: First principles should be an open exchange of ideas with actual diversity of thought.\n\nBen: I do think youâll...\n\nVivek: Which I think is missing in most media organizations, left and right, today.\n\nBen: I mean, I do think youâll have hopefully interesting conversations with Jonah Peretti about this, because itâs, the ideology of journalists is often, you know, demented in various ways, but rarely on a left-right spectrum. My own, in fact, in my own self criticism here, is this sort of radicalism about publishing the thing sometimes, you know, in any direction. But I do think that, I think I look forward to your digging in a little on this. When we said people who come out of politics often kind of project political motives, the way journalists often project political motives onto entrepreneurs. I think you see it all over the place, actually. And so, I look forward to the education of Vivek Ramaswamy on the inside of media businesses.\n\nNayeema: We should have a follow up.\n\nBen: This was really, this was really interesting.\n\nNayeema: We should genuinely have a follow up on this.\n\nBen: I think these things on the inside are often not what they look like from the outside. I mean, for better and for worse, for sure.\n\nVivek: If I could just finish in response to one of the points from that Nayeema made earlier, because I think itâs interesting. It goes, itâs important to me as a human being, but I think itâs also important to the essential fluid of our country, actually, is our country was built by pioneers and explorers who were actually Renaissance men that didnât fall into the pre-categorized lanes where youâre supposed to operate. Benjamin Franklin invented the lightning rod. He invented the Franklin stove. He invented a remedy for the common cold.\n\nNayeema: He was a satirist. Yeah, yeah.\n\nVivek: You got Thomas Jefferson, he invented the polygraph test, the swivel chair, he was 33 when he wrote the Declaration, you got guys like Livingston who were ambassadors to France while tinkering around creating the steamship with Robert Fulton. And itâs, I prefer to kind of close on at least a positive point here. Weâre talking about business building business or even rebuilding an industry in that, I think we would just all do better, myself included, but maybe if I may invite others who are willing to participate, to sort of take off those preconceived shackles not just on partisan politics...\n\nBen: Vivek, I think, on this note, I do think Iâm gonna run, Iâve always wanted to run for president. And I think thatâs what...\n\nVivek: From first principles, thatâs what our founders did. And if weâre rebuilding media, I think thereâs an opportunity to approach it with that spirit of the founders.\n\nNayeema: Three observations. By the way, I agree with you one should not necessarily, in their career, stay in a lane. I do also think that you had the same reaction that Bari had about the revolving door between...\n\nVivek: The corruption and politics, I agree with that.\n\nNayeema: And once youâre a practicing policymaker, and third, I do think Ben, you have a bright political future in front of you. If youâre not going back to BuzzFeed with Vivek, which is also, I think, an option.\n\nBen: I think Iâm gonna stay in my lane here. But thank you for coming on Vivek, we appreciate it.\n\nVivek: You donât have a lane Ben, youâre boundless, too, I believe in you.\n\nBen: I look forward to our conversation about being your vice presidential nominee.\n\nVivek: I respected your article in The Atlantic. I think the fact that you were able to, I donât agree with everything you even said in that article, but the fact that you could still go back and reflect and say, at least with the Steele dossier reporting, there are some things we could have done differently. I think itâs a good thing. And my advice to Jonah, I havenât spoken to him yet, but my advice would be, take a kernel of that humility and use that to advance your own self interest in building a brand. And if so, I think thatâs a big part of how we run BuzzFeed.\n\nBen: I would love to be a fly on the wall in that in that conversation, but I doubt you will invite me but thank you for, Thank you, thank you for taking the time.\n\nNayeema: Thank you, Vivek.\n\nVivek: Thanks, guys. Take care.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor media"

      "text": "Americana\n\nTHE SCENE\n\nLAS VEGAS â In a Planet Hollywood hotel ballroom, a few steps away from the Criss Angel Theater, around 200 Republican Party activists worked on their battle plans. The Republican National Committee would not save them. They would save themselves.\n\nâNo more culture of losing,â Turning Point USA CEO and co-founder Charlie Kirk told an audience of RNC members, GOP county chairs, and plugged-in activists. âEmbrace Donald Trump. Donât fight Donald Trump. Embrace what heâs brought to the party. Itâs a populist, people-centered movement, and this is what the oligarchs fear the most.â\n\nThe two-day Restoring National Confidence summit was built to tweak Ronna McDanielâs party committee, whose 168 members were about to meet in another hotel on the strip. Both meetings unfolded as the RNC released its weakest yearly fundraising numbers of McDanielâs tenure.\n\nTPUSA, with annual revenue not far off the RNCâs, had been building an alternative power base for years. It advocated non-stop ârelationalâ organizing, developing an app that its allies could use to find votes. It had identified low-propensity voters â âdisengaged voters,â as Arizona RNC member Tyler Bowyer called them â and put their information in binders for conference attendees. And it had built an influential media network, including Kirkâs show, which revels in the weekly churn of cultural battles that obsess the young, online right.\n\nOne host last week had expounded at length on the potential âpsyopâ of the Kansas City Chiefs making it to the Super Bowl and Taylor Swift endorsing Joe Biden â a topic that came up several times on stage in Las Vegas. Democrats, explained Bowyer and pundit Jack Posobiec, would use Swiftâs fame to engage those lower-propensity, low-information voters.\n\nThe same week, Kirk had caused his own uproar by lashing out about diversity efforts at airlines â âIâm sorry, if I see a Black pilot, Iâm going to be like boy I hope heâs qualified,â he said on his show â and posting at length about the criminal records of the Central Park Five , after one of them, the recently elected New York City Council Member Youssef Salem, was pulled over by police. Earlier in the month, heâd commemorated Martin Luther King Jr. Day by remarking upon the civil rights leaderâs âawfulâ personal life. The comments drove shocked media coverage â and, according to Kirk, getting no blowback âoutside of one donor.â\n\nDAVIDâS VIEW\n\nKirkâs group started as an effort to supercharge conservative outreach to young people. But the Vegas conference was a reminder of how vastly its kingmaking ambitions within the Republican party have grown. The fact that Kirk and Turning Pointâs stable of podcasters have become some of the MAGA movementâs premier podcasting shock jocks has, if anything, appeared to help that effort, building its credibility among the GOP base at a moment the RNC is shedding its own.\n\nOne year ago, Kirk and the more rebellious RNC members took a run at McDaniel and lost. The chair won a fourth term with 111 votes, to 54 for California RNC member Harmeet Dhillon and four for MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell. McDaniel, at the time, chided Kirk and Dhillon for âtrying to take over the RNC,â shortly after the GOP in Arizona â where Kirk lived, and where TPUSA had implemented its strategies to shape the party â had lost key races .\n\nDhillon is now representing Trump in his challenge to states that have cited the 14th Amendmentâs insurrection clause to block him from the ballot; Lindell was at Kirkâs summit, talking the crowd through his challenges to the 2020 election. TPUSA had remained resolutely pro-Trump as the RNC tried to run a neutral primary, and that was why it could be trusted, according to the luminaries on stage.\n\nâThe forces of the world are against him, including all the money and all the power in the Republican Party,â Steve Bannon told the crowd on Tuesday. âThatâs what the RNC has. Theyâve been harnessing the donor money to stop Trump. They should not get another penny.â\n\nAround two dozen RNC members stopped by the alternative summit, sitting in the front row for strategy sessions, chatting in the hallways about why theyâd given up on party leadership.\n\nâI would love for Ronna McDaniel to let us know that sheâs stepping down,â said Fanchon Blythe, an RNC committeewoman from Nebraska. âThe RNC is a bunch of fluff.â\n\nSome talk in the hallways speculated on when McDaniel might go and who should replace her. In training sessions, the question was bigger: How could Republican activists build a permanent infrastructure, one that always beat the left?\n\nKristina Karamo, the ousted MAGA chair of the Michigan GOP, met allies who wanted to help reverse her purge. Bannon hosted hours of his War Room podcast, passing the microphone to local party leaders who felt let down by HQ. Donald Trump Jr. thanked Kirk and the audience for being âthe tip of the spear,â fighting where too many people had conceded.\n\nâPeople want to know, what are we gonna do to save our country?â Karamo told Semafor. âWe canât let the internal conflict become the dominating factor â and then that becomes what we focus on instead of saving the country.â\n\nPlenty of Republicans see Karamoâs politics â and TPUSAâs â as the source of that conflict. She won her chairmanship after running and losing a 2022 race for secretary of state, which she never conceded ; sheâd won that nomination after working as a 2020 poll watcher and appearing across conservative media as an on-the-ground expert on the fraud she saw. She was ousted after complaints about the partyâs shrinking events and flatlining fundraising, with her opponents picking ex-Rep. Pete Hoekstra to replace her.\n\nThe problem for the official party apparatus, though, is that it canât reach the most disgruntled MAGA voters, who tend to view the world a lot like Karamo. TPUSA thinks it can. Even Hoekstra made a brief stop at their conference on his way to the RNC meeting.\n\nâType in âWisconsin conservatives.â A lot of election integrity groups exist on Telegram,â Turning Point Action enterprise director Brett Galaszewski said at one training session. âThese are prime crowds for recruiting.â\n\nOne of the newest RNC officials at the conference was Gina Swoboda, the new chair of the Arizona Republican Party, who won that role after Senate candidate Kari Lake released an audio recording of former chair Jeff DeWit telling her that âvery powerful peopleâ might offer her money to quit. DeWit, whoâd once called TPUSA âmore powerful than the RNC,â had handed his job to a Trump campaign alum whoâd spent years publishing voter rolls to find evidence of fraud\n\nâIâm wearing the armor of God,â Swoboda told Bannon during one of his conference livestreams. âI think that the reason that God made me my nerdy election self is for this time.â\n\nTHE VIEW FROM A SKEPTIC\n\nMarc McMain, the party chair of Walton County, Georgia, said that heâd come to the conference to learn best practices. He found some, but wasnât swayed by the talk about challenging the 2020 election. He confronted Jack Posobiec when he suggested that Gov. Brian Kemp, by not finding a way to reverse Trumpâs Georgia defeat, bore responsibility for the deaths of soldiers. And he was unmoved by presentations alleging 2020 election fraud by mathematician Doug Frank and Mike Lindell.\n\nâGod bless him, but thatâs not my wheelhouse,â McMain said. âI think there was nefarious activity in the election, but, you know, I just want to win the next race. I canât stand that faction of our party that wants to shoot within the tent.â\n\nROOM FOR DISAGREEMENT\n\nMcDanielâs RNC kept the press out of its winter meeting, but pushed back on the TPUSA storyline of a well-fed party elite that never did anything. The RNC tallied up 73 trainings across the country in 2023, with more 2,100 attendees; that included four trainings in D.C. that county chairs were invited to attend. The party said it offered help, to any GOP official who wanted it, on basically everything â handling press, turning out the vote, and advertising online. And if TPUSA was going to keep training poll watchers and contacting voters, the party had no problem.\n\nNOTABLE\n\nMinnesota . House Majority Whip Tom Emmer led calls for Rep. Ilhan Omar to resign, based on a misleading translation of remarks the Democrat made at a Jan. 27 celebration of a Somalian election result. After an official with the breakaway republic of Somililand posted the speech, with captions claiming that Omar had declared herself âSomalian first,â Emmer called it a âslap in the face,â Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called on her to be deported, and Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene introduced a resolution to censure her.\n\nThe Minnesota Reformer published a translation refuting the original claim; Omar had never said âSomalian first.â In a statement, Omar said she felt âembarrassedâ for Emmer, and her Democratic primary opponents were more cautious than the GOP. Don Samuels, who nearly defeated Omar in a 2022 primary, said in a statement that heâd âreview an independent translationâ before reacting.\n\nSchiff for Senate, âTwo Visions.â Mail ballots for Californiaâs all-party March 5 primary go out next week, and Rep. Adam Schiff is trying to nudge Republican Steve Garvey into the general election by attacking him as a MAGA Republican. Itâs a reliable tactic in the state, which has held âjungleâ primaries for 12 years â Gov. Gavin Newsom elevated a weak Republican rival in 2018, getting the easy November matchup he wanted, instead of a potentially competitive race against a fellow Democrat. Rep. Katie Porter, who is polling close to Garvey, immediately accused Schiff of âboxing out qualified Democratic women candidates.â\n\nSuozzi for Congress, âBorder.â The Republican ad buys in New Yorkâs 3rd Congressional District â formerly held by George Santos, thus the special election â have focused almost completely on illegal immigration. The toughest hit: a clip of Tom Suozzi, the Democrat who used to hold the seat, saying heâd âkicked out ICEâ as Nassau County executive. Suozziâs response runs back a 2018 Fox News interview in which he denounced the campaign to âabolish ICE,â embraced (and later abandoned) by Democrats like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nJoe Biden for President, âConfused.â As Nikki Haley campaigns against Donald Trump, Democrats are clipping every one of her attacks â especially the ones on Trumpâs mental acuity. Two of them make it into this digital spot (âI think heâs decliningâ), capped with Biden calling Trump âconfused.â Polling has shown Biden at a massive disadvantage when voters are asked which candidate is more mentally sharp, and Democrats want to narrow that.\n\nCNN has conducted just three head-to-head polls testing Trump against Biden, with Trump ahead each time , driven by Bidenâs low approval rating â just 38% here. This is the first CNN poll offering Haley as an option, and she runs stronger with every demographic than Trump. Republican voters simply donât believe it. Seventy-two percent of them say that the party has a âbetter chance of winning the presidencyâ if Trump is nominated, up from 51% when the primaries began. Just 43% of white voters with college degrees think a Trump alternative (meaning Haley) would run stronger than Trump.\n\nHaleyâs problem in her home state mirrors her basic problem in New Hampshire: Republicans who know both her and Trump prefer the former president. Since September, as the rest of Trumpâs competitors dropped out, his favorable rating among GOP voters has risen from 60% to 66%. Haleyâs has dropped from 59% to 45%, and 43% of primary voters say theyâd be âupsetâ or âdissatisfiedâ if she became the nominee; just 29% say that about Trump. Haley runs strongest with the sort of voters who backed her last week, taking 61% of non-Republicans, who can vote in this primary, so long as they donât show up for the Democratic primary tomorrow.\n\nWhite House. Wednesday was the deadline for last quarterâs FEC filings, a trove of data about the campaigns getting underway and the candidacies that had already collapsed. The highlights:\n\nJoe Biden and the Democrats. Over a miserable period for his campaign â nonstop stories about low poll numbers, the last-minute candidacy of Dean Phillips â Biden raised $33 million , as the DNC and its joint fundraising committee with the president raised another $64 million. Phillips raised just over a million dollars from donors, and put $4 million of his own money into the campaign, ending the year with just over $360,000 to spend. Marianne Williamson raised more ($3.4 million since the start of 2023), and loaned herself nearly $500,000, ending the year with just over $208,000. Biden and his campaign groups: $117 million.\n\nDonald Trump. He raised $19 million in the last three months of the year; all told, Trump campaign groups ended 2023 with around $70 million to spend. That was after more than $55 million went to legal fees, an unprecedented expense for a presidential candidate.\n\nRon DeSantis. His campaign and its super PAC allies raised a total of $154 million last year, with diminishing returns â and in the final quarter, diminishing revenue. From October through the end of 2023, his campaign raised just $3.7 million from individual donors, and he ended the year with $9.7 million to spend.\n\nDeSantisâs killer app was supposed to be his super PACs. Never Back Down started the campaign with a $82.5 million cash infusion from his 2022 re-election PAC, a chunk of the more than $200 million heâd raised in that race. The money simply wasnât there for the White House bid. Never Back Down raised $14.5 million between June and December, and by mid-December the DeSantis operation was directing donors to a new PAC, Fight Right, which raised $13.3 million in a hurry. Most of that â $9.6 million â was handed over from Never Back Down.\n\nNikki Haley. Her campaign and super PAC avoided every mistake made by the DeSantis operation. Haley for President hoarded cash while the super PAC, SFA Fund, went on the air in Iowa and New Hampshire. The result: Haleyâs campaign ended the year with $14.6 million left to spend, $5 million more than DeSantis. SFA Fund raised $67.3 million last year, $50.1 million of it in the last six months. Its mission was keeping Haley afloat until the race narrowed down, and it succeeded, with nearly all of that money flying out the door; the super PAC entered 2024 with just $3.6 million.\n\nCharlie Kirk had more to say about Turning Point USAâs ambitions, before and after its visit to RNC turf. During a break in the conference, he talked with Americana about his influence in the GOP, the extremists the group had distanced itself from, and why he believed his commentaries on race werenât hurting his goal of finding and mobilizing more non-white conservatives.\n\nAmericana: What do you want to come out of this conference?\n\nCharlie Kirk: Itâs mission critical, victory in November. Thatâs not a mystery, right? I was present in 2020, and there were a lot of assurances, a lot of promises, by the existing infrastructure that is largely not changed, from personnel to the philosophy and mechanics. And Iâm not going to sit idly by and let that happen again.\n\nWe were taken by surprise by 10 or 12 different attack vectors in 2020. And weâre told that everythingâs fine, with no evidence of that. After many, many attempts at trying to get their attention, that hasnât changed. Competition is the driver of excellence. Thatâs one of our belief systems here. So why not host what it should be with some of the attendees of the RNC meeting later this week? What we believe really makes or breaks our elections is county chairs. We think county chairs are some of the least appreciated, most important elements in a modern political apparatus.\n\nAmericana: How ready are people for the primary to be over?\n\nCharlie Kirk: The appetite for a continued primary, at this point, is very cloistered in wealthy circles. And not even all wealthy circles. I would say that the majority of donors I talk to want this primary over. It just makes you wonder why Nikki Haleyâs continuing to run. The sooner we wrap up this primary, the better; every dollar, every resource is precious, and this is an unnecessary kind of annoyance. I have no fear that sheâs going to gain all this traction in Texas or in Florida or in California where the delegate count is extraordinary. I do have a fear that it can unnecessarily extend and delay a healing process.\n\nIn politics, after primaries, time heals all wounds. It just does. Iâm friends with people and we used to hate each other. Every month is going to heal what some of the people on TV are saying. âOh, 20% or 30% of people wonât vote for Trump. Yeah, but if you end the primary effectively now, will they still feel that way in June? Probably not. And if 2016 is instructive, it shows that they do come home. In fact, you can crack 90-95% of registered Republicans to come home to the nominee.\n\nAmericana: Have the Trump and DeSantis people already come together?\n\nCharlie Kirk: I think that there was some initial acrimony out of the gate, now largely healed. I mean, Iâm sitting down with one of them â Steve Cortes, whoâs a friend of mine, he went over to DeSantis, but weâre having a meeting this week, and weâre all good. I donât even think about DeSantis anymore, and I mean, in the positive way. Like, that page is turned. Thatâs old news, honestly.\n\nAmericana: On the show, you talked about Speaker Johnson calling you to talk about the border deal. What are you mobilizing to stop that?\n\nCharlie Kirk: Well, first of all, I donât think we know whatâs in the border deal. How dare you criticize it? Weâre not going to show it to you! Itâs one of the weirdest political stories Iâve seen in quite some time. [Sen. James] Lankford goes on TV and says, itâs a great deal and Iâm not going to show it to you. Also, the people that are attacking it are awful. Then can we see the text?\n\nIâve been awfully critical of Speaker Johnson. To his credit, he called me and I thought he was really, really magnanimous to call me because Iâve been awfully spicy towards him. Most politicians will send their little janissaries after me or whatever, so I give him a lot of credit for that. Yes, I hope that the border deal collapses.\n\nAmericana: About the TPUSA ambassador network â how do you police extremists who want in? Weâve seen a few cases recently of people appearing as ambassadors, saying that Jews run everything.\n\nCharlie Kirk: Iâll say two things. One, weâre redoing the whole ambassador program. Weâre rethinking it, reimagining it, in structure and attitude and philosophy. But look â some single individual who says that all Jews are pedophiles? Yeah, thatâs not a tough call.\n\nSo, you love the truth. Iâll send you a piece of clip, back from the fall, before the October 7 stuff. Thereâs a guy that comes up with Dennis Prager on stage, and heâs a real anti-Semite. Turns out heâs like this neo-Nazi guy, and I basically told him, in so many words, get the hell out of the event. If you go back many years ago, Iâve had a spirited history with such forces.\n\nAmericana: Groypers showing up and making trouble because you support Israel.Charlie Kirk: I love Israel. I always have.\n\nAmericana: So whatâs the line? Youâre winning, someone wants to join the winning team, but they have this belief so theyâre out.\n\nCharlie Kirk: Itâs hard for me to give you a formula. Let me use the line that determined the pornography decision at the Supreme Court: You know once you see it.\n\nAmericana: TPUSA has done a lot to reach out to a diverse set of people â Black Americans, Hispanic Americans. You also, on the show, are dealing with topics that get condemned by the SPLC. Telling people you were lied to about George Floyd, you were lied to about MLK. How do you balance those topics with the outreach?\n\nCharlie Kirk: I donât think itâs an either/or. At least from our grassroots experience, from Blexit and others, we see coalitions strengthening and building. But honestly, itâs not much of a political calculus. I donât like to sit around and think: is this topic going to help or hurt? Iâd say itâs more of an instinct. The reaction I received from black voices who I really trust â Candace Owens, Pierre Wilson, Brandon Tatum and others â is that thereâs this mass reconsideration movement in Black America. Have the idols, the motifs, the themes that weâve been lifting up, been benefiting us? And I think theyâre willing to reconsider some of those things.\n\nAmericana: You were doing this fairly early , with Kanye West â not recent Kanye, but talking about all this with him after he started wearing a MAGA hat.\n\nCharlie Kirk: I donât know how sizable it is, but I will say completely anecdotally, that I have more people of color, that are enthusiastically supportive of the program and the show just from just like, hey, walking into restaurants. I donât know if thatâs macro true, or if itâs confirmation bias. I have no idea, but itâs way more noticeable than it used to be. We make compelling arguments, we pursue truth, and itâs worked so far.\n\nAmericana: Have you seen any kind of backlash?\n\nCharlie Kirk: Itâs the opposite. More people want to speak with us than ever before. The part that Iâm learning is that the audience has a broader scope and just a deeper curiosity than I think we always give them credit for. They might not always agree with it. They might not always like the take, but itâs interesting, and they might learn something. We saw that in the MLK segment. People were like, wow, thatâs interesting. I never knew that. Itâs been overwhelmingly positive. In any indicating metric that I would be concerned about, thereâs no backlash.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "Candace Owens' rapid rise defending two of America's most complicated men: Trump and Kanye\n\nIt's a Wednesday morning at Liberty University and the basketball arena is packed with nearly 10,000 people. Students reach their arms skyward, eyes closed, entranced in deafening Christian rock music.\n\nBackstage, administrators and students dote on Candace Owens, that day's convocation speaker, who has quickly built a career trashing liberal politics with a millennial fierceness. She hasn't rehearsed. It protects her authenticity. But she knows her beats.\n\nOnstage, she speaks for about 24 minutes, calmly gliding back and forth across the stage in heels, attacking some of her usual targets: Planned Parenthood , feminism, the welfare system.\n\nShe builds to the moment. Then, she goes for it.\n\n\"Kanye West. Man, he's a wonderful man,\" she says to applause and cheering - breaking the quiet of what had become a calm, attentive audience.\n\n\"What is it that President Donald Trump, Kanye West and Candace Owens have in common?\" she asks rhetorically. \"Kanye West describes it as 'dragon energy' and to me I think it's individualism. It's believing in yourself. It's standing up in the face of everybody telling you you can't.\"\n\nOwens embraces her role as the young black woman defending conservatism, attacking liberals and praising two of America's more complicated men.\n\nSince April when West tweeted, \"I love the way Candace Owens thinks,\" she has never been far behind the star, playing his chief defender as he lurched from one controversial headline to the next . She accompanied West to TMZ when he said slavery \"sounds like a choice\" and posted a photo of herself with West after his headline-making White House visit last week . People ask her to autograph West's CDs.\n\nOwens, 29, regularly appears on Fox News and travels six days a week to speak at college campuses. It's made her friendly with Trump and the first family, some of whom she's met for dinner.\n\nBut barely more than a year ago she was an unknown YouTuber.\n\nWhat changed her life was a video about the Charlottesville rally , wherein she blames the media for creating racial hysteria. That video prompted Fox News host Jesse Watters to invite her on the network for the first time late last year.\n\nFox News amplified Owens, who was then hired by Turning Point USA , an organization aimed at bringing conservative ideas to college campuses. Her Twitter following quickly grew to 108,000. West's tweet brought hundreds of thousands more, ballooning her audience to 850,000 today.\n\nThe president also took notice. Trump said Owens \"represents an ever expanding group of very smart 'thinkers.'\"\n\nHer rapid rise gives her a massive political voice for someone with such a brief career - or even interest - in politics. Owens says she has never voted. Not for Trump, or any other candidate, and only recently registered as a Republican, but previously identified as liberal.\n\n\"I had no interest in politics whatsoever prior to 2015,\" she said.\n\nOwens illustrates a political fact stamped and sealed by Trump: that strong voices can break through regardless of prior experience.\n\nOwens defends Trump's comments after Charlottesville : \"I still agree with him. There are morons on both sides.\" She doesn't believe in white privilege and often criticizes Black Lives Matter. Feminism, she claims, has become radicalized. Planned Parenthood is \"murdering\" people using abortion, which has slowed black population growth. The media causes dissent. And lately, amid Kavanaugh's ascension to the Supreme Court : \"I'm really passionate about defending men.\"\n\nShe's now preached politics to hundreds of thousands of students, said Turning Point founder Charlie Kirk. Her reach isn't contained to conservative havens like Liberty , where its president Jerry Falwell Jr. is an outspoken Trump supporter. Most recently Owens and Kirk spoke at the University of Colorado-Boulder, the University of Washington and the University of Georgia.\n\nAfter the speech at Liberty, Owens jumped off stage and was hounded by a group of students, black and white, seeking selfies. Security had to step in to control the crowd. On Twitter, the speech was mostly praised.\n\nBut outside the arena at a small protest, Liberty senior Abigail Ferris held up a pro-#MeToo sign . It's the day before Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, testified before a Senate committee. Owens often dismisses the #MeToo movement as a Democratic political ploy and called Ford a liar who should serve time in prison.\n\n\"We're not directly protesting her,\" Ferris said. \"But we are showing while she has made some disparaging remarks to the movement, that there are students on campus who respectfully disagree with her.\"\n\nMore than anything, Owens preaches against victimhood, particularly among African Americans, a pull-yourself-up-by-your bootstraps mindset.\n\n\"I consider myself insanely privileged to be in this country,\" she said. \"I try to tell people how much value there is in seeing yourself as privileged ... because if you see yourself as a victim, you'll have that shade over your eyes in life and you're not going to accomplish much.\"\n\nShe bolsters her message with an intriguing personal story, one that starts in poverty, involves a traumatic episode of racism and an I've-seen-the-dark-side political awakening. She sees it as the perfect antidote to liberal attacks on Republicans over race.\n\nOwens grew up in Stamford, Connecticut, the middle child of three girls. Her father was a property manager and her mother an executive assistant. Even as a toddler, Owens didn't back down in a debate, her dad Robert Owens Jr., said.\n\nThe family grew up in poverty, she claims, living in a small apartment before moving into the home of her grandfather, who laid tobacco out to dry on a sharecropping farm at age 5 and faced the Ku Klux Klan .\n\n\"He is a man's man,\" Owens said. \"That masculinity is now being taught as toxic, when in reality it's the one thing that grounded me as a child.\"\n\nIn 2007, Owens' senior year at Stamford High School, came an experience that shaped her personally - and eventually politically.\n\nFour boys called her from a blocked number and left voicemails with racial epithets and threats of violence.\n\n\"They were calling me the N-word, they were saying they were going to put a bullet into the back of my head as they had done to Martin Luther King. They were calling me Rosa Parks. They were telling me that they were going to tar and feather my family,\" she told the Liberty crowd.\n\nThe episode became enflamed because one of the boys was the son of then-Stamford Mayor Dannel Malloy, the current Democratic governor of Connecticut. Owens, then 17, faced threats and harassment in school for weeks afterward, according to a lawsuit her father filed against the Stamford Board of Education. Robert Owens, in his filing, said the school district failed to protect his daughter from the harassment. The school board later settled with the family for $37,500, according to a settlement agreement provided by the board.\n\nThe Stamford Police Department said documents related to the case were sealed because those involved were minors and a spokesman would not confirm the outcome. But the Danbury News Times reported police arrested at least one student.\n\nOwens was out of school for weeks because of the incident, which drew the attention of the NAACP, which defended her in the media. But Owens felt like a public relations pawn.\n\n\"I would come out of school and they would be outside with cameras and speaking, and I would stand there,\" she said. \"It was really awful because then it sort of gave people that fire of like, 'she's doing this for attention.'\"\n\nThe incident, Owens said, set in motion years of anorexia, which lasted through college and into her working years.\n\n\"It was really just a manifestation of trying to control something in your life,\" she said.\n\nToday, she complains about the media framing her as the victim.\n\n\"What it taught me was how little value there was in victimhood,\" she said. \"Now, according to the left, that should have been the best moment of my life.\"\n\nIn 2016, she wrote an op-ed in the Stamford Advocate defending the boys, which hints at what has become her candid speaking style.\n\n\"I'll be the first to say I am sorry,\" she wrote, \"To all of them, having to endure that experience; a group of children dissected and labeled.\"\n\nYears later, Owens chalks up the voicemails to poor decision-making, not racism.\n\n\"They were labeled these racists, and I never felt that they were racists,\" she said. \"I felt that they were people who did something that was really stupid.\"\n\nShe said some of the boys have since thanked her.\n\n\"People should be allowed to evolve,\" she said.\n\nAfter high school, Owens enrolled at the University of Rhode Island to study journalism, but dropped out in 2010 because she said her loan was declined. She then moved to New York City, and found steady work at a private equity firm, where she worked for four and a half years, starting off as an assistant and working her way up to the vice president of administration.\n\nIn 2014, she started the website Degree 180, a now-defunct lifestyle blog.\n\n\"I wanted to find my voice,\" she said.\n\nThe website sometimes touched on politics - one contributor wrote the idea of a Trump presidency \"makes my skin crawl.\" But Owens, listed as the founder and CEO, wrote mostly about relationships and sometimes sex. She did say in October 2015 that she welcomed the end of the Republican tea party movement and their \"crazy antics.\"\n\nIn April 2016 Owens started fundraising for another venture, an anti-cyberbullying website named Social Autopsy - the rapid downfall of which would embolden her political views and distrust of the media.\n\nSocial Autopsy aimed to connect people's social media comments to their places of employment as a way to hold people accountable. But to targets of GamerGate, an online harassment campaign led by video gamers , it sounded like \"doxxing,\" the term for exposing someone's personal information online . Owens denies this was the intent.\n\nWhen Social Autopsy launched a $75,000 Kickstarter campaign, it drew criticism in blogs and a lengthy piece in New York Magazine . Kickstarter suspended the project after two days, arguing the \"project's plan to 'dox' people were in violation of our rules.\"\n\nSocial Autopsy's coverage in the media made Owens a conservative overnight, she told Dave Rubin on his YouTube show \"The Rubin Report\" last year. To USA TODAY, she describes her political switch as the result of a perfect storm driven by an intense distaste for the media and Trump's rise.\n\n\"There's this guy who I used to watch on reality TV who's running for president of the United States and he says they're fake news,\" she said. \"It was happening to me at the same time.\"\n\nThe incident drew her to conservative outlets she'd formerly cast off as fringe, like Breitbart.com .\n\nShe also started exploring the writings of black conservatives, such as Thomas Sowell , a senior fellow at Stanford University'sHoover Institution. Like Owens, Sowell has alleged liberal attempts to stifle free speech on college campuses. He slammed the \"liberal media\" in a column for the conservative National Review in late 2016 regarding Trump's picks for top White House positions.\n\n\"They would be worried about anyone who has not been brainwashed in the political correctness that reigns among the intelligentsia,\" he wrote.\n\nOut of her self-immersion in conservative  media and black conservatism came a new outlook, which Owens describes like a calling.\n\n\"I want to make a difference,\" she said. \"I want people t know my story so that they know that it can be their story, that they're in control of their own destiny.\"\n\nTo do that, she'd use a 21st Century technique to push the ideas of Sowell and others to a social media crowd.\n\n\"I said, 'How can I bring that message that they're saying so brilliantly to a wider audience?\" she said. \"'Oh, I'm like a millennial. I can do a YouTube channel. I'm hilarious.'\"\n\nOwens began making a series of YouTube videos in July 2017. Her first post features her \"coming out\" as a conservative to her parents, who are aghast at the news. All characters are played by Owens. In her most watched video, with 1.6 million views, she mocks a list of demands Black Lives Matter made of white people.\n\nThe videos kickstarted a new career as a conservative commentator, earning her airtime on Fox and, eventually, West's attention. When he tweeted about her in April, she reacted like a fan, not the collaborator she is now.\n\n\"Please take a meeting with me,\" she tweeted to West just minutes later. \"I tell every single person that everything that I have been inspired to do, was written in your music.\"\n\nDays later she appeared with West on TMZ, when he made his remarks about slavery. West drew widespread condemnation for his comments - including from other celebrities, like Stevie Wonder and Kobe Bryant - and later apologized .\n\nBut former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, another black Republican, defended him .\n\n\"People ought to be able to express their views,\" she said. \"Not all of us have to think politically the same way. I've said to people sometimes, 'You know, I've been black all my life. You don't have to tell me how to be black.'\"\n\nNot long after TMZ, Owens visited Trump at the White House.\n\nOwens doesn't think she's treated differently in conservative media because of her race, but does suggest there is a \"sense of relief\" with her in the fold.\n\n\"I think there's a draw. I think there's a validation,\" Owens said. \"Imagine being a Republican and for years and years you try to say something and you get called a racist.\"\n\nBut Tasha Philpot, a professor of government at the University of Texas at Austin, said Owens and West draw more attention because they're unique.\n\n\"They're novel and so they can get media attention and coverage in ways that black Democrats can't,\" Philpot said. \"The idea that there is this special person, this aberration, exception to the rule, does certainly get you a platform that you wouldn't have otherwise.\"\n\nAn exception because Trump's approval rating among African Americans lags at 10 percent, according to a most-recent Gallup poll . Just 8 percent of African Americans voted for Trump in 2016, which is slightly higher than Republican presidential contenders John McCain and Mitt Romney when they took on former President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012; but slightly lower than former Republican President George W. Bush's outcomes with African Americans in 2000 and 2004, according to Cornell University's Roper Center for Public Opinion Research .\n\n\"There's nothing particularly appealing, especially in this highly racialized political environment that would draw blacks over to the Republican Party,\" Philpot said.\n\nTrump often touts black unemployment, which has reached lows . Although, as The Associated Press has reported , economists have argued the success is not Trump's doing but the result of years of economic recovery started years ago. The White House also distributed false statistics saying Trump has created more jobs for African Americans than Obama, something for which the White House later apologized .\n\n\"At this point, wearing a MAGA hat is a proxy for not being authentically black,\" Philpot said.\n\nOwens has her share of black critics. Black Lives Matter protesters have heckled her speeches. The news website The Root, which focuses on African American issues, often takes aim at her.\n\n\"Either they are delusional or they earned their Ph.D.s from the history, sociology and political science departments at the University of the Sunken Place,\" wrote Michael Harriot in The Root , referring to Owens and West while referencing the hypnotic abyss from the film \"Get Out.\"\n\nIt's the comments from other African Americans that bother her father, Robert Owens.\n\n\"What really makes me upset are the comments she gets from her own race,\" said Owens, a registered Independent who did not vote for Trump or Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\n\"We as African Americans need to stop believing that we can only vote Democrat,\" said Owens, whose daughter predicted a black exodus from the Democratic party on Fox News. \"We need to stop using slurs against those that choose to vote Republican because, in my opinion, there are good people on both sides.\"\n\nPhilpot says black Republicans are different from black conservatives. Many African Americans identify as conservatives, which she ties to the importance of religion in black community. But, she says, not all of those black conservatives vote Republican.\n\n\"Usually (black Republicans) tend to have lower levels of group consciousness,\" Philpot said. \"They define their conservatism not just in terms of being anti-government or reduced social spending but also in terms of blacks not relying on the government to get ahead.\"\n\nOwens insists she's not trying to convince people to become Republicans, but rather show them not to \"blindly\" trust in the media. She also comes out swinging against white progressives.\n\n\"Black people have become for white liberals like the puppy that they rescued from the pound,\" she said. \"White people that want to scream so much on behalf of black people that you can't even hear what black people have to say. If a black conservative says, 'No, thank you,' they lose their minds because they've built their sense of worth on being the righteous white person.\"\n\nOwens' abrupt shift from liberal to conservative confounds some. Her critics often point to some anti-Trump posts on Degree180 to counter what she says on television.\n\n\"You wonder why did she flip her perspective,\" said Nikki Usher, a professor of media at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champagne. \"Is it because she is somebody who genuinely has re-thought her ideological commitments or is this like a really good way to feed your ego and put yourself out there and establish a career?\"\n\nUsher suggests that a number of conservative pundits - Diamond and Silk , the black conservative duo popular on Facebook, as well as InfoWars' Alex Jones and the website's editor Paul Joseph Watson, whom Owens calls an \"amazing friend and a true supporter\" of hers - have found their way into the mainstream in a way \"that didn't really exist before the internet.\"\n\nNow people pay attention when someone is \"taking very alternative positions that then gain attraction in the digital space and then cannot be ignored by sort of the more mainstream right-leaning sites,\" Usher said.\n\nOwens bats down suggestions she has ulterior motives.\n\n\"It's just something that I believe in, and I love what I do,\" she said.\n\nOwens' story of political conversion is part of her pitch. Such stories have appealed to people for generations and been used by famous leaders like Ronald Reagan, Hillary Clinton and Malcolm X , said Don Waisanen an associate professor of communication at Baruch College-CUNY who wrote a book about political conversions.\n\n\"This is one of the most convincing arguments you can make in politics,\" he said.\n\nWaisanen said most conversions go from liberal to conservative. He argues it resonates better with a crowd accustomed to religious redemption narratives.\n\n\"It's a way of kind of arguing in a religious way without the overt religious overtones that you are going from one paradigm to the other,\" he said. \"That form of 'I once was lost but now am found, was blind but now I see,' it's still maintained in these narratives.\"\n\nWhatever the draw, Owens now boasts a bigger profile than her boss.\n\n\"No one in the modern era of American politics has accomplished such a meteoric rise in the cultural and political world,\" said Kirk, the Turning Point founder. \"Commentating on the news and doing punditry is a very small piece of Candace Owens. She is a movement leader.\"\n\nFor now, Owens won't pinpoint a future. She's planning to launch a podcast that touches on culture and politics, but says \"there's no destiny.\"\n\nShe doesn't plan on running for public office as long as she's satisfied with the country's leadership.\n\n\"If I wanted to be the president, I would win,\" she said \"I hope we don't need Candace for president. I hope it just is that America keeps on this trajectory and just that these social battles can die down. They're a little insane.\"\n\nFollow Sean Rossman on Twitter: @SeanRossman\n\nOpinion: Voting is a basic right but they didn't guarantee it in the Constitution\n\nKavanaugh accusers: Trump says those who made 'false statements' about Kavanaugh 'should be held liable'"

      "text": "Vivek Ramaswamy was on a podcast during the Iowa Republican debate. Here's what happened:\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa - Vivek Ramaswamy said at least three armed security guards are needed in each school in the country after a gunman killed a sixth-grade r and injured several staff members and students last week at Perry High School.\n\nPodcaster Tim Pool and conservative commentator Candace Owens joined Ramaswamy for a live podcast at his campaign's Des Moines headquarters after he failed to qualify for CNN's Republican primary debate at Drake University. He was asked the question on armed security guards late into the episode .\n\n\"I don't think one is sufficient, that's just a logistical point,\" Ramaswamy said. \"Some schools that are really large might benefit from four or five.\"\n\nLast week, Ramaswamy sold $33 million worth of shares in his biotech company Roivant Sciences to continue funding his presidential campaign, according to Bloomberg News. A few dozen people attended the taping Wednesday night.\n\nHere are the biggest takeaways from the podcast.\n\nRamaswamy was in Perry on the morning of Jan. 4 when a student at the high school killed Ahmir Jolliff, 11, and wounded several staff members and teachers. An event he had planned was altered to become more of a community gathering about prayer and open discussion than politics, Ramaswamy said.\n\nRamaswamy described the national reaction to the shooting as \"numb.\"\n\n\"It's really a tragedy what happened in Perry, Iowa,\" Ramaswamy said. \"We saw a bunch of ambulances, helicopters, we knew something was going on.\"\n\nRamaswamy has held more than 355 events in Iowa over the last year. He visited every one of Iowa's 99 counties at least twice and visited many counties three or more times, according to his campaign. And he moved his campaign headquarters to Des Moines.\n\nBut the work has yet to show in polling. In order to qualify for CNN's debate, candidates must have needed to receive at least 10% i n three separate national or Iowa polls of Republican caucusgoers or primary voters.\n\nIn December's Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom Iowa Poll , 5% of potential caucusgoers said Ramaswamy was their first choice. That was up 1% from Iowa polls conducted in October and November. But it remained well behind Trump, who led with the support of 51% of respondents in the December poll. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was at 19% and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, 16%.\n\nDespite failing to make the debate stage, Ramaswamy says he believes he will win the Iowa Caucuses on Jan. 15.\n\n\"I think we're going to deliver a major surprise here in Iowa,\" Ramaswamy said. \"I think we're going to shock the system and the vibes on the ground are very good.\"\n\nHe says many of his supporters are first-time caucusgoers or from under-represented groups who rarely caucus and who he can motivate to show up Monday night.\n\nEarly in the podcast, Pool and Ramaswamy repeated the false assertion that the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol was a an \"inside job,\" despite there being no evidence to support their claim. Federal prosecutors have charged more than 1,000 people with participating in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, and arrests continue.\n\n\"It appears to be an inside job, but we don't know the full extent of what happened,\" Ramaswamy said.\n\nRamaswamy said he would pardon many Jan. 6 defendants who he said were pressured into pleading guilty.\n\n\"Anybody who was peaceful and did not physically assault somebody that day will get a Day 1 pardon from me,\" Ramaswamy said. \"Anybody else who had their constitutional rights denied during that process will also in addition get a pardon.\"\n\nOnce again Ramaswamy called to end birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants, which he said could deter some people from trying to illegally enter the country.\n\nThe New York Times reported in November that 800,000 people applied for asylum in the U.S., a 63% increase over the number of applications filed the previous year. In fiscal year 2022 there were 2.3 million border apprehensions, the highest number of illegal border crossings since at least 1960 when the federal government began keeping that data, according to the New York Times.\n\nRamaswamy called the recent surge in the number of people trying to seek asylum by legal means, \"an organized invasion of people into our country.\"\n\nPool asked Ramaswamy if he would accept a spot on Trump's ticket as his running mate. Ramaswamy said Trump has his \"full support\" and in turn he expects Trump's \"full support\" but declined to say if he would accept a nomination to vice president.\n\nRamaswamy has repeatedly said he is running only for president and is not focused on a vice president ticket. His \"America First\" movement is bigger than Ramaswamy or one candidate, he said.\n\n\"I don't think we get to that place,\" Ramaswamy said.\n\nDuring the podcast, Ramaswamy said he was frustrated CNN ended its December town hall with him five minutes early in order to fact-check his repeated claims that the Jan. 6 attack was an \"inside job.\"\n\nDuring the CNN debate in Iowa, Ramaswamy ran an ad on CNN in every Iowa market which told viewers to turn off the debate. The ad doubled down on Ramaswamy's previous false statements about the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and Hunter Biden.\n\n\"Turn this s--- off,\" Ramaswamy said in the ad.\n\nBefore the debate Ramaswamy doubled down on his feud with CNN in a social media post , calling the network the \"Crap News Network.\"\n\nPhilip Joens covers retail, real estate and RAGBRAI for the Des Moines Register.

      "text": "Candace Owens fumes at Rep. Ted Lieu's use of her Hitler comments\n\nWASHINGTON - Rep. Ted Lieu was not happy that his Republican colleagues on the House Judiciary Committee invited conservative commentator Candace Owens to speak at a hearing on the rise in hate crimes and white nationalism.\n\nTo explain why, the California Democrat pulled out his smartphone and played a clip of Owens making some controversial comments about Adolf Hitler.\n\n\"In congressional hearings, the minority party gets to select its own witnesses. And of all the people Republicans could have selected, they picked Candace Owens,\" Lieu said during the Tuesday hearing.\n\n\"I don't know Ms. Owens. I'm not going to characterize her. I'm going to let her own words do the talking,\" he said.\n\nIn the clip, Owens, the communications director for Turning Point USA, explains that she thinks the word \"nationalism\" has been \"poisoned\" by \"elitists that actually want globalism\" and who conflate the word with Hitler's Nazi agenda.\n\n\"You know, he was a National Socialist, but if Hitler just wanted to make Germany great and have things run well, okay fine,\" she said. \"The problem is he had dreams outside of Germany. He wanted to globalize. He wanted everybody to be German.\"\n\nLieu did not ask Owens to respond, but rather asked another panel member, Eileen Hershenov from the Anti-Defamation League, \"When people try to legitimize Adolph Hitler, does that feed into white nationalist ideology?\"\n\n\"It does, Mr. Lieu,\" Hershenov replied. \"I know that Ms. Owens distanced herself from those comments later but we expressed great concern over the original comments.\"\n\nIn February, Owens had tried to clarify her comments, which had then gone viral. She explained that she considered Hitler \"a homicidal, psychotic maniac\" and that her point was that he was not a nationalist. But she added, \"I stand by my statements. And that is that.\"\n\n\"I think it's pretty apparent that Mr. Lieu believes that black people are stupid and will not pursue the full clip in its entirety,\" Owens said Tuesday when she did get a chance to respond. \"He purposely presented an extracted clip.\"\n\nHer response prompted a rebuke from Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., who mistakenly thought she had called Lieu \"stupid.\"\n\n\"I didn't refer to him as stupid, that's not what I said. That's not what I said at all. You didn't listen to what I said,\" Owen said, prompting a shrug from Nadler.\n\nOwens then continued, saying Lieu was \"trying to present as if I was launching a defense of Hitler in Germany when, in fact,\" she was trying to say that Hitler should not be characterized as a nationalist.\n\n\"A nationalist would not kill their own people,\" she said.\n\nShe said Lieu was trying to \"create a narrative\" and that it was \"similar to what they do to Donald Trump.\""

      "text": "Candace Owens' Latest Crusade: Exonerating Harvey Weinstein\n\nManage your account\n\nCandace Owens, the far-right commentator and YouTuber who in recent months has juiced her already sizable online following by zealously defending Justin Baldoni in his It Ends With Us legal battle with Blake Lively, revealed in a Feb. 27 livestream that her next project will be attempting to exonerate Harvey Weinstein in the court of public opinion ahead of his April 15 retrial in New York on rape charges.\n\nShe explained she's been talking with the imprisoned producer by telephone since early 2022, recording interviews since his second conviction in Los Angeles, also for rape and other sexual misconduct. Her takeaway: While he's \"an immoral man,\" he's also a victim of the justice system. Owens, a longtime and persistent critic of the #MeToo movement, of which the Weinstein saga served as the watershed, noted that \"I've always had faith in our court system and now that's beginning to change. Now I'm beginning to wonder if our courtrooms have been politicized.\"\n\nMore from The Hollywood Reporter\n\nHarvey Weinstein Responds to Adrien Brody Mentioning His Kids in Oscars Speech\n\nHarvey Weinstein Sues Bob Weinstein On Fraud, Financial Conspiracy Claims\n\nHarvey Weinstein Pushes for Earlier Trial: \"I Need to Get Out of This Hell Hole\"\n\nIn 2024, the New York state Court of Appeals overturned Weinstein's conviction from four years earlier, citing improper rulings by the trial judge that had prejudiced him as a defendant. The appeals court noted in its ruling that women had been allowed to testify about allegations that weren't part of the case.\n\nOwens, who in the same livestream derided Endeavor head Ari Emanuel's support for Blake Lively in the Baldoni matter and continued to highlight revelations pertaining to late child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, has a history of what the Anti-Defamation League has called \" vicious antisemitism ,\" which led to her departure from Ben Shapiro's conservative media outfit The Daily Wire last year. On her livestream, she explained that during their introductory call, Weinstein asked her about her support of antisemite Kanye West and noted he'd been a financial supporter of the ADL. \"I suddenly felt like I was trying out for the cheerleading team,\" recalled Owens, who last year promoted her belief that Brigitte Macron, France's first lady, was born a man.\n\nWeinstein's spokesman, Juda Engelmayer, tells The Hollywood Reporter in a statement: \"Since 2017, when the allegations against Mr. Weinstein first emerged, nearly every mainstream and alternative media outlet has seized opportunities to amplify grievances against him. Whenever potentially exculpatory information arose, it was often ignored. However, when new allegations surfaced, they were met with sensationalized headlines.\"\n\nEngelmayer added, \"Ms. Owens' intent is to contribute to the ongoing discourse by presenting some of that additional information that, to date, media have not felt need enough to share with the public. Mr. Weinstein hopes for a truly objective examination of his cases - one that fairly considers his accusers, the prevailing narratives, and crucial facts that have frequently been overlooked in the rush to report since this ordeal began.\"\n\nOwens' own communications representative has circulated a memo underscoring that the series Harvey Speaks , set to debut later this week, will also critique the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalism about Weinstein's misconduct published by The New Yorker 's Ronan Farrow and The New York Times ' Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, as well as delve into \"how businessmen used #MeToo to try to steal Harvey's and other men's businesses.\" Owens, who declined to speak with THR about the project, promised on her eponymous show that \"it will explode the world.\"\n\nIn statements to THR , attorneys for some of Weinstein's more than 80 accusers downplayed the value of the Owens-Weinstein effort, emphasizing that the producer has repeatedly opted not to testify under oath in his defense. \"I think that what really matters at this point is the evidence that will be admitted in his next criminal trial,\" said Gloria Allred. \"My guess is that the only evidence that may be 'explosive' would be his testimony if Mr. Weinstein decided to testify under oath and subjected himself to cross examination by the prosecution. Given that he has not taken the witness stand in his last two criminal trials in New York and California, I am doubtful that he will choose to testify this time.\"\n\nLawyer Dave Ring represented the Los Angeles trial's Jane Doe 1. (She went public in a THR profile following his rape conviction as Evgeniya Chernyshova.) He agrees with Allred: \"Mr. Weinstein chose to not take the witness stand on his own behalf,\" he said, adding: \"This [collaboration] is yet another ploy by Mr. Weinstein's public relations machine to try and change public opinion about him and his sordid past.\"\n\nLouise Godbold, who has accused Weinstein of misconduct and is now the executive director of Echo, a nonprofit that provides trauma education, says of the Owens project, \"I would ask people to please ignore it. I don't want to listen to it. I don't want to react to it. Candace Owens is not my source of information of choice. When these perpetrators clamor for attention via these more obscure media outlets, it's providing very effective PR. They know it will get picked up by more mainstream outlets, which can then publish without needing to do the fact-checking they would for an original piece. We know what the perpetrators are up to. If we can't ignore it, let's expose the strategy. Let's be intelligent. This is an age-old tactic, and in this age of disinformation we've got to get smarter and not get duped into clanging our bells on demand.\"\n\nRebecca Keegan contributed to this reporting.\n\nBest of The Hollywood Reporter\n\nMost Anticipated Concert Tours of 2025: Billie Eilish, Kendrick Lamar & SZA, Sabrina Carpenter and More\n\nHollywood's Highest-Profile Harris Endorsements: Taylor Swift, George Clooney, Bruce Springsteen and More\n\nMost Anticipated Concert Tours of 2024: Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny, Olivia Rodrigo and More\n\nSign up for THR's Newsletter .

However, some of the content was \"plagiarized from various far-right manifestos and publications, including Terrorgram Collective [a white supremacist group] and a manifesto by Matthew Harris,\" as per The Algemeiner.\n\nCandace Owens responded to her name being included in the writings on X/Twitter in a lengthy post, calling the manifesto \"an obvious troll.\" She also stated that it was \"truly sickening that people would use the death of a young 16-year-old girl to try to quickly score political points, rather than to responsibly make sure that what they are sharing is accurate.\"\n\nTRIGGER WARNING: This article contains extreme, hateful language.\n\nNashville's Antioch High School shooter allegedly wrote in his manifesto that Candace Owens inspired his actions.\n\nNew information has been revealed regarding the alleged gunman on Wednesday (Jan. 22), with News Channel 5 Nashville reporting that the Metro Nashville Police Department have identified the shooter as Solomon Henderson.\n\nThe 17-year-old Black student is accused of shooting and killing Josselin Corea Escalante, 16, and injuring other students before committing suicide in the school's cafeteria. Henderson's manifesto showcases the gear he used in the attack, including a handgun, a lock pick, and a blueprint of the school's layout.\n\nSolomon gushed about Owens' right-wing concepts and conspiracy theories in the writings, asserting that \"Candance Owens influenced me above all each time she spoke. \" However, the political commentator wasn't the only one named on his list of \"people who radicalized [him] the most.\" Solomon also listed content creators and pundits including Ethan Ralph, Nick Fuentes, Turkey Tom, Ruben Sim, Mr. Beast, Hasan Parker, CobsonTalks, iDubbz, Wayne Lambright, Destiny, and Kanye West-whom he solely credited for teaching him \" violence and extremism. \"\n\n\"To expand on this,\" Henderson wrote after listing his group of influences. \"I was stunned by [Candace Owens'] insights and her own views. [Owens] helped further and further into the belief of violence over the Jewish question along Turkey Tom and Ruben Sim pushing me to the alt-right pipeline.\"\n\nSolomon Henderson also swore off his Blackness in the manifesto, declaring that he \"was ashamed to be Black,\" while devoting himself to Hitler's cause of pushing the Aryan race. Feelings of disillusionment and fear littered the literary sketches, with multiple references to suicide or extreme violence against himself, women, Hispanics, and Black people.\n\n\"I was so miserable. I wanted to kill myself. I just couldn't take anymore. I am a worthless subhuman, a living breathing disgrace. All my (in real life) friends outgrew me act like they didn't f**king know me.

      "text": "The Shocking Reemergence of Candace Owens\n\nManage your account\n\nMY FIRST CLUE THAT SOMETHING WAS AFOOT was at a dinner party in early February when my left-leaning, normie girlfriend proclaimed-seemingly out of nowhere-that Justin Baldoni had been framed.\n\nAt a time when most Americans had not yet heard the word DOGE, tens of millions were tuning in daily to debate the minutiae of a high-profile sexual harassment case filed by megastar Blake Lively against Baldoni, her director and costar on It Ends With Us .\n\nNot so long ago, the default would have been to empathize with, if not straight up support Lively, who appeared to be the latest in a long line of actresses blowing the whistle on troubling on-set behavior. Instead, my friend whipped out her phone to play reel after reel of TikTok videos of women defending Baldoni and railing against Lively and her über-famous husband, Ryan Reynolds. Three reels in, a familiar name flashed across the screen.\n\n\"What's Candace Owens doing narrating this case?\" I asked.\n\n\"You know Candace Owens?\" my friend replied, with the bewilderment of someone who just discovered their mom knows what an NFT is.\n\nI did indeed. Owens's career path reads like a right-wing Mad Lib. The one consistency is her continuing commandeering of the spotlight through spectacle and controversy. She first became prominent as a college dropout who won a racial harassment settlement against her high school, then launched a blog where writers opined about Donald Trump's penis size and founded an organization to confront cyberbullying . After being doxxed-allegedly by progressives-she did a political 180, founding #RedPillBlack and the Blexit Foundation to encourage African Americans to abandon the Democratic party.\n\nShare\n\n\"Discovered\" by alt-right luminaries Milo Yiannopoulos and Mike Cernovich during the first Trump administration, Owens skyrocketed through roles at Turning Point USA and the Daily Wire between appearances on InfoWars. She attended Paris Fashion Week, palled around with Kanye West, and even received accolades from President Trump, who called her a \"very smart thinker\" for her defense of neo-Nazis in Charlottesville.\n\nBut even the right has limits, and Owens found them. She was fired from the Daily Wire in March 2024 for peddling the blood libel and Holocaust denial , among other antisemitic conspiracy theories. She leapt into the crossfire between Jordan Peterson and neo-Nazi Nick Fuentes, with the latter praising her for waging a \"full-fledged war against the Jews.\"\n\nBanished to the right-wing wilderness, Owens relaunched her solo YouTube show three months later. Early numbers were solid but not impressive; she hit a low point in views and subscribers after the 2024 election as she was casting about for new scandals.\n\nThen came the Baldoni case.\n\nDemocracy, Congress, policy and . . . Blake Lively, The Bulwark has you covered. Become a free or paid subscriber today:\n\nAfter flicking at the controversy for close to a week, Owens posted her first video weighing in on the Baldoni/Lively drama on January 8. By that point, millions of consumers of celebrity gossip had already been voraciously consuming every morsel of information they could find on the case since it debuted in the pages of the New York Times shortly before Christmas. Owens slid right into the zeitgeist, with nothing distinguishing her from the hundreds of other hot-take artists and celeb watchers flooding TikTok and Instagram.\n\nPerhaps because of her own opinions, or perhaps sensing the movement of the crowd-or maybe both-Owens established herself as a Lively skeptic. She also proved that she was a savvy social-media star. Splicing funny clips in with scathing commentary, she pounced on new legal filings, broke \" news \" from juicy sources, and found \"clues\" in clips from Reynolds's new blockbuster movie, Deadpool & Wolverine , in which Lively had a cameo. Other posters breathlessly discussed these coveted \"Easter eggs,\" magnifying Owens's visibility to a larger, apolitical audience.\n\nTo the new viewers flocking to her channel, Owens sounded like a credible, even insightful narrator. She speaks with confidence and self-assurance. She allied herself with an online cadre of Lively loathers dating back to the star's days on Gossip Girl . She declared Lively a \"mean girl\" and a \" brat ,\" repeatedly condemning her \" modern feminism .\" She sneered at white, wealthy women who, she argued, needed to manufacture hardships for women because they've never really experienced them. Her story's assumed premise was that real feminists work hard, don't have stuff handed to them, and prioritize truth over sophomoric allegiances. Real feminists, that is, look a little something like Owens herself.\n\nAs the case wore on, Owens went even further. She portrayed Lively as a backstabber of other women and Reynolds as a controlling husband driven to destroy Baldoni because of jealousy. They became symbols of anti-feminism in this pervasive narrative.\n\nJoin now\n\nAfter posting a dozen videos on the case, Owens announced she had surpassed 4 million subscribers to her channel for the first time ever. She added nearly 400,000 new subscribers just in the month of February 2025. Standup comedian Whitney Cummings noticed: \"Did not see this coming,\" she said to open a TikTok . \"That Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds would be the people that united this country. . . . The most liberal people I know are now obsessively following Candace Owens for her take and journalism on the situation.\"\n\nSoon, established influencers like \" Steph with da deets \" and the mega-popular DeuxMoi -known for hawking lip plumper and dishing on celebrity couplings, not spreading political invective-were citing Owens as a source on the Baldoni story. Her significance grew to such an extent that she was named-alongside Perez Hilton - as one of the content creators Lively sought to bar from case information. This is the celebrity gossip equivalent of making the FBI's Most Wanted list.\n\nShare The Bulwark\n\nHOW COULD IT COME TO BE that someone too toxic for the Daily Wire had not only reinvented herself as an influential culture commentator in such a short time, but had risen to preeminence in her new role?\n\nOwens's appeal rests in her young, hip, and glamorous aesthetic. She bridged what many assumed to be an impassable divide-merging the trad-wife trend with the girl-boss ethos. Viewers saw something both authoritative and aspirational: a successful career, a hot husband, and three adorable kids with a fourth on the way. Removed from politics, she was more acceptable-and, arguably, more influential: She is shaping the viewpoints of millions of people who may just now be engaging in the MeToo debates for the first time.\n\nDefenders of what Owens would deride as \"modern feminism\" noticed that she and others were doing real damage as public opinion shifted against Lively, which coincided with the start of a new administration hellbent on extinguishing the #MeToo movement. But Owens's narrative has proven durable in spite of pushback. A recent Glamour story offered a look at the \"mommy sleuths\" behind the campaign against Lively. The piece only made people angrier. Content creators lashed back , accusing the reporter of using \"mom\" as a derogatory term and delegitimizing their experiences in the world of journalism and the entertainment industry. Popular sports podcaster Dave Neal did a segment repudiating the article's attempt to paint all Lively skeptics as right-wing plants. (One of his commenters wrote, \"Omg I'm a Democrat a mom of boys, and I don't appreciate lies to destroy a man's life Blake.\") Reddit threads proliferated criticizing the perceived condescension from white feminists in their coverage of the case.\n\nShare\n\nFor Owens, this has undoubtedly been a triumph: Not only has this campaign given oxygen to her career but it has also served to advance a larger ideological project she's been working on since before Justin Baldoni became a household name.\n\nOwens was an outspoken early critic of the #MeToo movement. She launched her 2019 PragerU show with an interview about #MeToo with Roseanne Barr during which she claimed that the closest thing to white supremacy she had seen in her lifetime was the \"radical feminist movement.\" She and Barr agreed that women, and mothers, would have to be the ones to take down #MeToo.\n\nDespite her noxious views, Owens is tuning in to a real shift in public opinion on these matters. Voters-many of them women and moms-have started to worry about a failure to define due process in sexual harassment cases. Democrats failed to address the skepticism head on. Instead, they appeared to retreat from the movement it once championed. That left a wide-open lane for political opportunists like Candace Owens and her more mainstream counterpart, Megyn Kelly , to roll in, get a handle on the debate, and pull it squarely toward the anti-feminism side.\n\nThis has all been compounded by the fact that a generation of young women who feel politics has failed them and that humanity is doomed are losing themselves in the permanent escape of pop culture and celebrity gossip. The characters are familiar and the storylines offer simplicity in a complicated new world. These younger women are connecting with Candace Owens.\n\nOne TikTok at a time, she has spoken their language and promised that they can be like her, look like her, have it all-but first, they should think like her. By the time they get to her more radical views, they have already bought in. The only question now is whether we're witnessing a political realignment or just the world's most bizarre passing episode of celebrity courtroom drama.\n\nTake a second to share this article on social media or send it to a friend:\n\nShare"

      "text": "Candace Owens: 'The stupid MeToo movement allows women to completely ruin a man's life'\n\nManage your account\n\nKeeping up with Candace Owens is not easy. In the course of an hour on Zoom with the American podcaster, provocateur and scourge of all things liberal, she covers the following things: her (unsubstantiated) belief that France's first lady Brigitte Macron is secretly a man, her vaccine scepticism (she once called the Covid-19 jab \"pure evil\"), her longstanding status as an \"enemy\" of the MeToo movement, and the ongoing publicity war between Hollywood stars Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni (Owens is vehemently team Baldoni).\n\nThe dubious claims come so fast, it's reminiscent of Steve Bannon's advice to \"flood the zone\" in order to control the narrative. Even more disconcerting, Owens is far from your stereotypical conspiracist.\n\nOwens, 35, is charming: Barbie-doll pretty, with a perfectly sleek bob and an easy, infectious smile. \"I'm quite peaceful in terms of my life,\" she says, from her home in Nashville, where she lives with her British husband George Farmer (son of Conservative peer Lord Michael Farmer). The couple met through conservative advocacy group Turning Point USA in 2018, and married the year after at Trump Winery. They now have two sons and a daughter. In January, she confirmed that she was pregnant with their fourth child.\n\nBut her personal brand is built around provocation, and it's worked well for her: she counts 3.72 million subscribers on YouTube while her podcast Candace is often in Spotify's top five. She first exploded into public view in 2016 as an associate of the anti-feminist 'Gamergate' movement, her celebrity fuelled by the rarity value of being black and conservative. Though she was initially agnostic on Trump, she wrote in 2020 that he offered a \"call to action for anyone who dared to abandon the status quo in favour of real change.\" Her rise over the last nine years (or some might say radicalisation) has been dramatic.\n\nIn 2021, she joined conservative news site the Daily Wire; three years later, she departed after falling out with the site's co-founder Ben Shapiro over remarks characterised as anti-Semitic. These included attacking \"political Jews\" as \"some of the most vile, dishonest, manipulative people that I have ever met\". Owens says that any outrage about this and similar comments is down to \"things that are taken completely out of context\", although having heard them in context on her podcast, they do not become less shocking.\n\nNonetheless, she's well aware that she skirts acceptability, and in the content-creation world, that makes you vulnerable: if YouTube decides to ban her, she will lose her entire audience and income from that channel. Hence her newest project: Club Candace, her own independent website and membership scheme.\n\nWith a soft lilac colour scheme and a book club alongside \"too hot for YouTube\" episodes of Owens's podcast, you can see that Club Candace has Gen Z women in its sights. Merchandise includes a water bottle that's a dupe for the viral Stanley Cup, bearing Owens's catchphrase \"everything is fake and gay\". (She says this is a callback to the 1990s, which she calls the \"golden decade when you make fun of each other and everyone was OK with it.\")\n\n\"It's the way a lot of podcasters are thinking now,\" she says. \"Which is: how can I create my own platform so that I don't have to be subjected to the whims of Silicon Valley?\" Subscriptions start from $9.99 a month, with a $16.99 all-access tier, although she isn't currently releasing user numbers.\n\nClub Candace is very much a cottage industry. Her husband is the CEO, and she describes him as both \"head of compliance and head of engineering\", running the backend of the site and making sure she doesn't overstep too much at the front (until 2023, he was CEO of the Right-wing social media site Parler, which was shut down after being accused of coordinating the 2021 attacks on the Capitol). She also works with a lawyer on what she describes as a \"friendly basis\", but says she largely trusts her own judgement: \"I've been in this long enough that I know where you have to cushion something and say 'allegedly'.\"\n\nOverlook the wording, and the branding unavoidably recalls a black female media entrepreneur from a previous generation. So, is Candace Owens the alt-Right Oprah? She laughs at the label, but doesn't refuse it. \"The old Oprah was very daring - she had on witch doctors and people who said they were taken out of satanic cults. A lot of that was sanitised, and she lost her edge. So if there could be an Oprah comparison, I would hope that it would be early Oprah, who was speaking about topics that were off limits.\"\n\nIt's fair to say that the Oprah of today is unlikely to share Owens's current preoccupations. The first book she plans to read with her club is Chaos, a revisiting of the Manson murders that suggests (though doesn't substantiate) CIA involvement. She has also earmarked The Secret Founding of America, which claims that Freemasonry had a decisive influence in the origins of the USA. She likes books that offer the experience of \"getting ripped into a new reality\", she says.\n\nAnother title on the schedule will be her own, yet-to-be published second book, which she says will be about \"modern feminism\". Considering she tells me that MeToo is a \"fundamentally stupid\" movement that allows women to \"completely ruin a man's life on the basis of an allegation\", it's unlikely to be a positive take on the sisterhood. In a recent podcast, she claimed that Harvey Weinstein had \"a trial by the media and not a trial in the courtroom\", despite the fact that the former movie producer has been convicted in court of multiple sexual offences (some of these verdicts were overturned on appeal last year, but a conviction in LA for rape still stands).\n\n\"Women lie, men lie, everybody lies,\" she says - although across her output, it's the alleged lies of women that animate her most. She puts this down to the fact that, as a mother of boys, \"my skin is really in the game here.\" Right now, she describes herself as in \"full mommy mode\", but she eschews the \"trad wife\" label - partly because she's protective of her family's privacy but also, you suspect, because her business hustle is so much a part of who she is, she's very reluctant to hide her light under a floral pinny.\n\nOwens's vehement rejection of anything she sees as weakness is, by definition, unwelcoming to women who've experienced sexual harassment or violence. But it's also easy to see the appeal of this bootstraps attitude. Owens's promise is that, if you're tough enough, bad things won't happen to you. It's similar to her message on race: her 2020 New York Times bestseller Blackout, urged black Americans to turn away from the Democrat party and the politics of \"victimhood\". In 2022, at the peak of Black Lives Matter, Owens appeared at Paris fashion week alongside rapper and fellow liberal-baiter Kanye West, both dressed in \"white lives matter\" T-shirts. The reaction was widespread denunciation of her for \"internalised racism\".\n\nShe and West remain friends, and she recently visited him in Tokyo, where he now lives. One of the sources of friction between her and Shapiro was her loyalty to West, even after he tweeted that he was declaring \"death con 3 on Jewish people\". She won't pass judgement on West's frequent public displays of his wife Bianca Censori naked in public.\n\n\"You should never feel forced to say something about a person that is in your life,\" she says. Perhaps relevant here is the fact that last year her father-in-law Lord Farmer, who is also deputy chair of the Council for Christians and Jews, made a statement repudiating \"public comments from a high-profile member of my family\".\n\nBut Owens dismisses the idea that she's paid a personal cost for her career as an agitator, even after her ousting from the Daily Wire. \"The way things went down last year, was it nastier than I expected? Yeah. But I'm glad it happened, because I think the universe responded on my behalf.\"\n\nWhat's even more remarkable about Owens's current profile is that she first made headlines as a student, when she was the victim of a racism scandal at her high school. In 2007, a group of male fellow students left threatening and racist messages on her mobile phone: her family sued the local education board under anti-discrimination law and won a $37,000 settlement the next year.\n\nAfter an internship at Vogue followed by a stint in private equity, she next appeared in the news in 2015, as an anti-bullying advocate fundraising for a website called Social Autopsy. Had Social Autopsy taken off, it would have become a searchable database of trolling and abuse connected to the identity of the poster - a far cry from the anti-censorship, anti-cancel culture, \"everything is fake and gay\" Owens we now know.\n\nBut Social Autopsy also marks the origin of Owens's pitch to the Right. The site was roundly considered to be a bad idea, but Owens became convinced that the attacks on her in the media were being secretly orchestrated by feminist campaigners (there is no evidence of any such conspiracy).\n\nYou could see this as her first experience of being \"ripped into a new reality\", and it's one she's grateful for. \"I'm very glad it happened because I very quickly understood that the media had the capacity to lie,\" she says now. \"It made me, I guess you could say, more receptive when Donald Trump, who I would have never voted for, came down the escalator and started calling people fake news. I was like, no, they do lie. They just did it to me.\"\n\nShe's excited for the second Trump administration, which she sees as \"moving towards the middle. Everyone's getting a little less extreme.\" (On the day we're speaking, Trump is in the midst of his tariff war; the next day, he issues an executive order to begin the elimination of the department of education. So much for getting less extreme.)\n\n\"I don't know if I'm being overly optimistic, but I feel better about the political world today because I feel better about people's relationship with the media.\" The old arbiters of journalism have lost their power, she says: \"I'm still media enemy number one, but it feels like I've won against the media.\" With Club Candace, she aims to take it one further and become the media herself: does reality have a chance of keeping up?\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

      "text": "Conservative US influencer Candace Owens is barred from New Zealand weeks after a ban from Australia\n\nManage your account\n\nWELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) - The U.S. conservative political commentor Candace Owens was refused a visa to enter New Zealand for a speaking engagement because she had been banned from another country, immigration officials said Thursday.\n\nNews of the ruling came weeks after neighboring Australia also rejected her visa request, citing remarks in which she denied Nazi medical experimentation on Jews in concentration camps during World War II.\n\nOwens is scheduled to speak at a series of events in several Australian cities and in Auckland, New Zealand, in February and March next year. Tickets remain on sale and there is no acknowledgement on the promoter's website that she has been refused entry to both countries.\n\nThe commentator, who has more than 3 million followers on YouTube, is accused by her detractors of promoting conspiracy theories and antisemitism and has ignited firestorms with her remarks opposing Black Lives Matter, feminism, vaccines and immigration.\n\nIn March, Owens said she had parted ways with the Daily Wire, on which she had hosted an online talk show since 2021 , after clashes with its founders over her remarks about Jews and her opposition to U.S. military support for Israel. She was widely criticized for comments in a YouTube video in July that minimized the Holocaust.\n\nOwens had promised Australian and New Zealand audiences a discussion of free speech and her Christian faith when she announced the speaking tour in August.\n\nBut Australian officials banned her from the country in October, with Immigration Minister Tony Burke telling reporters Owens \"has the capacity to incite discord in almost every direction,\" citing her remarks about the Holocaust and about Muslims.\n\n\"Australia's national interest is best served when Candace Owens is somewhere else,\" Burke said. Australian Jewish groups had urged officials to bar her from the country.\n\nNew Zealand officials did not refer to Owens' political views in a statement on Thursday.\n\nShe was refused an entertainer's work permit for New Zealand on the ground that visas legally cannot be granted to those who have been excluded from another country, said Jock Gilray, a spokesperson for the immigration agency.\n\nOwens and the Australia-based promoter, Rocksman, did not immediately respond to requests for comment."

In latest news, Owens has officially been banned from her second country...and the reasons behind it shouldn't come as a surprise\n\nOn Nov. 19, it was announced that Owens' visa request to enter New Zealand was denied, according to USA Today . This comes just weeks after the right-wing firebrand was banned from entering the neighboring country of Australia.\n\nOwens was reportedly scheduled to speak in many cities across New Zealand and Australia in February and March. According to AP News , tickets for these events are still on sale.\n\nThe controversial speaker has made her name spewing MAGA-forward rhetoric and amplifying dangerous conspiracy theories over the years. Owens has more than 3 million subscribers on YouTube and over 11 million collective followers on X and Instagram.\n\nAustralia first moved to ban the 35-year-old commentator in October because of her continuous Holocaust denial and divisive conspiracy theories, which were spurred by the ongoing Isreal-Hamas conflict in Gaza, according to the Guardian . After banning Owens, Immigration Minister Tony Burke said \"Australia's national interest is best served when Candace Owens is somewhere else.\"\n\nThe snowball quickly began rolling downhill, and it didn't take long for New Zealand to notice the Australian ban and begin evaluating the potential threat Owens posed to their own country.\n\nImmigration New Zealand (INZ) deputy chief operating officer Jeannie Melville told the New Zealand Herald , \"All visa applicants must meet specific requirements, including a good character assessment that considers factors such as criminal convictions, deportation history, and potential risks to New Zealand's security, public order, or public interest.\"\n\nAnd with Owens' antisemitic ways and her name interestingly being cited in the New Zealand Christchurch mosque shooter's manifesto - where 50 people were murdered after Brenton Tarrant entered two mosques in 2019, according to NBC News - it's no surprise Owens has been denied entry.\n\nJock Gilray, a spokesperson for New Zealand's immigration agency, told AP News that Owens was denied an entertainer's work permit because visas legally cannot be granted to those who have been banned from another country. Giventhat, more countries could also deny Owens entry in the future.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook , Twitter and Instagram ."

      "text": "LA Times owner mulls MAGA-friendly digital news outlet featuring Candace Owens, Scott Jennings: report\n\nManage your account\n\nThe billionaire owner of the Los Angeles Times is reportedly in the process of launching a new MAGA-leaning digital news service that will feature controversial commentator Candace Owens and pro-Trump CNN pundit Scott Jennings.\n\nDr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, the biopharmaceutical mogul who bought the venerable newspaper in 2018, has been working with Republican strategist Eric Beach on a new media venture tentatively called LAT Next, according to the Status newsletter.\n\nSoon-Shiong, who has demanded the Times pivot away from its left-wing bent , sparked a newsroom revolt after killing the editorial board's endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris weeks before the Nov. 5 election.\n\nUnlike the Times, LAT Next appears to be a digital-first platform that will feature personalities catering to a conservative audience, Status' Oliver Darcy reported on Wednesday.\n\nOwens has been involved in multiple controversies, particularly regarding her comments on Israel and Jews.\n\nMost recently, she parted ways with The Daily Wire after making remarks that were widely condemned as antisemitic, escalating her public feud with co-founder Ben Shapiro over the Israel-Palestinian conflict.\n\nDespite sharing part of the Times' branding, LAT Next is reportedly a separate entity, though the specifics of its relationship with the newspaper remain unclear.\n\nHints of the new venture have surfaced on social media.\n\nLast week, Soon-Shiong revealed that the conservative Jennings, who has gotten into heated debates with left-leaning pundits on CNN, would be involved in the project. Jennings was also named to the LA Times editorial board after several members quit following the spiked endorsement.\n\nAdditional names being floated include Ana Kasparian, a progressive commentator who has expressed criticism of certain left-wing policies.\n\nSoon-Shiong's plans for a pro-Trump entity is said to be causing angst among staffers at the Times - particularly in light of management's recent buyout offer for anyone who has worked at the paper for more than two years.\n\nThe Post has sought comment from Soon-Shiong, the Times, Owens, Beach, Kasparian and Jennings.\n\nDetails about LAT Next's programming remain sparse, but sources suggest that video content will be a major focus, according to Status.\n\nOne of the key attractions is rumored to be a talk show modeled after \"The View,\" with Beach actively recruiting co-hosts.\n\nRob Schneider, the Trump-backing \"Saturday Night Live\" alum, had previously pitched Soon-Shiong on a conservative talk show that would model \"The View.\"\n\nSchneider discussed the idea in December at the newspaper's El Segundo offices alongside Cheryl Hines, who is married to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , Trump's nominee for Health and Human Services, according to Status.\n\nThe venture's connection to the Times is causing unease among its journalists, who fear that resources may be diverted from the newspaper to support Soon-Shiong's latest initiative, the outlet reported.\n\nConcerns about the newspaper's direction were already mounting before the emergence of LAT Next.\n\nIn late December, Soon-Shiong held a virtual meeting with members of the Times' opinion section after staffers expressed concern over his apparent interference in editorial decisions.\n\nAccording to sources, Soon-Shiong dominated the conversation, criticizing the opinion team for being too liberal.\n\nThe meeting, described as tense and unproductive, left staffers feeling demoralized.\n\nA little over a month later, management announced voluntary buyouts as the publication continued to lose money.\n\nThe extent of potential job losses remains uncertain, but the inclusion of relatively new hires in the buyout offer suggests significant reductions could be on the horizon.\n\nMeanwhile, Soon-Shiong continues to exert influence over the newspaper's opinion section.\n\nHe has reportedly directed three left-leaning columnists - Robin Abcarian, Jackie Calmes, and LZ Granderson - to scale back their contributions from two articles per week to one.\n\nThis decision has fueled speculation that the opinion section is being strategically reshaped to align with a more conservative perspective.\n\nA recent profile in The Free Press described Soon-Shiong as having taken \"the red pill,\" a term associated with a right-ward political awakening.\n\nIn the article, he expressed regret over his past support for progressive causes and criticized the Times for what he described as a culture of bias.\n\nHis remarks, which included accusations that some reporters disguise opinions as facts, infuriated staff members, according to Status.\n\nEmployees who had recently dedicated extensive efforts to covering wildfires in California were particularly frustrated that instead of acknowledging their hard work, their employer chose to publicly disparage them, the newsletter reported."

I'm asking you seriously because when I think of Native American tribes talking about their spirits, I know that they used to smoke a lot. They used to do drugs.

This is just what I see happening, and it's terrifying.\"\n\nUkraine has a mixed record on LGBTQ+ rights. While same-sex sexual relations are legal and employment discrimination based on sexual and gender identity is banned in the country, there are no housing protections or recognition of nonbinary or transgender identities. Russia is currently cracking down on its LGBTQ+ citizens with gay bars being raided by police in recent months."

Owens started a show, \"Candace,\" with the Daily Wire in 2021 and had guests including Donald Trump, former Vice President Mike Pence and Steve Bannon. Daily Wire cut ties with Owen earlier this year after Owens had publicly sparred with Ben Shapiro, Daily Wire's co-founder, about the Israel-Hamas war. Shapiro, an Orthodox Jew, has staunchly supported Israel during the war, while Owens has regularly criticized Israel over the growing number of Palestinian deaths. She also lashed out against \"political Jews\" and said they fueled antisemitism, and she has supported conspiracy theories that \"secret Jewish gangs\" have been behind \"horrific acts\" in Hollywood. The tension between the two escalated after Shapiro criticized Owens for her \"faux sophistication\" on the conflict and said \"her behavior during this has been disgraceful, without a doubt.\" After leaving the Daily Wire, Owens took her show back to YouTube , where she has more than 3 million subscribers, and she posts weekly videos in which she comments on the current political climate.\n\nOwens received criticism in July after she said in an episode of her YouTube show that \"some of the stories [of Nazis experimenting on captives] sound completely absurd.\" She specifically said reports that Nazis \"cut a human up and sewed them back together\"-which Holocaust historians believe Dr. Josef Mengele performed on twins at Auschwitz-sounded \"like bizarre propaganda.\" Owens was also criticized in 2019 for defending some actions of Adolf Hilter in the name of nationalism.\n\nIn 2018, Kanye West voiced support for Owens, saying in a since-deleted tweet he loved \"the way Candace Owens thinks,\" which sparked a friendship between the two.

      "text": "Did Candace Owens Suggest Invading Australia To 'Free' People From Covid-19 Precautions?\n\nBy Bruce Y. Lee\n\nBy Bruce Y. Lee ,\n\nSenior Contributor.\n\nBoth Candace Owens and Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas and not Australia) have called Australia's handling ... More of Covid-19 as \"tyranny.\" Yet, here is what Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia, looked like in September. (Photo by James D. Morgan/Getty Images)\n\nYou'd think that \"invade Australia\" wouldn't be high on the list of things for the U.S. military to do. After all, while vegemite can be bad, it's not that bad. Yet, on her Daily Wire TV show entitled Candace , political commentator Candace Owens actually asked, \"When do we deploy troops to Australia? When do we invade Australia and free an oppressed people who are suffering under a totalitarian regime? When do we spend trillions of dollars to spread democracy in Australia?\"\n\nIt's not as if someone's found weapons of mass destruction in Australia unless you consider Chris Hemsworth's biceps to be within that category. No, as you can see in the following clip from the Candace episode, Owens was somehow equating Australia's Covid-19 precautions to a totalitarian regime:\n\nYes, Owens was using the word '\"oppression' to describe public health measures aimed at preventing suffering and saving lives. Throughout much of the pandemic, Australia has pursued a \"Covid zero\" policy, which has meant trying to keep the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths as close to zero as possible. They've done this through closing borders, extensive testing, contact tracing whenever a case is identified in order to quickly find and quarantine any possible contacts, and stay-at-home orders when the number of cases have exceeded certain thresholds. They've certainly been more aggressive than the U.S., which has in effect had a \"Covid 44 million\" policy. As of October 22, Australia has had a total of 151,943 confirmed Covid-19 cases with 1,590 deaths compared to 44,940,696 and 726,846 for the U.S. Yes, the U.S. has had about 726 times the number of deaths despite having a population only about 12 times the population of Australia.\n\nAfter her \"invade Australia\" and \"when do we deploy\" rant, Owens then said in a lower, quieter voice, \"Of course, I ask that in jest because we all know the real answer,\" without clarifying what exactly she was \"in jesting\" about. Next, Owens steadily raised her voice back up again, suggested that the virus was not that dangerous, and declared, \"What is happening in Australia under the guise of this virus is federal overreach.\"\n\nShe didn't stop there. Owens went on to use two \"T\" words. No, not \"tinkle\" and \"toilet.\" Instead, she labeled what's happening in Australia as, \"Tyranny. Totalitarianism. The kind that gives birth to evil dictatorships and human atrocity.\"\n\nThen she started to name drop: \"We are watching a replay of the early ambitions of Josef Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Fidel Castro, Hugo Chavez. That is what's hiding behind the guise of this fictitious, perpetual need to slow the spread.\"\n\nWhoa. Those aren't names that you casually drop into any conversation. For example, you don't just say, \"the other day, you were behaving a little like Stalin, Hitler, Castro, and Chavez when you ate that pecan pie that I had saved.\"\n\nPeople enjoy outdoor dining along Sturt Street on September 10, 2021 in Ballarat, Australia. (Photo ... More by Darrian Traynor/Getty Images)\n\nIn case you are wondering about the way things are run Down Under, Australia has actually ranked higher than the U.S. on the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index , qualifying as a \"full democracy\" as opposed to the U.S. being closer to a \"flawed democracy.\" Moreover, Australia's six federated states (New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, and Western Australia) and ten federal territories have been independently deciding how to handle the pandemic. They've simply come up with similar policies because that's what science has suggested.\n\nIronically, Owens suggested invading Australia (whether in jest or not) when most states in Australia have already been easing Covid-19 precautions as Covid-19 vaccination rates have moved above target thresholds. Even though Australia began rolling out vaccines significantly later than the U.S., they have already exceeded the U.S.'s vaccination rates. Over 72% of the currently eligible population (those 16 years and older) have already been fully vaccinated, according to the Sydney Morning Herald Covid-19 vaccine tracker .\n\nSo on the one hand, fewer restriction may make it easier to invade Australia. In November, Australia will be re-opening their international borders for Australian citizens and permanent residents, as Colin Packham and Jamie Freed reported for Reuters . More open borders could make it easier for U.S. troops to invade, although they may have to put \"invade Australia\" on their landing cards as one of my Australian friends has suggested. Plus, it can be tough to get tanks and other artillery through customs.\n\nOn the other hand, U.S. troops may be too late to \"free\" Australians as the Aussies have been progressively \"freeing themselves.\" It might be awkward for the U.S. troops to have to ask Australians to go into lockdown just so that they can be freed. Moreover, troops would have to convince Australians that they are indeed being oppressed. According to 2021 Lowry Institute Poll , 95% of Australian adults felt that Australia has handled Covid-19 \"very well\" or \"fairly well\" so far. They were very favorable about Taiwan's handling of the pandemic as well. By contrast, 0% of Australians polled said that the United States has handled Covid-19 very well. In fact, 92% indicated that the U.S. has handled the pandemic very or fairly badly.\n\nAfter getting subsequent pushback for her \"invade Australia\" comment, Owens asserted on Twitter that she had used the qualifier \"in jest,\" albeit in a quieter voice. But again she didn't clarify what exactly she meant \"in jest\" and what she may have really meant \"outside jest.\"\n\nThis wasn't the first time that Owens has gone down under to make some political points. Back on October 7, she had tweeted the following:\n\nYeah, sending troops into a country completely unprovoked could lead to World War 3. Calling measures to protect against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) a war on the people is a bit like labelling waxing sessions as carpet bombing people.\n\nAs you can see from the above and below, Owens got responses from folks who said that they, you know, actually live in Australia:\n\nIf you want to hear about what's actually going down Down Under, it's a good idea to talk to a bunch of actual Australians rather than a political commentator from the U.S. who is talking about Australians.\n\nOwens hasn't been the only politically-oriented person to claim that Australians needed saving. On October 13, Senator Ted Crux (R-Texas and not Australia) tweeted out the following about the Australia: \"The Covid tyranny of their current government is disgraceful & sad. Individual liberty matters. I stand with the people of #Australia.\"\n\nThis prompted the following tweet response from Michael Gunner, chief minister of Australia's Northern Territory:\n\nAs you can see, Gunner pointed out the nearly 70,000 deaths from Coivid-19 in Texas so far. This seemed to suggest that Cruz should be paying more attention to his own state rather than pointing fingers at somewhere else.\n\nMeanwhile, Mark Bailey, a member of the Queensland Parliament, had a similar \"'umm what about Texas\" Twitter response to Cruz:\n\nIt's highly unlikely that the U.S. military will heed Owens' advice \"jest yet.\" And Australia is probably more worried about a SARS-CoV-2 invasion right now. They have been taking the science-based steps of keeping the virus under control and minimizing suffering and deaths until enough of the population is fully vaccinated. They have been easing Covid-19 restrictions and will be re-opening their international borders soon. The main question is whether vaccination rates are high enough already to keep spread of the Covid-19 coronavirus under control and to make most of the infections mild and not severe.\n\nNext year, 2022, will be a big year for Australia and its Parliament, with all 151 seats in the House of Representatives, and 40 of the 76 seats in the Senate up for election. This will decide the fate of current Prime Minister Scott Morrison. During the last election in 2019, over 91% of eligible Australians voted , compared to the 66.8% of eligible Americans who voted in the 2020 Presidential elections . So in theory, the Australian government will represent what the Australian population wants, because that's what democracies are supposed to do."

More the Israel-Hamas war. (Photo by Jason Kempin/Getty Images)\n\nThe beef between the two pundits unfolded this week after Shapiro, a forceful supporter of Israel, was filmed calling Owens \"disgraceful\" for her \"faux sophistication\" on the conflict.\n\nConservatives have previously criticized Owens for her statements, including a post on X in which she said \"no government anywhere has a right to commit a genocide,\" though she clarified she did not mention Israel or any other country.\n\nOwens posted a series of Bible verses Wednesday, including that \"you cannot serve both God and money.\"\n\nShapiro responded in a post liked 26,000 times, telling her that if \"taking money from The Daily Wire somehow comes between you and God, by all means quit.\"\n\nMinutes later, Owens, accused Shapiro of \"acting unprofessional and emotionally unhinged for weeks now,\" and called him \"utterly out of line for suggesting that I cannot quote biblical scripture,\" garnering more than 50,000 likes on both posts.\n\nOwens also appeared on the latest episode of Tucker Carlson's show, which premiered on Wednesday, where she called Shapiro's comments \"ad-hominem attacks\" that she couldn't respond to \"on a level of intellect.\"\n\nOwens previously rushed to her friend Kanye West's defense after he made a widely criticized post in October 2022 stating he would \"go death con 3 on Jewish people.\" Owens stated , \"if you are an honest person, you did not think this tweet was antisemitic.\" She posted on the right-wing social media outlet Parler that anyone comparing West to Adolf Hitler \"should no longer be taken seriously.\" Owens has her own history of making comments that appear to support Hitler. When asked about globalism and nationalism at a panel in December 2018, Owens affirmed her support for nationalism and condemned how Americans link nationalism with Hitler, stating : \"If Hitler just wanted to make Germany great and have things run well, okay, fine. The problem is that he wanted, he had dreams outside of Germany. He wanted to globalize.\" Owens defended her comments following criticism but clarified she was making a distinction between Hitler and nationalism, adding he was a \"homicidal, psychotic maniac\" and a \"mass murderer.\"\n\nOther prominent conservative media personalities have weighed in on the feud, including pundit Charlie Kirk, who said he is \"genuinely confused why asking questions and quoting Bible verses about peace warrants a call to resign\" and urged more room for disagreement. \"The Blaze\" host Lauren Chen defended Owens in a response to Shapiro's post, stating Owens has been \"perfectly respectful and consistent in her commentary,\" which Chen considers \"anti-war and America First.\" Conservative pundit Dave Rubin, however, criticized Owens as being \"bizarrely silent about the Hamas atrocities\" and questioned some of her posts directed at Shapiro, stating Shapiro had never said she cannot quote scripture.\n\nOwens said on Carlson's show she and Shapiro have repeatedly disagreed on a number of issues, including the Covid-19 vaccine and the Ukraine-Russia war, but no disagreements between the two have previously risen to the level of a public spat. Owens, previously known for her outspoken pro-Donald Trump activism, joined The Daily Wire in 2021, six years after Shapiro and Jeremy Boreing co-founded the media organization.\n\nCandace Owens Spills the Beans on Her Beef With Ben Shapiro (The Daily Beast)\n\nCandace Owens and Kanye West's provocative friendship, explained (The Washington Post)"

      "text": "Disability Rights Advocates Speak Out Against Candace Owens' Harmful Comments On Disability Representation\n\nBy Keely Cat-Wells\n\nBy Keely Cat-Wells ,\n\nFormer Contributor.\n\nIn a recent episode of her podcast, Candace Owens, a conservative political commentator with a Youtube subscriber count of 1.4 million, expressed her views on disability representation in fashion campaigns. However, her remarks have generated a wave of outrage from members of the disabled community and their allies.\n\nOwens' remarks around the SKIMS Adaptive Collection by Kim Kardashian that features a disabled model in the campaign include phrases such as, \"I really I don't understand how far we're going to take this inclusivity thing, I really don't get it, and if I am wrong educate me,\" \"[A model in a wheelchair] seems ridiculous\" and \"Whose idea was this? Was it your idea? Okay, you're fired\".\n\nHaleigh Rosa, a model, disability rights advocate and founder of foreveryone.foundation , was one of the first people to speak out against Owens' comments. Rosa is paralyzed from the waist down after a car accident, she is a wheelchair user and since her accident she has become a prominent advocate for disability rights. She has collaborated with several high-end fashion brands, including SKIMS, Off-White, LVMH, and Tommy Hilfiger, to bring inclusivity and accessibility to a new generation of consumers. Rosa's campaign for Off-White, titled \"FOR EVERYONE,\" was cited by CNN as one of the fashion industry's moves to set a new precedent for inclusive casting. \"After getting injured I remember not seeing anyone like me in campaigns. At the same time, I was relearning simple tasks like clothing myself. It would have been so helpful to see someone in a wheelchair; I'm so happy that we're finally coming around. Seeing someone like you matters; representation matters\" says Rosa.\n\nWhen Rosa saw Owens' comments, which included an image of Rosa modeling SKIMS, and heard the statement that it was \"ridiculous\" for a woman in a wheelchair to be part of a campaign, she was shocked. Rosa stated, \"it's so often assumed that the disability community should be felt bad for. The people I know that have disabilities are some of the most resilient people. Wheelchair users will not agree with [Owens'] views. If [Owens] truly wants to educate herself, she can reach out to me. I'm not one for cancel culture; I believe in the power of education. I'd love to have a conversation and educate Candace.\"\n\nHaleigh Rosa, model & disability rights advocate\n\nPaula Carozzo, creator and disability rights activist, was also outraged by Owens' comments. Carozzo has garnered an audience of over 100,000 followers through her advocacy work and has worked with several high-profile brands, including Google, META, Clinique, and Tommy Hilfiger, to promote disability representation. Carozzo, who was diagnosed with a non-traumatic brain injury at the age of five, believes that attitudinal barriers are the most difficult to overcome for the disability community.\n\nCarozzo stated \"for the disability community, we are at the current peak of representation. Representation for us is as vital as the lungs we need to breathe. We've worked so hard for such a long time. No bully should be able to show-up and make \"assumptions\" of what we need and want.\"\n\nHaleigh Rosa, model & disability rights advocate\n\nHelya Mohammadian, the founder of Slick Chicks , a company that designs accessible undergarments and apparel for disabled people, also spoke out against Owens' comments. Mohammadian started the company over a decade ago. \"As founder of a company with a very clear and decisive mission, I do not stand with any agenda or statement where women attack other women for a sound bite or highlight reel, much less generalize about an entire community. It is hard enough to make it as a female in business and those who are in a position of power with a large audience should use it to speak on the merit of whatever topic is in question, not to minimize for the sake of doing so or speak without a basic set of knowledge. Personally, I started this company on the floor of my NYC apartment with not a single cent to my name over a decade ago; it is that struggle which has built these products, in tandem with the community who has built with us. That same community which is being called into question has also struggled. Together that is what has made us stronger. My hope is that we all feel actualized to have produced an original set of clothing, which I hope has made even the smallest of impact on those who are part of the Slick Chicks family. Basic necessities are not dubbed luxuries for the very definition of the word; basic necessities are a human right. We love, support, and champion an entire community of marginalized people that want and deserve to be seen and respected. That is how we started and how we will always use our platform. Our company was not built to check a box; it was people who inspired my first design and it has been those same people who have driven growth which Slick Chicks is proud to embody.\" stated Mohammadian.\n\nIn conclusion, the disabled community has been working tirelessly to break down attitudinal barriers and create more inclusive spaces in all areas of life, including fashion. Owens' comments were harmful and demonstrated a lack of understanding of disability rights, accessibility and representation. Disability activists like Haleigh Rosa, Helya Mohammadian and Paula Carozzo have worked hard to promote disability representation in the fashion industry, and they demand an apology from Owens to the disabled community. Carozzo says, \"attitudinal barriers really create our default setting of perceptions and behaviors, and these are the barriers that the disability community works day and night to shift.\"\n\nCandace Owens has been asked to comment and the story will be updated if a response is received.\n\nSlick Chicks models showcasing accessible underwear"

      "text": "Candace Owens: The Voice Of Black Conservatives In The 2024 Election\n\nBy Stephanie Tharpe\n\nBy Stephanie Tharpe ,\n\nContributor.\n\nNASHVILLE, TENNESSEE - NOVEMBER 22: Candace Owens is seen on set of \"Candace\" on November 22, 2021 ... More in Nashville, Tennessee. The show will air on Tuesday, November 23, 2021. (Photo by Jason Davis/Getty Images)\n\nOn the surface, Candace Owens seems to be the antithesis of everything we expect a Black American woman to be. Upon deeper inspection, you would find she holds the core values many Black American men and women revere: Family, love, hard work, and the passion to make our country better for future generations. So, why is Candace such a controversial and polarizing figure? Is it because she is Conservative, Black and loathes the current ethos of female rap and pop culture? Candace embodies the very things popular culture has overtly or covertly told Black Americans would be to our detriment if we open our minds to those ideals. However, Owens has shown there is success in charting your path. She lives boldly in the stance that all Black Americans are not a monolith and deserve the freedom to make our own political, social, and economic choices without being ostracized.\n\nThis year, Black voices like Candace and many others across the sociopolitical spectrum will be at the forefront as Americans prepare to vote for our next President. It's prudent that the Black community embrace and be open to hearing varying perspectives to widen our understanding and vote in the best interest of our families and community. With our 2024 presidential race headed toward a face-off between President Biden and former President Trump, the Black vote has once again been thrust to the forefront of national news. According to a report from The Hill , \"A November poll by The New York Times and Siena College found that 22 percent of voters in six battleground states said they would support former President Trump in this year's election. While 71 percent of Black voters said they would support Biden, the numbers for Trump are the highest percentage a Republican presidential candidate has seen in a half-century. One in five voters suggested they wouldn't vote for either candidate. With Black Americans growing more displeased with the Biden administration, we are left searching for a solution to a broken two-party system with less-than-desirable candidate choices on both sides of the political spectrum. This is why highly visible Black moderate, liberal, and conservative figures like Owens are critical to the outcome of the upcoming presidential election and how we shape ourselves as a forever-evolving and diverse community of Black Americans.\n\nI sat for an Interview with Candace at the Daily Wire Studio in Nashville, Tennessee, to talk about the rise of Black conservatism, her passion for debunking harmful mainstream programming, and her thoughts on Black and American culture.\n\nThis interview was edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nNASHVILLE, TN - JANUARY 11: Candace Owens hosts during a taping of \"Candace\" hosted by Candace Owens ... More on January 11, 2022 in Nashville, Tennessee. (Photo by Brett Carlsen/Getty Images)\n\nStephanie Tharpe: There is a narrative that you were a lifelong Democrat gone rouge. Is this true? What formed your relationship with the party and politics?\n\nCandace Owens: My grandfather was raised in Fayetteville, North Carolina, on a sharecropping farm, and then he moved his family up to Connecticut. He was super Southern in the way he instilled values in us. I think it's essential to clarify the differences between conservatism, Republicans, liberalism, and the Democrat Party. I grew up in a family that was not politically inclined. I have no memory of either of my parents ever voting. My grandparents abstained from that; they were incredibly faithful. And they constantly would talk about secularism and anything of this world. So, it was a very strict, conservative, and faithful household. I lived with my grandparents from the age of eight to fifteen. So, in terms of an introduction to the Democrat party, I didn't have one outside of the school system.\n\nI think every Black person in America would agree that when you go through the public school system, you come out with the idea that the Republican Party was racist, the Republican Party was backward, and the Democrat Party saved you. I was a victim of my schooling in that regard that I was sympathetic to the Democrat Party, and I felt that if I ever engaged in politics, I would have to be a Democrat. But I have never been a Democrat in my life. The media tells the story that I was this Democrat until I realized I could make money as a Republican. This is just not true. I've always said that I was liberal, but I wasn't politically inclined. I guess we could say the most Democrat I've ever been is I cried when Former President Barack Obama won, although I didn't vote for him.\n\nStephanie Tharpe: As a mother, do you feel the current social media climate is a safe place for children?\n\nCandace Owens: Absolutely not. Social media is not a safe environment for children, and I speak about it regularly on my show. I tell people to keep their children off of Tik Tok. Social media is creating entirely new psychiatric disorders that we've never considered. No matter what, children want to find their tribe and find out who they are. It's part of growing up; you try different hairstyles and different fashion styles, and when you have social media, which sits outside of the realm of reality, giving you different variations of a personality, you can be; that's extremely harmful to the psychiatric for the psychological development of children. I'm not a doctor. But I am a mother. And a lot of this is common sense. This even gets into a weird category that I covered on my show of children who are young teenagers and tweens who are recording themselves crying on the internet for attention, likes, and clicks. And it's because they're getting likes from a community of people who agree this is cool.\n\nA parent can't monitor their child's social media every second of every day. Eventually, a video will pop up that you're going to wish your child hadn't seen. And that removes parental control from you. And so it's an absolute no for me. I don't know if this sounds hypocritical or sexist, especially for my daughter. As young women, we think: What do I look like? Oh, my breasts haven't come in. Now you've got the Kardashians establishing what the beauty trends are. We're seeing young women who look way too grown for their ages. Parents want to avoid going through the effort of raising their children. Phones are distracting and keep them busy. It keeps them quiet. And then you will wake up one day and realize you don't recognize your child. So, I am very against children being on social media.\n\nStephanie Tharpe: Why do you think the Black American community historically has almost unwavering loyalty to the Democratic party?\n\nCandace Owens: I think the Black American community is highly emotional. First, we are emotionally more responsive than any other community, which is very much to our detriment. Other racial and ethnic groups that are much calmer know that this becomes a method of manipulation. So, it was easy to establish the Black monolith as it was intentionally established because emotion was used to launch it. Suppose I know that deep down, I am controlling the education system and creating an excessive amount of fear within every Black American child regarding slavery. After that first education step is accomplished, I can move into culture and media.\n\nThe implicit threat that the Democrat Party has always implied to Black people is if you don't support a particular organization. If you don't vote for Biden or Hillary Clinton, then slavery and racism are returning. It's utterly irrational and incredibly emotional, and Black people respond to it before rationality slips in.\n\nNASHVILLE, TENNESSEE - OCTOBER 12: Kanye West and Candace Owens attend the \"The Greatest Lie Ever ... More Sold\" Premiere Screening on October 12, 2022 in Nashville, Tennessee. (Photo by Jason Davis/Getty Images for DailyWire+)\n\nStephanie Tharpe: Is there a middle ground for Black Liberals and Conservatives?\n\nCandace Owens: To be honest, when I think of liberals, I think of white women. Black liberals, when you get down to their actual ideas, they're conservative, and it's hard for me to identify the Black liberal movement. It seems to me that many Black conservatives were duped into believing they're liberal based on emotional arguments like George Floyd. I think mainstream media has them a little confused. I don't know what a Black liberal is, and as I stated In my book when you get down to the beliefs of Black Americans, we are often pretty conservative.\n\nStephanie Tharpe: Why do you think Black conservative leaders like Ben Carson, Condoleezza Rice, and Clarence Thomas are judged so harshly?\n\nCandace Owens: When Black people are actual examples of how every single Black person can become successful, it threatens the liberal establishment. So they attack it with everything they have and get Black people to reject the path to success they can all follow.\n\nWhat's interesting about Clarence Thomas, Condoleezza Rice, and Dr. Ben Carson is everybody wants to talk about racism, and they don't want to examine how these people grew up. They grew up with actual racism, real racism, and they defied incredible odds to get to where they are. They all came from the same story. And yet, people who didn't live through the periods of racism will discount everything they lived through and call them racist because they have the formula. These are people that, if you study them as examples, every Black person will become successful, and they can't have that.\n\nSo, instead, they give Black Americans false idols and things that are nearly impossible to achieve. Lebron James is one of the biggest idols in Black America. What are the chances of becoming the next Lebron James? Literally, zero, you can round it to zero percent. What is your chance of becoming a doctor, Lawyer, or judge? If you stay in school, one hundred percent. Black Americans aren't allowed to think like that. Because then they can't be controlled. At the same time, we have astounding illiteracy rates among Black Americans. We are systematically becoming dumber because they increase the focus on false idols and culture instead of education. I aspire to be like all three of those Black intellectuals someday. Those are my idols.\n\nNASHVILLE, TENNESSEE - MAY 17: Candace Owens is seen on the set of \"Candace\" on May 17, 2021 in ... More Nashville, Tennessee. The show will air on Tuesday, May 18, 2021. (Photo by Jason Kempin/Getty Images)\n\nStephanie Tharpe: What can be done to encourage Black voters to think more independently about our politics?\n\nCandace Owens: It starts with the Black family. I think the Black family has been destroyed, and people are pursuing that paternity and maternity elsewhere. They're turning to culture to tell them what's right and wrong; in reality, that is the role of your mother and your father at the head of the dinner table. The collapse of the black family has led to the destruction of everything else in terms of Black culture, economics, and intellect. Everything falls when the family is not intact.\n\nI wish we would be having more conversations about the disruption, the intentional disruption of the Black family in the sixties with Lyndon Baines Johnson, and until Black Americans are educated about why everything surrounding them seems like grief, which wasn't always this way. I always say, look at your grandparent's generation. Despite living in harsher times racially, their morals were intact, the families were together, and the music was better. People keep telling me, you know, you don't represent Black culture. I'm like, this isn't Black culture. Who convinced you that this derogatory, disgusting filth is Black culture? This is not the music that we grew up listening to. This is not The Temptations, the Commodores, Patti LaBelle, and the stuff I heard at my grandfather's house singing about love. I don't think anything changes until we can be willing to discuss and meaningfully assess what has gone wrong. Until you can identify the problem, there is no solution.\n\nStephanie Tharpe: Your docuseries Convicting a Murderer on The Daily Wire is a counter to the Netflix series Making a Murderer. Why do you feel you need to counter that narrative?\n\nCandace Owens: I'm always looking for the next documentary project, and I'm very interested, obviously, in media propaganda and the spell it has on people's minds. I'm very interested in psychology, and this was one of the earlier experiments in mass psychology, the ability for people to be duped by a docuseries and literally turn a convicted killer, robber, and rapist into a hero. Steven Avery is getting letters in prison and has fiance's and girlfriends. He's living his best life, and has fan clubs. Crazy. And he horrifically murdered someone, and nobody cares. Like, propaganda is fascinating.\n\nStephanie Tharpe: What did you and The Daily Wire get right that Netflix Got wrong?\n\nCandace Owens: Well, we were committed to telling the truth wherever the chips may fall. That's always been my thing. I don't care who is at the nucleus of a story. I don't care if that is a Latino man, a Black man, or a Spanish woman. I want to know what the truth is. We can only learn from the truth. We can't learn from lies. So, we were committed to telling the whole story. We had to debate whether to include some things in the documentary. We gave everybody the truth and let them make up their own mind. And so that's what we did differently. At the Daily Wire, we trust the public to decide once you present them with the facts.\n\nStephanie Tharpe: Your show on YouTube and The Daily Wire pivoted over the years, centering more around social issues rather than political ones. What influenced that change?\n\nCandace Owens: I think what happened was I became well known because of my stance on BLM at a time when it was just unacceptable to be anti-BLM, and people pigeon-holed me into politics. I love politics and the challenge of having the audacity to keep being myself. I loved that people hated me for being myself because I would never stop. I've always been that kind of a kid. I am not a person who can be persuaded to like someone or not like somebody. I have always very much marched to the beat of my own drum.\n\nWhat really has been the most significant transformation for me is starting a family. And it has been a very natural progression that my interests have shifted over the last three years. I want people to know that I'm not just political. I actually have never been overtly political in my life; I just had something to say. I disagreed with this narrative about Black Lives Matter and liked Trump. It's been nice to show people other pieces of me, and motherhood is the biggest piece of me. That brought me to the vaccine series, and it was really important. It's against the trend, and everybody vaccines their kids. I was doing this pre-COVID. So, people weren't really interested in having a dialogue about all of these vaccines that were being given. Now, people are more open to it. Ultimately, people are seeing me transform naturally in my personal life. And that comes across in my podcasts and in whatever I'm doing.\n\nNASHVILLE, TENNESSEE - NOVEMBER 08: Candace Owens is seen on set of \"Candace\" on November 08, 2021 ... More in Nashville, Tennessee. The show will air on Tuesday, November 9th. (Photo by Jason Davis/Getty Images)\n\nStephanie Tharpe: Why is Candace Owens viewed as the villain?\n\nCandace Owens: I think because culture controls Black America. And culture has decided on a leftist narrative- I'm on the right. I think it's that simple. I'm conservative, so they attack me. I think they grow frustrated in their attacks on me because they've been attacking me for years. And I'm still here. That's got to be frustrating.\n\nStephanie Tharpe: What is the trajectory of Black culture, and how can we remedy some of the negative stereotypes?\n\nCandace Owens: Social media opened up so many conversations. That is a very good thing that will undoubtedly positively affect Black America. People other than me, like Kevin Samuels, were good for the Black conversation because he was saying something different. Black women heard him talking about high-value men and saying you're not high-value. It struck a chord because we haven't been high value. We're in a generation where we're producing the \"WAPS,\" and Black women know that is not high value. They are, and I'm not saying every Black woman, but the women who hated Kevin Samuels knew he was saying something they knew deep down was true. It's the same for me. People that really hate me- don't hate me. There's something that they don't want to acknowledge in themselves. And I think people like us are starting to penetrate, and people are starting to have a conversation.\n\nStephanie Tharpe: What will your legacy be, Candace?\n\nCandace Owens: My legacy is wife, mother, sister, and friend. What I do and my personal life is so much more important than what I do in the public sphere. I've made up of a lot of different things, those being the most important elements of my life. In an adjective, I'd say passionate. People should know that I'm on stable footing, which is to say that I am not disturbed. Other people's opinions of me never perturb me. I hope that what people take away is that when you foster a stable household and when you foster a stable life, you don't have to look to external forces for security. I wake up every day, and I'm secure because I have a husband who loves me. I have children that Adore Me. And they will, of course, be my legacy."

      "text": "Candace Owens: The Voice Of Black Conservatives In The 2024 Election\n\nBy Stephanie Tharpe\n\nBy Stephanie Tharpe ,\n\nContributor.\n\nNASHVILLE, TENNESSEE - NOVEMBER 22: Candace Owens is seen on set of \"Candace\" on November 22, 2021 ... More in Nashville, Tennessee. The show will air on Tuesday, November 23, 2021. (Photo by Jason Davis/Getty Images)\n\nOn the surface, Candace Owens seems to be the antithesis of everything we expect a Black American woman to be. Upon deeper inspection, you would find she holds the core values many Black American men and women revere: Family, love, hard work, and the passion to make our country better for future generations. So, why is Candace such a controversial and polarizing figure? Is it because she is Conservative, Black and loathes the current ethos of female rap and pop culture? Candace embodies the very things popular culture has overtly or covertly told Black Americans would be to our detriment if we open our minds to those ideals. However, Owens has shown there is success in charting your path. She lives boldly in the stance that all Black Americans are not a monolith and deserve the freedom to make our own political, social, and economic choices without being ostracized.\n\nThis year, Black voices like Candace and many others across the sociopolitical spectrum will be at the forefront as Americans prepare to vote for our next President. It's prudent that the Black community embrace and be open to hearing varying perspectives to widen our understanding and vote in the best interest of our families and community. With our 2024 presidential race headed toward a face-off between President Biden and former President Trump, the Black vote has once again been thrust to the forefront of national news. According to a report from The Hill , \"A November poll by The New York Times and Siena College found that 22 percent of voters in six battleground states said they would support former President Trump in this year's election. While 71 percent of Black voters said they would support Biden, the numbers for Trump are the highest percentage a Republican presidential candidate has seen in a half-century. One in five voters suggested they wouldn't vote for either candidate. With Black Americans growing more displeased with the Biden administration, we are left searching for a solution to a broken two-party system with less-than-desirable candidate choices on both sides of the political spectrum. This is why highly visible Black moderate, liberal, and conservative figures like Owens are critical to the outcome of the upcoming presidential election and how we shape ourselves as a forever-evolving and diverse community of Black Americans.\n\nI sat for an Interview with Candace at the Daily Wire Studio in Nashville, Tennessee, to talk about the rise of Black conservatism, her passion for debunking harmful mainstream programming, and her thoughts on Black and American culture.\n\nThis interview was edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nNASHVILLE, TN - JANUARY 11: Candace Owens hosts during a taping of \"Candace\" hosted by Candace Owens ... More on January 11, 2022 in Nashville, Tennessee. (Photo by Brett Carlsen/Getty Images)\n\nStephanie Tharpe: There is a narrative that you were a lifelong Democrat gone rouge. Is this true? What formed your relationship with the party and politics?\n\nCandace Owens: My grandfather was raised in Fayetteville, North Carolina, on a sharecropping farm, and then he moved his family up to Connecticut. He was super Southern in the way he instilled values in us. I think it's essential to clarify the differences between conservatism, Republicans, liberalism, and the Democrat Party. I grew up in a family that was not politically inclined. I have no memory of either of my parents ever voting. My grandparents abstained from that; they were incredibly faithful. And they constantly would talk about secularism and anything of this world. So, it was a very strict, conservative, and faithful household. I lived with my grandparents from the age of eight to fifteen. So, in terms of an introduction to the Democrat party, I didn't have one outside of the school system.\n\nI think every Black person in America would agree that when you go through the public school system, you come out with the idea that the Republican Party was racist, the Republican Party was backward, and the Democrat Party saved you. I was a victim of my schooling in that regard that I was sympathetic to the Democrat Party, and I felt that if I ever engaged in politics, I would have to be a Democrat. But I have never been a Democrat in my life. The media tells the story that I was this Democrat until I realized I could make money as a Republican. This is just not true. I've always said that I was liberal, but I wasn't politically inclined. I guess we could say the most Democrat I've ever been is I cried when Former President Barack Obama won, although I didn't vote for him.\n\nStephanie Tharpe: As a mother, do you feel the current social media climate is a safe place for children?\n\nCandace Owens: Absolutely not. Social media is not a safe environment for children, and I speak about it regularly on my show. I tell people to keep their children off of Tik Tok. Social media is creating entirely new psychiatric disorders that we've never considered. No matter what, children want to find their tribe and find out who they are. It's part of growing up; you try different hairstyles and different fashion styles, and when you have social media, which sits outside of the realm of reality, giving you different variations of a personality, you can be; that's extremely harmful to the psychiatric for the psychological development of children. I'm not a doctor. But I am a mother. And a lot of this is common sense. This even gets into a weird category that I covered on my show of children who are young teenagers and tweens who are recording themselves crying on the internet for attention, likes, and clicks. And it's because they're getting likes from a community of people who agree this is cool.\n\nA parent can't monitor their child's social media every second of every day. Eventually, a video will pop up that you're going to wish your child hadn't seen. And that removes parental control from you. And so it's an absolute no for me. I don't know if this sounds hypocritical or sexist, especially for my daughter. As young women, we think: What do I look like? Oh, my breasts haven't come in. Now you've got the Kardashians establishing what the beauty trends are. We're seeing young women who look way too grown for their ages. Parents want to avoid going through the effort of raising their children. Phones are distracting and keep them busy. It keeps them quiet. And then you will wake up one day and realize you don't recognize your child. So, I am very against children being on social media.\n\nStephanie Tharpe: Why do you think the Black American community historically has almost unwavering loyalty to the Democratic party?\n\nCandace Owens: I think the Black American community is highly emotional. First, we are emotionally more responsive than any other community, which is very much to our detriment. Other racial and ethnic groups that are much calmer know that this becomes a method of manipulation. So, it was easy to establish the Black monolith as it was intentionally established because emotion was used to launch it. Suppose I know that deep down, I am controlling the education system and creating an excessive amount of fear within every Black American child regarding slavery. After that first education step is accomplished, I can move into culture and media.\n\nThe implicit threat that the Democrat Party has always implied to Black people is if you don't support a particular organization. If you don't vote for Biden or Hillary Clinton, then slavery and racism are returning. It's utterly irrational and incredibly emotional, and Black people respond to it before rationality slips in.\n\nNASHVILLE, TENNESSEE - OCTOBER 12: Kanye West and Candace Owens attend the \"The Greatest Lie Ever ... More Sold\" Premiere Screening on October 12, 2022 in Nashville, Tennessee. (Photo by Jason Davis/Getty Images for DailyWire+)\n\nStephanie Tharpe: Is there a middle ground for Black Liberals and Conservatives?\n\nCandace Owens: To be honest, when I think of liberals, I think of white women. Black liberals, when you get down to their actual ideas, they're conservative, and it's hard for me to identify the Black liberal movement. It seems to me that many Black conservatives were duped into believing they're liberal based on emotional arguments like George Floyd. I think mainstream media has them a little confused. I don't know what a Black liberal is, and as I stated In my book when you get down to the beliefs of Black Americans, we are often pretty conservative.\n\nStephanie Tharpe: Why do you think Black conservative leaders like Ben Carson, Condoleezza Rice, and Clarence Thomas are judged so harshly?\n\nCandace Owens: When Black people are actual examples of how every single Black person can become successful, it threatens the liberal establishment. So they attack it with everything they have and get Black people to reject the path to success they can all follow.\n\nWhat's interesting about Clarence Thomas, Condoleezza Rice, and Dr. Ben Carson is everybody wants to talk about racism, and they don't want to examine how these people grew up. They grew up with actual racism, real racism, and they defied incredible odds to get to where they are. They all came from the same story. And yet, people who didn't live through the periods of racism will discount everything they lived through and call them racist because they have the formula. These are people that, if you study them as examples, every Black person will become successful, and they can't have that.\n\nSo, instead, they give Black Americans false idols and things that are nearly impossible to achieve. Lebron James is one of the biggest idols in Black America. What are the chances of becoming the next Lebron James? Literally, zero, you can round it to zero percent. What is your chance of becoming a doctor, Lawyer, or judge? If you stay in school, one hundred percent. Black Americans aren't allowed to think like that. Because then they can't be controlled. At the same time, we have astounding illiteracy rates among Black Americans. We are systematically becoming dumber because they increase the focus on false idols and culture instead of education. I aspire to be like all three of those Black intellectuals someday. Those are my idols.\n\nNASHVILLE, TENNESSEE - MAY 17: Candace Owens is seen on the set of \"Candace\" on May 17, 2021 in ... More Nashville, Tennessee. The show will air on Tuesday, May 18, 2021. (Photo by Jason Kempin/Getty Images)\n\nStephanie Tharpe: What can be done to encourage Black voters to think more independently about our politics?\n\nCandace Owens: It starts with the Black family. I think the Black family has been destroyed, and people are pursuing that paternity and maternity elsewhere. They're turning to culture to tell them what's right and wrong; in reality, that is the role of your mother and your father at the head of the dinner table. The collapse of the black family has led to the destruction of everything else in terms of Black culture, economics, and intellect. Everything falls when the family is not intact.\n\nI wish we would be having more conversations about the disruption, the intentional disruption of the Black family in the sixties with Lyndon Baines Johnson, and until Black Americans are educated about why everything surrounding them seems like grief, which wasn't always this way. I always say, look at your grandparent's generation. Despite living in harsher times racially, their morals were intact, the families were together, and the music was better. People keep telling me, you know, you don't represent Black culture. I'm like, this isn't Black culture. Who convinced you that this derogatory, disgusting filth is Black culture? This is not the music that we grew up listening to. This is not The Temptations, the Commodores, Patti LaBelle, and the stuff I heard at my grandfather's house singing about love. I don't think anything changes until we can be willing to discuss and meaningfully assess what has gone wrong. Until you can identify the problem, there is no solution.\n\nStephanie Tharpe: Your docuseries Convicting a Murderer on The Daily Wire is a counter to the Netflix series Making a Murderer. Why do you feel you need to counter that narrative?\n\nCandace Owens: I'm always looking for the next documentary project, and I'm very interested, obviously, in media propaganda and the spell it has on people's minds. I'm very interested in psychology, and this was one of the earlier experiments in mass psychology, the ability for people to be duped by a docuseries and literally turn a convicted killer, robber, and rapist into a hero. Steven Avery is getting letters in prison and has fiance's and girlfriends. He's living his best life, and has fan clubs. Crazy. And he horrifically murdered someone, and nobody cares. Like, propaganda is fascinating.\n\nStephanie Tharpe: What did you and The Daily Wire get right that Netflix Got wrong?\n\nCandace Owens: Well, we were committed to telling the truth wherever the chips may fall. That's always been my thing. I don't care who is at the nucleus of a story. I don't care if that is a Latino man, a Black man, or a Spanish woman. I want to know what the truth is. We can only learn from the truth. We can't learn from lies. So, we were committed to telling the whole story. We had to debate whether to include some things in the documentary. We gave everybody the truth and let them make up their own mind. And so that's what we did differently. At the Daily Wire, we trust the public to decide once you present them with the facts.\n\nStephanie Tharpe: Your show on YouTube and The Daily Wire pivoted over the years, centering more around social issues rather than political ones. What influenced that change?\n\nCandace Owens: I think what happened was I became well known because of my stance on BLM at a time when it was just unacceptable to be anti-BLM, and people pigeon-holed me into politics. I love politics and the challenge of having the audacity to keep being myself. I loved that people hated me for being myself because I would never stop. I've always been that kind of a kid. I am not a person who can be persuaded to like someone or not like somebody. I have always very much marched to the beat of my own drum.\n\nWhat really has been the most significant transformation for me is starting a family. And it has been a very natural progression that my interests have shifted over the last three years. I want people to know that I'm not just political. I actually have never been overtly political in my life; I just had something to say. I disagreed with this narrative about Black Lives Matter and liked Trump. It's been nice to show people other pieces of me, and motherhood is the biggest piece of me. That brought me to the vaccine series, and it was really important. It's against the trend, and everybody vaccines their kids. I was doing this pre-COVID. So, people weren't really interested in having a dialogue about all of these vaccines that were being given. Now, people are more open to it. Ultimately, people are seeing me transform naturally in my personal life. And that comes across in my podcasts and in whatever I'm doing.\n\nNASHVILLE, TENNESSEE - NOVEMBER 08: Candace Owens is seen on set of \"Candace\" on November 08, 2021 ... More in Nashville, Tennessee. The show will air on Tuesday, November 9th. (Photo by Jason Davis/Getty Images)\n\nStephanie Tharpe: Why is Candace Owens viewed as the villain?\n\nCandace Owens: I think because culture controls Black America. And culture has decided on a leftist narrative- I'm on the right. I think it's that simple. I'm conservative, so they attack me. I think they grow frustrated in their attacks on me because they've been attacking me for years. And I'm still here. That's got to be frustrating.\n\nStephanie Tharpe: What is the trajectory of Black culture, and how can we remedy some of the negative stereotypes?\n\nCandace Owens: Social media opened up so many conversations. That is a very good thing that will undoubtedly positively affect Black America. People other than me, like Kevin Samuels, were good for the Black conversation because he was saying something different. Black women heard him talking about high-value men and saying you're not high-value. It struck a chord because we haven't been high value. We're in a generation where we're producing the \"WAPS,\" and Black women know that is not high value. They are, and I'm not saying every Black woman, but the women who hated Kevin Samuels knew he was saying something they knew deep down was true. It's the same for me. People that really hate me- don't hate me. There's something that they don't want to acknowledge in themselves. And I think people like us are starting to penetrate, and people are starting to have a conversation.\n\nStephanie Tharpe: What will your legacy be, Candace?\n\nCandace Owens: My legacy is wife, mother, sister, and friend. What I do and my personal life is so much more important than what I do in the public sphere. I've made up of a lot of different things, those being the most important elements of my life. In an adjective, I'd say passionate. People should know that I'm on stable footing, which is to say that I am not disturbed. Other people's opinions of me never perturb me. I hope that what people take away is that when you foster a stable household and when you foster a stable life, you don't have to look to external forces for security. I wake up every day, and I'm secure because I have a husband who loves me. I have children that Adore Me. And they will, of course, be my legacy."

(Photo by Scott Kowlchyk/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images)\n\nRecently, Fox News seems to have acquired a keen interest in the physical attributes of female cartoon characters.\n\nFresh off the heels of Tucker Carlson's surreal rant against the Green M&M trading her knee-high boots for trainers, comes Candace Owens, triggered by a new pantsuit for Disney's Minnie Mouse.\n\nIt should be noted that the iconic mouse hasn't actually been redesigned - Minnie is set to temporarily sport a new pantsuit, designed by Stella McCartney, which will be worn by a performer in a Minnie Mouse costume at Walt Disney Studios Park, in recognition of Women's History Month.\n\nNot a big deal - Minnie experiments with new clothes all the time . After all, new outfits equal more merchandising opportunities for Disney.\n\nOwens, however, framed the temporary outfit change as part of an insidious plot to erode American society and distract consumers from the rising cost of living, despite the fact that Minnie's Hillary Clinton-esque pantsuit wasn't exactly being pushed on the public as some kind of indoctrination campaign - it's just something Disneyland visitors will see at some point.\n\nSpeaking to Jesse Watters while on his show, Jesse Watters Prime Time , Owens stated :\n\n\"This is why people don't take these people seriously, they are taking all of these things, that nobody was offended by and feel they have to get rid of them and destroy them.

(Photo by Scott Kowlchyk/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images)\n\nRecently, Fox News seems to have acquired a keen interest in the physical attributes of female cartoon characters.\n\nFresh off the heels of Tucker Carlson's surreal rant against the Green M&M trading her knee-high boots for trainers, comes Candace Owens, triggered by a new pantsuit for Disney's Minnie Mouse.\n\nIt should be noted that the iconic mouse hasn't actually been redesigned - Minnie is set to temporarily sport a new pantsuit, designed by Stella McCartney, which will be worn by a performer in a Minnie Mouse costume at Walt Disney Studios Park, in recognition of Women's History Month.\n\nNot a big deal - Minnie experiments with new clothes all the time . After all, new outfits equal more merchandising opportunities for Disney.\n\nOwens, however, framed the temporary outfit change as part of an insidious plot to erode American society and distract consumers from the rising cost of living, despite the fact that Minnie's Hillary Clinton-esque pantsuit wasn't exactly being pushed on the public as some kind of indoctrination campaign - it's just something Disneyland visitors will see at some point.\n\nSpeaking to Jesse Watters while on his show, Jesse Watters Prime Time , Owens stated :\n\n\"This is why people don't take these people seriously, they are taking all of these things, that nobody was offended by and feel they have to get rid of them and destroy them. Because they are bored, they are absolutely bored, they are trying to destroy fabrics of our society pretending that there's issues. This is so everybody looks over here, look at Minnie Mouse, don't look at inflation, Jesse.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nCommentator Candace Owens has been blocked from entering Australia ahead of a planned speaking tour.\n\nAustralia's Minister of Home Affairs, Tony Burke, rejected Owens' visa application, his office confirmed to Newsweek.\n\n\"From downplaying the impact of the Holocaust with comments about [Nazi doctor Josef Mengele] through to claims that Muslims started slavery, Candace Owens has the capacity to incite discord in almost every direction,\" Burke said in a statement.\n\n\"Australia's national interest is best served when Candace Owens is somewhere else.\"\n\nOwens has long stoked controversy with inflammatory claims about Jewish, Muslim and transgender people . In July, she sparked a backlash after saying that accounts of the Nazi medical experiments conducted on twins by Mengele in concentration camps sound \"completely absurd\" and like \"bizarre propaganda.\"\n\nOwens has not publicly commented on being barred from entering Australia. She has been contacted for comment via an email sent through the website for Blexit, a grassroots conservative movement she co-founded.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation Commission, a pro-Jewish group that pushed to bar Owens from Australia, welcomed Burke's decision to reject her visa application.\n\n\"This is a victory for truth, for decency, and for the millions of Jewish souls and millions of others whose memory she so shamelessly desecrated,\" the group's chairman Dvir Abramovich said in a statement provided to Newsweek .\n\n\"The decision by the government to bar Owens sends a resounding message: Australia has no place for those who mock the suffering of genocide survivors and insult the memories of the 6 million Jews who perished. This is a line in the sand.\"\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League says Owens has \"come to espouse explicitly antisemitic, anti-Zionist and anti-Israel views,\" while LGBQT+ advocacy organization GLAAD has listed several occasions when Owens has expressed allegedly transphobic views on social media.\n\nOwens left The Daily Wire, a right-wing website, earlier this year amid reported tensions with editor emeritus Ben Shapiro over their opposing points of view on Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nShe has been increasingly critical of Israel, writing on X in November last year that \"no government anywhere has a right to commit a genocide, ever. There is no justification for a genocide. I can't believe this even needs to be said or is even considered the least bit controversial to state.\" Israel has denied accusations of genocide.\n\nHer speaking tour in Australia was set to kick off in Melbourne on November 17, with tickers ranging from $95 for reserved seating to $1,500 for a VIP package that included a pre-event dinner and a meet-and-greet with Owens. The tour also included stops in Sydney, Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane, and Auckland in New Zealand.\n\n\"Join us for an electrifying evening with Candace Owens, the outspoken and fearless American conservative social commentator, author, activist, and YouTube sensation,\" read a description of the show on ticketing website Ticketek.\n\n\"Known for her controversial takes and unwavering stance, Candace is set to light up stages across Australia and New Zealand with her bold and unfiltered perspectives.... this is your opportunity to experience firsthand the intellect and fearlessness that has captivated millions around the globe.\"\n\nUpdate 10/28/24, 4:50 a.m ET: This article has been updated with a statement from Tony Burke's office and the Anti-Defamation Commission.\n\nKhaleda Rahman is Newsweek's National Correspondent based in London, UK.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nCandace Owens is known for sharing her views on everything from politics to public figures on her podcast, talk show and social media accounts.\n\nOver the years, the conservative commentator has generated headlines over such matters as her friendship with beleaguered musician and fashion designer Kanye West (aka Ye) and their shared support of Donald Trump .\n\nOwens, 33, has made a name for herself as a markedly fierce opponent in a debate, but when it comes to her private life, she's a doting mother of two. She has been married to British-born businessman George Farmer for more than three years, and they have two children under the age of 2.\n\nOwens, host of the Daily Wire show Candace , met Farmer at a December 2018 soft-launch reception party for Turning Point U.K. , which promotes right-wing politics in British schools, colleges and universities.\n\nAt the time they met, Farmer was chairman of the U.K. offshoot of the pro-Trump organization Turning Point USA , and Owens was director of communications. According to a post on Owens' Instagram account, they were engaged on Valentine's Day in 2019.\n\nSix months later, on August 31, they were married at the Trump Winery near Charlottesville, Virginia. The leader of the Brexit Party (now Reform UK), Nigel Farage , attended the ceremony.\n\nOwens and Farmer's daughter, the couple's second child, was welcomed into the family in July 2022. Owens announced her birth one week after her arrival.\n\nSharing a trio of snapshots of their new family member on Instagram, Owens wrote in an accompanying caption on July 20: \"Happy one week birthday to our sweet girl: Louise Marie Farmer. Dad, Mom and Big Brother are so in love.\"\n\n\"Thank you, God for the blessing of being a mother,\" the Connecticut native said.\n\nA post shared by Candace Owens (@realcandaceowens)\n\nAfter initially announcing that she was expecting her second baby in February, Owens revealed in a post in April that she had a girl on the way.\n\n\"It's a...GIRL,\" Tennessee-based Owens captioned a series of photos from a celebratory gathering with friends. \"The sweetest sprinkle ever for our baby girl, who we cannot wait to meet.\"\n\nShe went on to thank country singer Jason Aldean and his wife, Brittany Aldean , for hosting \"the most perfect day,\" and she called them \"Nashville's finest.\"\n\nOwens and Farmer became first-time parents on January 13, 2021, when they welcomed the birth of their son, whose name has not been publicly shared.\n\nSeveral days after her son was born, Owens presented him to her army of followers on Instagram, writing in the post, \"It's true what they say- the whole world stops when your child is born. 1/13/21. My first born son.\"\n\nOwens rounded out her post with a biblical passage from Psalm 127 that read: \"Children are a gift from the Lord; they are a reward from him.\"\n\nA post shared by Candace Owens (@realcandaceowens)\n\nIn a Daily Wire interview during her first pregnancy, Owens spoke about how prospective motherhood affected her outlook and priorities.\n\n\"In a way, pregnancy has better focused me.... Many of these debates are no longer just political for me-they're personal,\" she said. \"The stakes seem much higher when you are starting a family.\n\n\"You realize that whatever decisions we land upon as a society will have real implications for your child's future,\" she continued. \"Will my child grow up in the same America that I grew up in, with the same opportunities? I have a lot of anxiety about the answer to that question, which is being determined now.\"\n\nFarmer, the CEO of Parlement Technologies, the parent company of social media platform Parler, spoke about his wife's settling into her role as a mother, a life change that he described as \"fascinating to watch\" on the First Class Fatherhood podcast in June.\n\n\"I mean, for those who would argue in society that men and women have no differences or could be the same or whatever, I mean they couldn't be more wrong.... Motherhood just brings out the best in women, it just does. It's just a fantastic thing to see,\" Farmer said.\n\n\"They become homemakers, they become people who have so much more tenderness in them,\" he went on. \"I think it allows them to love more. That's not to say they didn't love beforehand. There are plenty of women who don't have kids who are incredibly loving and wonderful and incredible women. But it's just that motherhood is so complementary. There's no doubt about it.\"\n\nFarmer said that parenthood \"changed us both in ways that we didn't imagine before we began this journey together.\"\n\nOwens \"really blossomed into that role, I think, of being a mother,\" he said.\n\n\"In the same way that being a father for me-I suddenly started thinking about college funds and life insurance and all this kind of stuff,\" he continued. \"It's just that dads and moms have different things they think about, but we're all planning together now to build this family unit for the rest of our lives. And that's incredibly rewarding for the two of us.\"\n\nRyan Smith is a Newsweek Senior Pop Culture and Entertainment Reporter based in London, U.K. His focus is reporting on pop culture and entertainment.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nConservative political commentator Candace Owens has defended Brittany Mahomes after she faced backlash for liking an Instagram post from U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump .\n\nThis comes after followers of Mahomes, the wife of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, noticed she had allegedly liked a post that outlined the Republican Party 's platform for the 2024 election, including deporting \"pro-Hamas radicals\" and keeping \"men out of women's sports.\"\n\nScreenshots and a screen-recorded video indicated Mahomes liked the post, but according to a review by Newsweek , her account is no longer among the current \"likes\" on the post. Amid the negative response she received, the former soccer player condemned \"haters\" in a post on her Instagram story .\n\nNow Owens, a conservative political commentator, has stood up for Mahomes during an episode of her Candace podcast. She argued that Mahomes should be able to like whatever post she wants, especially during an election season.\n\nNewsweek emailed spokespeople for Mahomes and Owens for comment on Wednesday.\n\n\"Brittany Mahome has an attitude. She doesn't care [that social media is angry], and I am here for it,\" Owens said at the beginning of the podcast.\n\nLater in the episode, Owens expanded on her thoughts, criticizing those who came after Mahomes.\n\n\" Britney Mahomes is under fire , uh, because she liked a Trump post, it's like a thing right now, I guess. You've gotta love Hollywood. We're so accepting. We just love everyone. Love is love, love, love,\" she joked.\n\n\"Let someone like a post, which they're allowed to do because it's an election and you are not required to vote one way or the other. And that's what Brittany Mahomes did, she sure stepped in it, she apparently liked a Trump post.\n\n\"This is the post that she has, that she liked, and has since unliked because she has received so much heat for it.\"\n\nIn case some listeners weren't aware of the situation, Owens explained who Mahomes is as well as the post that she allegedly liked from Trump's Instagram account.\n\nA post shared by instagram\n\nShe continued: \"So she liked this post. I think she just said, 'Hey, I agree with, maybe not all, maybe some, maybe a few of these policy points.'\"\n\n\"Given the fact that she's from the South this certainly doesn't stress me out or shock me but you know, people that live in the bubbles like on the coast, really do believe that everybody thinks like them. They just can't imagine-or, or they think people in the South are all backwards and all racist.\n\n\"So I guess they were, they were shocked by this and one user wrote 'Brittany Mahomes just outed herself as a Trump supporter.' Gosh, what are we going to do with her?\n\n\"Another user wrote 'Patrick Mahomes imagine marrying someone who doesn't care about your rights and your kid's rights. Britney Mahomes agreeing with Project 2025 but married to a black man with mixed kids is insane.\"\n\nOwens went on to show her support for Project 2025 , saying those who \"freak out about Project 2025, they're just bots.\"\n\nThe project was created by the conservative Heritage Foundation as a handbook detailing policies for a possible next Republican president. Among the items on the list are expanding the control of the presidency and withdrawing the abortion pill mifepristone from the market.\n\nIt also proposes sweeping changes to remake the federal government, including planning for the Department of Education and the Department of Homeland Security to be dismantled.\n\nWhen Mahomes faced the initial backlash from people, she wrote on her Instagram story: \"To be a hater as an adult, you have to have some deep-rooted issues you refuse to heal from childhood. There's no reason your brain is fully developed and you hate to see others doing well.\"\n\nShe has never publicly expressed her support for any candidate in this election or any other and has never liked any other post from Trump. She also does not follow the Republican on Instagram.\n\nNonetheless, her reported like on the post provoked a flurry of criticism from her followers and fans of Taylor Swift who began following Mahomes after Swift started dating Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce last year.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nBillie is a Newsweek Pop Culture and Entertainment Reporter based in London who has appeared online, in print and on radio.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPolitical commentator Candace Owens has weighed in on Carrie Underwood's political views, saying that any notion the singer \"was a liberal\" is \"the craziest thing I've ever heard.\"\n\nUnderwood's political views became a talking point in recent days, when it was announced that the musician had agreed to perform at President Donald Trump 's inauguration on Monday, January 20.\n\nThe American Idol alum performed \"America the Beautiful \" acapella at the U.S. Capitol Rotunda, shortly after Trump was officially sworn in as the 47th president of the United States.\n\nAhead of the ceremony, Underwood told Newsweek in a statement: \"I love our country and am honored to have been asked to sing at the inauguration and to be a small part of this historic event. I am humbled to answer the call at a time when we must all come together in the spirit of unity and looking to the future.\"\n\nUnderwood's decision to perform for Trump has sparked debate on both sides of the political aisle, with some criticizing her move and others defending her .\n\nOwens, who is a vocal supporter of Trump, weighed into the conversation around Underwood's political leanings when she hosted a livestreamed special on the inauguration.\n\nAs Underwood came into view during the livestream, Tennessee-based Owens said: \"Oh is that Carrie Underwood? Looking fantastic. I love her so much. Neighbor of mine, by the way. Fantastic human being, she really is.\"\n\n\"I have no idea why liberals thought that Carrie Underwood was a liberal,\" Owens continued. \"That's just the craziest thing I've ever heard.\"\n\nOwens went on to describe herself as a \" Carrie Underwood stan\" as she paused briefly in anticipation for the performance.\n\n\"You can tell she's nervous,\" Owens added. \"She's a very shy person. So for her to do this and to take all the mudslinging that she's endured, I'll tell you that probably... it was not easy for her.\"\n\nNewsweek has contacted a representative of Underwood via email for comment.\n\nUnderwood has largely shied away from publicly discussing her political views over the course of her career. In 2019, she told U.K. newspaper The Guardian : \"I try to stay far out of politics if possible, at least in public, because nobody wins. It's crazy.\n\n\"Everybody tries to sum everything up and put a bow on it like it's black and white. And it's not like that.\"\n\nAccording to Parade , Underwood was registered as Republican in 2012 . It is unclear if Underwood voted for Trump in the 2016, 2020 or 2024 election cycles.\n\nIn 2012, Underwood spoke out in support of gay marriage in an interview with U.K. newspaper The Independent.\n\n\"As a married person myself, I don't know what it's like to be told I can't marry somebody I love, and want to marry,\" she said. \"I can't imagine how that must feel. I definitely think we should all have the right to love, and love publicly, the people that we want to love.\"\n\nUnderwood further told the publication that \"God wanted us to love others.\"\n\nWhile hosting the 2017 Country Music Awards, Underwood and fellow country music singer Brad Paisley poked fun at Trump's social media etiquette with a song called \"Before He Tweets,\" a parody of her smash hit \"Before He Cheats.\"\n\n\"And it's fun to watch, yeah, that's for sure / 'Til little Rocket Man starts a nuclear war,\" the two sang. \"Maybe next time, he'll think before he tweets.\"\n\nIn 2018, Underwood's song \"The Bullet\" was deemed to be about gun control. The song includes lyrics like, \"You can blame it on hate or blame it on guns / But mamas ain't supposed to bury their sons,\" as well as, \"The grass grows back around the stone / And friends stop checkin' in on the phone / The camera crews have all moved on / But the wound's still open.\"\n\nHowever, Underwood appeared to refute those claims in a 2019 interview with The Guardian , telling the publication: \"Immediately people said, 'Oh you have a song about gun control!' It was more about the lives that were changed by something terrible happening.\n\n\"And it does kind of bug me when people take a song, or take something I said and try to pigeonhole or force me to pick a side or something. It's a discussion-a long discussion.\"\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nRyan Smith is a Newsweek Senior Pop Culture and Entertainment Reporter based in London, U.K. His focus is reporting on pop culture and entertainment.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nCandace Owens has questioned the security surrounding Donald Trump following as assassination attempt on the former president on July 13.\n\nMinutes into Trump's speech at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, loud popping noises were heard and Trump was struck on his right ear, leaving it bleeding. He was surrounded by Secret Service agents and led from the stage after defiantly raising his hand in a clenched fist.\n\nThe former president, 78, was taken to the nearby Butler Memorial Hospital. Hours later, the FBI revealed the shooter to be Thomas Matthew Crooks , 20, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. One rally attendee was killed and two others were critically injured, according to the Secret Service , who killed the shooter.\n\nShortly after the shooting, witness Greg Smith told the BBC that he spotted a man with a rifle crawling on a rooftop near the rally venue minutes before shots were fired.\n\n\"We noticed the guy bear-crawling up the roof of the building beside us, 50ft away from us,\" Smith recounted. \"He had a rifle; we could clearly see a rifle.\"\n\nSmith went on to describe a scene of chaos and apparent lack of coordination among security personnel as he attempted to warn them of imminent danger.\n\n\"We're pointing at him, the police are down there running around on the ground, we're like 'Hey man, there's a guy on the roof with a rifle'...and the police did not know what was going on,\" he said.\n\nSmith estimated that he and others tried to draw attention to the gunman for three to four minutes before the shooting.\n\nAfter watching a clip of the interview on a live special of her podcast , conservative commentator Owens expressed her astonishment as she remarked: \"You have got to be kidding me. Let me say something right now. Take this to the bank. That person was allowed to scale that roof.\"\n\nCiting her experience of having been in Trump's presence when he was in office, she said: \"I was around him a lot-a lot. And let me tell you something, [with] the Secret Service, there is no person that can get around the perimeter of the Secret Service where Donald Trump is without them being aware of it.\n\n\"I am not kidding when I say that my husband once almost got shot by the Secret Service, because he came down a staircase. I was speaking at the NRA , and he snaked in and came down, and they didn't know who he was. They were like, 'Freeze, we will shoot you right now.'\n\n\"So you're telling me that guy walked up and was trying to get the attention, the Secret Service saw him, and he's pointing and he's saying, 'This guy's got a gun,' and they're pretending they don't know what's going on? I mean, am I crazy?\"\n\n\"Do you guys actually believe this was a failure in intelligence, all of these Secret Service agents crawling around?\" Owens asked her audience. \"They're trying to now tell us that common sense is a conspiracy. That is the new thing that they're trying.\"\n\nOwens, who has expressed her intention to vote for Trump in November's election, stated that it is protocol for the Secret Service to surveil an area \"days before\" a president would make an appearance anywhere.\n\n\"They'll knock on doors,\" she said. \"They've got to figure out every possible angle that any individual could potentially get unapproved. Because you know what? This has happened in the past. People have been shot from roofs. People have been shot from windows.\n\n\"There was a zero percent chance that some random person with a rifle was able to scale a roof, unless there was just an unbelievable failure of intelligence. And you want to know why it's unbelievable? Because I don't effing believe it. I don't believe it. I want the names of the Secret Service agents that allowed this remarkable security failure to go down, because I don't believe this.\"\n\n\"They knew he was going to speak, and they weren't worried about the roofs, a roof with an angle to shoot the president?\" Owens continued. \"And this wasn't like [the shooter] scaled [the roof] silently.\"\n\n\"This man was allowed time to set up,\" Owens added of the shooter. \"Do you understand what that witness is telling us?...Oh, then suddenly, [the Secret Service] snapped back into life, guys, and they just took him out. They blew his head off. Nothing to see here, guys, he missed his shot.\"\n\n\"Let me ask you something, world, do you buy this s***? Hang on. Do you buy it? Because if you if you're buying this, I'm about to sell you guys all sorts of stuff. If you're buying this narrative that's coming out slowly, I mean, I'm a Nigerian prince. Answer my emails, send me a million dollars, give me your credit card digits.\"\n\nAmid questions about security decisions in the moments before the assassination attempt, Anthony Guglielmi, who is chief of communications at the Secret Service, took to X, formerly Twitter , on July 14 to share a statement.\n\n\"[There's] an untrue assertion that a member of the former President's team requested additional security resources & that those were rebuffed,\" he wrote. \"This is absolutely false. In fact, we added protective resources & technology & capabilities as part of the increased campaign travel tempo.\"\n\nThe FBI is leading the investigation into the former president's shooting, working alongside the Secret Service. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said the investigation into the shooting of the other victims is being headed by Pennsylvania State Police.\n\nSince the shooting, Trump has traveled to Milwaukee for this week's Republican National Convention, where he will be formally nominated as the party's presidential candidate.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nRyan Smith is a Newsweek Senior Pop Culture and Entertainment Reporter based in London, U.K. His focus is reporting on pop culture and entertainment.

She is a graduate of The State University of New York at Oneonta. You can get in touch with Rachel by emailing r.dobkin@newsweek.com .

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nConservative commentator Candace Owens said she is \"terrified\" of women pilots while criticizing diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) hiring practices on her podcast on Friday.\n\nAs companies try to incorporate DEI policies into the hiring process to make a more diverse and inclusive workplace and industry, conservatives have criticized the policies as giving jobs to people based on race or gender and not on their credentials. It is illegal to make hiring decisions solely based on these identities, however, it has been argued that inclusive recruitment helps to decrease bias and discrimination in the workplace.\n\nIn a video posted to the Candace Owens Podcast YouTube channel on Friday, Owens defended recent comments that were made by Charlie Kirk, founder of conservative group Turning Point USA .\n\nWhile on the podcast he co-hosts, ThoughtCrime , Kirk said: \"I'm sorry, if I see a Black pilot, I'm gonna be like boy I hope he's qualified...that's not who I am, that's not what I believe.\" His comments came during a conversation about United Airlines DEI policies.\n\nKirk received backlash for these comments , with people on social media calling him racist.\n\n\"I said the exact same thing on this show just a couple of weeks ago,\" Owens, who used to work with Kirk at Turning Point USA as communications director, said about his comments. \"I remarked that now when I even am watching a commercial, if I see a commercial and I see a Black person, a Hispanic person, an Asian person, my thought process is 'Did they just get this because DEI?' I no longer think the person is qualified.\"\n\nShe continued: \"It makes me upset that that's my thought process when I see a commercial and when I see a movie, is this person actually even a good actor or are they just checking a box? But unfortunately that is the reality of what happens when it comes to DEI and what he is remarking on is true.\n\n\"I would be terrified if I got onto a plane and I saw a woman flying the plane and I know that we have the United CEO saying that he just wants to fulfill a quota. He just wants there to be more women and wants there to be more Black people and he's not concerned at first with qualifications. That is something that should alarm all of us guys.\"\n\nOwens called arguments that inclusive hiring helps to decrease bias and discrimination \"foolish\" in a comment to Newsweek via email on Friday.\n\n\"When it comes to flying planes (and every other occupation) individuals should be hired based on merit. The most qualified person should be hired for every position, irrespective of race or sex. Positively shocking that this is considered even remotely controversial,\" she added.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Kirk's podcast via email for comment.\n\nA 2021 interview of United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby talking about DEI initiatives within the airline's aviate academy has recently resurfaced, garnering backlash.\n\nDuring the interview, Kirby was asked by Axios' Dan Primack, \"How is diversity and diversity targets working into the aviate academy?\"\n\nKirby responded at the time: \"We have committed that 50 percent of the classes will be women or people of color. Today, only 19 percent of our pilots at United Airlines are women or people of color. And by the way, from the data I've seen, that's the highest of any airline in the country.\"\n\nA United spokesperson told Newsweek via email on Friday: \"United is proud to maintain the highest standards in our pilot hiring, training, and safety practices. Every aviator who joins our ranks must meet them. No exceptions.\"\n\nUpdate 1/26/23, 6:15 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with comment from United.\n\nUpdate 1/27/23, 10:13 a.m. ET: This article has been updated with comment from Owens.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nRachel Dobkin is a Newsweek reporter based in New York.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nConservative political commentator Candace Owens received support on Friday from pro-Palestinian social media users for her opposition to genocide amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.\n\nOn October 7, Hamas led the deadliest Palestinian militant attack on Israel in history. Israel subsequently launched its heaviest-ever airstrikes on Gaza. According to Israeli officials, 1,400 people in Israel were killed in Hamas' attack, the Associated Press reported, while 9,488 Palestinians have been killed since Saturday, according to officials from the health ministry in Gaza, the AP reported. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said his country is \"at war\" and has cut off supplies of food, fuel, electricity and medicine into Gaza.\n\nOwens wrote on X, formerly Twitter , on Friday: \"No government anywhere has a right to commit a genocide, ever. There is no justification for a genocide. I can't believe this even needs to be said or is even considered the least bit controversial to state.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out to Owens via email for comment.\n\nAlthough Owens later said that she was not referring to any specific government, her comment comes as pro-Palestinian activists and progressive politicians in the U.S. House of Representatives accuse Israel of carrying out a genocide in Gaza.\n\nThe United Nations (UN) describes genocide as \"a crime committed with the intent to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, in whole or in part.\"\n\nMeanwhile, supporters of Israel deny claims that the country is carrying out a genocide against Palestinians.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a Jewish nonprofit that fights against antisemitism, said in response to these claims: \"Genocide is a legal term, and in no way do Israeli policies and actions meet this legal threshold.\" The ADL added that using the term genocide in this context \"is not only inaccurate and misleading, but it serves to demonize the State of Israel and to diminish recognized acts of genocide.\"\n\nNewsweek has reached out to the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, Owens is known for her controversial views on issues like the Black Lives Matter movement and COVID-19, but Friday's post, which she wrote should not be controversial, turned heads.\n\n\"Sorry for all the hate you'll get for this@RealCandaceO,\" X user Omar Freij wrote. \"Thank you for standing up for basic human principles.\"\n\nUser Samah Fadil wrote: \"Candace Owens is now to the left of Biden and Bernie Sanders what the f*** timeline is this.\"\n\n\"You know they've lost the plot when I find myself agreeing with Candace Owens,\" Karen Attiah, a columnist for The Washington Post who has been critical of Israel and voiced support for Palestinians, wrote on X, sharing the conservative commentators \"genocide\" post.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has maintained his position on a two-state solution, which would recognize Palestine and Israel as two separate states in an effort to promote peace in the region.\n\nHowever, Biden, along with progressive senators like Bernie Sanders of Vermont have refrained from calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Senator Dick Durbin , an Illinois Democrat, became the first senator to do so on Thursday, with the caveat that Hamas releases over 200 hostages that were taken during its surprise attack on Israel last month.\n\nAn X user who goes by Sydney commented: \"The fact that elon musk and candace owens are sharing this opinion while joe biden isn't really shocks me.\"\n\nMusk announced on October 28 that his company SpaceX would help humanitarian groups in Gaza communicate with Starlink internet terminals after Israeli airstrikes cut almost all internet and cellular communications in the region.\n\n\"This world is in shambles why is candace owens finally making sense,\" X user who goes by Kira commented, while user Q. Anthony Ali wrote, \"Candace Owens straight yamming on Zionists was NOT on my 2023 bingo card.\"\n\nOwens, however, received backlash from some of her fellow conservatives.\n\nDarrell Scott, a pastor and former advisor to former President Donald Trump , wrote on X: \"Candace Owens implied that Israels retaliation against Hamas is genocide. I tried to tell the 'Right' that she was fulla [poop emoji], but they didn't wanna listen. She's now biting the hand(s) that have been feeding her for years.\"\n\nOwens also got into a tiff with conservative political commentator Dave Rubin.\n\n\"Well as I'm sure you know Candace, the Palestinian population has 5x'd in a few decades,\" Rubin wrote on X, alongside a graph of Palestinian population growth. \"But thank you for taking a strong stand against Hamas' stated genocide of the Jews, which is in their charter.\"\n\nOwens replied: \"What's amazing about this is that I did not name any country in this tweet. I simply stated that genocide is wrong- ALWAYS. This is not a controversial stance. Interesting how you interpreted it.\"\n\nIn a follow-up post to Rubin, she wrote: \"In short- If the blanket statement that genocide is wrong upsets you in any way, then you need to check yourself.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nMeghan Markle has been mocked by Candace Owens after a reporter sought to explain her help for Los Angeles wildfire victims during the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's visit to the wildfire zone.\n\n\"She stooped down and she picked up the lid of a plastic bin,\" Owens said in a TikTok clip. \"And that's how I knew my girl was real, and I just want to thank Meghan for doing that. It's very helpful for her to stoop down and do that.\"\n\nOwens told Newsweek in a statement: \"I agree with the general public sentiment that Meghan and Harry are inauthentic ambulance chasers.\"\n\nMeghan and Harry's visit to the wildfire zone sits neatly within the remit of a traditional royal engagement, but the fact the couple are no longer working royals appears to have landed badly with some people.\n\nThey were likely not helped by the fact much of the news footage showed them talking to World Central Kitchen staff and Pasadena Mayor Victor Gordo or walking through ruined streets rather than packing boxes with aid for victims.\n\nHowever, it remains the case that the Sussexes appear to be in the same negative spiral with conservative Americans that they had been in with conservative Brits prior to quitting the royal family.\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry toured fire-ravaged neighborhoods as well as visiting a Pasadena site where World Central Kitchen were offering disaster relief last Friday.\n\nOwens shared a clip of an interview with Gordo, in which the reporter said: \"It looked as if the two of them might want to really be helpful, as I saw actually Meghan Markle , like, stoop down and take off the lid of a plastic bin. Do they really want to get down and dirty?\"\n\nOwens said: \"If there's any plastic bins that you guys see around that need picking up, you can hit up your girl Meghan Markle. It's amazing.\n\n\"I really just got such a chuckle out of that description. It's just such a nonsense. Nobody cares. Send money, send food, it's about what these people need.\n\n\"They need donations, they need a place to live, they need hotels. That's not to say they aren't doing that, I'm sure perhaps they are in the background, but I just don't understand this visit.\"\n\nBREAKING: Meghan Markle Took OFF The Lid of a PLASTIC Bin!\n\nShe also mocked Meghan's decision to postpone her Netflix show With Love , Meghan .\n\n\"Meghan, our duchess, has decided that she's going to push the Netflix series, the one that we showed you of her cooking, its so relatable.\n\n\"She felt that maybe it would not be relatable at this time to see her cooking in a mansion that belongs to one of her friends and inviting over her rich and fabulous people as she gets honey out of the garden and presents perfect Martha Stewart-looking cakes.\n\n\"They thought maybe it's not the right time, it was kind of devastating that they're going to have to push that but then people will be able to watch it at a later time.\"\n\nThe clip of Owens' comments was liked 27,000 times and viewed 550,000 times after being posted on TikTok .\n\nNot everyone agreed with Owens, as one comment on her post read : \" I like Candace , but the Meghan Markle hate is ridiculous.\"\n\nAnother commenter said : \"I don't understand how a reporter's question of one moment of Meghan volunteer work, probably in the middle of doing something, is now a bit to again criticize Meghan.

She specializes in delivering in-depth news and live blog reporting and has experience covering U.S. presidential debates, awards shows, and more.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nConservative political commentator Candace Owens was just denied a visa to enter New Zealand for a speaking engagement, weeks after she was refused a visa by Australia, according to immigration officials.\n\nThe Australian visa denial came after Owens made past remarks that minimized the Holocaust and made controversial claims about Islam and slavery, causing officials to object to those remarks.\n\nOwens, who has built a substantial following on YouTube with over 3 million subscribers on the platform, had planned to speak in several Australian cities and Auckland, New Zealand, in February and March. Despite her visa issues, tickets for the tour remain on sale, and the promoter's website has not made statements on the exclusions from both countries.\n\nNew Zealand Immigration spokesperson Jock Gilray said that Owens' visa application was rejected because New Zealand law prohibits granting permits to individuals barred from entering other countries, The Associated Press reported on Thursday.\n\nImmigration New Zealand told Newsweek, \"INZ has declined the application from Candace Owens for an Entertainers Work Visa .\n\n\"Under section 15(1)(f) of the Immigration Act, an individual may not be granted a visa to come to New Zealand if they have been excluded from another country.\"\n\nIt added that the application was declined on November 19, 2024.\n\nAustralia's rejection, however, was more explicit. Immigration Minister Tony Burke said in October that Owens \"downplay[ed] the impact of the Holocaust\" and claimed \"Muslims started slavery.\" He also said that Owens \"has the capacity to incite discord in almost every direction\" based on the aforementioned comments.\n\n\"Australia's national interest is best served when Candace Owens is somewhere else,\" Burke added.\n\nOwens has created controversy in the past by making inflammatory remarks about Jews, Muslims, and transgender individuals. In July, she sparked backlash after saying that accounts of the Nazi medical experiments conducted on twins by Josef Mengele in concentration camps sound \"completely absurd\" and like \"bizarre propaganda.\" This statement reportedly influenced Australia's decision to bar her from entering the country.\n\nThe Nazi doctor was known for performing cruel medical experiments on prisoners at the Auschwitz concentration camp.\n\nOwens announced her speaking tour in August, promising audiences discussions of free speech and her Christian faith. Owens nor her event's promoter, Rocksman, have commented publicly on the decision from New Zealand.\n\nNewsweek has reached out to Owens for comment via an email sent from the website of Blexit, a grassroots conservative movement she co-founded.\n\nHer speaking tour in Australia was scheduled to begin on November 17 in Melbourne, with tickets ranging from $95 for reserved seating to $1,500 for a VIP package that included a pre-event meal and a meet-and-greet with Owens. The tour also included stops in Sydney, Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane.\n\n\"Join us for an electrifying evening with Candace Owens, the outspoken and fearless American conservative social commentator, author, activist, and YouTube sensation,\" a description of the show on ticketing website Ticketek reads. \"Known for her controversial takes and unwavering stance, Candace is set to light up stages across Australia and New Zealand with her bold and unfiltered perspectives....this is your opportunity to experience firsthand the intellect and fearlessness that has captivated millions around the globe.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Owens left The Daily Wire, a right-wing website, earlier this year amid reported tensions with editor emeritus Ben Shapiro over their opposing points of view on Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nShe has been increasingly critical of Israel, writing on X, formerly Twitter , last November that \"no government anywhere has a right to commit a genocide, ever. There is no justification for a genocide. I can't believe this even needs to be said or is even considered the least bit controversial to state.\" Israel has denied accusations of genocide.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation Commission (ADC), a pro-Jewish group that pushed to bar Owens from Australia, welcomed Burke's decision to reject her visa application.\n\n\"This is a victory for truth, for decency, and for the millions of Jewish souls and millions of others whose memory she so shamelessly desecrated,\" the group's chairman Dvir Abramovich said in a statement provided to Newsweek in October. \"The decision by the government to bar Owens sends a resounding message: Australia has no place for those who mock the suffering of genocide survivors and insult the memories of the 6 million Jews who perished. This is a line in the sand.\"\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League (ADL) says Owens has \"come to espouse explicitly antisemitic, anti-Zionist and anti-Israel views,\" while LGBQT+ advocacy organization GLAAD has listed several occasions when she has expressed allegedly transphobic views on social media.\n\nUpdate, 12/02/24, 1:59 p.m. ET: This article was updated to include Immigration New Zealand's comment.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nAmanda M.

In the 44-minute Instagram live video, Owens said Klacik's charity Potential Me was illegitimate, that Klacik was a stripper at a club owned by her husband and that she misused campaign funds, according to the lawsuit. . . .\n\nOwens . . . has not taken down the video despite multiple letters from Klacik that the allegations were false, according to the suit. . . .\n\nIn the video, Owens says she is \"not an investigative journalist,\" and \"could not confirm\" any of the criminal allegations she makes against Klacik. But she went on to accuse Klacik of \"money laundering, tax fraud and campaign fraud,\" as well as paying vendors to \"move money off the books\" and working to recruit strippers for a strip club Owens says Klacik's husband owns, according to the lawsuit.\n\nBoth Klacik and Owens are prominent African-American women who supported President Trump.

In July, podcaster Candace Owens said reports of experiments conducted on Holocaust victims sound \"like bizarre propaganda.\" The Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany published a 2020 survey showing a deficiency in Holocaust knowledge among younger Americans. A new approach to preserving the facts of the past is needed.\n\nThe Netflix docuseries Hitler and the Nazis: Evil on Trial is narrated by William L. Shirer, an American war correspondent and author of The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich - despite Shirer dying in 1993. Director Joe Berlinger used an AI recreation of Shirer's voice to recite passages from his books alongside audio from his actual radio broadcasts. Visually, the series interweaves gut-wrenching dramatizations with colorized 80-year-old footage.\n\nBerlinger sought to reach a younger audience with the six-part series that examines the Nazis \"from pre-WWII to the Holocaust to the Nuremberg trials.\" How do you do that? \"Embrace the tools of cinema that they're used to,\" Berlinger says .\n\nThe picture revealed is frighteningly familiar: a strongman figure, dehumanization of entire ethnic groups, increased support for immigration restrictions. (Nazism was greatly influenced by the eugenicist arguments that buttressed the era's restrictionist American immigration laws.) The 58 percent of survey respondents who believe \"something like the Holocaust could happen again\" seem attuned to the dangerous echoes reverberating today.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Who Are the Least and Most Antisemitic Americans by Ideology?\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nDavid Bernstein | 5.26.2024 10:30 AM\n\nI happened across this very interesting and provocative paper by Fordham political scientist Jeffrey Cohen .\n\nCohen starts by noting the two dominant theories of antisemitism and poltiical ideology in the United States. One theory holds that antisemitism can be found on the extreme right and the extreme left. A second holds that people on the left are least antisemitic, and are more likely to be antisemitic the further right one goes.\n\nCohen has a third theory. I can't do justice to his methodology in a short blog post, but essentially he criticizes prior researchers for relying on self-declared political ideology, and for excluded \"don't knows\" from their analysis.\n\nThe uphot is that the least antisemitic Americans are mainstream liberals and conservatives. The most antisemitic are the extreme left, the extreme right, as one of the theories noted above suggests, but also low information voters, who skew survey results by often self-identifying as \"moderate.\"\n\nCohen's explanation for these results is interesting. He argues that the mainstream elite in the US has been philo-semitic since the 1950s. People who have mainstream political views and take their cues from mainstream sources follow that mainstream consensus. But those who take their cues and get their news elsewhere are, obviously, less influenced by this consensus and thus much more likely to hold antisemitic views. This includes far leftists and far rightists, but also, crucially, people of inchoate ideology who are alienated from the mainstream.\n\nCohen doesn't get into this, but the upshot isn't a happy one for American Jews. Increasing numbers of Americans don't trust the \"establishment\" and take their cues and get their news from extremists or demagogues just looking for clicks. Consider how many young people rely on TikTok, of all things, for information. This helps explain the rise in antisemitism in recent years. It also helps explains why so many Jews were intuitively uncomfortable with Trump and his blowing up of the Republican mainstream, which has indeed helped cause a rise in antisemitic nonsense proliferating on the right (I'm looking at you Candace Owens). It's also why Biden's failure to articulate and implement a defense of the Democratic mainstream from the far left has left many Jews-- especially many Jewish liberals who find themselves under attack in Progressive circles that seek to exclude \"Zionists\"--extremely uneasy.\n\nI suspect, though, that Trump and Biden are more symptoms than causes. The establishment, often (but not always) for good reasons, lost the faith of large swathes of the American public. And it's not clear what the \"mainstream\" is anymore in the current media environment. NPR, for example, once an exemplar of mainstream liberalism, has taken a hard turn to the left since 2016 and especially 2020. Meanwhile, social media has allowed the media environment to fracture such that successful media outlets generally are ones that appeal to people's pre-existing prejudices rather than challenging them. Further evidence, I suppose, for Frankin Foer's thesis that the golden age of American Jews is ending.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Both the Left and the Right Are Exaggerating the Threat Posed by Facebook\n\nFacebook\n\nRobby Soave | 5.5.2021 6:00 PM\n\nCharged with determining whether Facebook erred in suspending former President Trump following the January 6 Capitol riots, the Facebook Oversight Board-which exists solely for the purpose of taking difficult content moderation decisions out of Mark Zuckerberg's hands-essentially shrugged and returned the decision to Facebook. The board did rule, however, that the indefinite suspension was inconsistent with the the company's policies, and Facebook should revisit the matter in the next six months.\n\nA conceivable outcome of this ruling is that Facebook will eventually decide, sometime later this year, that it has little choice but to un-ban Trump. Indeed, the board criticized Facebook for \"applying a vague, standardless penalty.\" One might have expected tech-skeptical conservatives to be somewhat pleased with this ruling, since it was ultimately a rebuke of Facebook, and one that hints at the potential return of Trump.\n\nInstead, the right had a meltdown.\n\n\"Twitter and Facebook are Fascist companies,\" tweeted (yes, tweeted) Candace Owens. \"We should all begin slowly migrating away from their platforms.\"\n\nRachel Bovard of the Conservative Partnership Institute opined that the actual issue was Facebook's \"hegemonic control over global political speech, reinforced today by the platform anointing itself with the moral authority to memory hole future world leaders at their own discretion.\"\n\nFacebook has neither hegemonic control over political speech nor memory-hole powers-indeed, the former president recently engaged in political speech with Owens, possibly offering her the veep slot if he runs again-and yet many conservatives argue that the Facebook Oversight Board's decision was not merely wrong but evidence that Facebook's powers supersede the U.S. government's.\n\n\"A multi-national corporation just assumed a supranational level of sovereignty and is LARPing as a government,\" fretted Will Upton, a conservative public relations specialist formerly with the U.S. Treasury.\n\nJ.D. Vance, a likely Republican candidate for Ohio's U.S. Senate seat in 2022, upped the hysteria even further: \"The Facebook oversight board has more power than the United Nations,\" he said.\n\nFacebook is indeed a powerful and influential company, but these people all need a reality check. The social media site does not wield nearly as much power as actual governments. Facebook doesn't drop bombs on its enemies or send troops to bust down their doors and kill them. Facebook can't put people in jail, or confiscate their money, or forbid them from gathering in groups, or force children as young as three to wear masks while they play sports outside . The only thing Facebook can do is stop people from posting on Facebook.\n\nThe right's escalation of Facebook moderation policies to an extinction-level threat is extremely unhelpful, as it obscures some legitimate concerns about how the media bullies the company into making bad calls, as well as issues with the various hypocrisies -often unintentional-produced by uneven enforcement. But to hear conservatives tell it, we are supposed to believe that Facebook's existence has singlehandedly ended the American experiment in representative democracy.\n\n\"Allowing near-trillion dollar companies like Facebook to act as political partisans, censoring one side while amplifying the other, is tantamount to election interference and represents an existential threat to our democracy,\" asserted Jon Schweppe of the American Principles Project in a characteristic post on this subject. \"It simply cannot be allowed to go on. We all know what happened in 2020. By censoring advertisements , banning conservative influencers, and falsely fact-checking verifiably true content, Facebook and other social media companies swung the election to Joe Biden.\"\n\nWhat's especially telling about this sort of panic is that it perfectly mirrors liberals' own ongoing freakout about Facebook. Indeed, with only minor changes to Schweppe's statement, it would be identical to something Rachel Maddow or Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) might say: We all know what happened in 2016. By allowing Russian-backed influence operations to spread viral disinformation, Facebook and other social media companies swung the election to Donald Trump.\n\nForget the millions of dollars the campaigns spent on their own advertising on television, the radio, in print, and elsewhere: A handful of misleading Facebook posts and/or bad moderation calls were the decisive factors. Clearly.\n\nWhile liberals and conservatives can't agree on which side is supposedly receiving an unfair advantage from social media, they increasingly agree on the solution: break up Big Tech.

      "text": "YouTube Algorithms Don't Turn Unsuspecting Masses Into Extremists, New Study Suggests\n\nSocial Media\n\nLiz Wolfe | 4.26.2022 8:40 AM\n\n\"Over years of reporting on internet culture, I've heard countless versions of [this] story: an aimless young man-usually white, frequently interested in video games-visits YouTube looking for direction or distraction and is seduced by a community of far-right creators,\" wrote Kevin Roose for The New York Times back in 2019. \"Some young men discover far-right videos by accident, while others seek them out. Some travel all the way to neo-Nazism, while others stop at milder forms of bigotry.\"\n\nNever one to dial back alarmism, The Daily Beast put out a headline in 2018 calling YouTube's algorithm a \"far-right radicalization factory\" and claimed that an \"unofficial network of fringe channels is pulling YouTubers down the rabbit hole of extremism.\" Even MIT Technology Review sounded the alarm in 2020 about how \"YouTube's algorithm seems to be funneling people to alt-right videos.\"\n\nA new study by City University of New York's Annie Y. Chen, Dartmouth's Brendan Nyhan, University of Exeter's Jason Reifler, Stanford's Ronald E. Robertson, and Northeastern's Christo Wilson complicates these popular narratives. \"Using paired behavioral and survey data provided by participants recruited from a representative sample (n=1,181), we show that exposure to alternative and extremist channel videos on YouTube is heavily concentrated among a small group of people with high prior levels of gender and racial resentment,\" write the researchers. \"These viewers typically subscribe to these channels (causing YouTube to recommend their videos more often) and often follow external links to them. Contrary to the 'rabbit holes' narrative, non-subscribers are rarely recommended videos from alternative and extremist channels and seldom follow such recommendations when offered.\"\n\nThe researchers were precise in their definition of what constitutes a \"rabbit hole.\" They also distinguished between \"alternative\" content-Steven Crowder, Tim Pool, Candace Owens-and \"extremist\" content-Stefan Molyneux, David Duke, Mike Cernovich. (Methodological information can be found here .)\n\nLess than 1 percent-0.6, to be exact-of those studied by the researchers were responsible for an astonishing 80 percent of the watch time for channels deemed extremist. And only 1.7 percent of participants studied were responsible for 79 percent of the watch time for channels deemed alternative. These study participants typically found those videos by having watched similar ones previously.\n\nBut how many people studied by the researchers watched innocuous videos and were led by algorithms from those videos toward extremist content? This occurred in 0.02 percent of the total video visits that were studied, for a grand total of 108 times. If you apply an even stricter definition of rabbit holes and exclude cases where a viewer was subscribed to a similar extremist or alternative channel and followed an algorithmic suggestion to a similar one, rabbit holes become even more rare, comprising 0.012 percent of all video visits.\n\nBasically, the narrative that hordes of unwitting YouTube browsers are suddenly stumbling across far-right extremist content and becoming entranced by it does not hold much water.\n\nInstead, it is people who were already choosing to watch fringe videos who might be fed extremist content by the algorithm. It's the people who were already Alex Jones-curious, per their own browsing habits, who receive content about Pizzagate and how the chemicals in the water supply are turning the frogs gay and who veer toward Cernovich or Duke types. (Duke himself was banned from YouTube two years ago.)\n\nPlenty of tech critics and politicians fearmonger about algorithmic rabbit holes, touting these powerful algorithms as explanations for why people get radicalized and calling for regulatory crackdowns to prevent this problem. But this new study provides decent evidence that the rabbit hole concern is overblown- and , possibly, that the steps YouTube took to tweak their algorithm circa 2019 have led to the relative absence of rabbit holes. The changes \"do appear to have affected the propagation of some of the worst content on the platform, reducing both recommendations to conspiratorial content on the platform and sharing of YouTube conspiracy videos on Twitter and Reddit,\" write the researchers.\n\n\"Our research suggests that the role of algorithms in driving people to potentially harmful content is seemingly overstated in the post-2019 debate about YouTube,\" Nyhan tells Reason, but \" people with extreme views are finding extremist content on the platform. The fact that they are often seeking such content out does not mean YouTube should escape scrutiny for providing free hosting, subscriptions, etc. to the channels in question-these are choices that the company has made.\"\n\nAlgorithm tweaks have not stopped tech journalists and politicians from frequently bloviating about YouTube radicalization , regardless of whether their rabbit hole critique remains true today.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "'There Shall Be None to Make Him Afraid'\n\nHeretics, trolls, and the defects of illiberal religious politics.\n\nOne of the many benefits of political liberalism is that it provides a means of avoiding other, less desirable forms of liberalism, such as theological liberalism and social liberalism. When people are treated equally under the law, when their rights to speak and publish, to worship, and to engage in commerce are all secure, then under the shelter of that political liberalism we discover room for profound disagreements-philosophical, political, moral, religious.\n\nBut first, Ben Shapiro.\n\nI like Ben. I don't know him very well, but he has always struck me as a smart and decent guy, and he has helped me promote books over the years. I like to think-and I do hope that I am right about this-that he is basically the Andy Kaufman of the New New Right, that one of these days he's going to sell his company for a billion dollars or two or six and then sail off into the sunset, two middle fingers raised to all the rage-addled rubes whose money he took over the years. In the earliest days of the Trump phenomenon-back when Breitbart was publishing antisemitic attacks on its former editor-at-large and the Trump campaign was using the Star of David as an emblem of corruption-guys like Ben had a choice: Go big or go home. Ben's a graduate of Harvard Law-he was going to be just fine if he went home. But he decided to go big on the most lucrative kind of Trumpish and Trump-adjacent political entertainment. I am with Don Corleone on this stuff: I don't judge a man for how he makes his money, but I know a dirty business when I see one. There's a difference between profit-seeking and bad faith, but the balance can be delicate. That being said, I'm pretty sure Ben Shapiro hired Candace Owens-and a lot of the other dopes who work for him-because he thought it would be good business, not because he thought she was smart or interesting, that her contributions to the public discourse were going to help right this teetering republic.\n\nBut as another big-time gangster put it : You lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas.\n\nThe messy departure of Candace Owens from Shapiro's Daily Wire media empire amid disagreements about Israel and accusations of antisemitism has generated a great deal of imbecilic Jew-hater trolling, which, given the history of persistent antisemitism in this political tendency- e.g. , Ben Shapiro and Breitbart three paragraphs above-should surprise exactly no one. Naturally, this has, in turn, generated a great deal of gleeful commentary in progressive quarters. (\"A dirty business.\")\n\nOne of the odd tics of progressive rhetoric in our time is its heresy-hunting. It isn't enough to identify bad actors doing bad things; contemporary progressivism needs to understand discrete episodes in terms of some overriding idea, the pollution of which can be usefully attributed to other political targets, however vaguely connected to it. \"Great replacement theory\" is a version of this. There are some kooks and cranks who believe that shadowy (no doubt Jewish) powers are scheming to replace this country's ethnically distinct Anglo-American stock (which exists mainly in their imaginations) with swarthy immigrants who can be more readily made into easily controlled welfare dependents. But there are also some well-intentioned and well-informed critics of Democratic political ambitions who observe that progressives have for years sincerely professed a version of something broadly similar: the notion that immigration-driven demographic changes would create an \" emerging Democratic majority ,\" as the famous book put it. (Do check out Ruy Teixeira's conversation with Jonah Goldberg about his much-discussed and often misunderstood book, co-authored with John Judis.) Of course, many Democrats do indeed believe-and hope-that they will benefit politically from increased Latin American immigration, but point that out and you can bet that some pissy mediocrity writing in New York magazine will brand you a great-replacement theorist , and, as such, a heretic.\n\nThe Shapiro-Owens kerfuffle has caused some progressive writers to turn their attention to \"supersessionism,\" a Christian doctrinal question involving the relationship between the Old Covenant (the ancient one between God and His chosen people) and the New Covenant (established by the death and resurrection of Jesus). Supersessionism is really more of a rhetorical issue than a religious one: The theological details matter a great deal, of course, but if there is a universally attested bedrock of Christian orthodoxy, it is that the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus created a new kind of relationship between God and man, distinct from the relationship God entered into with the Israelites, a particular people. The Old Testament prophet Jeremiah spoke of a coming \"new covenant,\" and Christians maintain that their religion is the fruit of that new covenant. The Epistle to the Hebrews , traditionally attributed to Paul, is the prime supersessionist text, reading, in part: \"The ministry Jesus has received is as superior to theirs as the covenant of which he is mediator is superior to the old one, since the new covenant is established on better promises. For if there had been nothing wrong with that first covenant, no place would have been sought for another.\"\n\nWriting in Slate, Molly Olmstead claims that the Catholic Church \"officially rejects\" supersessionism, which is not exactly right. What the Catholic Church has been at pains to reject in recent years-and particularly in the work of the Second Vatican Council-is antisemitism and antisemitic doctrines. Supersessionism is not itself inherently antisemitic, but it can be put to antisemitic purposes-as, indeed, can almost everything that is religiously distinctive about Christianity at all, which is what you'd expect from a religion that separated itself from Judaism.\n\nThe theological tension here comes from two Christian beliefs that can be difficult to reconcile: One, that God is faithful, not a breaker of promises, and hence not inclined to revoke His covenant with the Jewish people; two, that Christianity (in Catholic belief, the Catholic Church per se) is the only means to salvation. Without going too deep into the weeds, you can get an idea of the approach from the very straightforwardly titled \"Notes on the Correct Way to Present the Jews and Judaism in Preaching and Catechesis in the Roman Catholic Church,\" part of a body of work commissioned by Pope John Paul II in 1982, a passage from which I have lightly edited (removing citations of additional church documents) in the interest of legibility:\n\nChurch and Judaism cannot ... be seen as two parallel ways of salvation, and the Church must witness to Christ as the Redeemer for all, while maintaining the strictest respect for religious liberty in line with the teaching of the Second Vatican Council.\n\nThe urgency and importance of precise, objective, and rigorously accurate teaching on Judaism for our faithful follows too from the danger of antisemitism which is always ready to reappear under different guises. The question is not merely to uproot from among the faithful the remains of antisemitism still to be found here and there, but much rather to arouse in them, through educational work, an exact knowledge of the wholly unique bond. which joins us as a Church to the Jews and to Judaism. In this way, they would learn to appreciate and love the latter, who have been chosen by God to prepare the coming of Christ and have preserved everything that was progressively revealed and given in the course of that preparation, notwithstanding their difficulty in recognizing in Him their Messiah.\n\nThe question of supersessionism comes up not only in the context of Christian-Jewish relations but also (more often, I estimate) in discussions of prophetic literature, in which there is some debate (and a great deal of genuine doubt) about whether certain references to Israel, Jerusalem, et al. are intended as references to the country in the Middle East or more allegorical references to Christians and the Christian church as God's people. As a Pole born in 1920, Pope John Paul II was sensitive to antisemitism and to Catholic contributions to it, both cultural and religious. He advised Christians to think of Jews as our \"elder brothers in faith,\" which seems to me the right way to think about it. But he also insisted on a quite orthodox interpretation of the Christian mission that would have been recognizable to popes who served in office a millennium before he did, as much as they might have been surprised by (even scandalized by) his affectionate attitude toward Jews and Judaism. There is a tendency among us moderns, suffering from the bias of presentism , to think of the last 50 or 60 years as the most relevant epoch of Christianity, a religion now in its 21st century.\n\n\"Witness to Christ as the Redeemer for all, while maintaining the strictest respect for religious liberty,\" is advice that depends on political liberalism rather than theological liberalism.\n\nAnd my point here is political rather than religious. There is a reason Christianity and Judaism are separate religions: The truth claims of each are mutually exclusive. For Christians, the most important issue is not whether a person is good, nice, decent, or moral-it is his relationship with Jesus. And Christians and Jews disagree about the issue that is most important to Christians, the one that defines Christianity. A Christianity and a Judaism that were religiously compatible with one another would not be Christianity and Judaism-they would be diminished things.\n\nThere are a few different ways to deal with that situation: One version of illiberalism holds that somebody wins and somebody loses, and that Christians, having the upper hand in terms of numbers and political power, are entitled to impose their religion on society at large, to whatever degree they feel necessary and with only those accommodations demanded by their own forbearance. (That this is a profoundly un-Christian attitude has not stopped many Christians from embracing it.) Another version of illiberalism disguises itself as liberalism, and it insists that both Christianity and Judaism be denuded of everything that makes each distinctive, that these and all other religions be reduced to some version of the Church of Niceness, and that this orthodoxy be imposed on society at large, through formal and informal means. Genuine liberalism takes a different approach: It takes for granted that people living in a free and open society of any meaningful size or complexity will have profound, wrenching disagreements about fundamental issues, and that the job of the state and of civic institutions (including the schools) is not to scrub religions, political platforms, and creeds of anything potentially offensive but rather to create a political space in which community life can be lived peaceably.\n\nThere is more to authentic political liberalism than what the law says and what the Supreme Court will allow-it necessarily involves the cultivation of essential civic virtues oriented toward mutual respect, toleration, and a genuine appreciation for the real organic diversity of a society such as ours. There are certain civic duties that naturally fall more heavily on the majority populations (\"Why is there no White History Month, huh?\") and on the dominant religious and cultural tendencies, and some civic necessities that fall in a more particular way to minority groups. (There is, after all, an entire religion founded on a very aggressive understanding of supersessionism: Islam. But we take a relatively indulgent view of minority religions, usually for good reasons.)\n\nIn a society with real political liberalism, the question of how Christians think theologically about their Jewish neighbors is not a particularly urgent one for public life. Mature people understand that living with fundamental disagreements is part of being a good citizen: a good Christian citizen, a good Jewish citizen, a good Muslim citizen, a good atheist citizen, etc. But without that political liberalism, what you end up with is either constant bitter conflict or some kind of (ruthlessly) enforced theological and social liberalism, one that tries to deal with the disagreement by eliminating it rather than by respectfully conceding its legitimacy.\n\nWhile we have enjoyed decades worth of reinforcement of the formal structures of political liberalism-thanks in no small part to the conservative legal movement's successful advocacy of religious freedom, freedom of speech, and a robust interpretation of the constitutional bulwark of our civil rights-we have lost some of the civic and cultural buttresses of that liberalism that are necessary virtues of citizenship. And there is a certain political tendency within Christianity that has been ... not particularly helpful on that front . Owens' partisans have taken to tweeting \"Christ is King\" at Shapiro and other Jewish critics-a political statement rather than a religious one.\n\n(If you really believe that Christ is King , then act like it.)\n\nAmerica has always had more than its share of Jew-hating weirdos, and it still does. But we also look to the example of George Washington, who wrote to the Jewish community at Newport:\n\nThe reflection on the days of difficulty and danger which are past is rendered the more sweet, from a consciousness that they are succeeded by days of uncommon prosperity and security. If we have wisdom to make the best use of the advantages with which we are now favored, we cannot fail, under the just administration of a good Government, to become a great and a happy people.\n\nThe Citizens of the United States of America have a right to applaud themselves for having given to mankind examples of an enlarged and liberal policy: a policy worthy of imitation. All possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship. It is now no more that toleration is spoken of, as if it was by the indulgence of one class of people, that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights. For happily the Government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance requires only that they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens, in giving it on all occasions their effectual support.\n\nIt would be inconsistent with the frankness of my character not to avow that I am pleased with your favorable opinion of my Administration, and fervent wishes for my felicity. May the Children of the Stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other Inhabitants; while every one shall sit in safety under his own vine and figtree, and there shall be none to make him afraid. May the father of all mercies scatter light and not darkness in our paths, and make us all in our several vocations useful here, and in his own due time and way everlastingly happy.\n\n\"Everyone shall sit in safety under his own vine and fig tree, and there shall be none to make him afraid.\" If you are looking for a summary of the American way, there it is.\n\nIt is remarkable to me that so many professional writers will go to such lengths to avoid the perfectly respectable word \"foreign.\" E.g. , Jim Newell writing in Slate about the proposal to rename Dulles Airport for Donald Trump, who never flies commercial.\n\nIn a way, it could be a perfect passing of the torch. The current namesake, John Foster Dulles, worked to overthrow international governments; his would-be successor, the domestic one.\n\nThat's a good line-clever.\n\nBut there are no \"international governments\" that can be overthrown-there are \"foreign governments\" that can. International things are things that are between nations, that involve more than one nation: international agreements, international travel, international trade, etc.\n\nThe government of Germany isn't international (not in this century, anyway!)-it's just German, and foreign. Germans are foreign to Americans, and Americans are foreign to the Germans. (Though maybe less foreign-seeming: The world always has Americans in its face, which is why your average resident of Lagos or Bangalore knows a heck of a lot more about Americans than Americans know about the people in Lagos or Bangalore.)\n\nYes, people sometimes spit foreign as invective. But it is a word that means something, and what it means is not international. Like alien and illegal alien , we need a term for the thing we are talking about, and it is better if that term is a word or words that actually say what they are meant to mean.\n\nA Most Remarkable Creature: The Hidden Life of the World's Smartest Birds of Prey is Jonathan Meiburg's very interesting book about the caracara. Very smart, nicely written, and offering an account of something you probably don't know much about-what's not to like?\n\nApple is being sued on antitrust grounds , under Ye Olde Sherman Act.\n\n(Some of our pro-choice friends scoff that current attempts to regulate the distribution of abortifacients under the Comstock Act rely on a \"long discredited, arcane 150-year-old law,\" as Sen. Tina Smith, a former Planned Parenthood ghoul, put it in the New York Times . The Sherman Act and the Comstock Act both date from the late19th century, and both of them are-inconvenient though the fact may be!-the law of the land, neither \"discredited\" nor \"arcane,\" words that do not mean, \"politically inconvenient.\")\n\nApple's iPhone business is a funny kind of monopoly to be going after: Its worldwide share of the smartphone market is around 20 percent and its domestic market share is about 60 percent -solid, but hardly a monopoly. But our antitrust law doesn't require an actual trust to be anti -, or a real monopoly, or anything like that. What getting a lawsuit rolling requires at the moment is ... more or less anything that Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chair Lina Khan can claim is an anti-competitive practice, as though eliminating or reducing competition were not the goal of a whole lot of legitimate business strategies. The FTC wants to regulate smartphones as \"platforms,\" which essentially means regulating them as though they were utilities, and its lawsuit has an economic theory of Apple's behavior:\n\nLimiting the features and functionality created by third-party developers-and therefore available to iPhone users-makes the iPhone worse and deprives Apple of the economic value it would gain as the platform operator. It makes no economic sense for Apple to sacrifice the profits it would earn from new features and functionality unless it has some other compensating reason to do so, such as protecting its monopoly profits.\n\nThat isn't particularly persuasive. But as a purely economic matter, it is not difficult to think of examples of Apple's forgoing profits for reasons not related to some anti-competitive purpose: Apple famously keeps pornography out of the walled gardens of the App Store and the iTunes Store. There may be a long-term economic argument for that-Steve Jobs had a very particular idea of the kind of user experience he wanted Apple products to offer-but you'd have a hard time quantifying that economically. It is a matter of taste and a hunch about business. A million years ago, when Apple first decided to start selling music, the firm picked a price of 99 cents per song not because that was profit-maximizing but because of a hunch about consumer psychology, i.e. , that people who had been stealing musically digitally would pay 99 cents for a better experience and in order to feel like customers rather than scofflaws. There was surely an anti-competitive element in that strategy-but it also created the digital music business and paved the way for the streaming model we now take for granted.\n\nIt is difficult to argue that consumers are being ill-treated by innovations in the mobile phone market. Look at it over a timeline that extends past the day before yesterday: That big Motorola brick that Gordon Gekko carried around cost the equivalent of about $12,000 for the handset and a few bucks a minute to make a call-and that was all it did, for the few scant minutes of talk time it offered. Unlike a few other products and services that leap to mind-say, higher education and health care-smartphones and personal technology get cheaper and better every year, a testament to what free-market innovation can accomplish. If college or diabetes treatment had improved in price and quality the same way mobile phones have over the past several decades, we'd be living in a radically different and radically better world .\n\nLina Khan is smart. The markets are smarter, and we should let them work.\n\nSimply not being Donald Trump-and being to the centrist side of Bernie Sanders-was enough for Joe Biden to win the election in 2020. It probably won't be this time around. There may not be enough Trump-weary Republicans to have won Nikki Haley the primary, but there probably are enough to win Joe Biden the general. So, why isn't he trying to win them over?

Of interest is this working paper from Canadian politician and law professor Irwin Cotler. An excerpt:\n\nWhat is intrinsic to each form of Antisemitism-and common to both-is discrimination. All that has happened is that it has moved from discrimination against Jews as individuals in their respective host societies-a classical Antisemitism for which there are indices of measurement; to discrimination against Jews as a People-and Israel as the collective Jew among the nations-a new Antisemitism for which one has yet to develop indices of measurement.\n\nThe essay is very much worth reading-and acting on.\n\nKevin D.

      "text": "The Ka-Ching Theory of Truth\n\nWhether something is true on social media matters less than whether it gets eyeballs.\n\nDear Reader (except those of you who really, really should know better)\n\nSo I've reached the conclusion that arguing that antisemitism is bad has reached the point of diminishing returns.\n\nOne of the things that can make this chapter of American life so ass-achingly stupid is that the demand for plausible hot takes dwarfs the available supply. The key word being plausible, because plausibility requires some fidelity to facts and reason.\n\nAnd just to be clear, I love me some plausible hot takes, particularly about history, because a lot of the established narratives about the past are exactly that-narratives.  The literary critic and historian Leon Edel once said that a \"biographer is a novelist under oath.\" I think that gets at what a lot of history is. Good historians construct narratives about the past they believe are true by selecting the facts that support the story they want to tell-and that they think is true-but also necessarily downplay the facts that undermine that story. Good journalists do the same thing about the present. The best in either field get the weighting more or less right, but there will always be room for alternative interpretations, because life is complicated and people see the world differently. Hindsight is not, in fact, 20/20. If it were, no one would argue about the past. I mean if hindsight were 20/20 why is anybody arguing about the history of the Middle East, slavery, the Catholic Church, capitalism, imperialism, baseball, or, well, anything, including \"the Jews\"?\n\nBy now, it's a cliché to talk about how social media and the internet have served to knock down the old walls and dethrone the \"gatekeepers.\" I was one of those conservatives who, for a very long time, thought this was mostly a good thing. The hegemony of the old media deserved to be toppled. A handful of newspapers, magazines, and television networks-90 percent of which were headquartered within walking distance of one another in New York City-manufactured a political consensus that places like National Review were founded to stand athwart, yelling stop. Now, with the benefit of hindsight-as unreliable as it sometimes is-it seems obvious to me that some valuable things were lost.\n\nOne thing the internet in general (and social media in particular) does is flatten the topography of political discourse into a two-dimensional space. Mountaintops seem no taller than valleys. Accumulated knowledge has no altitude over knee-jerk instant conclusions. If something seems superficially true, or even superficially plausible, that's given equal weight to things with deep foundations and layers of established fact. For instance, the other week, Candace Owens-who has all the learning of a lobotomized amnesiac- explained that Israel was like the Jim Crow South because Jerusalem has a \"Muslim Quarter,\" which was all she needed to know to assert that it's a ghetto and the only place where Muslims are allowed to live. She couldn't be bothered to google or read a Wikipedia page before making her claim of Israeli anti-Muslim apartheid (22,000 people live in the Muslim Quarter , 350,000 Muslims live in Jerusalem). To name another example, Tucker Carlson's Patriot Purge was a farrago of half-truths, whole lies, and decontextualized facts about the January 6 Capitol riot that constructed a seemingly plausible façade for a giant pile of bullsh-t.\n\nWilliam James proposed that under his conception of philosophical pragmatism, truth should be measured by what has \"cash value.\" Now before some Owens-type reads that and thinks James was arguing for a capitalist scheme that monetizes truth claims, that's not what he meant at all. He merely meant that the veracity of claims should be tested in the real world based on their consequences. Now, I have monumental problems with James' consequentialism. But the ironic thing is that the Owens types seem to actually believe the stupid version of measuring truth by its \"cash value.\" Like literally. Whether something is true-or, again, even plausible-is an afterthought. What matters is what will boost engagement, traffic, eyeballs. It's the Ka-Ching theory of Truth.\n\nBecause truth and falsehood look equal in two-dimensional space, the incentive structure is all screwed up. Repeating boring truths doesn't pay. Spewing transgressive, shocking, attention-grabbing falsehoods that get people riled up and confirm their angriest or darkest passions is where it's at. Hot takes that confirm our \"Main Character Syndrome\" and fuel our self-regard as rebel-victim-martyr-heroes get eyeballs in our attention economy. The better mousetrap of hot takes that has people knocking down your door-on the right and left-generally takes the form of, \"That thing they tell you is bad is actually good.\"  Taboos are bad because you're not the boss of me. Third rails must be touched because touching them makes me a rebel.  Established truths need to be unsettled, according to the Chomskyites at either end of the horseshoe, because the establishment uses them to manufacture consent, or something.\n\nThis explains the Vesuvian eruption in hot take idiocy on TikTok this week in which scads of kids declared that they found Osama Bin Laden's \"Letter to America\" was some profound manifesto of truth-telling. A cocktail of Jihadist death worship and Chomskyite anti-Americanism was the perfect elixir for young know-nothings desperate to stay drunk on their own ignorance.\n\nWhich bring us to antisemitism. Telling people antisemitism is bad is like telling Donald Trump he cannot press the Big Red Button on his desk. The mere act of saying it invites people to say, \"Well actually ... \"\n\nSo instead let me try to explain why antisemitism is stupid.\n\nElon Musk got himself into yet another briar patch this week by endorsing a ridiculous claim that the Jews have been fomenting hatred against white people.\n\nOn Wednesday night a Jewish X-user posted, \"To the cowards hiding behind the anonymity of the internet and posting 'Hitler was right.' You got something you want to say? Why dont you say it to our faces.\"\n\nSome white nationalist dufus responded:\n\nJewish commun[i]ties have been pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them.\n\nI'm deeply disinterested in giving the tiniest shit now about western Jewish populations coming to the disturbing realization that those hordes of minorities that [they] support flooding their country don't exactly like them too much.\n\nYou want truth said to your face, there it is.\n\nTo which the richest man in the world-and an immigrant himself- responded , \"You have said the actual truth.\"\n\nBefore I get to the main point, let me just note something here. The jagoff who can't muster the most minuscule fecal particulate of sympathy for \"Western Jewish populations\"-that's a whole lot of Jews-who are being attacked or vilified is endorsing collective punishment for an entire people, a great many of whom do not hold any of the B.S. views he ascribes to them. And so is Elon Musk.\n\nSpecifically, he's endorsing the version of the Great Replacement holding that \"the Jews\" have been importing dusky hordes of Third Worlders with the aim of replacing white people. That's why the tiki-torch peckerwoods in Charlottesville chanted \"The Jews will not replace us.\"\n\nI have never understood why \"the Jews\" would want to do this, and to my knowledge no one has mustered any remotely sane explanation. It's almost as if the reasoning goes: A bad thing is happening, therefore the Jews must be responsible.\n\nBut let's assume that \"the Jews\" are as smart and as powerful as this theory contends. Let's even assume that they decided upon the policy of importing millions of Middle Eastern immigrants to the U.S. and the West. These are the same immigrants who have a disproportionate tendency to hate Jews and Israel, as we've been reminded in the last month. Surely at one of the meetings some Rabinowitz or Greenberg would have chimed in and said, \"Hey maybe we shouldn't let those people in.\"\n\nBut that's the thing, there are no such meetings. And even if there were, how exactly are they supposed to make this immigrant importation thing work ? To believe that \"the Jews\" have the power to make these sorts of things happen-with no paper trail, no whistleblowers, no exposes-is every bit as plausible as saying we subsidize sugar in this country because the Lizard People want it that way.\n\nI'm Jewish, though not particularly observant. But you know what? I know a lot of Jews. I know a lot of important Jews, and I know a lot of important people who happen to be Jewish.  And guess what? They all disagree with each other about, well, almost everything. We are a disputatious lot. George Soros is Jewish. So was Sheldon Adelson. The GOP got a lot of money from Adelson. Democrats, particularly left-wing Democrats, get a lot of money from Soros. But to listen to a lot of hot takers out there you can lump them both under the category of \"Jewish financiers.\" That's the term Charlie Kirk deployed to defend Musk's endorsement of a white supremacist.\n\nOf course, Kirk just says \"some\" \" Jewish financiers \" have funded \"anti-white\" stuff. And you know what? That's sort of true. You know what's also true? Some Jewish financiers have funded groups opposed to said \"anti-white\" stuff, including Kirk's own organization . So what does the Jewish part have to do with anything? You know who else has funded cultural Marxism or \"anti-white\" nonsense? Episcopalians, atheists, and agnostics. It's funny though, if you said \"Episcopalian financiers\" or \"Agnostic financiers\" that would sound ridiculous. But \"Jewish financiers\" is so edgy and cool.\n\nThis gets to the core of the idiocy undergirding so much antisemitism. It treats \"the Jews\" as a monolithic block, as if there's a transitive property indicting all Jews for the actions or beliefs of some Jews.  Again, I think that's bad because, you know, that's textbook bigotry. If I hold Tom Sowell accountable for the statements of Cornel West, or the actions of some inner-city carjacker, that's racism.* But if I put \"the Jews\" in the dock, for actions or statements by Noam Chomsky or Bernie Sanders, well that's different because, wink-wink, \"the Jews.\" But it's also just really stupid.\n\nLet's zoom out. For antisemites, wherever bad things happen you can find a Jew, and that proves that Jews were behind it. The tragic and inconvenient thing is that if you look hard enough you can often-by no means always-find some Jews involved in bad things. But you can also find them involved in good things-that just doesn't count. Sometimes, when you can't find some convenient Jews people just make up Jewish involvement. (There are even some asinine fantasies about how Jews were behind the Holocaust. I won't link to them.)\n\nAntisemites who hate capitalism, Karl Marx most famous among them , count noses among the capitalists and say, \"Capitalism is a Jewish thing.\" Antisemites who hated Soviet communism, Hitler most famous among them, count noses among the Bolsheviks and declare \"it's a Jewish thing.\" Antisemites who hate Marxism love to point out that Marx came from a once-Jewish family. His grandfather was a rabbi, but Marx's father converted to Lutheranism. But don't you dare blame Lutheranism for Marxism. (No, seriously, don't blame Lutheranism for Marxism, that would be stupid.) Jews get dinged for being too cosmopolitan and for being too clannish, for being meddling philanthropists and for being too stingy. In country after country, Jews were told they were unwelcome in mainstream society and then they were demonized for sticking together too much. A handful-you know the ones who weren't peasants or shopkeepers-were told they had to be moneylenders because moneylending was a sin for Christians in Medieval Europe and then they were demonized for being moneylenders. Sorry, \"financiers.\"\n\nAt various points they've been kicked out of Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Iran, France, England, and Spain, to name a tiny fraction of places . They've been harassed, ghettoized, demonized around the world. But they're supposed to run the world? Man, are they bad at it. But in response to millennia of persecution, the survivors moved back to the first country they were expelled from, Israel. And the response to that is. \"How dare they?\"\n\nMy own view is that antisemitism is a dye marker for other societal pathologies. Out of painful necessity, Jews learned some habits that will serve one well in any society. They emphasize education, hard work, thrift, mutual aid and cooperation, etc. These bourgeois habits are the original success sequence. When some Protestant sects started behaving in the same way, it's hailed as \"the Protestant work ethic.\" When Jews do it, it's considered cheating. When societies indulge their illiberal tribal instincts, Jewish distinctiveness stands out and is seen as a threat. Jews are the original \"other\" in Western civilization. That's why it should come as no surprise in this asinine moment when tribalism in all its ancient and modern forms is seen as a source of authenticity and rebelliousness that it is coming back with such vengeance among the tribalists in all parties. I would like for people to recognize it as a bad thing. But I'd settle for people recognizing it as such a stupid thing.\n\nVarious & Sundry\n\nCanine update: Many of you have probably heard by now that Zoë had a terrible week. I took her to the vet on Monday for a dental cleaning. She had a few teeth removed a year or so ago. But her bad breath had come back with such vengeance that her panting could cause birds to fall dead out of the sky. The vet found abscesses that were so infected they threatened her jawbone.  So they said they wanted to pull 21 teeth. They settled for 18. When my wife texted me the news, I started to cry. Zoë had been so scared at the vet and I already felt so guilty. Yes, I know I am a giant softie when it comes to my dogs, but I think you knew that. Anyway, the first day or two she was a pathetic mess with a swollen snoot and raspy breath, walking around like John Belushi doing a Joe Cocker impersonation. But her appetite was good and she didn't seem to hold too much of a grudge against me. She's rebounded amazingly well. We didn't let her go on walks with Kirsten for a couple days. But then yesterday when Kirsten came by, Zoë was so happy to see her and so eager to go, Kirsten couldn't say no. And Zoë did great. She still struggles eating some things and the mix of a new, softer diet (including ice cream !), and her pain meds had her farting for a couple days to the point where we should have bought carbon offsets. She has enough of her show teeth that she still has a good dingo smile . Both Pippa and Gracie gave her ample space. They're all good girls.\n\nI'll just add that I'm really touched by all of the people who reached out this week. The whole Canine Update was started when she had parvo (which I think may be the original cause of her bad teeth). I know some people don't care about the dog stuff and that is totally fine. But it's gratifying to know that a lot of folks appreciate it-and them.

      "text": "Here's to You, Mr. Robinson\n\nWill the North Carolina Republican spoil Trump's reelection bid?\n\nAll you need to know about the modern right is that Mark Robinson is only its third-most popular black Nazi.\n\nWell ... \"Nazi\" might be a bit strong to describe Kanye West and Candace Owens, although only a bit . But it's a fair cop for Robinson if this new CNN report is accurate. Allegedly, it's how he once described himself.\n\nRobinson is the GOP candidate for governor in North Carolina. We've gotten used to Republicans nominating \" the craziest son of a b-ch in the race ,\" in the words of Rep. Thomas Massie, but Robinson's credentials on that point are so sterling that they belong in the window at Tiffany's. Even before CNN went digging through his internet archives and turned up comments about \"Martin Lucifer Koon\" and the virtues of slavery, he had built a reputation as an unusually loose cannon by the already very loose standards of right-wing populism.\n\nLoose enough that he was apparently promoting Holocaust denial years before Republican edge lords decided that promoting Holocaust denial was cool .\n\nNot everything unearthed by CNN was as troubling as that, but some of it might pose a political problem for Robinson regardless. \"I like watching tranny on girl porn! That's f-ing hot!\" he once allegedly wrote on an internet forum. To each his own, but in Donald Trump's party of culture war, it's anyone's guess whether finding trans women titillating is more or less forgivable at this point than being a \"free-thinker\" about slavery.\n\nAlthough Robinson denies that he left any of the comments CNN attributed to him, the circumstantial evidence of authorship is overwhelming. (He claims it's all a dirty trick somehow concocted via AI .) He vowed after the story broke that he wouldn't withdraw from the race, giving the North Carolina Republican Party little choice but to stick by him .\n\nNone of which is very interesting, frankly, as Republican candidates grossing everyone out and being dutifully defended by party apparatchiks anyway is another thing we've all gotten used to. \"Mark Robinson is wackadoodle\" is a dog-bites-man story at this point in the 2024 cycle.\n\nBut there are two interesting facets to it. One is how much more credulous populists were on Thursday about the Robinson scandal du jour relative to the average Trump scandal du jour. \"It's very rare that a story on a Republican that's treated like a bombshell by establishment media actually is one; but this one really is,\" Breitbart reporter Matthew Boyle wrote of CNN's investigation, capturing the vibe among the MAGA faithful. \"It was very tough to see a pathway for Robinson before this. Now, it's basically gone. This guy is in serious trouble.\"\n\nRobinson is indeed in serious trouble . He's en route to being Mastriano'd , i.e., getting blown out in what should have been a winnable gubernatorial race in a swing state by a Democratic attorney general named Josh.\n\nBut even more interesting than populists' scandalous double standard toward scandals was the timing of the CNN report. Why is this appearing now?\n\nWhen a news outlet drops a bomb on a political candidate, the munition was often prepared with help from the opposing party. Parties employ opposition researchers to gather dirt on the other side, then launder that dirt at an opportune moment through reporters who are hungry for a scoop. That's politics.\n\nBut Thursday wasn't an opportune moment for North Carolina Democrats to attack Robinson. The opposite, in fact: It turns out that midnight on Thursday evening was the state's deadline for candidates to withdraw before ballots were printed. By publishing when it did, CNN gave Republicans a last-second chance to convince Robinson to drop out and to replace him with a more electable candidate, their own version of the Democratic switcheroo in the presidential race.\n\nIf Democrats had supplied CNN with the dirt in this case, one would assume it would have come with the condition that it couldn't be published until after the withdrawal deadline had passed. They want Robinson in this race! And of course they want to maximize the political impact of any oppo research they've assembled on him, which logically should mean releasing it in mid- or late October, not now.\n\nIt's Republicans who had an incentive to give Robinson a hard shove before the withdrawal deadline.\n\nLocal party figures have known for a while what was coming about their candidate, it seems. Conservative radio host Erick Erickson claims that , as far back as last year, North Carolina consultants warned him that \"there were lots of bad things that would come out about Robinson including 'weird online sex stuff' or something like that.\" As the gubernatorial race turned uncompetitive in August , Republican leaders might have lost hope for a comeback and dropped a dime on him at CNN in hopes of shaming him out of the campaign ASAP.\n\nSwapping him out this month for a more respectable Republican nominee might have conceivably had the same energizing effect on the right as swapping out Joe Biden for Kamala Harris had on the left. But I'm skeptical: Robinson is now far behind, much further than Biden was relative to Trump when he quit, which would have left any replacement nominee with an improbable amount of ground to make up and much less time than Harris had to do it.\n\nI don't think it was the race for governor that made local Republicans anxious about Robinson, as they've presumably already written it off. I think it was the presidential race, and in particular how Robinson's cavalcade of disgrace might potentially influence it.\n\nHarris' ascent in polling has been especially steep in North Carolina , where Trump's lead of more than 5 points over Biden was cut instantly in half by the new Democratic nominee in July and kept on eroding. By mid-August, it was down to 1.5 points; by the end of the month, just half a point. As I write this on September 20, Trump is ahead by ... one-tenth of a point. A state won by Republicans in 10 of the last 11 presidential elections , with nearly as many Electoral Votes as Pennsylvania, is suddenly dead even.\n\nAnd now here's the party's gubernatorial nominee in a marquee statewide race with scandals blowing up around him like he's on the golf course at the end of Caddyshack .\n\nCould Trump's chances of holding North Carolina be collateral damage?\n\nBefore Biden dropped out, some Democrats argued that he might squeak out victories in the swing states with help from candidates down ballot.\n\nNormally, it's the candidate at the top of the ticket who drags everyone else over the finish line, not vice versa. But liberals noticed that their party's Senate candidates in battlegrounds were polling quite well relative to the president and wondered if voters turning out for those Senate races might end up holding their noses and voting for Biden as well.\n\nIt was an inversion of the idea that popular presidential nominees have \"coattails.\" Maybe in 2024 there'd be reverse coattails, with the nominee riding the popularity of his party's lesser officers.\n\nDemocrats are now eyeing North Carolina and wondering if Robinson will have reverse coattails for Trump-except by carrying Trump to defeat instead of victory.\n\nThis strikes me as wishful thinking. Mostly.\n\nNo justice would be more poetic than Donald Trump losing the presidency thanks to a candidate who wouldn't have been viable in American politics but for Trump's own influence. Trumpism taught Republican voters to treat their own moral scruples as \"weakness\" and to prize vacuous politically incorrect pugnacity in candidates instead. That's how you get Mark Robinson, which in turn is how you get blown out in a gubernatorial election, which in turn is how, per the wishful thinking, Trump ends up losing North Carolina as anti-Robinson sentiment bleeds over into his own vote share.\n\nIt's a nice thought. But there's a reason \"coattails\" is a familiar concept and \"reverse coattails\" is not: Parties are defined by their leaders, especially in presidential election years and especially when that leader is as colorful and domineering as Donald Trump. The \"reverse coattails\" theory seemed plausible-ish with respect to Joe Biden because Biden was/is a remarkably weak political personality amid his senescence, barely president at all. Under those circumstances, one could imagine voters taking their cues from Senate candidates instead.\n\nTrump is different. He's so vivid and singular a persona that he reliably turns out voters who otherwise don't bother much with politics. And because he's so remarkably polarizing, any election in which he's on the ballot tends to be \"about\" him. It's far more likely that Mark Robinson will overperform his polling due to Trump fans turning out en masse for the GOP than that Trump will underperform his polling due to revulsion at Robinson.\n\nBesides: By what theory, precisely, is Mark Robinson's candidacy an affront to decency yet Donald Trump's is not? It wasn't Robinson who said on Wednesday that if he loses in November \"in my opinion, the Jewish people would have a lot to do with a loss.\" Both men seem to be sexually licentious, unusually vicious in their political rhetoric, and way too comfortable with bigots . If you've successfully normalized Trump, as all Trump supporters in North Carolina have, Robinson shouldn't cause any crisis of conscience.\n\nAnd even if he did, Trump's unique stature as leader of his party, godfather of modern right-wing populism, pope of his own cult of personality, and martyr in an ever more elaborate persecution narrative should insulate him from any spillover.\n\nWhat's strange, though, is that North Carolina Republican officials ... do seem worried. The fact that they (probably) tried to drive Robinson out of the race this week suggests they think he might have reverse coattails for Trump and are eager to eliminate the risk.\n\nHow can that be? Well, start with the margins. If this state is destined to end in a photo finish a la Georgia or Arizona in 2020, a \"reverse coattails\" effect could be tiny but still decisive. A few thousand right-leaning centrists growing gradually more disgusted with Robinson's perpetual scandal machine before Election Day might turn them off of voting altogether. That could potentially be curtains for Trump.\n\nAlso noteworthy is the fact that Harris is performing considerably better with suburbanites in North Carolina this year than Biden did in 2020. Four years ago, he won just 39 percent of that cohort, far below his national average of 50; Harris is currently polling at 51 percent by comparison. Chronic exposure to Robinson's toxic gonzo populism over the next six weeks could compound some undecided suburbanites' preexisting misgivings about Trump and tip them over into preferring Harris.\n\nEspecially since, as noted, Trump and Robinson are birds of a feather. It would be easy for centrist voters to compartmentalize voting Republican for president but not for governor if the two candidates were worlds apart temperamentally. But when they're of a piece, and when Trump is on video lavishing praise on Robinson ...\n\n... maybe the righteous contempt they've already developed for one will goose a sense of righteous contempt for the other. The Trump-Robinson tandem is practically built in a lab to make Reaganites blanch and think, \"This has gone too far. It's time to burn it all down.\"\n\nIs that worth an extra 3 points, say, in North Carolina for Kamala Harris on Election Day? Not remotely. Is it worth an extra three-tenths of a point? Not unthinkable. And the further behind Robinson falls in his race, the more freakishly huge the ticket-splitting at the top of the ballot will need to be in order to get Trump over the hump.\n\nWith the polling the way that it is, three-tenths of a point there could decide the entire national election. And so ultimately the presidency may come down to a single question.\n\nHow many Mike DeWines are there in the North Carolina suburbs?\n\nThere were many depressing (yet funny) reactions on the right to CNN's Robinson scoop after it dropped. For instance, behold the populist drug dealer wondering why everyone around him keeps overdosing. \"Perhaps the American primary voter should start nominating normies for high office. I dunno. Just a thought,\" Daily Wire co-founder Ben Shapiro tweeted .\n\nShapiro gave Candace Owens a platform for years at The Daily Wire and announced this spring that he'd host a fundraiser for Trump , in case you're wondering how much he values normalcy. That he felt obliged to frame his objection to Robinson in electoral rather than moral terms illustrates my point earlier about the ethics of Trumpism: One gets the sense that if Robinson were on track to win his race, Ben would have shrugged and let the CNN story pass without comment.\n\nAnother downer came from right-wing pollster Patrick Ruffini, who concluded that the GOP's enduring problem with nominating lunatics is the fault of ... former Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey? \"Who were the big-name GOP candidates capable of unifying the entire party who stepped up to run against Mastriano and Mark Robinson,\" Ruffini tweeted Thursday . \"If you're upset that the GOP is blowing a Senate opportunity in AZ, for instance, a lot of the blame for that rests with Doug Ducey not running.\"\n\nThe reason no \"big-name GOP candidates capable of unifying the entire party\" stepped forward to challenge Robinson, of course, is because those candidates have been hunted to near-extinction. Every mainstream Republican on Trump's enemies list who's thinking of running for office now knows they're guaranteed a serious primary challenge eagerly backed by Trump and a bevy of threats made against them and their families by Trump's nuttier minions.\n\nDoug Ducey, Chris Sununu, Charlie Baker, Mark Brnovich, Jeff Sessions, and many others either opted against running to spare themselves that aggravation or did run and predictably ended up getting squashed. If their reluctance to challenge the likes of Robinson upsets you, blame the vindictive dirtbag at the top who'd rather lose winnable races than see his antagonists within the party succeed.\n\nOr blame Republican primary voters, whose appetite for demented populism is so voracious that they've been known to prefer the craziest son of a b-h in the race even when Trump prefers someone else . What Jonathan Chait describes as the GOP's \"wackjob problem\" is as much a problem of demand as supply.\n\nThe most depressing commentary I saw on Robinson, though, had nothing to do with him or with North Carolina. It came from Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, one of the more honorable people left in the party who's done an especially honorable job lately.\n\nOn Friday, DeWine published an op-ed in the New York Times hoping to set the record straight about whether dusky foreign usurpers in Springfield are eating pets, as some unusually sleazy demagogues would have you believe . It's not true, the governor insisted. It's not even true that they're a drain on the community. \"Springfield is having a resurgence in manufacturing and job creation,\" he noted, and some of that \"is thanks to the dramatic influx of Haitian migrants who have arrived in the city over the past three years to fill jobs.\"\n\nSpeaking up against a smear campaign that carries poisonous civic consequences is good leadership. But tucked away in DeWine's column is this: \"As a supporter of former President Donald Trump and Senator J.D. Vance, I am saddened by how they and others continue to repeat claims that lack evidence and disparage the legal migrants living in Springfield. This rhetoric hurts the city and its people, and it hurts those who have spent their lives there.\"\n\nIf the candidates you support are hurting your constituents-quite deliberately, for purely selfish reasons- why are you still supporting them?\n\nA few days ago, Jonathan Last wondered how many Republican voters in Springfield would go to the polls this fall and either reward Trump and Vance for their scaremongering or compartmentalize it away as lamentable but not quite disqualifying. One can ask the same question of voters in North Carolina who are disgusted by Mark Robinson, a man elevated by Trump's movement and embraced by Trump himself until 24 hours ago. At what point does the ungodly long list of Trumpist sins at last reach disqualification-length?\n\nAs North Carolinians go with respect to that question, so goes the election.\n\nNick Catoggio is a staff writer at The Dispatch and is based in Texas.

      "text": "Does the CDC Have a Plan to Put High-Risk Individuals in Camps?\n\nNo.\n\nRight-wing provocateur and frequent source of misinformation Candace Owens claimed in a recent viral tweet that the CDC \"actually put together a document to discuss putting high risk people into camps to 'shield' low risk people from them.\"\n\nHoly shit.\n\nThe CDC actually put together a document to discuss putting high risk people into camps to \"shield\" low risk people from them.\n\nNo- this is not a joke, and yes, every single person who has made a reference to 1930's Germany is vindicated. https://t.co/II6gjGtb5e\n\n- Candace Owens (@RealCandaceO) August 9, 2021\n\nOwens linked to a page on the CDC's website titled \"Interim Operational Considerations for Implementing the Shielding Approach to Prevent COVID-19 Infections in Humanitarian Settings.\" As the title suggests, the document discusses how to organize humanitarian settings-such as refugee camps-to limit the spread of COVID-19 infections. It does not describe creating camps for high-risk individuals. The first sentence of the document reads: \"This document presents considerations from the perspective of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) for implementing the shielding approach in humanitarian settings as outlined in guidance documents focused on camps, displaced populations and low-resource settings.\"\n\nThe document was published in July 2020, during the Trump administration, and outlines potential challenges to implementing the \"shielding approach,\" a plan in which individuals at high risk of contracting the virus are separated from those at low-risk of contracting the virus. Again, this document discusses shielding within camps , not, as Owens claims, creating camps for high-risk populations.\n\nCDC public affairs specialist Jade Fulce tells The Dispatch Fact Check that \"These considerations are in response to concepts put forth by [Caroline Favas in] ' Guidance for the prevention of COVID-19 infections among high-risk individuals in camps and camp-like settings ,' and specifically address humanitarian settings.\"\n\nCavas' paper looked at shielding in \"forcibly displaced populations residing in camps or camp-like settings,\" which she identified as \"particularly vulnerable to COVID19 epidemics due to overcrowding, poor access to safe water and sanitation and limited access to health services.\" Given the differences between camps and the general population, Cavas noted that the typical pandemic responses \"such as mass 'stay-at-home' orders, social distancing, self-isolation and quarantine\" would not be feasible in a camp setting and explored shielding as a way to mitigate the spread of coronavirus in that context. The CDC paper was written in response to this research, outlining difficulties that would likely arise from attempting to employ shielding in camps.\n\nOwens did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com .

      "text": "The GOP's Conspiracy Theorist Problem\n\nSeveral candidates running for federal office espouse QAnon beliefs or other fringe political leanings.\n\nThe Republican Party let out a collective sigh of relief when Steve King-a soon-to-be-former Iowa congressman known for his racist and nativist rhetoric-lost his re-election primary in early June. But Republicans are still in a bind. In a partisan political climate that has sown the seeds for fringe candidates to win elections, the GOP is struggling to distance itself from conspiracy-mongering nominees without surrendering key districts to Democratic opponents.\n\nMuch of this can be traced to the QAnon conspiracy theory. Back in 2016, \"Pizzagate\" gained national attention when a man who believed that Hillary Clinton and John Podesta were running a child-trafficking ring out of the Comet Ping Pong pizza restaurant in Washington, D.C., went into the establishment and fired a rifle.\n\nNo one was hurt, and the outlandish claims were quickly debunked. But the vile conspiracy theory didn't totally die. It lingered in dark corners of the internet. And then in 2017, an anonymous user named Q-self-dubbed for his alleged Q level security clearance-took the reins and began posting claims that Clinton would be arrested, adding other allegedly classified intel about her on a public messaging board called \"4chan.\" Mesmerized by Q's cryptic clues (which were, in reality, baseless rumors), anonymous users began obsessively tracking his posts and the QAnon movement took hold.\n\nAccording to conspiracy theory expert and University of Miami professor Joseph Oscinski, Q adopted the Pizzagate theory, \"predicting that Donald Trump would be victorious in the battle against the satanic, pedophile, child sex trafficking deep state.\" Anons believe \"that imminently the 'Great Awakening' is going to happen in which all of the elites who have been engaged in these evil activities are going to be exposed for the evildoers they are, and shipped down to Guantanamo and summarily hung for their crimes.\"\n\nIt sounds far-fetched, like the plot of a bad movie. But now, in 2020 several dozen GOP candidates who align themselves with QAnon have run or are running for Congress. Some have snuck onto the ballot in districts where Democrats dominate and the GOP invests few resources in recruiting candidates. Most have lost primaries and won't be on the ballot in the fall.\n\nBut GOP primary candidates Lauren Boebert, Marjorie Greene, and Jo Rae Perkins have won the hearts of Republican voters in their states. While Perkins secured a Senate primary victory in Oregon and Boebert ousted a Trump-backed incumbent in Colorado's 3rd District primary, Greene is well on her way to win a House GOP primary runoff in Georgia. Laura Loomer-a Republican primary candidate in Florida's 21st District-doesn't endorse QAnon, but her provocative and bizarre behavior is problematic for other reasons.\n\nTogether, they represent a growing problem for Republican leaders: What do you do when your voters choose candidates who espouse fringe, sometimes crazy views? The answer, at least so far? It depends.\n\nQAnon's Oregon contender, Jo Rae Perkins, has no realistic shot at beating her Democratic incumbent, Sen. Jeff Merkley. But she won nearly 200,000 votes in her GOP primary-earning almost 50 percent of the vote in a four-person race-and she has garnered national headlines for some of her bolder proclamations. Lauren Boebert and Marjorie Greene, however, have a real chance at winning the general election in each of their districts. Although a few Republican lawmakers have publicly condemned their campaigns, others have remained silent on the matter or gone so far as to offer endorsements.\n\nIf QAnon sounds like gibberish to you, polls show you're not alone. A Pew Research poll from March 2020 shows that only 3 percent of Americans know \"a lot\" about the theory, whereas 76 percent of those polled know \"nothing at all.\" But the movement still has a huge following on social media platforms, especially Twitter and YouTube, where some accounts boast hundreds of thousands of followers.\n\nQAnon's doomsday flair has even captured the attention of fringe churches, including Omega Kingdom Ministry , which regularly interprets Q drops through a biblical lens. Its pastor, Russ Wagner-who sports a long beard, bears a striking resemblance to KFC's Colonel Sanders, and preaches in front of an American flag backdrop-regularly live-streams YouTube sermons to the channel's 5.4 thousand subscribers. The church is also affiliated with \"Home Congregations,\" a site with extremely disturbing videos narrated by a woman with an ambiguous accent, who warns against Satan-worshipping pedophiles in the Democratic establishment and beyond.\n\nAlthough QAnon's following is just a small part of the dark web, what it lacks in reach it makes up for in intensity, resulting in a groundswell of support for certain fringe candidates.\n\nLauren Boebert is the latest QAnon conspiracy sympathizer to inch toward Congress after beating her Trump-backed incumbent opponent, Rep. Scott Tipton, by 9 points in Colorado's 3rd District Republican primary. President Trump endorsed Tipton the day before the runoff, but he was quick to congratulate Boebert on \"a really great win!\" on Twitter. She even snagged a congratulatory endorsement from former deputy prime minister of Italy, Matteo Salvani, a neo-nationalist populist, following her win.\n\n\"This is a Republican seat and will remain a Republican seat as Nancy Pelosi and senior House Democrats continue peddling their radical conspiracy theories and pushing their radical cancel culture,\" said National Republican Congressional Committee chairman Tom Emmer in a statement.\n\nWith a Twitter bio that proclaims \"Running in Colorado's 3rd to get rid of RINOs,\" Boebert will face off Democratic primary winner Diane Mitsch Bush-who lost to Tipton in 2018-in the general election. In a reliably Republican district that Trump won by a 12 point margin in 2016, Mitsch Bush's progressive agenda will likely leave Boebert smooth sailing to November's general election.\n\n\"Colorado deserves a fighter who will stand up for freedom, who believes in America and who is willing to take on all the left-wing lunatics who are trying so hard to ruin our country,\" Boebert said in a press release after her primary win. Boebert gained national recognition at a Beto O'Rourke rally in September 2019 when she told the former presidential candidate, \"Hell no, you won't take our guns,\" while sporting a glock on her hip. The comment landed her a Fox News appearance the following December.\n\nA die-hard Second Amendment defender who hails from Rifle, Colorado, Boebert owns Shooter's Grill, where she encourages her staff to open-carry while serving customers. She also recently defied Colorado's stay-at-home order by reopening her restaurant in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, which was met by a temporary suspension of her restaurant license by the county.\n\nWhen pressed on her knowledge of QAnon on the \"Steel Truth\" show in May, she said, \"I am familiar with that. And, so, that's more my mom's thing. She's a little fringe. I try to uh, I just try to keep things on track and positive. I am very familiar with it though.\"\n\n\"Everything I heard of Q - I hope that this is real because it only means America is getting stronger and better, and people are returning to conservative values, and that's what I am for,\" she added. The conspiracy \"is only motivating and encouraging and bringing people together, stronger, and if this is real, then it could be really great for our country.\"\n\nIf Boebert offered only a halting embrace of the QAnon conspiracies, Marjorie Greene has shown no such hesitancy. And she's currently a favorite to end up in Congress.\n\nLike Boebert, Greene has captured attention for her brash, own-the-libs campaign strategy, and is expected to win Georgia's fourteenth district seat in the general election. After winning a June 9 primary with nearly twice the number of votes as the runner-up, Greene will be facing Dr. John Cowan in the next primary on August 11.\n\nGreene uploaded a video in 2017 in which she declared, \"Q is a patriot, we know that for sure, but we do not know who Q is.\" She proceeded to say, \"but I'm going to tell you about it, because I think it's something worth listening to and paying attention to,\" adding that \"many of the things that he has given clues about and talked about on 4chan and other forums have really proven to be true.\"\n\nThe rest of the nearly 30-minute video-which is still up as of today-consists of Greene unspooling outlandish conspiracy theories, one of her favorites being Hillary Clinton's alleged sacrifice of a chicken in her backyard to the ancient Canaanite deity Moloch. After explaining Q's prophetic Great Awakening in which deep state Democrats will be held accountable for their sins, Greene says \"I really truly pray that this is true.\"\n\n\"We know cults are real and we know real evil exists, but it hides in the darkness,\" she warns, \"because it doesn't wanna get caught, because when Satanic worshippers and real evil comes out and it's pulled out into the light it can't survive, it just can't survive.\"\n\n\"Now, there's a once in a lifetime opportunity to take this global cabal of Satan worshipping pedophiles out, and I think we have the president to do it, so I'm very excited about that\" she says with a smile.\n\nMore recently, Politico uncovered recordings in which Greene said African Americans \"are held slaves to the Democratic Party\" and that she would feel proud to see Confederate monuments if she were black because they demonstrate the progress American has made since the Civil War. \"I know a ton of white people that are as lazy and sorry and probably worse than black people,\" Greene said on the topic of black unemployment. \"And that has everything to do with their bad choices and their personal responsibility. That is not a skin-color issue.\"\n\nShe called the 2018 House midterms \"an Islamic invasion of our government\"-clearly alluding to the victories by Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib-and said that \"anyone that is a Muslim that believes in Sharia law does not belong in our government.\"\n\nDrew Florio, a spokesman for House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, said \"These comments are appalling and Leader McCarthy has no tolerance for them.\" Reps. Liz Cheney (R-Wyoming) and Steve Scalise (R-Louisiana) are among other key Republicans who have denounced her campaign. The National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Chris Pack said NRCC Chairman Tom Emmer is \"personally disgusted by this rhetoric and condemns it in the strongest possible terms.\"\n\nGeorgia Reps. Austin Scott, Buddy Carter, and Drew Ferguson have publicly endorsed Greene's opponent. But Georgia Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, along with Gov. Brian Kemp, have been noticeably silent on the matter, despite numerous requests for comment.\n\nAnd other key players in the new Republican establishment have rallied behind her. Although Rep. Jody Hice rescinded his support for her campaign the day after Politico released its story, Reps. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs (R-Arizona) stand by their endorsements.\n\nThe National Association for Gun Rights PAC also endorsed Greene's campaign, persuaded by her stalwart defense of the Second Amendment. \"It's good to see a female say things like that,\" said the organization's president Dudley Brown in an interview with The Dispatch. \"It's got the 'I'm the mama bear and I'm gonna protect not my family, but I'm gonna go to Congress and do my part to stop politicians from threatening your family.'\"\n\nThe Dispatch sought answers from Greene's campaign about the race and initially we received no response. But after the distancing from national Republicans earlier in June, the campaign sent us a statement. Greene said she will not let her enemies \"whip [her] into submission,\" and that she's \"sick-and-tired of watching establishment Republicans play defense while the Fake News Media cheers on Antifa terrorists, BLM rioters, and the woke cancel culture, as they burn our cities, loot our businesses, vandalize our memorials, and divide our nation.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, her campaign manager Isaiah Whartman informed The Dispatch that Greene is suing her opponent in response to the \"defamatory television commercial\" his campaign aired that day.\n\nIn a letter obtained by The Dispatch , Greene's lawyer, L. Lin Wood, alleges that Dr. Cowan's commercial \"[accuses] Ms. Greene and Taylor Commercial, Inc. of refusing to use a federally required program known as EVerify,\" and \"falsely [asserts] that Taylor Commercial, Inc. was not found under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's EVerify website.\" The letter says Dr. Cowan is liable for economic damages for defamation.\n\nNo doubt this lawsuit will spice up the race before the candidates face off again in the district's August primary.\n\nOregon Senate primary winner Jo Rae Perkins is also an avowed QAnon believer. She was eager to talk to The Dispatch about her affinity for Trumpism and hatred of the mainstream media. She has been open about public embrace of the QAnon conspiracy movement, having recently disavowed her own campaign's attempt to dissociate her from the conspiracy.\n\nPerkins-who says she gets her news from the Epoch Time s, Fox News, and various podcasts-explained that QAnon uses the Socratic method to crowdsource information. \"We're encouraged to do our own critical thinking and our own research,\" she said in solidarity with the movement, saying it's \"kind of like putting together a massive puzzle.\"\n\n\"If we dare look at something that they didn't put out it's a conspiracy, that it has to be wrong because they didn't sanction it.\" She assured me that she is just a \"mainstream American\" trying to set the facts straight.\n\nBut then she'll say something with a hint of conspiracy-wondering, for example, how Black Lives Matter protesters so quickly produced masks that said \"Defund the Police\" days after Floyd was murdered. \"It could be totally organic,\" adding a caveat, \"then again it might not be.\"\n\nPerkins alleged that money being donated to Black Lives Matter-a movement which she believes has \"gotten out of hand\"-is really being funneled into Act Blue and the Democratic Party, a claim the Dispatch Fact Check recently debunked.\n\n\"And this is where I'm going to get myself in trouble and I recognize that,\" she said, before proceeding. Perkins then alleged that the Black Lives Matter has been \"co-opted\" to victimize African Americans. Perkins added she had faith in far-right pundit Candace Owens, whom she believes is well-suited to put a stop to it. \"We seem to see this thing happening on four-year cycles that kind of coincide with the presidential election,\" she said.\n\nOn the topic of George Floyd, she said \"it certainly looks very damning for that police officer, but in our country you're innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,\" saying she will let the court and the jury come to their decision on how to handle Officer Derek Chauvin, captured on videotape kneeling on Floyd's neck.\n\nPrior to her primary win, Perkins was endorsed by Rep. Mike Nearman, the Right to Life PAC, and the Republican Party of Linn County, her hometown. Oregon GOP Chairman Bill Currier did not respond to multiple requests for comment from The Dispatch .\n\nAlthough QAnon has captured its fair share of news headlines in recent years, Joseph Oscinski told me that the group's popularity is likely \"at or near the ceiling,\" citing a 2018 poll he published in the Washington Post showing that QAnon at the time was \"neither well-known nor well-liked by Floridians in either party.\" He reminded me that a lot of the 2018 headlines about QAnon were, in reality , \"all based on 12 people were in Q shirts to a Trump rally in Tampa,\" and that Twitter activity and media coverage are unreliable measures of public opinion.\n\nMeanwhile one of the more prominent QAnon believers, David Hayes, (he has 300,000 Twitter followers and published a book on the movement) dismissed the Pew Research poll as \"fake news\" and, in an interview with The Dispatch, claimed that there are \"hundreds of millions\" of Q followers.\n\nBut the QAnon conspiracy theory alone doesn't explain why fringe candidates keep winning GOP primaries. Take Laura Loomer, for instance. A former investigative reporter for James O'Keefe's Project Veritas, self-proclaimed Islamophobe, and far-right provocateur, Loomer is running in Florida's 21st Congressional District. She rejected the QAnon conspiracy theory in an interview with The Dispatch , but she worked alongside a man who amplified the Pizzagate conspiracy that led it it.\n\nLaura Loomer and Jack Posobiec, a reporter at One American News, made headlines in 2017 for disrupting an anti-Trump play in Central Park. But their professional relationship crumbled after they began squabbling over who deserved credit for propagating conspiracy theories relating to the Las Vegas shooting of 2017, when Steven Paddock murdered 58 people at a concert.\n\nAccording to The Daily Beast, \"Loomer reported for a website owned by British provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos that members of Congress had been briefed on 'ISIS ties' to the shooting\" in March 2017. Posobiec announced three months later that he would run a segment called \"Inside Las Vegas\" on OANN to peddle other conspiracies about the shooting.\n\nOn Twitter, Loomer condemned Posobiec's failure to cite her original-albeit unsubstantiated-reporting on the topic, which was all based on an unofficial report she found online that was authored by by two former intelligence officials. \"I just thought it was really shady how Jack calls himself my friend, but then he won't give me credit for my work,\" she said .\n\nLoomer has called herself a \"proud Islamophobe\" and has previously referred to Muslims as \"savages\" and \"cancer.\" Most Florida Republicans have avoided commenting on her campaign, but Florida GOP Chairman and state Sen. Joe Gruters embraced her candidacy during an interview with The Dispatch .\n\nIn 2017, she was banned from Uber and Lyft after sending a series of Islamophobic tweets after a terrorist drove a truck down a bike path and killed eight people in New York City: \"Someone needs to create a non Islamic form of Uber or Lyft because I never want to support another Islamic immigrant driver.\" She was also banned from Twitter the following year for calling Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) a \"Jew hater,\" and then from Facebook and Instagram in 2019 for violating user agreements.\n\nLoomer has worked with discredited fabulist Jacob Wohl, locked herself to the doors of Twitter headquarters, and shouted to disrupt a congressional hearing. Loomer has also worked with conspiracy outlet InfoWars after the school shooting in Parkland, Florida.\n\nIn an interview, Loomer called herself \"a one woman squad,\" referring to the collective nickname for progressive firebrands, Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.; Ilhan Omar, D-MN; Ayanna Pressley, D-MA.; and Rashida Tlaib, D-MI.\n\n\"Unlike a lot of other candidates who are running for office who have made promises to take on the squad, I've already taken on the squad during my time as an investigative journalist.\" She spoke to me about her eagerness to make political affiliation a protected class under the Civil Rights Act in her crusade to combat the \"radical left,\" which she believes is \"trying to create a Communist stronghold in our country.\"\n\nIn years past, Loomer's comments toward minorities would push her to the fringes of a typical primary race. But in this age of politics as entertainment, where Donald Trump has pushed past previous boundaries of acceptable rhetoric, she has been endorsed by Jeanine Pirro and Roger Stone ahead over her August 18 primary. Trump himself retweeted two tweets about her campaign.\n\nAs for her support within the state party, Sens. Marco Rubio and Rick Scott did not respond to numerous requests for comment. Florida GOP Chairman and state Sen. Joe Gruters, however, is vocal about his support for her campaign. \"I've developed a close relationship with Loomer,\" Gruters said in an interview with The Dispatch , calling her \"a special candidate.\" Gruters invited her to a news conference in January to discuss his bill, the \" Stop Social Media Censorship Act, \" after which he said, \"I am proud to have Laura Loomer stand with me here today because what we are here discussing is social media censorship, and we are trying to stop the bias.\"\n\nWhen pressed on Loomer's bigoted comments toward Muslims, Gruters said, \"You know what, here's the deal. When you make comments that are powerful in any way, what will happen is you will be judged accordingly.\" The Florida GOP does not endorse candidates, but the chairman's embrace of her campaign may sway voters come election season.\n\nDespite Loomer's unabashed Islamophobia, she still plays the victim card. Loomer criticized Twitter and Facebook's bans against her, telling me her campaign \"is the only de-platformed campaign in the nation\" that has \"been denied intentionally by these big tech social media companies access to campaign social media accounts.\" Loomer decried this as election interference and said her campaign \"has filed an FCC complaint against Twitter for giving illegal in kind contributions to my Democratic opponent Lois Frankel.\"\n\nLoomer moved to the social media app Parler as an alternative to Twitter, where she boasts 600,000 followers and regularly advocates for \"Twexit\"-the collective abandonment of Twitter.\n\n\"People can say what they're going to say,\" Loomer said regarding her disparaging comments toward Muslims over the years. \"But when you look at the tweet that I was banned for [the Omar tweet], it had nothing to do with any of those comments.\"\n\n\"We can sit here and have conversations for days on end about ideologies\" and \"things I may have or may not have said in the past,\" Loomer said regarding her previous anti-Muslim comments. \"But at the end of the day,\" she said, \"it is not hate speech to call a public elected official anti-Jewish, right?\" In her eyes, hate speech is nothing more than a conspiracy theory created by Democrats and the media.\n\nThe rise of these conspiracy Republicans is causing concern in some quarters of the party, with some leaders denouncing the crazy outright and others awkwardly seeking to avoid comment. But movements often take the shape of their leaders and with Donald Trump, an eager amplifier of many false or unproven conspiracies , as the country's most prominent Republican and the party's de facto leader, there will be no distancing the GOP from conspiracy theories-at least for four more months.\n\nAudrey Fahlberg is a reporter for The Dispatch.\n\nPhotograph of Marjorie Greene from Facebook.

Black Lives Matter donations go directly to a superpac called \"ACT BLUE\" that has given hundreds of millions to Democrats running for President. How is this legal? #BLM is LITERALLY a shell company. https://t.co/V57IUCThVo\n\n- Candace Owens (@RealCandaceO) June 11, 2020\n\n100 million dollar question that leftists are refusing to answer:\n\nTo what organization do the funds raised on the Black Lives Matter website go?\n\nBLM raised 40 million dollars in 48 hours because of George Floyd's death. But WHO did Act Blue direct that funding to?\n\n- Candace Owens (@RealCandaceO) June 11, 2020\n\nDid you know:\n\nDonations to Black Lives Matter are funneled through ActBlue, the Democrat Party's main fundraising platform\n\nDoes anyone else think it's odd these BLM riots pop up every four years?\n\n🤔\n\n- Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) June 11, 2020\n\nDaily Beast reporter Lachlan Markay pointed out that Owens's tweets, and Kirk's by extension, are inaccurate-while ActBlue is organized as a political committee , it acts as a nonprofit fundraising tool that serves as a conduit, rather than a collector, for donations. ActBlue's website explains that the platform is available to \"Democratic candidates and committees, progressive organizations, and nonprofits that share our values.\" Such groups can incorporate an ActBlue contribution form into their websites for free-although there is a 3.95 percent processing fee on donations-allowing groups and candidates to raise funds without having to create and maintain their own secure method of receiving donations.\n\nWhile donations go to ActBlue initially, the group delivers the funds to the organization or candidate intended by the donor. It's only possible for ActBlue to redirect funds if the recipient refuses a donation or doesn't cash a check from ActBlue for 60 days. In such an instance, a donation is re-designated as a contribution to ActBlue (if earmarked for a campaign or committee), to support social welfare activities (if earmarked for social welfare organizations), or to ActBlue Charities (if earmarked for a charitable organization). In other words, even if Black Lives Matter were to refuse donations the funds would be given to another similar cause, not the Democratic Party or any political candidates. Donations can be made directly to ActBlue as well to support the organization.\n\nAs a registered political committee, ActBlue is required to report all contributions made through its platform to relevant agencies at either the federal or state level.

Paul Gosar's Claim About the Texas School Shooter\n\nGosar spread misinformation that originated on right-wing platforms.\n\nImmediately after the deadly shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, where 19 children and two adults were killed, Arizona GOP Rep. Paul Gosar began spreading misinformation about the Texas shooter. In a now-deleted tweet, Gosar promoted the false claim that the suspect was a \"transsexual leftist illegal alien.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott identified the gunman as 18-year-old Salvador Ramos, who was killed on the scene.\n\nThe false tweet was up for almost two hours before it was taken down, but has been saved as a screenshot below.\n\nThese same false rumors have been spreading on right-wing platforms , as reporters Matt Binder and Ben Collins pointed out, with users sharing a picture of a transgender person from Reddit who is unrelated to the incident but has been incorrectly identified as the Texas shooter.\n\nRight-wing provocateur Candace Owens wondered what might cause \"an 18 year old to murder innocent children,\" and then answered her own question: \"Judging by photos of him cross-dressing, we can assume there were plenty of signs that he was mentally disturbed and abused by adults in his life.\" Owens did not provide evidence to support her speculation and did not respond to our request for comment.\n\nWhat's drives an 18 year old to murder innocent children?\n\nI don't know.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nConservative activist and author Candace Owens argued on Monday that Black voters are choosing President Trump over Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden because Black Americans \"want more opportunities.\"\n\n\"You want to put Biden back in office, he is the person along with Barack Obama who gave Black America more handouts. Donald J. Trump is giving us more handups,\" The BLEXIT founder told \" Mornings with Maria \" on Monday, the day before Election Day.\n\n\"We don't want more food stamps, we want more opportunities,\" she added.\n\nHost Maria Bartiromo noted that rappers Ice Cube , 50 Cent , Lil Wayne and Kanye West have been \"vocal and outward in terms of their support for President Trump.\"\n\nShe then asked Owens what she thinks is behind that.\n\n\"I think these are the pioneers,\" Owens responded, adding that she spoke to other hip-hop artists, basketball players and singers who expressed their support for Trump to her in private.\n\n\"It is much bigger than you could possibly imagine behind closed doors and there is something happening,\" Owens said.\n\n\"Time is up on the Democrat Party when it comes to Black America,\" she added. \"You cannot come around every four years and say to Black Americans, 'You're a victim, you're a victim, you're a victim, we're going to help you' and then the second we put you in the White House you turn around and pretend that we were never there.\"\n\nOwens went on to say that \"the left wants to keep Black Americans impoverished, poor and uneducated.\"\n\nTRUMP $500B BLACK AMERICA PLAN DESIGNATES KKK, ANTIFA AS 'TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS'\n\nShe stressed that she wants \"our kids learning engineering, I want our kids learning mathematics so they can grow to become competitive and not grow up to see themselves as victims.\"\n\n\"Donald Trump does not see Black Americans as victims and that is what Black Americans are starting to understand especially young Black men,\" Owens continued.\n\nShe also said that she doesn't believe the polls \"for one second.\"\n\nBiden held an 81-point lead over Trump among Black voters, according to Pew Research data posted on Oct. 9. However, data analysis released by The New York Times on Wednesday showed that the so-called racial gap among voters has shrunk since 2016 as Trump has picked up support from both Black and Latino voters.\n\nOwens said that a couple of weeks ago the polls \"were saying that Black America was only at 8%, saying it was unchanged since 2016. I've never laughed harder.\"\n\n\"Now they're saying 14%. Oh, what a difference. I think we're at 20%,\" she continued.\n\nOwens also said she thinks Black Americans are going to vote for Trump and are not vocal about it because they fear being laughed at and called names.\n\n\"When they get in the booth, they're going to do the right thing and they're going to vote for a president that actually believes that Black Americans are just like all Americans,\" Owens said, adding that Trump is the candidate \"who believes that philosophy.\"\n\nBoth Trump and Biden were making their final pitches to Black voters ahead of Election Day, including presenting competing plans to invest in Black communities.\n\nThroughout the race, Trump has harped on the record-low Black unemployment seen before the coronavirus pandemic, while Biden chose Sen. Kamala Harris , D-Calif., as his running mate, making her the first Black and Indian American woman on a major-party presidential ticket.\n\nBiden's Plan for Black America focuses on economics, education and justice reform. His plan includes \"ensuring equal access to credit and capital\" for Black entrepreneurs and improving teacher diversity in public education.\n\nMeanwhile, Ice Cube has praised the Trump campaign for taking interest in his \"Contract with Black America\" proposal before the election. Last month, the rapper applauded the president's \" Platinum Plan ,\" which would include creating 3 million new jobs in the Black community over the next four years, increasing access to capital by nearly $500 billion and strengthening Trump's immigration policies to protect American jobs, according to his website .\n\nLast week Ice Cube told \"Mornings with Maria\" that he's \"pleading to not only the government but the private sector to come up with a solution that can help America.\"\n\nICE CUBE RESPONDS TO SCARBOROUGH, MAKES PLEA FOR BLACK AMERICA: 'WE REALLY NEED HELP'\n\nHe stressed that the financial inequality issue is a big reason as to why \"we have all the problems in the street.\" Riots and violence have erupted in cities across the country after the death of George Floyd , a Black man who died in Minneapolis police custody in May.\n\n\"I'll disagree with Ice Cube on this one point,\" Owens told Bartiromo on Monday. \"We don't need more government handouts. What we need is to do things on our own.\"\n\n\"We are capable of doing things on our own, but we have to be awake to the lies of a Democrat party,\" she continued. \"We don't need more government assistance. We need our families put back together, we need a stronger education system and we need to be looked at the same as every single person in the country.\"\n\n\"We are Americans first and foremost,\" she stressed.\n\nFOX Business' Evie Fordham contributed to this report.\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

Roughly $60,000 was instead given to her company Washpoppin, Inc. for \"campaign event production,\" according to campaign records reviewed by the Beacon.\n\nThe money was allegedly paid to the rapper on Dec. 12, almost a month after the comment was made, but it is not clear what the timeline of the payment agreement was.\n\nObama was allegedly paid $95,576 for \"travel expenses\" through his firm Renegade44, LLC.

Part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign also reportedly paid Oprah Winfrey's production company Harpo $2.5 million to produce a campaign event in Michigan on Sept. 19.

During the same year, all renewable energy sources combined represented 20% of U.S. electricity generation - compared to natural gas at 40%, nuclear at 20%, and coal at 19%.\n\n\"Our transportation sector has reached a turning point,\" Vice President Kamala Harris declared last week in announcing an administration initiative to \"expand clean public transit and school buses, reduce emissions from dirty diesel trucks, and create good-paying jobs.\"\n\n\"We have the technologies to transition to a zero-emission fleet,\" said Harris, as the White House announced $17 million in funding from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for electric zero-emission and low-emission school buses. \"Our administration together, all of us, is working to make that possibility a reality.\n\n\"We can clean our air and protect the health of our children. We can connect all our communities for affordable, accessible, and reliable public transportation. We can address the climate crisis and grow our economy at the same time.\"\n\nGas prices averaged $4.17 per gallon last week, their highest level since 2008 .\n\n\"Vice President Kamala Harris and DOT Secretary Pete Buttigieg spent the afternoon promoting electric vehicles and Green New Deal policies,\" teeted Rep. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.) in response to the administration rollout of its clean transit initiative. \"Are you kidding me? The Biden Administration could not be more tone deaf.\"\n\nIn order to meet the Biden administration's goal of net-zero emissions in the U.S. by 2050, virtually all gas-powered vehicles would have to be replaced \"with cleaner electric vehicles charged largely by low-carbon power sources such as solar, wind or nuclear plants,\" the New York Times reported in March 2021 .\n\nAutomakers would have to stop selling gas-powered vehicles by 2035, and 350 million electric vehicles would be needed by 2050, according to the article.\n\n\"Doing so would also require a massive expansion of the nation's electric grid and vast new supplies of battery materials like lithium and cobalt,\" the Times reported. \"One possibility is that the nation reaches a tipping point: As more and more plug-in vehicles start appearing on the roads, gas stations and crude oil refineries start closing down, while auto repair shops shift to mainly servicing electric models. Eventually, it might be too much of a hassle for people to own conventional gasoline-powered cars.\"\n\nMIT economist Christopher Knittel told the Times such a transition \"would not shock\" him.\n\n\"Right now it can be inconvenient to own an electric vehicle if there are no charging stations around,\" he said. \"But if we do get to a world where there are charging stations everywhere and few gas stations around, suddenly it's less convenient to own a conventional vehicle.\"\n\nThe Daily Wire host Candace Owens on Wednesday suggested there is a connection between the transition to electric and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"The West is attempting to rapidly divest from oil and force its citizenry into electric and they need a war to do it,\" she tweeted. \"All of these corrupt leaders are long on electric (hence clearing the way for China to mine lithium-rich Afghanistan). The entire world is an energy map.\"\n\nAndrew Wheeler, former administrator of the EPA under former President Trump, told the John Solomon Reports podcast in October that electric vehicle batteries do not currently have a clean method of disposal.\n\n\"Right now, when you trade in your old [electric vehicle] battery, most of them are just going to warehouses and sitting in warehouses until we perfect technology to dispose of them,\" Wheeler explained. \"And those chemicals can leach into the groundwater - we're sitting on potential Superfund sites that we're creating today that are going to plague us for the next generation if we don't do something about it.\""

Ambassador Nikki Haley and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nOther conservative luminaries confirmed to be attending include: Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), conservative commentator Candace Owens and Rep. Majorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.).\n\nCPAC Chairman Matt Schlapp suggested earlier this week that this year's event will focus on holding the Republican-controlled House to its 2022 campaign promises on a range of make-or-break issues, including border security, fiscal responsibility and investigative oversight of the Biden administration.\n\n\"It's about the Republicans in the House offering hope that getting the majority can make a difference,\" he told Just the News earlier this week. \"So they have to actually be fighting on spending and fighting on some policy goals like closing this border with Biden. If we come out of all those negotiations with nothing, I think it'll be destructive towards our ability to build a coalition together for 2024.\"\n\nConspicuously missing from the event will be another potential 2024 White House candidate, Florida's GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis, who will instead be attending the rival Club for Growth's private retreat for donors, hosted in his home state.\n\nTrump was reportedly not invited to the group's retreat at The Breakers luxury resort, which is not far from the former president's residence at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe group has made clear its desire to move beyond Trump, who has responded with slashing criticism of the organization.\n\n\"The Club For NO Growth, an assemblage of political misfits, globalists, and losers, fought me incessantly and rather viciously during my presidential run in 2016,\" he posted on Truth Social last month. \"They said I couldn't win, I did, and won even bigger in 2020, with millions of more votes than '16, but the Election was Rigged & [Stolen].\"\n\nJust the News' attempt to reach the group late Wednesday afternoon was unsuccessful.\n\nAnother cloud hanging over CPAC this year involves a sexual battery allegation against Schlapp, which he has vehemently denied. Schlapp is facing a lawsuit filed by a GOP campaign staffer who alleges Schlapp fondled him without consent in October after a day of campaigning in Georgia.\n\nDespite the challenges facing a potentially divided GOP as the curtain rises on this year's CPAC, Schlapp sounded an optimistic note about 2024.\n\n\"I think we have a great chance in 2024 to take back the White House, which unfortunately has become the epicenter of everything,\" he said. \"The White House holds almost all the power. If you don't have it, you can't get anything done. We need to get that place back.\"\n\nYou can follow Nick on Twitter @NGivasDC"

      "text": "LA Times owner mulls MAGA-friendly digital news outlet featuring Candace Owens, Scott Jennings: report\n\nThe billionaire owner of the Los Angeles Times is reportedly in the process of launching a new MAGA-leaning digital news service that will feature controversial commentator Candace Owens and pro-Trump CNN pundit Scott Jennings.\n\nDr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, the biopharmaceutical mogul who bought the venerable newspaper in 2018, has been working with Republican strategist Eric Beach on a new media venture tentatively called LAT Next, according to the Status newsletter.\n\nSoon-Shiong, who has demanded the Times pivot away from its left-wing bent , sparked a newsroom revolt after killing the editorial board's endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris weeks before the Nov. 5 election.\n\nUnlike the Times, LAT Next appears to be a digital-first platform that will feature personalities catering to a conservative audience, Status' Oliver Darcy reported on Wednesday.\n\nOwens has been involved in multiple controversies, particularly regarding her comments on Israel and Jews.\n\nMost recently, she parted ways with The Daily Wire after making remarks that were widely condemned as antisemitic, escalating her public feud with co-founder Ben Shapiro over the Israel-Palestinian conflict.\n\nDespite sharing part of the Times' branding, LAT Next is reportedly a separate entity, though the specifics of its relationship with the newspaper remain unclear.\n\nHints of the new venture have surfaced on social media.\n\nLast week, Soon-Shiong revealed that the conservative Jennings, who has gotten into heated debates with left-leaning pundits on CNN, would be involved in the project. Jennings was also named to the LA Times editorial board after several members quit following the spiked endorsement.\n\nAdditional names being floated include Ana Kasparian, a progressive commentator who has expressed criticism of certain left-wing policies.\n\nSoon-Shiong's plans for a pro-Trump entity is said to be causing angst among staffers at the Times - particularly in light of management's recent buyout offer for anyone who has worked at the paper for more than two years.\n\nThe Post has sought comment from Soon-Shiong, the Times, Owens, Beach, Kasparian and Jennings.\n\nDetails about LAT Next's programming remain sparse, but sources suggest that video content will be a major focus, according to Status.\n\nOne of the key attractions is rumored to be a talk show modeled after \"The View,\" with Beach actively recruiting co-hosts.\n\nRob Schneider, the Trump-backing \"Saturday Night Live\" alum, had previously pitched Soon-Shiong on a conservative talk show that would model \"The View.\"\n\nSchneider discussed the idea in December at the newspaper's El Segundo offices alongside Cheryl Hines, who is married to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , Trump's nominee for Health and Human Services, according to Status.\n\nThe venture's connection to the Times is causing unease among its journalists, who fear that resources may be diverted from the newspaper to support Soon-Shiong's latest initiative, the outlet reported.\n\nConcerns about the newspaper's direction were already mounting before the emergence of LAT Next.\n\nIn late December, Soon-Shiong held a virtual meeting with members of the Times' opinion section after staffers expressed concern over his apparent interference in editorial decisions.\n\nAccording to sources, Soon-Shiong dominated the conversation, criticizing the opinion team for being too liberal.\n\nThe meeting, described as tense and unproductive, left staffers feeling demoralized.\n\nA little over a month later, management announced voluntary buyouts as the publication continued to lose money.\n\nThe extent of potential job losses remains uncertain, but the inclusion of relatively new hires in the buyout offer suggests significant reductions could be on the horizon.\n\nMeanwhile, Soon-Shiong continues to exert influence over the newspaper's opinion section.\n\nHe has reportedly directed three left-leaning columnists - Robin Abcarian, Jackie Calmes, and LZ Granderson - to scale back their contributions from two articles per week to one.\n\nThis decision has fueled speculation that the opinion section is being strategically reshaped to align with a more conservative perspective.\n\nA recent profile in The Free Press described Soon-Shiong as having taken \"the red pill,\" a term associated with a right-ward political awakening.\n\nIn the article, he expressed regret over his past support for progressive causes and criticized the Times for what he described as a culture of bias.\n\nHis remarks, which included accusations that some reporters disguise opinions as facts, infuriated staff members, according to Status.\n\nEmployees who had recently dedicated extensive efforts to covering wildfires in California were particularly frustrated that instead of acknowledging their hard work, their employer chose to publicly disparage them, the newsletter reported.\n\nAdvertisement"

She denied downplaying Mengele's experiments and said that the Aussies were keeping her out because \"people don't want me to get in front of an audience\" in order to talk about \"the death taking place in Palestine.\"\n\n\"They can't produce [videos of] me discussing Mengele because it doesn't exist,\" Owens said on her show last month.\n\n\"If you're speaking about someone so evil, why is a lie required?\"\n\nEarlier this year, Owens left Daily Wire after a public rift with that news site's co-founder Ben Shapiro , a rabid Israel supporter, over the Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attacks by Hamas.\n\nWith Post Wires\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "The shameful nods to antisemitism from Candace Owens and Tucker Carlson\n\nCandace Owens and Tucker Carlson know exactly what they're doing.\n\nOver the past month, antisemites of all stripes - emboldened by Hamas' barbaric attack on Israeli civilians - have made their presence among us known.\n\nThey've celebrated Hamas' atrocities and committed their own, fantasizing about the destruction of Israel, tearing down posters of abducted children and harassing their Jewish neighbors.\n\nMuch of the overtly antisemitic rhetoric and action across the West has been situated on the left, and conservatives have rightly pointed out as much, chalking up the deluge of hatred and wickedness on display to fallacious progressive theory.\n\nBut there is a cohort on the right complicit in this great reawakening of an ancient evil.\n\nAnd that brings us back to Owens and Carlson.\n\nThe past few weeks have seen Owens repeat a series of blood libels.\n\nIn one breath, she's implied the Israeli government is committing a genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn the next, she's submitted that Jerusalem's historic Muslim Quarter (population: 22,000) is a ghetto where the city's Muslims (population: 350,000) are forced to live.\n\nAfter being called out on her ignorant smears by her Daily Wire colleague Ben Shapiro, Owens responded on X.\n\n\"Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God. Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake,\" wrote Owens, quoting the Book of Matthew's fifth chapter.\n\n\"No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other,\" she added.\n\n\"You cannot serve both God and money. Christ is King.\"\n\nAnd just like that, the mask clinging to her face by a thread fell off.\n\nShapiro, she argued without evidence and hardly any plausible deniability, had forsaken righteousness for wealth; is there a more textbook example of an antisemitic charge?\n\nWhen Shapiro responded by reminding Owens she's welcome to stop taking a paycheck from their company if it's threatening her soul, Owens hid behind her Bible verse.\n\n\"You are utterly out of line for suggesting that I cannot quote biblical scripture,\" she cried, affixing another performative \"Christ is King\" to her digital flop.\n\nThen on Wednesday night, Carlson released a fawning interview of Owens in which both professed not to know why Shapiro had criticized her in the first place.\n\nCarlson brought up the feud by playing the video of Shapiro \"attacking\" Owens stripped of all context.\n\nWhen he asked Owens what might have inspired it, she insisted that \"there isn't much of a background\" to it.\n\nLater, Carlson said that while he was \"horrified\" by Hamas' attack, he thought that \"the emotional response\" to it from \"some commentators\" was \"disproportionate.\"\n\nHe went on to work himself up into a lather over some university donors threatening a boycott over antisemitism on campus, protesting they hadn't done the same for white people.\n\n\"If the biggest donors at, say, Harvard have decided, well, we're going to shut it down now, where were you the last 10 years when they were calling for white genocide? You were allowing this. And then I found myself really hating those people, actually,\" he said.\n\nHis Wednesday performance followed weeks of downplaying the events in Israel and arguing against the provision of aid to it.\n\nLast month, for example, he brought retired Army Col. Douglas Macgregor - a man who's accused the pro-Israel lobby of making American officials rich - to assert Israelis are attempting to inflict collective punishment on Gaza civilians through the perpetration of war crimes.\n\nBoth Owens and Carlson boast a deep understanding of their audiences; that's how they amassed such impressive ones.\n\nThey know that to keep the antisemites in them on their side and attract more to them, they need not reference \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\" and alienate their more well-meaning followers.\n\nThey need only wink at the bigots while hiding behind either counterfeit curiosity (Carlson) or, even more shameful, Christianity (Owens) when they're held accountable for their thinly veiled appeals to humanity's worst nature.\n\nTheir ilk counts on people of good faith drawing distinctions between antisemites and those who cater to them.\n\nIt's past time for the clear-eyed among us to cease affording them that luxury.\n\nIsaac Schorr is a staff writer at Mediaite."

      "text": "Candace Owens named 'Antisemite of the Year' by StopAntisemitism: 'Poisonous hater'\n\nFirebrand pundit Candace Owens has been named \"Antisemite of the Year\" by watchdog StopAntisemitism, which says she \"blew the competition away\" with more votes than anyone in previous years.\n\n\"Candace Owens' witch's brew of antisemitism drew from vile medieval blood libels, including claims that Jews drink Christian blood, conspiracies that Jews are pedophiles who control the media and are 'taking over America,' and modern toxic anti-Israel hysteria,\" StopAntisemitism's founder, Liora Rez, told The Post.\n\n\"There is no psychotic rabbit hole too extreme for this poisonous hater.\"\n\nStopAntisemitism bestowed the title last year on Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.). Other recipients have included Ye, the Hitler-loving rapper formerly known as Kanye West, in 2022, and Tlaib's fellow \"Squad\" member Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) in 2019.\n\nThe watchdog shared a video of comments from Owens - who split from The Daily Wire over her views - including her defending Ye's antisemitic tirades and also her attacking Israel, which she claimed had \"occupied\" the US, in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre.\n\n\"Jew-hatred is a symptom of a decaying society just as it is a rotting mind,\" Rez stated.\n\n\"This dishonor is awarded to the individual who has done the most to endanger the Jewish community, and in 2024, Candace Owens has tragically and decisively earned the title.\n\n\"Out of dozens of contenders, she blew the competition away with her relentless campaign of dangerous rhetoric targeting the Jewish community, earning more votes than any Antisemite of the Year we've ever named.\"\n\nThe outspoken conservative pundit had previously scoffed at being in the running for the title.\n\n\"I feel like maybe [Israeli] prime minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu should've made the list because he's killed more semites than anybody - did we forget Palestinians are semites,\" she said on her show last month.\n\n\"The ratio under this post is incredible lol. Zionists are completely out of touch. Reminiscent of BLM in 2020 running around calling everything and everyone racist. From excruciatingly annoying, to mildly entertaining to utterly obsolete,\" Owens posted on X in response to the announcement. \"We are all fatigued with 'antisemitism.'\"\n\n\"Truly, I didn't think anyone could top the petulance of Patrisse Cullors in 2020 but I have to hand it to the Zionist lobby this year,\" she added. \"BLM walked so you guys could run.\"\n\n\"Obviously I will prepare an acceptance speech for my show tomorrow,\" Owens later snarked in another X post. \"So many people to thank.\"\n\nOwens had parted ways in March with the Daily Wire , a conservative outlet she began working for in 2021. She is widely believed to be under a gag order that precludes her from speaking specifically on the split.\n\nHowever, her departure came amid public friction with its co-founder and star podcaster Ben Shapiro. In the wake of the Hamas surprise attack that killed some 1,200 Israelis, she was caught liking a post on X spouting a bizarre and centuries-old conspiracy theory about rabbis drinking the blood of Christians.\n\nMorning Report and Evening Update: Your source for today's top stories\n\nPlease provide a valid email address.\n\nBy clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy .\n\nNever miss a story.\n\nShapiro, an Orthodox Jew and a staunch defender of Israel, had criticized Owens' comments as \"absolutely disgraceful.\"\n\nRez said that \"thankfully\" Owens \"has been disavowed by many of her former friends and allies.\n\n\"But she is a cautionary tale for our nation,\" the watchdog's founder said. \"Just as Candace has deteriorated into insanity and irrelevance, so does every civilization where antisemitism flourishes.\"\n\nFollowing her departure from the Daily Wire, Owens has launched her own show, which she posts on YouTube and other platforms.\n\nShe's also continued to draw scrutiny over her comments on Jewish people. Over the summer, she appeared to imply suggested that some of the heinous experiments conducted by Nazis during the Holocaust were merely \"propaganda.\"\n\n\"The Nazis experimented on innocent people,\" Owens said over the summer. \"Some of the stories, by the way, sound completely absurd. \"\n\n\"The idea that they just cut a human up and sewed them back together?\" she further pondered at the time. \"Why would you do that? Literally even if you're the most evil person in the world, that's a tremendous waste of time and supplies [to] just slice a person in half and sew them back together. That just sounds like bizarre propaganda.\"\n\nOwens maintains that her remarks were taken out of context and denies that she's downplayed the experiments by notorious Nazi Dr. Josef Mengele.\n\n\"They can't produce [videos of] me discussing Mengele because it doesn't exist,\" Owens argued on her show in November. \"If you're speaking about someone so evil, why is a lie required?\"\n\nAdvertisement"
