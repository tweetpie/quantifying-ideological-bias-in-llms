      "text": "'I'm a threat to injustice': Amanda Gorman recounts racial profiling incident with security guard\n\nPoet Laureate Amanda Gorman recently revealed she was racially profiled by a security guard working near her Los Angeles, Calif. apartment complex. According to Newsweek, Gorman took to Twitter with details about the disheartening encounter as she shared her perspective of the harsh reality that black girls face.\n\nA security guard tailed me on my walk home tonight. He demanded if I lived there because \"you look suspicious.\" I showed my keys & buzzed myself into my building. He left, no apology.\" She added, This is the reality of black girls: One day you're called an icon, the next day, a threat.\"\n\n\"In a sense, he was right. I AM A THREAT: a threat to injustice, to inequality, to ignorance,\" she said in a later tweet. \"Anyone who speaks the truth and walks with hope is an obvious and fatal danger to the powers that be.\"\n\nGorman, who became the youngest poet to appear at a presidential inauguration when she recited poetry at President Joe Biden's inauguration, also linked her first tweet to a previous one she'd shared on February 14. In that tweet, she included a link to a Washington Post article written about her as she expressed concern about racial injustice.\n\nShe also appeared to allude to the incident that recently occurred in Rochester, N.Y. which centered around footage of a police officer caught on camera pepper-spraying a 9-year-old girl. To make matters worse, the child was handcuffed when the officer pepper-sprayed her in the face.\n\n\"We live in a contradictory society that can celebrate a black girl poet & also pepper spray a 9 yr old,\" Gorman said. \"Yes see me, but also see all other black girls who've been made invisible. I can not, will not, rise alone.\"\n\nGorman's social media status skyrocketed when she was praised for her groundbreaking performance at the presidential inauguration back in January. More than one million social media users have followed her since the inauguration. No further details about the profiling incident have been released."

      "text": "Explosive report reveals right-wing tactic used to influence red state's schools\n\nIn 2019, the Keller Independent School District in North Texas looked a lot like its counterpart just 30 miles to the east in the Dallas suburb of Richardson. Each served about 35,000 children and had experienced sharp increases in the racial diversity of students in recent decades. Each was run by a school board that was almost entirely white.\n\nIn the five years since, the districts have followed strikingly divergent paths as culture war battles over how to teach race and gender exploded across the state.\n\nIn Keller, candidates backed by groups seeking to limit the teaching of race and gender took control of the school board and immediately passed sweeping policies that gave outsized power to any individual who wanted to prevent the purchase of books they believed to be unsuitable for children.\n\nThough more than half of Keller's students are from racially diverse backgrounds, the district in 2023 nixed a plan to buy copies of a biography of Black poet Amanda Gorman after a teacher at a religious private school who had no children in the district complained about this passage: \"Amanda realized that all the books she had read before were written by white men. Discovering a book written by people who look like her helped Amanda find her own voice.\" The passage, the woman wrote, \"makes it sound like it's okay to judge a book by the authors skin color rather than the content of the book.\"\n\nBoard members at the Richardson school district went in the opposite direction, even as they contended with similar pressure from groups aiming to rid the district of any materials that they claimed pushed critical race theory, an advanced academic concept that discusses systemic racism. The school board did not ban library books but instead allowed parents to limit their own children's access to them, keeping them available for other students.\n\nOne major difference contributed to the districts' divergence: the makeup of their school boards.\n\nThe way communities elect school board members plays a key, if often overlooked, role in whether racially diverse districts like Keller and Richardson experience takeovers by ideologically driven conservatives seeking to exert greater influence over what children learn in public schools, ProPublica and The Texas Tribune found. Since the pandemic, such groups have successfully leveraged the state's long-standing and predominantly at-large method of electing candidates to flip school boards in their direction.\n\nMost of Texas' 1,000 school districts use an at-large method, where voters can cast ballots for all candidates. Supporters say that allows for broader representation for students, but voting rights advocates argue that such systems dilute the power of voters of color. If board members are elected districtwide, there tends to be less diversity, according to research, which also shows that if they are elected by smaller geographic zones, candidates of color often have more success.\n\n\"What you're seeing happening in Texas is how at-large districts make it easy for somebody to come in, usually from the outside, and hijack the process and essentially buy a board,\" said Michael Li, senior counsel for the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonprofit public policy institute that champions small-donor campaign financing. \"Because of this conflux of factors - at-large elections and large amounts of outside money - it just sort of defeats the idea of representative democracy.\"\n\nProPublica and the Tribune examined 14 rapidly diversifying suburban school districts where children from diverse backgrounds now make up more than half of the student population. In the six districts that used at-large voting systems, well-funded and culture-war-driven movements successfully helped elect school board members who have moved aggressively to ban or remove educational materials that teach children about diversity, even in districts where a majority of children are not white. Nearly 70% of board members in such districts live in areas that are whiter than their district's population.\n\nEight nearby school systems with similar demographics employ single-member voting systems to elect school board candidates. Under the single-member system, voters within certain boundaries elect a board member who specifically represents their area. Candidates in those districts received less campaign support from ideologically driven political action committees, and none of the districts experienced school board takeovers fueled by culture war issues.\n\nAbout 150 Texas school districts have transitioned to a single-member system since the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which is intended to prevent voter discrimination and has brought greater racial representation to local governments. Richardson joined that list in 2019 after a former Black board member sued the district.\n\nSuch legal challenges, however, could soon become more difficult. In one of his first acts in office, President Donald Trump froze civil rights litigation against school districts accused of discriminating against minority groups, and many legal experts believe that under his administration, federal prosecutors will refuse to bring challenges against at-large systems. DOJ officials did not respond to questions from the news organizations.\n\nTrump, a staunch critic of diversity and inclusion programs, has threatened to cut federal funding to schools that he says are pushing \"inappropriate racial, sexual or political content onto the shoulders of our children.\"\n\nDistricts whose boards oppose sweeping efforts to restrict curriculum and books related to race and racism face even more headwinds in Texas. In January, Gov. Greg Abbott vowed to ban diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in public schools, a move that would expand the state's existing ban on college campuses. And Texas lawmakers continue to target the books students can access. One bill, authored by North Texas state Sen. Angela Paxton , the wife of Attorney General Ken Paxton , would require every district in the state to follow a version of Keller's library book purchase policy.\n\nThe president of the Keller board, Charles Randklev, did not respond to multiple requests for comment, and the district did not answer written questions. District officials have previously said that the board represents all students, not just those in a specific neighborhood or area.\n\nBut Laney Hawes, the parent of four students in the district and an outspoken critic of the school board, said the policy on library purchases spawned a backdoor channel to banning materials about race. That, she said, has deprived her children of reading books about Americans like Gorman that provide points of view they might not find otherwise.\n\n\"They have created a system that allows anyone in the community to complain about any book for any reason, and now that book is not on library shelves,\" said Hawes, who is white. She added that the book does not contain any sexually explicit material and was strictly targeted because it dealt with race.\n\n\"They just hate the racial undertones.\"\n\nSchool districts across Texas have drawn considerable attention for removing books from their shelves, but board members in Keller went further when they passed a policy in August 2022 that, in practice, allowed community members to block proposed purchases.\n\nStudents spoke out against the district's removal policies during a board meeting months later, pleading for access to books about race. One biracial student, who has since graduated, told the board that books about characters from different racial backgrounds helped her feel more accepted.\n\n\"All kids deserve to see themselves in literature,\" the student said. \"Racial minorities being written into a story does not instantly equate the book to being propaganda. Having books that mirror the experience of race is not pushing an agenda. It's simply documenting the hardships that consistently happen to most students of color that they're able to relate to. Concealing ideas just because they tell an uncomfortable truth is not protecting your children.\"\n\nThe students' pleas didn't sway the board, and by July 2023, challenges to such books began pouring in.\n\nOne person opposed the purchase of \"Jim Crow: Segregation and the Legacy of Slavery.\" The person, who did not provide their name, pointed to a photo of a young girl participating in a Black Lives Matter protest with the caption: \"Just as in the past, people continue fighting for change.\" They also took issue with this quote: \"You can't 'get over' something that is still happening. Which is why black Americans can't 'get over' slavery or Jim Crow.\"\n\nThe photo and the quotes, the book challenger said, were \"potentially CRT,\" showed the Black Lives Matter Movement in \"a positive light\" and claimed \"oppression is still happening.\"\n\nAnother person challenged the planned purchase of \"Our Skin: A First Conversation About Race,\" saying that the book started \"beautifully,\" but that \"unfortunately tenets of CRT, social justice, and anti-white activism are portrayed.\" The person, who used a pseudonym, did not offer specifics.\n\nAdministrators removed those books, the Gorman biography and 26 others from the purchase list after receiving the complaints, according to district officials. Librarians can reinstate books on future lists, but 75% of those flagged for further review never made it to the shelves, an online search of district libraries shows. That includes the three books about race.\n\nHawes, who heads two PTA groups at her children's schools, said book challenges and complaints have come from allies of school board members. In 2022, Patriot Mobile Action, a North Texas Christian nationalist PAC funded by a cellphone company, spent more than $115,000 supporting three ideologically driven conservatives running for control of the school board.\n\nLeigh Wambsganss, Patriot Mobile's spokesperson and executive director of the PAC, declined to comment but said in a 2022 podcast that the PAC chose candidates based on their Christian conservative views and sought out those who \"absolutely would stand against critical race theory.\" Patriot Mobile supported eight candidates in three other North Texas districts that used at-large voting during the same election cycle. All of them won their races.\n\n\"We weren't prepared for what was coming,\" Hawes said. \"We were literally up against a machine.\"\n\nAnother PAC, KISD Family Alliance, spent $50,000 to help elect the same Keller school board candidates. Its donors included conservative activist Monty Bennett, who previously told the Tribune that he believes schools have been taken over by ideologues \"pushing their outlandish agendas.\" Neither Bennett nor the PAC's treasurer responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe slate of Keller candidates, whose combined campaign war chests dwarfed that of their opponents' by a more than 4 to 1 margin, focused their agendas squarely on culture war issues related to library books and curriculum.\n\n\"While I have many priorities I want to focus on, if concerns over child safety, and sexualization and politicization of children make me a one-issue candidate, so be it. I will be a one-issue candidate all day long,\" Joni Shaw Smith wrote on her campaign website. Smith, who is now a board member, declined to comment.\n\nHer election contributed to what would become a sweep of the seven seats on the board. Five of those seats are held by board members who live in the city of Keller, where three-quarters of residents are white and the median household income of more than $160,000 is among the highest in the state.\n\nMost of the Keller district's 42 schools, however, are located in the more diverse neighborhoods of Fort Worth.\n\nThirty miles away, the makeup of Richardson's school board changed dramatically after the district settled a lawsuit filed in 2018 by David Tyson Jr. He argued that the continued use of at-large voting to select candidates was a \"relic of the district's segregated past.\"\n\nTyson became the district's first Black board member when he was elected in 2004. After he retired in 2010, he watched with growing consternation as no candidates from diverse backgrounds followed in his footsteps, even though students of color accounted for nearly 70% of the district's population.\n\nFrustrated, Tyson sued Richardson, challenging its system for electing candidates under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He and Richardson officials settled the lawsuit in 2019, and the district converted primarily to a system in which candidates needed to live within specific boundaries and receive a majority of votes from residents who also lived within those boundaries to be elected.\n\nAs ideologically driven candidates swept Keller school board elections, similar efforts played out differently in Richardson. In 2022, two candidates supported by groups seeking to limit instruction and library books that deal with race and gender ran against two candidates of color with differing views. A local PAC that accused the district of teaching \"CRT nonsense\" in a mailer hired the same Republican campaign consulting firm that was working in support of the Keller candidates.\n\nDespite being outspent 2-to-1, the candidates of color won their elections. Their wins gave Richardson four board members of diverse backgrounds, a remarkable evolution from an all-white board just three years earlier. And, as nearby districts began mass removals of library books dealing with race and gender, the Richardson school board embraced an \"opt-out\" process to give concerned parents control over their children's reading \"without impacting the choices of other families who may have different values, wishes or expectations.\" Opponents say opt-out systems do not go far enough in protecting students from materials they deem objectionable.\n\n\"Single-member districts benefited us in making sure our school board maintains the diversity, and diversity of thought, we have, and not just fall into those culture wars,\" said Vanessa Pacheco, one of the board members who won.\n\nPacheco said not being consumed by such fights allowed the board to focus on \"real stuff\" like dual-language classes for elementary students, expanding pre-K opportunities and scheduling school events for parents in the evenings and on weekends to account for working families.\n\nSo striking was the district's atmosphere following the 2022 election that a Dallas Morning News commentary dubbed Richardson a \"no-drama district\" in a sea of school boards consumed by fights over race and gender.\n\nTyson, whose lawsuit set the stage for the Richardson school board's dramatic transformation, said that the shift in voting methods has accomplished what he had hoped for.\n\n\"The goal was to get representation,\" he said. \"We're a majority-minority school district, and so we need to have a majority-minority representation on the school board.\"\n\nHawes watched as voters down the road in Richardson rejected candidates seeking to limit what the district's diverse student body could read and learn. She watched as the board itself grew increasingly diverse. And she watched with a touch of envy as the district embraced the idea that parents and community members who opposed certain books should not make decisions for every child in the district.\n\nWith Richardson as their north star, Hawes and a growing number of concerned parents began discussing ways to force the Keller school district to adopt what they believed was a more representative voting system. It wasn't just a question of race for Hawes. It was also about geographic diversity. Board members who live in the city of Keller hold a majority, even though less than a third of students in the district attend schools there.\n\nSo last year, Hawes and other concerned parents met with law firms and the NAACP and began planning a petition drive that would require the board to hold an election to do away with at-large voting. Members planned to meet in January to finalize a strategy.\n\nThen, in mid-January, the Keller school board shocked many in the community by proposing to split the district in two, separating the whiter, more affluent city of Keller to the east from the neighborhoods of northern Fort Worth, which are home to the majority of the district's students, including many who are low income. Like many districts in the state, Keller faces a massive budget shortfall.\n\nRandklev, the board president, defended the split as financially beneficial for both districts in a Facebook post last month. He also wrote that \"neighboring school districts have been forced into single-member districts, and that's a no-win situation regardless of where you live.\" He did not explain his position but said the proposed split \"could provide programming opportunities that best reflect local community goals and values and foster greater parent and community involvement.\"\n\nBut many parents, including Dixie Davis, who previously ran unsuccessfully for the board, said the proposed change would leave the vast majority of the district's low-income student population, and most of its students of color, with uncertain access to facilities like an advanced learning center and the district's swimming complex.\n\nOn Friday, board members abandoned plans to divide the school district in two, citing the cost of restructuring the district's debt. But their push to split the district has further energized efforts by some parents to do away with at-large voting. Brewer Storefront, the same law firm that fought to change the voting system in Richardson, has filed a similar legal challenge in federal court against Keller and concerned parents have launched a petition drive to force the district to vote on its at-large system. The district has not yet filed a response to the lawsuit and did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\n\"With the momentum and uproar around this proposed district split, it's now or never to get this done,\" Davis said. \"It'll be a huge uphill battle, but this is our best shot.\"\n\nLexi Churchill , ProPublica and The Texas Tribune, and Jessica Priest , The Texas Tribune, contributed research."

      "text": "How to keep the country from going to hell\n\nI've told you about mantras I teach undergraduates . Here's another one: \"You can't get anything done when fascists are sitting at the table of democratic politics.\" A democratic community can tolerate a vast array of opinions. However, it cannot, and should not, tolerate opinions in which democratic politics is the problem. If it does, then nothing needing to get done gets done-and everyone suffers. Kaitlin Byrd put it another way : \"Democrats are the entire spectrum of rational politics in this country. We don't have a government, and we won't, until we break the Republican Party.\"\n\nI think Byrd's \"spectrum of rational politics\" is ideal for viewing the debate over \"cancel culture.\" This term is gaining traction thanks to Donald Trump's lawyers accusing the House Democrats of \"canceling\" the former president's constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech during his second impeachment trial. And like most people aligned with Trump, or most people seeing opportunities in that alignment, they pervert reality. Truth is, the sacking and looting of the United States Capitol, which Trump incited, was an attempt to cancel a free and fair democratic election . These fascists did not fight for principles. They fought against democratic politics itself. (Indeed, many of them longed for a United States purified by blood and violence.)\n\nIf you remove the fascists from democratic debate over \"cancel culture,\" we might be able to see a \"spectrum of rational politics,\" though debate participants might disagree vehemently. Michelle Goldberg, a liberal columnist at the Times , noted Sunday where she parts ways with \"the critical race theory tradition\" and its \"tension with liberalism, particularly when it comes to issues like free speech. Richard Delgado, a key figure in the movement, has argued that people should be able to sue those who utter racist slurs. Others have played a large role in crafting campus speech codes.\" Goldberg said she sides with Skip Gates' classic argument against the tradition's position vis-a-vis First Amendment rights. But like Gates, she takes it seriously.\n\nIf the debate over \"cancel culture\" were restricted to a center-liberal-left spectrum, it might be fruitful. But fascists make democratic debate impossible. Their goal isn't assessing whether this or that is good or bad. It's smashing debate altogether.\n\nSadly, the news media seems captive to the fascist inclination to view everything in terms so desperately black and white that they are locked in a zero-sum struggle for existence. The Times of London reported over the weekend, for instance, that an award-winning translator pulled out of a project to translate into Dutch the poem written and performed by Amanda Gorman at Joe Biden's inauguration. Marieke Lucas Rijneveld is the youngest person ever to win the international Booker Prize. He left the project after critics said it was inappropriate for a white person to translate a Black poet's work. The newspaper saw Rijneveld's departure as undermining what Gorman called for when she said, \"We will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation.\"\n\nI don't know anything about The Times of London except its reporter in this case amplified the fascist belief that criticism-which is to say, counter-speech-is the same thing as intimidation. The paper misled its readers by suggesting Rijneveld was pushed out of the project rather than having left it freely. It made room, in other words, for the fascists to sit at the table of democratic politics. At the same time, I think Rijneveld's critics are wrong. There's nothing morally suspect about a white translator translating a Black poet. But being wrong is irrelevant to the fascists.\n\nTo them, what's important isn't debating political ideals and public morality. What's important is dominating democratic discourse for the purpose of putting a stop to it and subsequently replacing it with \"The Truth.\" Goldberg reports, for instance, that Republican legislators in Arkansas, West Virginia, and Oklahoma are introducing bills that would ban \"divisive\" conduct, such as the \"the teaching of The Times 's 1619 Project curriculum.\" A New Hampshire lawmaker proposed a \"divisive concepts\" ban, saying in a hearing , \"This bill addresses something called critical race theory.\"\n\nHow do you keep the fascists away from the table of democratic politics? Here I reveal myself to be more in line with liberals like Goldberg than with leftists like Delgado. We're not going to keep them away with bans and codes. Those might even backfire. But I do think free speech-importantly, counter-speech!-remains the most effective tool for defending the public arena. The more people are aware of the fascist tactic of suppressing free speech in the name of protecting it, the more people can speak out against the fascists. There's a lot we can do when the \"spectrum of rational politics\" stays rational. But to keep the country from going to hell, we have to keep raising hell."

      "text": "Girls against Trump: What the end of the Trump years means\n\nby Mayurika Chakravorty , Carleton University\n\nIn Kamala Harris's rousing victory speech in November 2020, the vice-president-elect of the United States directly addressed the country's children - but first, she spoke specifically to girls:\n\nMany little girls (and boys) probably did watch with rapt attention as the world contemplated the historic significance of Harris's win as the first woman of Black and South Asian origin to be elected vice-president. Some parents attested to the significance of that moment, and the hope and inspiration that it ushered in.\n\nDid Harris's achievement also mark a turning point for girlhood in the U.S. - and the world?\n\nDonald Trump's presidency was marked by a toxic climate of aggressive hyper-masculinity where women were often insulted, bullied, mocked and harassed. Trump's comments and tweets were sometimes rampantly sexist , excused as mere locker-room banter by his followers but found to have \" dangerously ingrained an ideology of denigration and objectification of women\" by one researcher.\n\nThe conservative and regressive policy decisions of the Trump administration disproportionately affected women of colour, along with anyone else who did not belong to the white elite heteronormative order.\n\nA recent quantitative study explored the correlation between the increase in racially motivated hate crimes following Trump's election and the deterioration of mental health in young college women. Scholars have also pointed out that exclusionary Trump policies like immigration bans and the separation of children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border jeopardized the \"children's safety and well-being\" and particularly targeted kids from racialized and marginalized backgrounds.\n\nAt the crossroads between misogyny and anti-children policies, American girlhood, unsurprisingly, came under siege during the Trump years, threatening to smother the spirit of the Fearless Girl statue facing the Wall Street Bull in New York City's financial district.\n\nWhen it comes to the cultural iconography of girlhood, few can match the confidence, defiance and courage exuded by the Kristen Visbal statue, installed on the eve of International Women's Day in 2017.\n\nIt symbolizes an audacious resilience in girls - in the U.S. and around the world - that could not be suppressed even during Trump's tenure.\n\nPoet and activist Maya Angelou once wrote how she would \" love to see a young girl go out and grab the world by the lapels .\" Throughout Trump's presidency, girls rose to Angelou's challenge, mounting sustained challenges to his inequitable and reckless policies - from gender and race issues to immigration and climate change.\n\nMalala Yousufzai, the young education activist and Nobel laureate from Pakistan, criticized Trump's discriminatory attitude towards Muslims and called his calls for immigration bans \"tragic\" and \"full of hate\" in 2015, even before he was elected.\n\nShe also publicly criticized Trump's sexism and later called him out for the cruel, unfair and inhumane separation of more than 2,000 children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTeenage climate activist Greta Thunberg also took on Trump. As she castigated world leaders for lacking the moral fibre to tackle climate change at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump notoriously accused her of having anger management issues.\n\nThe more Trump mocked and derided her, the more Thunberg upped the ante, valiantly returning fire tweet by tweet until Trump lost the election and she used his own insults against him.\n\nWhen the Trump administration reneged on the promise of gun control following mass shootings, a trenchant critique came from the Naomi Wadler, 11 years old at the time.\n\nShe spoke for all the \" African American girls whose stories don't make the front page of every national newspaper \" and her orange scarf is now an artefact at the virtual exhibition called Girlhood: It's Complicated at the National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.\n\nIt's clear that when girls and young women are at the forefront of major movements with their tireless commitment to justice and equity, and as they form a formidable coalition transcending borders and cultures, the old structures of patriarchy and misogyny can be challenged and hopefully dismantled.\n\nWhen Trump won the U.S. election in 2016, an educator offered a strategic toolkit to the parents of girls in the U.S. to survive his presidency . In the wake of his re-election bid in 2020, the issue of girlhood had entered the arena of political debate - a video entitled Girl in the Mirror , released by the conservative, anti-Trump Lincoln Project, urged American voters to imagine the impact of another presidential term marked by misogyny and sexism on girls and young women.\n\nFortunately, the U.S. and the world were spared that outcome.\n\nIt was also fitting that the inauguration of President Joe Biden and Vice-President Harris featured the powerful poetry of a talented young woman, Amanda Gorman, who boldly asserted from the balcony of the U.S. Capitol:\n\nMayurika Chakravorty , Instructor, Department of English and Institute of Interdisciplinary Studies (Childhood and Youth Studies), Carleton University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "'Underhanded scheme': Emails reveal new Trump prosecutor made serious ethical violations\n\nReporting Highlights\n\nThese highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.\n\nThe attacks on Judge John Barberis in the fall of 2016 appeared on his personal Facebook page. They impugned his ethics, criticized a recent ruling and branded him as a \"politician\" with the \"LOWEST rating for a judge in Illinois.\"\n\nBarberis, a state court judge in an Illinois county across the Mississippi River from St. Louis, was presiding over a nasty legal battle for control over the Eagle Forum, the vaunted grassroots group founded by Phyllis Schlafly, matriarch of the anti-feminist movement. The case pitted Schlafly's youngest daughter against three of her sons, almost like a Midwest version of the HBO program \"Succession\" (without the obscenities).\n\nAt the heart of the dispute - and the lead defendant in the case - was Ed Martin, a lawyer by training and a political operative by trade. In Missouri, where he was based, Martin was widely known as an irrepressible gadfly who trafficked in incendiary claims and trailed controversy wherever he went. Today, he's the interim U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., and one of the most prominent members of the Trump Justice Department.\n\nIn early 2015, Schlafly had selected Martin to succeed her as head of the Eagle Forum, a crowning moment in Martin's career. Yet after just a year in charge, the group's board fired Martin. Schlafly's youngest daughter, Anne Schlafly Cori, and a majority of the Eagle Forum board filed a lawsuit to bar Martin from any association with the organization.\n\nAfter Barberis dealt Martin a major setback in the case in October 2016, the attacks began. The Facebook user who posted them, Priscilla Gray, had worked in several roles for Schlafly but was not a party to the case, and her comments read like those of an aggrieved outsider.\n\nAlmost two years later, the truth emerged as Cori's lawyers gathered evidence for her lawsuit: Behind the posts about the judge was none other than Martin.\n\nProPublica obtained previously unreported documents filed in the case that show Martin had bought a laptop for Gray and that she subsequently offered to \"happily write something to attack this judge.\" And when she did, Martin ghostwrote more posts for her to use and coached her on how to make her comments look more \"organic.\"\n\n\"That is not justice but a rigged system,\" he urged her to write. \"Shame on you and this broken legal system.\"\n\n\"Call what he did unfair and rigged over and over,\" Martin continued.\n\nMartin even urged Gray to message the judge privately. \"Go slow and steady,\" he advised. \"Make it organic.\"\n\nGray appeared to take Martin's advice. \"Private messaging him that sweet line,\" she wrote. It was not clear from the court record what, if anything, she wrote at that juncture.\n\nLegal experts told ProPublica that Martin's conduct in the Eagle Forum case was a clear violation of ethical norms and professional rules. Martin's behavior, they said, was especially egregious because he was both a defendant in the case and a licensed attorney.\n\nMartin appeared to be \"deliberately interfering with a judicial proceeding with the intent to undermine the integrity of the outcome,\" said Scott Cummings, a professor of legal ethics at UCLA School of Law. \"That's not OK.\"\n\nMartin did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nMartin's legal and political career is dotted with questions about his professional and ethical conduct. But for all his years in the spotlight, some of the most serious concerns about his conduct have remained in the shadows - buried in court filings, overlooked by the press or never reported at all.\n\nHis actions have led to more than $600,000 in legal settlements or judgments against Martin or his employers in a handful of cases. In the Eagle Forum lawsuit, another judge found him in civil contempt, citing his \"willful disregard\" of a court order, and a jury found him liable for defamation and false light against Cori.\n\nCori also tried to have Martin charged with criminal contempt for his role in orchestrating the posts about Barberis, but a judge declined to take up the request and said she could take the case to the county prosecutor. Cori said her attorney met with a detective; Martin was never charged.\n\nNonetheless, the emails unearthed by ProPublica were evidence that he had violated Missouri rules for lawyers, according to Kathleen Clark, a legal ethics expert and law professor at Washington University in St. Louis. She said lawyers are prohibited from trying to contact a judge outside of court in a case they are involved in, and they are barred from using a proxy to do something they are barred from doing themselves.\n\nSuch a track record might have derailed another lawyer's career. Not so for Martin.\n\nAs a presidential candidate, Donald Trump vowed to use the Justice Department to reward his allies and seek retribution against his perceived enemies. Since taking office, Trump and his appointees have made good on those pledges, pardoning Jan. 6 rioters while targeting Democratic politicians, media critics and private law firms.\n\nAs one of its first personnel picks, the Trump administration chose Martin to be interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, one of the premier jobs for a federal prosecutor.\n\nA wide array of former prosecutors, legal observers and others have raised questions about his qualifications for an office known for handling high-profile cases. Martin has no experience as a prosecutor. He has never taken a case to trial, according to his public disclosures. As the acting leader of the largest U.S. attorney's office in the country, he directs the work of hundreds of lawyers who appear in court on a vast array of subjects, including legal disputes arising out of Congress, national security matters, public corruption and civil rights, as well as homicides, drug trafficking and many other local crimes.\n\nOver the last four years, the office prosecuted more than 1,500 people as part of the massive investigation into the violence at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. While Trump has pardoned the Jan. 6 defendants, Martin has taken action against the prosecutors who brought those cases. In just three months, he has overseen the dismissal of outstanding Jan. 6-related cases, fired more than a dozen prosecutors and opened an investigation into the charging decisions made in those riot cases.\n\nMartin has also investigated Democratic lawmakers and members of the Biden family; forced out the chief of the criminal division after she refused to initiate an investigation desired by Trump appointees citing a lack of evidence, according to her resignation letter ; threatened Georgetown University's law school over its diversity, equity and inclusion policies; and vowed to investigate threats against Department of Government Efficiency employees or \"chase\" people in the federal government \"discovered to have broken the law or even acted simply unethically.\"\n\nMartin \"has butchered the position, effectively destroying it as a vehicle by which to pursue justice and turning it into a political arm of the current administration,\" says an open letter signed by more than 100 former prosecutors who worked in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia under Democratic and Republican presidents.\n\nAlready, Martin has been the subject of at least four disciplinary complaints with the D.C. and Missouri bars, of which one was dismissed and the other three appear to be pending. Two of the complaints came after he moved to dismiss charges against a Jan. 6 rioter whom he had previously represented and for whom he was still listed as counsel of record. (The first complaint was dismissed after the D.C. bar's disciplinary panel concluded that Martin had dismissed the case as a result of Trump's pardons and so did not violate any rules.) The third was filed in March by a group of Democratic lawmakers in the U.S. Senate. The fourth was submitted last week by a group of former Jan. 6 prosecutors and members of the conservative-leaning Society for the Rule of Law. It argues that Martin's actions so far \"threaten to undermine the integrity of the U.S. Attorney's Office and the legal profession in the District of Columbia.\" If Martin has responded to any of the complaints, those responses have not been made public.\n\nTrump has nominated Martin to run the office permanently. Senate Democrats, meanwhile, have vowed to drag out Martin's confirmation, demanding a hearing and setting up a fight over one of Trump's most controversial nominees.\n\nMartin stepped off the elevator into the newsroom of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper. He was angry at a reporter named Jo Mannies, one of the city's top political journalists. At a conference table with Mannies and her senior editors, he accused Mannies of being unethical and pressed the paper's leadership to spike her stories about him, according to interviews.\n\nMannies said later she believed he was trying to get her fired.\n\n\"He was attacking her,\" said Pam Maples, who was managing editor at the time. \"He was implying she had an ax to grind, that she wanted to get some big story and that she was not being ethical. And when that didn't get traction, it was more like 'this isn't a story.' It wasn't that he said anything about a fact being inaccurate, or he wanted to retract a story; he wanted the reporting to stop.\"\n\nMannies had been covering a scandal dubbed \"Memogate\" that started to unfold in 2007 while Martin was chief of staff to Missouri Gov. Matt Blunt. In that role, Martin was using his government email to undermine Democratic rivals and rally anti-abortion groups. But when reporters requested emails from Blunt's staff, the governor's office denied they existed. Media organizations joined a lawsuit to preserve the messages and recover them from backup tapes.\n\nAn attorney for the governor, Scott Eckersley, later said in a deposition that Martin tried to block the release of government emails and told employees to delete their messages. After Eckersley warned that doing so might violate state law, he was fired. He sued the state for wrongful termination and defamation and settled for $500,000. Martin resigned as chief of staff in 2007 after just over a year on the job, and Blunt's office would eventually hand over 22 boxes of internal emails.\n\nIn a 2008 email to the Associated Press , Martin dismissed Eckersley's lawsuit as a \"desperate attempt\" to revise his story after he was fired, citing Eckersley's own testimony that not all emails are public records.\n\nThe Memogate incident was telling - and Martin's efforts to have Mannies fired were never reported. \"His claim was we were misrepresenting what the law was and what he was doing,\" she told ProPublica. \"I mean, he can get very hyper. He can get very emotional.\"\n\nWhen Martin launched a bid for Congress in 2010, he acted as if Memogate was ancient history. He made himself available to Mannies, she recalled, always taking her calls. Years later, he even appeared, lighthearted and bantering, on a St. Louis Public Radio podcast Mannies co-hosted. She said Martin could be outlandish and aggressive, but he could also be disarmingly passionate about whatever cause he was pursuing at the moment, often speaking in a frenetic rush. \"He just wore people down with his enthusiasm,\" she said.\n\nMartin allowed a different St. Louis reporter to shadow him during his 2010 run for Congress. The reporter asked about the St. Louis election board, a dysfunctional organization that, by all accounts, Martin had helped turn around in the mid-2000s. Martin had fired an employee there named Jeanne Bergfeld, and she later sued for wrongful termination. The board settled the lawsuit.\n\nAs part of the settlement, Martin agreed not to talk about the case and the board paid Bergfeld $55,000. Martin and two others issued a letter saying she had been a \"conscientious and dedicated professional.\"\n\nBut talking to the reporter covering his campaign, Martin said Bergfeld enjoyed \"not having to do anything\" and \"wasn't interested in changing.\" The day after the story was published, Bergfeld sued Martin again, this time for violating the settlement agreement. Martin denied making the comments, but the Riverfront Times released audio that proved he had.\n\nMartin agreed to pay Bergfeld another $15,000 but delayed signing the settlement for a few months. The judge then ordered Martin to pay some of her legal costs, citing his \"obstinacy.\"\n\nMartin lost his 2010 congressional bid. He ran for Missouri attorney general two years later and lost again. After his stint as chair of the Missouri Republican Party, he went to work as Schlafly's right-hand man. Martin grew so attached to Schlafly that a lawyer for the Eagle Forum jokingly called him \"Ed Martin Schlafly.\"\n\nAs the 2016 presidential campaign ramped up, Martin supported Trump even though Eagle Forum board members, including Cori, supported Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. At the time, Cori described Trump at the time as an \"egomaniacal dictator.\" (Today, she said she supports him.) Cori and other board members were stunned when Schlafly endorsed Trump, with Martin standing by her side.\n\nA few weeks later, a majority of the Eagle Forum's board voted to oust Martin as president; a lawsuit filed by the board cited mismanagement and poor leadership and described his tenure as \"deplorable.\" Martin has maintained that he was Schlafly's \"hand-picked successor\" and has characterized his removal as a hostile takeover.\n\n\"Every day, they are diminishing the reputation and value of Phyllis,\" he said in a 2017 statement . She died in September 2016.\n\nCori and the board's lawsuit sought to enforce Martin's removal and demand an accounting of the forum's assets. That's the case that wound up before Barberis.\n\nOn top of his efforts to direct Gray's posts on Barberis' Facebook page, Martin prepared a separate statement, according to previously unreported records from the case. The statement called Barberis' ruling to remove him as Eagle Forum president \"judicial activism at its worst\" that \"shows what happens when the law is undermined by judges who think they can do whatever they want.\"\n\nMartin emailed the statement, which said it was from \"Bruce Schlafly, M.D.\" - the name of one of Schlafly's sons - to himself, then sent it to two of her other sons, John and Andy, court filings show. Martin said the statement was a \"declaration of war\" and urged the Schlaflys to \"put something like this out to our biggest list.\" (It's unclear if the message was ever sent.) Bruce Schlafly did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn a 2019 sworn deposition, Cori's lawyer asked Martin questions about the posts on Barberis' Facebook page and the letter he drafted for Bruce Schlafly. Because of the possibility that he could be charged with criminal contempt of court, Martin declined to comment, on the advice of his own lawyer, though he acknowledged that lawyers are barred from communicating with judges outside of court or engaging in conduct meant to disrupt proceedings.\n\nAndy Schlafly, a lawyer and former Eagle Forum board member who supported Martin in the leadership fight, said \"no court has ever sanctioned Ed for his engagement of First Amendment advocacy\" and likened the controversy to liberal attacks on conservative judges. He dismissed concerns about Martin directing Gray to contact the judge, saying she \"speaks for herself\" and had every right to voice her outrage. He compared Martin's style - then and now - to Trump's. He said he did not believe the email Martin drafted for his brother Bruce had ever been sent, but if it had been, it would have been no different from Trump posting on Truth Social, which he considered normal behavior in political battles.\n\n\"What would Trump do in that position?\" Andy Schlafly said of Martin's current role in Washington. \"I would say Trump would be doing just what Ed's doing. Elections do have consequences.\"\n\nGray declined to comment. She was not part of the lawsuit.\n\nWhen Cori's lawyers uncovered the emails, they asked a new judge, David Dugan - who had taken over the case after Barberis was elected to a higher court - why Martin should not be held in criminal contempt for \"an underhanded scheme\" to \"attack the integrity and authority\" of the court with the Facebook comments about Barberis, according to court records.\n\nDugan declined to take up the criminal contempt motion. But he later found Martin and John Schlafly in civil contempt of court for having interfered with Eagle Forum after Barberis had removed them from the group. John Schlafly appealed the contempt finding and mostly lost. He did not respond to requests for comment. It's unclear if Martin appealed.\n\nCori told ProPublica she also filed an ethics complaint against Martin with the Missouri Office of Chief Disciplinary Counsel, which investigates ethics complaints against lawyers. She said she was told her complaint would have to wait until her lawsuit concluded. The office said it could neither confirm nor deny it had received a complaint.\n\nIn 2022, when part of Cori's lawsuit went to trial, a jury found Martin liable for defaming her and casting her in a false light - including by sharing a Facebook post suggesting that she should be charged with manslaughter for her mother's death. It awarded her $57,000 in damages and also found Martin liable for $25,500 against another Eagle Forum board member.\n\nMartin argued that the statute of limitations had expired on the defamation claims and that many of his statements were either true or vague hyperbole not subject to proof. He also claimed he could not be held liable because he didn't write the offending post - he had merely shared something written by someone else.\n\nIn a post-trial motion, he also leaned into protections that make it harder for public figures to win defamation cases. Under that higher legal standard, it's not enough for a plaintiff to show that a statement was false. Cori also had to prove that Martin knew it was false or acted with reckless disregard for the truth, and he said she didn't prove it.\n\nBut while he's wrapped himself in First Amendment protections when defending his own speech, he's taken the opposite stance since being named interim U.S. attorney by Trump, threatening legal action against people when they criticize the administration.\n\nFor instance, after Rep. Robert Garcia called DOGE leader Elon Musk a \"dick\" and urged Democrats to \"bring weapons\" to a political fight, Martin sent Garcia a letter warning his comments could be seen as threats and demanding an explanation.\n\nWith the start of Trump's first presidency, Martin and his family moved to the Northern Virginia suburbs near Washington, D.C. Martin had no formal role in the new administration, but he turned himself into one of the president's most prolific and unfiltered surrogates.\n\nCNN hired him in September 2017 to be a pro-Trump on-air commentator, only to fire him five months later after a string of controversial on-air remarks. He attacked a woman who had accused Alabama U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore of molesting her as a child, praised Trump for denigrating Sen. Elizabeth Warren as \"Pocahontas,\" and described some of his CNN co-panelists as \"rabid feminists\" and \"Black racists.\"\n\nUnbowed, Martin went on to make more than 150 appearances on the Russia Today TV channel and Sputnik radio, both Russian state-owned media outlets, first reported by The Washington Post. On RT and Sputnik, Martin railed against the \"Russia hoax,\" criticized the DOJ investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller and questioned American support for Ukraine after Russia's invasion by saying the U.S. was \"wasting money in Kiev for Zelensky and his corrupt guys.\" The State Department would later say RT and Sputnik were \"critical elements in Russia's disinformation and propaganda ecosystem.\" The Treasury Department sanctioned RT employees in 2024. The DOJ indicted two RT employees for conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to fail to register as foreign agents.\n\nMartin's flair for fealty set him apart even from fellow Trump supporters. He cheered the Maine Republican Party for considering whether to censure Sen. Susan Collins for her vote to convict Trump during the second impeachment trial. He singled out Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska in a radio segment titled \"America Needs to Go on a RINO Hunt.\" He accused Sen. John Cornyn of going \"soft\" on gun rights after Cornyn endorsed a bipartisan gun-safety law after the Uvalde, Texas, mass shooting that left 19 children and two teachers dead.\n\nOn Jan. 6, 2021, Martin joined the throngs of Trump supporters who marched in protest of the 2020 election outcome. He compared the scene that day to a Mardi Gras celebration and later said the prosecution of Jan. 6 defendants was \"an op\" orchestrated by former Rep. Liz Cheney and law enforcement agencies to \"damage Trump and Trumpism.\"\n\nDuring an appearance on Russia Today, Martin said then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \"weaponized\" Congress' response to the Jan. 6 riots by ramping up security on Capitol Hill, comparing her to the Nazis. \"Not since the Reichstag fire that was engineered by the Nazis have we seen behavior like what Nancy Pelosi did,\" he said.\n\nAs an attorney, he represented Jan. 6 defendants, helped raise money for their families and championed their cause. Last summer, Martin gave an award to a convicted Jan. 6 rioter named Timothy Hale-Cusanelli. According to court records, Hale-Cusanelli held \"long-standing white supremacist and Nazi beliefs,\" wore a \"Hitler mustache\" and allegedly told his co-workers that \"Hitler should have finished the job.\" (In court, Hale's attorney said his client \"makes no excuses for his derogatory language,\" but the government's description of him was \"simply misleading.\")\n\nAfter hugging and thanking Hale-Cusanelli at the ceremony, Martin told the audience that one of his goals was \"to make sure that the world - and especially America - hears more from Tim Hale, because he's extraordinary.\"\n\nIn his three months as interim U.S. attorney for D.C., Martin has used his position to issue a series of threats. He's vowed not to hire anyone affiliated with Georgetown Law unless the school drops any DEI policies. He vowed to Musk that he would \"pursue any and all legal action against anyone who impedes your work or threatens your people.\" He publicly told former special counsel Jack Smith and Smith's lawyers to \"[s]ave your receipts.\" And in another open letter addressed to Musk and Musk's deputy, Martin wrote that \"if people are discovered to have broken the law or even acted simply unethically, we will investigate them and we will chase them to the end of the Earth to hold them accountable.\"\n\nMore often than not, Martin's threats have gone nowhere.\n\nA month into the job, he announced \"Operation Whirlwind,\" an initiative to \"hold accountable those who threaten\" public officials, whether they're DOGE workers or judges. One of the \"most abhorrent examples\" of such threats, he said, were Sen. Chuck Schumer's 2020 remarks that conservative Supreme Court justices had \"released the whirlwind\" and would \"pay the price\" if they weakened abortion rights.\n\nEven though Schumer walked back his incendiary comments the next day, Martin said he was investigating Schumer's nearly 5-year-old remarks as part of Operation Whirlwind. Despite Martin's bravado, the investigation went nowhere. No grand jury investigation was opened. No charges were filed. That the probe fizzled out came as little surprise. Legal experts said Schumer's remarks, while ill advised, fell well short of criminal conduct.\n\nIn another instance, when one of Martin's top deputies refused to open a criminal investigation into clean-energy grants issued by the Biden administration, Martin demanded the deputy's resignation and advanced the investigation himself. When a subpoena arrived at one of the targeted environmental groups, Martin's was the only name on it, according to documents obtained by ProPublica.\n\nKevin Flynn, a former federal prosecutor who served in the D.C. U.S. attorney's office for 35 years, told ProPublica that he did not know of a single case in which the U.S. attorney was the sole authorizing official on a grand jury subpoena. Flynn said he could think of only two reasons why this could happen: The matter was of \"such extraordinary sensitivity\" that the office's leader took exclusive control over it, or no other supervisor or line prosecutor was willing to sign off on the subpoena \"out of concern that it wasn't legally or ethically appropriate.\"\n\nAnd when the dispute between the environmental groups and the Justice Department reached a courtroom, federal Judge Tanya Chutkan asked a DOJ lawyer defending the administration's actions for any evidence of possible crimes or violations - evidence, in other words, that could have justified the probe initiated by Martin. The DOJ lawyer said he had none. \"You can't even tell me what the evidence of malfeasance is,\" Chutkan said. \"There are still rules that even the government has to follow, last I checked.\"\n\nMartin's tenure has caused so much consternation that in early April, Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., put a hold on Martin's nomination. Typically, the Senate Judiciary Committee approves U.S. attorney picks by voice vote without a hearing. But in Martin's case, all 10 Democrats on the committee have asked for a public hearing to debate the nomination, calling Martin \"a nominee whose objectionable record merits heightened scrutiny by this Committee.\"\n\nEven the process of submitting the requisite paperwork for Senate confirmation has tripped him up. According to documents obtained by ProPublica, he has sent the Judiciary Committee three supplemental letters that correct omissions about his background. In an earlier submission , Martin did not disclose any of his appearances on Russian state-owned media. But just before The Washington Post reported that Martin had, in fact, made more than 150 such appearances, he sent yet another letter correcting his previous statements.\n\n\"I regret the errors and apologize for any inconvenience,\" he wrote.\n\nSharon Lerner contributed reporting.\n\nThe clear-cutting across the federal government under President Donald Trump has been dramatic, with mass terminations, the suspension of decades-old programs and the neutering of entire agencies. But this spectacle has obscured a series of moves by the administration that could profoundly harm some of the most vulnerable people in the U.S.: children.\n\nConsider: The staff of a program that helps millions of poor families keep the electricity on, in part so that babies don't die from extreme heat or cold, have all been fired . The federal office that oversees the enforcement of child support payments has been hollowed out. Head Start preschools, which teach toddlers their ABCs and feed them healthy meals, will likely be forced to shut down en masse, some as soon as May 1. And funding for investigating child sexual abuse and internet crimes against children; responding to reports of missing children; and preventing youth violence has been withdrawn indefinitely.\n\nThe administration has laid off thousands of workers from coast to coast who had supervised education, child care, child support and child protective services systems, and it has blocked or delayed billions of dollars in funding for things like school meals and school safety.\n\nThese stark reductions have been centered in little-known children's services offices housed within behemoth agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice, offices with names like the Children's Bureau, the Office of Family Assistance and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. In part because of their obscurity, the slashing has gone relatively overlooked.\n\n\"Everyone's been talking about what the Trump administration and DOGE have been doing, but no one seems to be talking about how, in a lot of ways, it's been an assault on kids,\" said Bruce Lesley, president of advocacy group First Focus on Children. He added that \"the one cabinet agency that they're fully decimating is the kid one,\" referring to Trump's goal of shuttering the Department of Education . Already, some 2,000 staffers there have lost or left their jobs.\n\nThe impact of these cuts will be felt far beyond Washington, rippling out to thousands of state and local agencies serving children nationwide.\n\nThe Department of Education, for instance, has rescinded as much as $3 billion in pandemic-recovery funding for schools, which would have been used for everything from tutoring services for Maryland students who've fallen behind to making the air safer to breathe and the water safer to drink for students in Flint, Michigan . The Department of Agriculture, meanwhile, has canceled $660 million in promised grants to farm-to-school programs, which had been providing fresh meat and produce to school cafeterias while supporting small farmers.\n\nAt the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the agency's secretary, has dismissed all of the staff that had distributed $1.7 billion annually in Social Services Block Grant money, which many states have long depended on to be able to run their child welfare, foster care and adoption systems, including birth family visitation, caseworker training and more. The grants also fund day care, counseling and disability services for kids. (It is unclear whether anyone remains at HHS who would know how to get all of that funding out the door or whether it will now be administered by White House appointees.)\n\nHead Start will be especially affected in the wake of Kennedy's mass firings of Office of Head Start regional staff and news that the president's draft budget proposes eliminating funding for the program altogether . That would leave one million working-class parents who rely on Head Start not only for pre-K education but also for child care, particularly in rural areas, with nowhere to send their kids during the day.\n\nSome local Head Start programs are already having to close their doors , and many program directors are encountering impediments to spending their current budgets. When they seek reimbursement after paying their teachers or purchasing school supplies, they're being directed to a new \"Defend the Spend\" DOGE website asking them to \"justify\" each item, even though the spending has already been appropriated by Congress and audited by nonpartisan civil servants.\n\nNext on the chopping block , it appears, is Medicaid, which serves children in greater numbers than any other age group . If Republicans in Congress go through with the cuts they've been discussing, and Trump signs those cuts into law, kids from lower- and middle-class families across the U.S. will lose access to health care at their schools, in foster care, for their disabilities or for cancer treatment.\n\nThe Trump administration has touted the president's record of \"protecting America's children,\" asserting in a recent post that Trump will \"never stop fighting for their right to a healthy, productive upbringing.\" The statement listed five examples of that commitment. Four were related to transgender issues (including making it U.S. government policy that there are only two sexes and keeping trans athletes out of women's sports); the other was a ban on COVID-19 vaccine mandates at schools that receive federal funding.\n\nThe White House, and multiple agencies, declined to respond to most of ProPublica's questions. Madi Biedermann, a Department of Education spokesperson, addressed the elimination of pandemic recovery funding, saying that \"COVID is over\"; that the Biden administration established an \"irresponsible precedent\" by extending the deadline to spend these funds (and exceeding their original purpose); and that the department will consider extensions if individual projects show a clear connection between COVID and student learning.\n\nAn HHS spokesperson, in response to ProPublica's questions about cuts to children's programs across that agency, sent a short statement saying that the department, guided by Trump, is restructuring with a focus on cutting wasteful bureaucracy. The offices serving children, the statement said, will be merged into a newly established \"Administration for Healthy America.\"\n\nPrograms that serve kids have historically fared the worst when those in power are looking for ways to cut the budget. That's in part because kids can't vote, and they typically don't belong to political organizations. International aid groups, another constituency devastated by Trump's policy agenda, also can't say that they represent many U.S. voters.\n\nThis dynamic may be part of why cuts on the health side of the Department of Health and Human Services - layoffs of doctors, medical researchers and the like - have received more political and press attention than those on the human services side, where the Administration for Children and Families is located. That's where you can find the Office of Child Support Services, the Office of Head Start, the Office of Child Care (which promotes minimum health and safety standards for child care programs nationally and helps states reduce the cost of child care for families), the Office of Family Assistance (which helps states administer direct aid to lower-income parents and kids), the Children's Bureau (which oversees child protective services, foster care and adoption) and the Family and Youth Services Bureau (which aids runaway and homeless teens, among others).\n\nAll told, these programs have seen their staffs cut from roughly 2,400 employees as of January to 1,500 now, according to a shared Google document that is being regularly updated by former HHS officials. (Neither the White House nor agency leadership have released the exact numbers of cuts.)\n\nThose losses have been most acutely felt in the agency's regional offices, five out of 10 of which - covering over 20 states - have been closed by the Trump administration. They were dissolved this month without notice to their own employees or to the local providers they worked with. It was these outposts that had monitored Head Start programs to make sure that they had fences around their playgrounds, gates at the top of their stairs and enough staffing to keep an eye on even the most energetic little ones. It was also the regional staff who had helped state child support programs modernize their computer systems and navigate federal law. That allowed them, among other things, to be able to \" pass through \" more money to families instead of depositing it in state coffers to reimburse themselves for costs.\n\nAnd it was the regional staff who'd had the relationships with tribal officials that allowed them to routinely work together to address child support, child care and child welfare challenges faced by Native families. Together, they had worked to overcome sometimes deep distrust of the federal government among tribal leaders, who may now have no one to ask for help with their children's programs other than political appointees in D.C.\n\nIn the wake of the regional office cuts, local child services program directors have no idea who in the federal government to call when they have urgent concerns, many told ProPublica. \"No one knows anything,\" said one state child support director, asking not to be named in order to speak candidly about the administration's actions. \"We have no idea who will be auditing us.\"\n\n\"We're trying to be reassuring to our families,\" the official said, \"but if the national system goes down, so does ours.\"\n\nThat national system includes the complex web of databases and technical support maintained and provided by the Office of Child Support Services at HHS, which helps states locate parents who owe child support in order to withhold part of their paychecks or otherwise obtain the money they owe, which is then sent to the parent who has custody of the child. Without this federal data and assistance, child support orders would have little way of being enforced across state lines.\n\nFor that reason, the Trump administration is making a risky gamble by slashing staffing at the federal child support office, said Vicki Turetsky, who headed that office under the Obama administration. She worries that the layoffs create a danger of system outages that would cause child support payments to be missed or delayed. (\"That's a family's rent,\" she said.) The instability is compounded, she said, by DOGE's recent unexplained move to access a highly confidential national child support database.\n\nBut even if the worst doesn't come to pass, there will still be concrete consequences for the delivery of child support to families, Turetsky said. The staff members who've been pushed out include those who'd helped manage complicated, outdated IT systems; without updates, these programs might over- or undershoot the amount of child support that a parent owes, misdirect the money or fail to give notice to the dad or mom about a change in the case.\n\nWhen Liz Ryan departed as administrator of the Department of Justice's juvenile division in January, its website was flush with opportunities for state and local law enforcement as well as nonprofits to apply for federal funding for a myriad of initiatives that help children. There were funds for local police task forces that investigate child exploitation on the internet; for programs where abused children are interviewed by police and mental health professionals; and for court-appointed advocates for victimized kids. Grants were also available for mentoring programs like Big Brothers Big Sisters and the Boys & Girls Clubs of America.\n\nBut the Trump administration removed those grant applications, which total over $400 million in a typical year. And Ryan said there still hasn't been any communication, including in what used to be regular emails with grant recipients, many of whom she remains in touch with, about whether this congressionally approved money even still exists or whether some of it might eventually be made available again.\n\nA spokesperson for the Office of Justice Programs within the DOJ said the agency is reviewing programs, policies and materials and \"taking action as appropriate\" in accordance with Trump's executive orders and guidance. When that review has been completed, local agencies and programs seeking grants will be notified.\n\nMultiple nonprofits serving exploited children declined to speak on the record to ProPublica, fearing that doing so might undermine what chance they still had of getting potential grants.\n\n\"Look at what happened to the law firms ,\" one official said, adding that time is running out to fund his program's services for victims of child abuse for the upcoming fiscal year.\n\n\"I never anticipated that programs and services and opportunities for young people wouldn't be funded at all by the federal government,\" Ryan said, adding that local children's organizations likely can't go to states, whose budgets are already underwater , to make up the funding gap. \"When you look at this alongside what they're doing at HHS and the Department of Education and to Medicaid, it's undercutting every single effort that we have to serve kids.\"\n\nAfter President Donald Trump announced sweeping new tariffs earlier this month, the White House released a list of more than a thousand products that would be exempted.\n\nOne item that made the list is polyethylene terephthalate, more commonly known as PET resin, the thermoplastic used to make plastic bottles.\n\nWhy it was spared is unclear, and even people in the industry are confused about the reason for the reprieve.\n\nBut its inclusion is a win for Reyes Holdings, a Coca-Cola bottler that ranks among the largest privately held companies in the U.S. and is owned by a pair of brothers who have donated millions of dollars to Republican causes. Records show the company recently hired a lobbying firm with close ties to the Trump White House to make its case on tariffs.\n\nWhether the company's lobbying played any role in the exemption is unclear. Reyes Holdings and its lobbyists did not respond to questions from ProPublica. The White House also did not comment, but some industry advocates say the administration has rebuffed requests for exemptions .\n\nThe resin's unexplained inclusion on the list exemplifies how opaque the administration's process for crafting its tariff policy has been. Major stakeholders are in the dark about why certain products face levies and others don't. Tariff rates have been altered without any clear explanation for the changes. Administration officials have given conflicting messages about the tariffs or declined to answer questions at all.\n\nThe lack of transparency about the process has created concerns among trade experts that politically connected firms might be winning carve-outs behind closed doors.\n\n\"It could be corruption, but it could just as easily be incompetence,\" a lobbyist who works on tariff policy said of PET resin's inclusion. \"To be honest, this was such a hurried mess, I am not sure who got into the White House to talk to folks about the list.\"\n\nDuring the first Trump administration, there was a formal process for seeking an exemption from tariffs. Companies submitted hundreds of thousands of applications making the case for why their products should be spared. The applications were public, so the machinery of the tariff crafting process could be more closely examined. Such transparency allowed academics to subsequently analyze thousands of the applications and determine that political donors to Republicans were more likely to be granted exemptions .\n\nIn Trump's second term, at least thus far, there has not been a formal application process for tariff carve-outs. Industry executives and lobbyists are making their case behind closed doors . The Wall Street Journal's editorial board last week called \"the opacity of the process\" for getting an exemption \"the Beltway Swamp's dream.\"\n\nIn the executive order formalizing Trump's new tariffs , including baseline 10% tariffs for almost all countries, exemptions were broadly defined as products in the pharmaceutical, semiconductor, lumber, copper, critical minerals and energy sectors. An accompanying list detailed the specific products that would be spared.\n\nBut a ProPublica review of that list found many items that don't fit neatly, or at all, in those broad categories, and some items that fall squarely within the categories were not spared.\n\nThe White House exclusions list, for example, included most types of asbestos, which is not generally considered a critical mineral and doesn't seem to fit in any of the exempted categories. The cancer-causing mineral, which is not generally considered critical to national security or the U.S. economy, is still used to make chlorine, but the Biden administration's Environmental Protection Agency banned imports of the material last year. The Trump administration has signaled it may roll back some of those Biden-era restrictions.\n\nA spokesperson for the American Chemistry Council, which had pushed back on the ban because it could hurt the chlorine industry, said the trade group played no role in lobbying for asbestos to get a tariff exemption and didn't know why it was included. (Two major chlorine companies also showed no indication of lobbying on the tariffs in their disclosure forms.)\n\nOther items that landed on the list, despite not falling into exempted categories, are far more innocuous. Among them: coral, shells and cuttlebone, a part of the cuttlefish that is used as a dietary supplement for pets.\n\nPET resin also doesn't fit neatly in any of the exempted categories. It's possible the administration counted it as an energy product, experts said, because its ingredients are derived from petroleum. But other products that would have met that same low bar were not included.\n\n\"We are as surprised as anybody,\" said Ralph Vasami, executive director of the PET Resin Association, a trade group for the industry. The resin, he said, has no application for the exempted categories, unless you count the packaging those products come in.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of last year, the same period when Trump won the election, records show Reyes Holdings, the Coca-Cola bottler, enlisted Ballard Partners to lobby on tariffs. During the first quarter of this year, when Trump was inaugurated, records show that Ballard began lobbying the Commerce Department, which shapes trade policy, on tariffs.\n\nThe firm has become a destination for companies looking for an in with the Trump administration. It once lobbied for Trump's own company, the Trump Organization, and its staff has included top officials in the administration, such as Attorney General Pam Bondi and the president's chief of staff, Susie Wiles. Brian Ballard, its founder and a prolific fundraiser for Trump, was named by Politico \"the most powerful lobbyist in Trump's Washington.\" He was one of two lobbyists from the firm who lobbied on tariffs for Reyes Holdings, federal disclosure records show.\n\nThe billionaire brothers behind Reyes Holdings, Chris and Jude Reyes, also have their own political ties. While they have given to some Democratic candidates, the bulk of their political donations have gone to Republican causes, campaign finance disclosures show. And after Trump's first election win, Chris Reyes was invited to Mar-a-Lago to meet privately with Trump.\n\nThe PET resin carve-out isn't just a break for Reyes Holdings. It's a boon to other firms that buy the resin to manufacture bottles and the beverage companies that use them. Earlier this year, the CEO of Coca-Cola said the company would transition to using more plastic bottles in the face of new tariffs on aluminum, a plan that might have been dashed if the thermoplastics were also hit with new tariffs. Disclosure records show the company also lobbied this year about tariffs on the Hill, but the documents don't provide detail about which policies in particular, and the company did not respond to questions from ProPublica. (Coca-Cola has looked to make inroads with Trump, donating about $250,000 for his inauguration, and the CEO presented Trump with a personalized bottle of his favorite soda, Diet Coke.)\n\nAnother industry that appears to have done relatively well lobbying for carve-outs from the recent tariffs is agriculture. The exemption list includes various pesticide and fertilizer ingredients.\n\nThe American Farm Bureau Federation, an agricultural lobby, took credit for some of those exemptions in an analysis posted on its website recently, calling exemptions for peat and potash \"hard fought for by agricultural organizations such as the American Farm Bureau Federation\" and \"a testament to the effectiveness of farmers' and ranchers raising their collective voice.\"\n\nThere are a number of other imports that don't neatly fall into any of the exempted categories but might if the categories were defined loosely.\n\nOne example is sucralose, the artificial sweetener. Its inclusion will largely help companies that use the product in food and beverages. But sucralose is also sometimes used in drugs to make them more palatable. It's not clear if the White House gave it a pass under the pharmaceutical exemption or for some other reason.\n\nEven for the items that were spared, the reprieve may just be temporary.\n\nThe broad categories exempted are largely industries that are being investigated by the administration for potential future tariffs under its authority to administer levies to protect national security.\n\nAlex Mierjeski and Agnel Philip contributed research.\n\nMore children ages 1 to 4 die of drowning than any other cause of death. Nearly a quarter of adults received mental health treatment in 2023, an increase of 3.4 million from the prior year. The number of migrants from Mexico and northern Central American countries stopped by the U.S. Border Patrol was surpassed in 2022 by the number of migrants from other nations.\n\nWe know these things because the federal government collects, organizes and shares the data behind them. Every year, year after year, workers in agencies that many of us have never heard of have been amassing the statistics that undergird decision-making at all levels of government and inform the judgments of business leaders, school administrators and medical providers nationwide.\n\nThe survival of that data is now in doubt, as a result of the Department of Government Efficiency's comprehensive assault on the federal bureaucracy.\n\nReaction to those cuts has focused understandably on the hundreds of thousands of civil servants who have lost their jobs or are on the verge of doing so and the harm that millions of people could suffer as a result of the shuttering of aid programs. Overlooked amid the turmoil is the fact that many of DOGE's cuts have been targeted at a very specific aspect of the federal government: its collection and sharing of data. In agency after agency, the government is losing its capacity to measure how American society is functioning, making it much harder for elected officials or others to gauge the nature and scale of the problems we are facing and the effectiveness of solutions being deployed against them.\n\nThe data collection efforts that have been shut down or are at risk of being curtailed are staggering in their breadth. In some cases, datasets from past years now sit orphaned, their caretakers banished and their future uncertain; in others, past data has vanished for the time being, and it's unclear if and when it will reappear. Here are just a few examples:\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services, now led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., laid off the 17-person team in charge of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, which for more than five decades has tracked trends in substance abuse and mental health disorders. The department's Administration for Children and Families is weeks behind on the annual update of the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System, the nationwide database of child welfare cases, after layoffs effectively wiped out the team that compiles that information. And the department has placed on leave the team that oversees the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, a collection of survey responses from women before and after giving birth that has become a crucial tool in trying to address the country's disconcertingly high rate of maternal mortality .\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has eviscerated divisions that oversee the WISQARS database on accidental deaths and injuries - everything from fatal shootings to poisonings to car accidents - and the team that maintains AtlasPlus, an interactive tool for tracking HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency is planning to stop requiring oil refineries, power plants and other industrial facilities to measure and report their greenhouse-gas emissions , as they have done since 2010, making it difficult to know whether any of the policies meant to slow climate change and reduce disaster are effective. The EPA has also taken down EJScreen, a mapping tool on its website that allowed people to see how much industrial pollution occurs in their community and how that compares with other places or previous years.\n\nThe Office of Homeland Security Statistics has yet to update its monthly tallies on deportations and other indices of immigration enforcement , making it difficult to judge President Donald Trump's triumphant claims of a crackdown; the last available numbers are from November 2024, in the final months of President Joe Biden's tenure. (\"While we have submitted reports and data files for clearance, the reporting and data file posting are delayed while they are under the new administration's review,\" Jim Scheye, director of operations and reporting in the statistics unit, told ProPublica.)\n\nAnd, in a particularly concrete example of ceasing to measure, deep cutbacks at the National Weather Service are forcing it to reduce weather balloon launches , which gather a vast repository of second-by-second data on everything from temperature to humidity to atmospheric pressure in order to improve forecasting.\n\nLooked at one way, the war on measurement has an obvious potential motivation: making it harder for critics to gauge fallout resulting from Trump administration layoffs, deregulation or other shifts in policy. In some cases, the data now being jettisoned is geared around concepts or presumptions that the administration fundamentally rejects: EJScreen, for instance, stands for \"environmental justice\" - the effort to ensure that communities don't suffer disproportionately from pollution and other environmental harms. (An EPA spokesperson said the agency is \"working to diligently implement President Trump's executive orders, including the 'Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing.'\" The spokesperson added: \"The EPA will continue to uphold its mission to protect human health and the environment\" in Trump's second term.) The White House press office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLaura Lindberg, a Rutgers public health professor, lamented the threatened pregnancy-risk data at the annual conference of the Population Association of America in Washington last week. In an interview, she said the administration's cancellation of data collection efforts reminded her of recent actions at the state level, such as Florida's withdrawal in 2022 from the CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Survey after the state passed its law discouraging classroom discussion of sexual orientation. (The state's education secretary said the survey was \"inflammatory\" and \"sexualized.\") Discontinuing the survey made it harder to discern whether the law had adverse mental health effects among Florida teens. \"States have taken on policies that would harm people and then are saying, 'We don't want to collect data about the impact of the policies,'\" Lindbergsaid. \"Burying your head in the sand is not going to be a way to keep the country healthy.\" (HHS did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nMaking the halt on data gathering more confounding, though, is the fact that, in some areas, the information at risk of being lost has been buttressing some of the administration's own claims. For instance, Trump and Vice President JD Vance have repeatedly cited, as an argument for tougher border enforcement, the past decade's surge in fentanyl addiction - a trend that has been definitively captured by the national drug use survey that is now imperiled. That survey's mental health components have also undergirded research on the threat being posed to the nation's young people by smartphones and social media, which many conservatives have taken up as a cudgel against Big Tech.\n\nOr take education. The administration and its conservative allies have been able to argue that Democratic-led states kept schools closed too long during the pandemic because there was nationwide data - the National Assessment of Educational Progress, aka the Nation's Report Card - that showed greater drops in student achievement in districts that stayed closed longer . But now NAEP is likely to be reduced in scope as part of crippling layoffs at the Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics, which has been slashed from nearly 100 employees to only three, casting into doubt the future not only of NAEP but also of a wide array of long-running longitudinal evaluations and the department's detailed tallies of nationwide K-12 and higher education enrollment . The department did not respond to a request for comment but released a statement on Thursday saying the next round of NAEP assessments would still be held next year.\n\nDan Goldhaber, an education researcher at the University of Washington, cast the self- defeating nature of the administration's war on educational assessment in blunt terms: \"The irony here is that if you look at some of the statements around the Department of Education, it's, 'We've invested X billion in the department and yet achievement has fallen off a cliff.' But the only reason we know that is because of the NAEP data collection effort!\"\n\nShelly Burns, a mathematical statistician who worked at NCES for about 35 years before her entire team was laid off in March, made a similar point about falling student achievement. \"How does the country know that? They know it because we collected it. And we didn't spin it. We didn't say, 'Biden is president, so let's make it look good,'\" she said. \"Their new idea about how to make education great again - how will you know if it worked if you don't have independent data collection?\"\n\n\"Reality has a well-known liberal bias,\" Stephen Colbert liked to quip, and there have been plenty of liberal commentators who have, over the years, taken that drollery at face value, suggesting that the numbers all point one way in the nation's political debates. In fact, in plenty of areas, they don't.\n\nIt's worth noting that Project 2025's lengthy blueprint for the Trump administration makes no explicit recommendation to undo the government's data-collection efforts. The blueprint is chock full of references to data-based decision-making, and in some areas, such as immigration enforcement, it urges the next administration to collect and share more data than its predecessors had.\n\nBut when an administration is making such a concerted effort to stifle assessments of government and society at large, it is hard not to conclude that it lacks confidence in the efficacy of its current national overhaul. As one dataset after another falls by the wayside, the nation's policymakers are losing their ability to make evidence-based decisions, and the public is losing the ability to hold them accountable for their results. Even if a future administration seeks to resurrect some of the curtailed efforts, the 2025-29 hiatus will make trends harder to identify and understand.\n\nWho knows if the country will be able to rebuild that measurement capacity in the future. For now, the loss is incalculable.\n\nJesse Coburn , Eli Hager , Abrahm Lustgarten , Mark Olalde , Jennifer Smith Richards and Lisa Song contributed reporting.\n\nA Wisconsin teenager accused of murdering two family members and plotting to assassinate President Donald Trump was inspired by Terrorgram, a white supremacist network that operated on the Telegram messaging and social media platform for half a decade, according to federal court records.\n\nThe Terrorgram community, which has been linked to around three dozen criminal cases around the globe, including at least three mass shootings, was profiled last month in stories and a documentary produced by ProPublica and FRONTLINE.\n\nThe court documents allege that Nikita Casap, a 17-year-old from Waukesha, Wisconsin, wrote a three-page manifesto calling for the assassination of Trump in order to \"foment a political revolution in the United States and 'save the white race' from 'Jewish controlled politicians.'\"\n\nIn his manifesto, Casap allegedly encouraged people to read the writings of Juraj Krajčík , a longtime Terrogram figure who murdered two people in an attack on an LGBTQ+ bar in Bratislava, Slovakia, in 2022, according to the court records. Casap also allegedly recommended two publications produced by the Terrorgram Collective, a secretive group that produced alleged hit lists, videos and written publications - including instructions for building bombs and sabotaging critical infrastructure - and distributed them throughout the Terrorgram ecosystem.\n\nLaunched in 2019, Terrorgram was a constellation of scores of Telegram channels and chat groups focused on inciting acts of white supremacist terrorism and anti-government sabotage. At the network's peak, some Terrorgram channels drew thousands of followers. Over the past six months, however, the network has been disrupted as authorities in Canada, the U.S. and Europe have arrested key Terrorgram influencers and community members.\n\nBut the violence hasn't stopped.\n\nCasap in February allegedly shot and killed his mother, Tatiana Casap, and stepfather, Donald Mayer; stole their property; and fled in their Volkswagen Atlas, Waukesha County prosecutors say. He was arrested in Kansas. Prosecutors have charged the teen with two counts of first-degree homicide, as well as identity theft and other theft charges. He is expected to be arraigned on May 7, according to court records.\n\nA witness told local investigators that Casap \"was in touch with a male in Russia through the Telegram app and they were planning to overthrow the U.S. government and assassinate President Trump,\" according to charging documents in the Wisconsin case.\n\nThe newly unsealed federal court filings indicate that the FBI is investigating Casap in connection to the alleged assassination plot.\n\nThe bureau declined to comment on the matter.\n\nLast fall, federal prosecutors accused two Americans of acting as leaders of the Terrorgram Collective and charged them with soliciting the murder of federal officials and a host of other terrorism-related offenses. The U.S. State Department has officially designated the Terrorgram Collective as a terrorist organization, as have officials in the United Kingdom and Australia. The two Americans have pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\n\"Do absolutely anything you can that will lead to the collapse of America or any country you live in,\" Casap allegedly wrote in his manifesto, according to an FBI affidavit. \"This is the only way we can save the White race.\"\n\nThe teen's writings and online postings that are cited in the affidavit indicate that he is a believer in militant accelerationism, a concept that has become increasingly popular with neo-Nazis and other right-wing extremists over the past decade. Militant accelerationists aim to speed the collapse of modern society through acts of spectacular violence; from the ruins of today's democracies, they aim to build all-white ethno-states organized on fascist principles.\n\nMatthew Kriner, executive director of the Institute for Countering Digital Extremism, a nonprofit think tank, called the alleged Casap plot unique. \"It's the first time we're explicitly seeing an individual tie an accelerationist act or plot with the president of the United States as a means of collapsing society,\" Kriner said. \"I think what we have here is a fairly clear-cut case of an individual who is being groomed to take drastic terrorist action in an accelerationist manner.\"\n\nCasap's public defender could not be reached for comment.\n\nA Telegram spokesperson said, \"Telegram supports the peaceful exchange of ideas; however, calls for violence are strictly prohibited by our Terms of Service and are removed proactively as well as in response to user reports.\"\n\nA ProPublica and FRONTLINE review shows that Casap was recently active in at least five extremist Telegram channels or chat groups, including a Russian-language neo-Nazi chat in which posters uploaded detailed instructions for crafting explosives, poisons and improvised firearms. He was also a member of a chat group with more than 4,300 participants run by the Misanthropic Division, a global neo-Nazi organization.\n\nCasap, according to the federal documents, also sought out information online about the Order of Nine Angles, a cult that blends Satanic concepts and Nazi ideology and has increasingly turned to Telegram to recruit and proselytize.\n\n\"This is a clear example of how Terrorgram continues to influence murder,\" said Jennefer Harper, a researcher who studies online extremism. \"Nikita was influenced online by an assortment of ideologies and groups that intersect with the Terrorgram ecosphere.\"\n\nWhen news broke in January that the Trump Justice Department was freezing significant work on civil rights litigation, including police reform cases , attention immediately focused on two cities: Minneapolis and Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nBoth places were on the cusp of entering court-enforced agreements to overhaul their police forces after high-profile police killings there sparked a nationwide reckoning over race and policing.\n\nBut it's now clear that the administration's move will be felt well beyond those two cities. In fact, it throws into question police reform efforts in at least eight other communities across the country, according to a ProPublica review. The need for change in these places was documented in a flurry of investigations published by the Justice Department in the final year of Joe Biden's presidency. All of the probes found a \"pattern or practice\" of unlawful behavior that was routine enough that the federal government recommended reforms.\n\nFrom Phoenix to Trenton, New Jersey, federal officials investigating the eight agencies found unjustified killings, excessive force, debtors' prisons, retaliation against police critics, racial discrimination, unlawful strip searches and officers having sexual contact with sex workers during undercover operations.\n\nSuch findings are typically the first step toward a department agreeing to federal oversight and court-ordered reform. Over the years, the DOJ has credited such agreements, known as consent decrees, for having helped departments reduce unnecessary use of force, cut crime rates and improve responses to people with behavioral health needs. President Donald Trump's Justice Department, however, has ordered its civil rights attorneys to pause such work until further notice, effectively reinstating the limited approach it took during the president's first term. Department officials did not respond to questions about the pause or how long it would remain in effect.\n\nFor now, that means any reform efforts will be up to local leadership - a dynamic that experts say could bode poorly for communities with long histories of police abuse.\n\nCliff Johnson, an attorney and director of the Mississippi office of the MacArthur Justice Center, a nonprofit legal organization, was not optimistic.\n\n\"While those DOJ reports sometimes can lead municipalities, police departments and other offenders to come to Jesus,\" Johnson said, \"what we've been seeing, from our perspective, is folks saying, 'I don't need Jesus. I got Trump.'\"\n\nLouisiana leaders, for example, have slammed the Justice Department's report , which found a pattern of problems in the way the state police used force against civilians. Gov. Jeff Landry said the report was an attempt by the Biden administration to \"diminish the service and exceptionality\" of the state police. And state Attorney General Liz Murrill said the Justice Department was being used to \"advance a political agenda.\"\n\nThe report was partly spurred by the 2019 death of Ronald Greene, who was killed while in the custody of Louisiana State Police. Officers repeatedly shocked him with a Taser, dragged him by his ankle shackles and then left him face down in the road. Some officers deactivated or muted their body cameras during the incident. Louisiana troopers had claimed Greene died when his car crashed after a high-speed chase. The department was forced to change its story when The Associated Press obtained and published body-camera footage of the incident.\n\nFederal investigators found the episode was not an outlier. According to their report, officers in the department used Tasers without warning and against people who were restrained or who did not pose a threat, didn't give people the chance to comply before using force, used force against people who weren't a threat, and used excessive force against people running from officers.\n\nA spokesperson for the Louisiana State Police did not answer questions about the report's findings but said the agency is working to improve its relationship with citizens and other stakeholders. Landry's office did not respond to ProPublica's questions about the report and the state's response, and Murrill's office declined to comment.\n\nAcross the state line in Lexington, Mississippi , the Justice Department's shift away from police accountability could also be consequential. Department officials said residents there were so afraid of local police that they were hesitant to meet with investigators in public, fearful of retaliation.\n\nThey had good reason to be concerned. In 2023, officers arrested an attorney who was representing citizens in police abuse cases against the department. She had been filming a traffic stop at the time.\n\nThe police force - made up of about 10 officers, some of whom are part time - is the smallest the Justice Department has investigated in decades. Federal investigators ultimately found that its officers use excessive force, discriminate against Black people, conduct stops and searches without probable cause, and arrest people purely for not having the money to pay fines.\n\nIt's unclear what steps, if any, the Lexington Police Department is taking in response to the report. Police Chief Charles Henderson declined to comment and directed questions to the city attorney, who did not return a call.\n\nReform advocates have put their hopes in upcoming elections in Lexington that could bring in new leadership that is more interested in making changes at the police department.\n\nIn Mount Vernon, New York , advocates say they've seen little movement since the Justice Department found police there use excessive force, conduct unlawful strip and body cavity searches of arrestees, and fail to properly train officers and supervisors. It also found police discriminated against Black people. One group is considering legal action to bring the city to the table.\n\n\"It seems like Mount Vernon has put lip service on addressing the findings,\" said Daniel Lambright, an attorney with the New York Civil Liberties Union. \"It remains unclear actually what they're doing to address the findings.\"\n\nIn their report, federal investigators expressed concern that the police department's \"overly aggressive tactics unnecessarily escalate encounters.\" In one instance, they wrote, five Mount Vernon officers used force on a man they thought was selling drugs - without announcing their presence or attempting to arrest him peacefully. Instead, one of the officers approached the man from behind and attempted to put him in an \"upper body hold,\" which started an altercation, according to the report. Police then threw the man to the ground. One officer drove his Taser into the suspect five times while another repeatedly punched him in the head. The man suffered a broken nose.\n\n\"The reform efforts have to continue,\" said the Rev. Stephen Pogue, a member of the United Black Clergy of Westchester, an organization that works on social justice matters in Mount Vernon and surrounding areas. \"We're not in one of those places where Trump is our god. In Mount Vernon, we still need Jesus.\"\n\nPogue said he hopes the city will host a public meeting about the report before the summer.\n\nMayor Shawyn Patterson-Howard and a police spokesperson did not reply to interview requests. But in December, the mayor said in a statement that the city would work with the Justice Department to address its findings. \"We wholeheartedly support our good officers and at the same time will not tolerate and will punish unconstitutional policing,\" she said.\n\nIn Phoenix , city and police officials have sent conflicting signals about the federal investigation, which found the Police Department used excessive and deadly force, violated the rights of homeless people, and discriminated against Black, Latino, Native American people, as well as those who have behavioral disabilities. \"Why the hell would anybody ever accept a consent decree?\" said one City Council member months before the report was released. Afterward, the head of the police union said the investigation was a \"farce\" and part of an \"unprofessional smear campaign.\"\n\nBut Mayor Kate Gallego has said the city is taking the report seriously. In September, the City Council passed several police reform measures, including requiring all officers who deal with the public to use body-worn cameras, even the special units that have been at the center of controversial shootings.\n\n\"Regardless of the new federal administration, these reforms are moving forward, and the mayor's commitment to improving the police department is unwavering,\" a mayoral spokesperson told ProPublica.\n\nSome of the other cities the Justice Department had targeted are taking small steps toward fixing problems the federal investigators identified, though it's unclear whether the efforts will result in lasting change.\n\nIn Oklahoma City, where Justice found in January that police officers discriminate against people with behavioral health disabilities, the city recently began funding mobile mental health units that can respond to incidents instead of police, said Jessica Hawkins, chair of the city's Crisis Intervention Advisory Group. She said the city is also working on a written response to the DOJ report but didn't know when it would be completed.\n\nPolice Chief Ron Bacy declined ProPublica's request for an interview and through a spokesperson said the department was \"still reviewing the report.\"\n\nIn Memphis, Tennessee, where federal investigators found that police use excessive force, conduct unlawful stops and discriminate against Black people, the mayor put together a reform task force, led by a retired federal judge. \"The DOJ report, in our case, kick-started a conversation that had sort of gone cold,\" said Josh Spickler, executive director of Just City, an organization that works on litigation and justice matters in Memphis.\n\nAnd in Trenton, New Jersey , where the Justice Department found that local police have a pattern or practice of using excessive force and conducting unlawful pedestrian and vehicle stops, City Council member Jasi Edwards has been hosting community meetings to introduce the idea of a civilian complaint review board and build support for the measure. Edwards said she plans to formally put forth her proposal sometime in the fall.\n\nIt will likely run into resistance, though. Representatives of the Police Department and mayor told ProPublica that they didn't believe a civilian review board was necessary because it would be costly and there are existing ways for citizens to complain about police conduct. The DOJ report, they said, highlighted some areas in need of improvement but mischaracterized a number of cases and gave an inaccurate depiction of the department's culture.\n\nIn Worcester, Massachusetts, reforms are already moving forward in response to the Justice Department's investigation .\n\nLast month, the police chief released a 15-page report on proposed measures intended to remedy the problems identified by federal investigators. The changes, which are still awaiting legal review, include prohibiting police from releasing K-9 dogs into mass gatherings or riot scenes and requiring a supervisor to go to a scene if someone reports being injured by police.\n\nThe police chief, Paul Socier, has also proposed several changes to how officers approach prostitution. Investigators found the department engaged in \"outrageous government conduct\" with sex workers by having sexual contact during undercover operations.\n\n\"We are hopefully headed in the right direction,\" said Audra Doody, co-executive director of Safe Exit Initiative, an organization in Worcester that provides services, housing and counseling to sex workers who want to leave the sex trade. \"With a time of such uncertainty, I want to believe our people in the community are telling the truth and actually are going to do what they say they're going to do, which they seem like they are, right now.\"\n\nProPublica is reporting on how the Trump administration's efforts to reshape the federal government will impact the Department of Justice and its work on civil rights.

Ecologists, chemists and biologists at Montlake Laboratory, the center's headquarters in Seattle, are taking turns hauling garbage to the dumpster and discussing whether they should create a sign-up sheet to scrub toilets.\n\nThe scientists - who conduct genetic sampling of endangered salmon to check the species' stock status and survival - routinely work with chemicals that can burn skin, erupt into flames and cause cancer. At least one said they'd have to delay mission-critical research if hazardous waste removal isn't restored.\n\nThe deteriorating conditions at Montlake stem from a new policy at the Commerce Department that says Secretary Howard Lutnick must personally approve all contracts over $100,000. NPR reported that the bottleneck has disrupted operations at many NOAA facilities.\n\nProPublica spoke to three Montlake employees who described what it was like to work there as, one by one, service contracts expire and aren't renewed. People are running around looking for compost bags and wondering who will empty out the female sanitary waste containers in the bathrooms, they said. The floors are getting dirty and workers have no access to vacuums or mops. Some scientists have bought their own soap and cleaning supplies.\n\nNor can people escape by working from home: the Trump administration has increasingly ordered federal workers to return to the office five days a week. At Montlake, that policy will apply to everyone by April 21.\n\n\"It's making our work unsafe, and it's unsanitary for any workplace,\" but especially an active laboratory full of fire-reactive chemicals and bacteria, one Montlake researcher said.\n\nPress officers at NOAA, the Commerce Department and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMontlake employees were informed last week that a contract for safety services - which includes the staff who move laboratory waste off-campus to designated disposal sites - would lapse after April 9, leaving just one person responsible for this task. Hazardous waste \"pickups from labs may be delayed,\" employees were warned in a recent email.\n\nThe building maintenance team's contract expired Wednesday, which decimated the staff that had handled plumbing, HVAC and the elevators. Other contacts lapsed in late March, leaving the Seattle lab with zero janitorial staff and a skeleton crew of IT specialists.\n\nDuring a big staff meeting at Montlake on Wednesday, lab leaders said they had no updates on when the contracts might be renewed, one researcher said. They also acknowledged it was unfair that everyone would need to pitch in on janitorial duties on top of their actual jobs.\n\nNick Tolimieri, a union representative for Montlake employees, said the problem is \"all part of the large-scale bullying program\" to push out federal workers. It seems like every Friday \"we get some kind of message that makes you unable to sleep for the entire weekend,\" he said. Now, with these lapsed contracts, it's getting \"more and more petty.\"\n\nThe problems, large and small, at Montlake provide a case study of the chaos that's engulfed federal workers across many agencies as the Trump administration has fired staff, dumped contracts and eliminated long-time operational support. Yesterday, hundreds of NOAA workers who had been fired in February , then briefly reinstated, were fired again.\n\nLocal management had new service contracts ready to go ages ago, Tolimieri said. The delay from headquarters means employees will struggle to get repairs for their computers or basic building maintenance; the aging elevators at Montlake already break so often that Tolimieri joked it would be easier to send notices on the occasions when they did work.\n\nThe fisheries center employs more than 350 people, most of whom work at Montlake. The rest are scattered across several research stations in Oregon and Washington.\n\nStaff at the center conduct research and provide scientific advice for policies on sustainable fishing and endangered species, including a population of orcas in Puget Sound. They test seafood after oil spills to ensure the fish are safe to eat. Their work helps restore native salmon populations and support regional farming.\n\nNOAA is \"so uncontroversial,\" said the Montlake researcher who's worried about hazardous waste disposal. Employees are just \"trying to do weather reports and give people good seafood.\"\n\nThe researcher said lab workers are trained in basic lab safety, so the chemicals are properly stored, handled and placed into appropriate waste containers after use. But there's a limit to how much chemical waste can be kept on site. And the contractors who left were experts on handling emergencies like large chemical spills or serious toxic exposures.\n\nIf those contractors don't return soon, the researcher said, the lab may need to delay or pause important research.\n\nThat could include chemical-intensive lab work like testing sea lions, killer whales and walruses from Alaska for environmental contaminants, Tolimieri said.\n\n\"For a bunch of people who are screaming about efficiency,\" he said, referring to the administration's efforts to downsize the federal government, \"they've done the most inefficient things possible.\"\n\nIn June 2005, a former employee from the Federal Emergency Management Agency toured the grounds of the Bonnaroo music festival in rural Tennessee. He wasn't there to see the headliners, which included Dave Matthews Band and the lead singer of the popular jam band Phish. He was there to meet the guys setting up the toilets for the throng of psychedelics-infused campers in attendance: Richard Stapleton, a construction industry veteran, and his business partner Robert Napior, a onetime convicted pot grower, who specialized in setting up music festivals.\n\nThe meeting, described in court documents, offered the pair's fledgling company, Deployed Resources, a key introduction to players doing government contract work for the Department of Homeland Security, the agency that oversees not only the nation's disaster responses but also its immigration system. Over the next two decades, Stapleton and Napior hired more than a dozen former agency insiders as they turned their small-time logistics business, which had helped support outdoor festivals like Lollapalooza, into a contracting giant by building camps for a completely different use: detaining immigrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nNow, as the government races to carry out President Donald Trump's campaign promise of mass deportations, Deployed is shifting its business once more - from holding people who are trying to enter the country to detaining those the government is seeking to ship out.\n\nIn Trump's second term in office, the government is poised to spend tens of billions of dollars on immigration detention, including unprecedented plans to hold immigrants arrested in the U.S. in massive tent camps on military bases. One recently published request for contract proposals said the Department of Homeland Security could spend up to $45 billion over the next several years on immigrant detention. The plans have set off a gold rush among contractors. All this spending is unfolding at the same time the government has made sweeping cuts to federal agencies and shed other contracts.\n\nAmong those seeking a windfall is Deployed Resources, which, along with its sister company, Deployed Services, has adapted to shifting government policies and priorities in immigration enforcement.\n\nStarting in 2016, to help respond to spikes in immigrant crossings that had periodically overwhelmed border stations, Deployed began setting up tent encampments to ease the overcrowding. These temporary structures served as short-term emergency waystations, which several former officials said provided flexibility that the U.S. needed. Many of those arriving - including families and unaccompanied children - were turning themselves in, hoping to be released into the U.S. to apply for asylum. In all, the company has been awarded more than $4 billion in government contracts building and operating border tents, according to an analysis of contracting data by ProPublica.\n\nSince taking office in January, Trump has cracked down on asylum, pushing border crossings to record lows. Last month, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it no longer needed the tent facilities run by Deployed.\n\nInstead, ProPublica found, the military will now be contracting with Deployed to use one of those border facilities to house people arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nIn March, one of the company's tent complexes in El Paso, Texas, was handed over to ICE, CBP and ICE spokespeople said. In an unusual move, the Trump administration tapped funds from the Department of Defense to pay Deployed for the facility, citing the president's declaration of an emergency at the southern border , a DOD spokesperson said. The nearly $140 million contract wasn't posted publicly and was given to Deployed as the \"incumbent contractor,\" the spokesperson said, without further explaining why ICE would use military funds. ICE said it started transferring detainees to the site - which currently has the capacity to house 1,000 adults - on March 10.\n\nAs immigration raids escalate, detention space in the country's existing network of permanent ICE prisons is filling up. There are currently around 48,000 immigrants locked up across the country, levels not seen since 2019. Deportations are happening at a slower pace than ICE arrests, according to data shared with ProPublica, so the administration is turning to companies that can quickly set up facilities.\n\nAs it looks to expand its capacity, the agency \"is exploring all options to meet its current and future detention requirements,\" said ICE spokesman Miguel Alvarez.\n\nYet using tents to house thousands of people arrested by ICE is fundamentally different from using them to house recent border crossers, many of whom weren't supposed to be held for more than a few days, seven current and former DHS officials who served in both Republican and Democratic administrations told ProPublica.\n\nThey said it would be the first time these tent camps would be used for ICE detainees in the U.S. and that it was unclear how they could be constructed to meet the agency's basic health and safety requirements. These include separate areas for men and women and dedicated zones for families, as well as space to segregate those who are potentially violent, and private meeting areas for lawyers and their clients. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not directly involved in the contracts.\n\n\"People that you've ripped out of the community, people you've arrested, people who want to get back to their children, people who are scared, are going to behave differently than the border crossing population,\" said one former ICE official. \"You have a lot more fear in the population.\"\n\n\"It would take a remarkable degree of innovation from a contractor,\" said another former DHS official, adding, \"It would also be incredibly expensive.\"\n\nAt a border security conference this week, ICE Acting Assistant Director for Operations Support Ralph Ferguson said that Deployed Resources was modifying the CBP tents in El Paso by adding more rigid structures inside, which he said would make them more secure. Deployed got an additional contract for up to $5 million to provide unarmed guards at the El Paso facility, according to a public notice posted in late March.\n\nThe company did not respond to requests for comment. On its website, Deployed says it is \"dedicated to safely and efficiently providing transparent facility support and logistical services, anytime, anywhere\" and describes itself as \"the first-choice provider\" for government contracts.\n\nDeployed was also one of the companies interested in operating an immigrant detention camp on the nearby Fort Bliss military base, according to government documents obtained by ProPublica and interviews with people familiar with the contracting process. ICE was seeking proposals from vendors last month for a 1,000-bed camp that could grow to 5,000 beds, housing women and men, including those deemed high security risks, as well as families with small children. The contractor would be responsible for separating those groups and preventing escapes, documents reviewed by ProPublica show.\n\nThe plans are \"a recipe for disaster,\" said Eunice Hyunhye Cho, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union's National Prison Project.\n\n\"All of the problems that we see with ICE detention writ large, like the abuse of force, the sexual assault, medical neglect, the lack of food, lack of access to counsel, lack of due process rights, lack of access to telephones - the list goes on - all of those things are going to be vastly more complicated in a system where you are literally setting up people in tents that are surrounded by barbed wire and armed military personnel,\" Cho said.\n\nSince 2016, Deployed Resources has enjoyed a virtual monopoly on providing CBP with immigration tent structures to help with sudden influxes of immigrants. During the first Trump administration, the contractor set up temporary tent courts for people forced to wait in Mexico for their asylum hearings under a policy known as the Migrant Protection Protocols. The company also earned hundreds of millions of dollars during the Biden years operating emergency detention facilities for unaccompanied minors that were funded by the Department of Health and Human Services .\n\nThough the value of Deployed Resources isn't publicly known, county real estate records attest to the wealth its owners, Stapleton and Napior, have amassed in the detention business.\n\nIn the spring of 2019, shortly after the company landed what was then its biggest immigration contract - a $92 million no-bid award to run two tent facilities in Texas - Stapleton purchased a $5.7 million condo in Naples, Florida. Nearly three years and more than $1 billion in contracts later, he upgraded to a $15 million home a block away from the shore. Napior snapped up a $9 million beachside property near Sarasota, Florida, in 2023. Stapleton did not respond to requests for comment. Reached by phone, Napior said he did not comment to the press and then hung up.\n\nAfter the meeting at Bonnaroo in 2005, Deployed later hired the former FEMA employee who had checked out its facilities there and to win emergency management contracting work at the agency before moving into immigration detention. In court filings, Deployed said that the meeting did not lead to its FEMA work.\n\nDeployed went on to hire additional former DHS officials over the years, expanding its connections to the federal agencies with which it does business. With a second Trump administration poised to crack down further on the flow of immigrants to the southern border - a potential threat to Deployed's core business - the company hired several former ICE leaders, according to online searches and current and former officials.\n\nA month after Trump's victory, former ICE field office director Sean Ervin announced he was joining Deployed as a senior adviser for strategic initiatives. He had previously overseen removal operations across Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. The head of field operations for ICE Miami, Michael Meade - an 18-year agency veteran - also joined Deployed that month, according to their profiles on LinkedIn. Meade and Ervin did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nDeployed has continued to win federal business even after the spending on the company's contracts was criticized by government watchdogs and a whistleblower.\n\nA review by Congress' Government Accountability Office of one no-bid CBP contract that the first Trump administration awarded to Deployed found that the company's 2,500-person facility in Tornillo, Texas, averaged just 30 detainees a night in the fall of 2019 and never held more than 68 during the five-month period it was open. It also found that CBP paid Deployed millions for meals it didn't need to feed people it wasn't holding. Deployed agreed to reimburse $250,000 for meals not delivered, the GAO said.\n\nA separate whistleblower lawsuit in New Hampshire brought by a former DHS official who worked for Deployed accuses the company of cutting corners on training its staff to detect and report sexual abuse of children in facilities it set up to house unaccompanied minors during the Biden administration. In court filings, Deployed said it \"vigorously disputes the allegations\" and has moved to dismiss the suit.\n\nLast year, Dan Bishop, a former Republican congressman from North Carolina, held up a Deployed Services contract in Greensboro , North Carolina, as an example of waste during a hearing on unaccompanied migrant children . The company was paid nearly $40 million to help operate a facility for immigrant children, Bishop said, but it stood empty for over two years.\n\nDeployed nonetheless had workers there full time, according to interviews with three former employees familiar with the facility, tasking them with playacting as if they were providing care. Case managers invented case details and Deployed workers would role-play as students in classrooms, even asking for permission to go to the bathroom, according to the former Deployed workers and social media posts of former workers describing the surreal situation.\n\n\"I have no idea why they were doing that with government money,\" said one former case manager, who recalled inventing elaborate backstories for fictional children, filling out make-believe statements and other paperwork for hours each day. The case manager spent about a year in Greensboro, living in housing paid for by Deployed from its government contract. Deployed did not respond to requests for comment about its Greensboro contract.\n\nNow, with even more money to be spent on immigration detention, Deployed is just one of the companies hoping to benefit. In addition to Fort Bliss more than 10 military sites around the country are being considered for ICE detention facilities, according to a DHS document shared with ProPublica. The New York Times previously reported on elements of the plan.\n\nThe Fort Bliss contracting process has proceeded mostly out of public view, and it's not clear if the project would go forward or fall under the larger $45 billion plan to expand immigration detention. In March, representatives from at least 10 companies, including Deployed Resources, toured Fort Bliss with DHS officials to survey the site, said two people familiar with the visit. Also there were private prison giants The GEO Group and CoreCivic, the sources said.\n\nThe GEO Group's leadership and allied political action groups donated more than $1 million to Trump's reelection effort, according to a review by the Project on Government Oversight , a nonpartisan Washington watchdog group. On its most recent earnings call , GEO's CEO said Trump's immigration agenda was an \"unprecedented opportunity\" for the firm. CoreCivic - which donated $500,000 to Trump's inauguration committee - has also spoken about the business opportunities . After Trump's election, stock prices for both companies jumped.\n\nCoreCivic said it is in \"regular contact\" with government agencies \"to understand their changing needs\" but said that it does not comment on contracts it is seeking. Its contribution to inauguration events was \"consistent with our past practice of civic participation\" supporting both parties. The GEO Group did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nDeployed Services has largely eschewed political donations, sticking to its strategy - also used by GEO and CoreCivic - of hiring former high-ranking government officials.\n\nA few weeks ago Deployed scored another high-profile ICE hire: Marlen Pineiro joined Deployed after 40 years in government, including more than a decade in ICE's Senior Executive Service, according to her LinkedIn profile. At a border security conference this week, where several former high-ranking DHS employees hired by Deployed were gathered among industry vets and Trump immigration officials, Pineiro declined an interview request from a ProPublica reporter.\n\nBut on LinkedIn, the congratulations rolled in. The acting head of ICE under Trump, Todd Lyons, posted: \"Great news.\" Two other senior ICE officials who had also recently joined Deployed commented: \"Welcome aboard.\"\n\n\"Let's sail away,\" Pineiro replied. \"Woohooo see you soon.\"\n\nNote: ProPublica analyzed transaction-level contract data from usaspending.gov for this story. Contract amounts reported are federal obligations over the life of a contract or group of contracts. In the case of the recently announced Department of Defense award to Deployed Resources, the contract is new and worth up to $140 million.\n\nPerla Trevizo contributed reporting and Kirsten Berg contributed research.\n\nReporting Highlights\n\nThese highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.\n\nOn a late afternoon in November 2017, Witney Arch told her 1-1/2-year-old son to stop playing and come inside. Upset, he grabbed her right breast when she picked him up. She experienced a shock of pain but did not think it was anything serious. A week later, however, the ache had not subsided. After trips to several doctors, a biopsy revealed that Arch had early-stage breast cancer. Her surgeon told her that it was likely invasive and aggressive.\n\nBy the end of January, she had made two critical decisions. She would get a double mastectomy. And she wanted her operation at the Center for Restorative Breast Surgery in New Orleans, a medical facility renowned for its highly specialized approach to breast cancer care and reconstruction. The two surgeons who founded it had pioneered techniques that used a woman's own body tissue to form new breasts post mastectomy. The idea of a natural restoration appealed to Arch. \"I don't judge anybody for getting implants, especially if you've had cancer,\" she said. \"But I felt like I was taking something foreign out of my body, cancer, and I did not want to put something foreign back in.\"\n\nArch was a 42-year-old preschool teacher for her church, with four young children, living in a suburb of New Orleans. The 1-1/2-year-old had been born with Sturge-Weber syndrome, a rare neurological disorder. Caring for him consumed her life. By nature upbeat and optimistic, Arch felt blessed that her son's act of defiance had led to an early diagnosis. \"We're going to pray about this and we're going to figure it out,\" she told her husband.\n\nArch asked her insurer, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana, for approval to go to the center for her care, and the company granted it, a process known as prior authorization. Then, a week or so before her surgery, Arch was wrangling child care and meal plans when she got a call from the insurer. The representative on the line was trying to persuade her to have the surgery elsewhere. She urged Arch to seek a hospital that, unlike the center, was in network and charged less. \"Do you realize how much this is going to cost?\" Arch remembered the agent asking. Arch did not need more stress, but here it was - from her own health plan. \"I feel very comfortable with my decision,\" she replied. \"My doctor teaches other doctors around the world how to do this.\" Over the next year, Arch underwent five operations to rid herself of cancer and reconstruct her breasts.\n\nArch did not know it at the time, but her surgery would become evidence in a long-running legal fight between the breast center's founders, surgeons Frank DellaCroce and Scott Sullivan, and Blue Cross, Louisiana's biggest health insurance company, with an estimated two-thirds share of the market. DellaCroce and Sullivan had repeatedly sued the insurer, alleging that it granted approvals for surgery but then denied payments or paid only a fraction of patients' bills. They pointed to calls like the one Arch received as proof of the company's effort to drive away patients. The aggressive legal attack, they knew, was fraught. Litigation against the $3.4 billion company would take a long time and a lot of money. The chances of winning were slight. \"You fight dragons at great peril,\" DellaCroce would tell friends. But this September, after 18 years and several defeats in court, jurors found Blue Cross liable for fraud. They awarded the center $421 million - one of the largest verdicts ever to a single medical practice outside of a class-action lawsuit. In a statement , Blue Cross said it \"disagrees with the jury's decision, which we believe was wrong on the facts and the law. We have filed an appeal and expect to be successful.\"\n\nFrustration with insurers is at an all-time high. The December fatal shooting of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson allegedly by Luigi Mangione serves as an extreme and tragic example. Doctors and insurers are locked into a perpetual conflict over health care costs, with patients caught in the middle. Doctors accuse insurance plans of blocking payments for health care treatments that can save the patients' lives. Insurance companies insist they shouldn't pay for procedures that they say are unnecessary or overpriced. It is easy to emerge from an examination of the American health care system with a cynicism that both sides are broken and corrupt.\n\nHowever, interviews with scores of doctors, patients and insurance executives, as well as reviews of internal documents, regulatory filings and academic studies, reveal a fundamental truth: The two sides are not evenly matched. Insurance companies are players in the fight over money, and they are also the referees. Insurers produce their own guidelines to determine whether to pay claims. When a doctor appeals a denial, insurers make all the initial decisions. In legal settings, insurers are often given favorable standing in their ability to set what conditions they are required to cover. Federal and state insurance regulators lack the resources to pursue individual complaints against multibillion-dollar companies. Six major insurers, which include some of the nation's largest companies, cover half of all Americans. They are pitted against tens of thousands of doctors' practices and large hospital chains.\n\nThe Blue Cross trial provides a rare opportunity to expose in detail the ways that health insurance companies wield power over doctors and their patients. Blue Cross executives testified that the breast center charged too much money - sometimes more than $180,000 for an operation. The center, they said, deserved special attention because it had a history of questionable charges. But the insurer's defense went even further, to the very meaning of \"prior authorization,\" which it had granted women like Arch to pursue surgery. The authorization, they said in court, recognized that a procedure was medically necessary, but it also contained a clause that it was \" not a guarantee of payment.\" Blue Cross was not obliged to pay the center anything, top executives testified. \"Let me be clear: The authorization never says we're going to pay you,\" said Steven Udvarhelyi, who was the CEO for the insurer from 2016 to 2024, in a deposition . \"That's why there's a disclaimer.\n\nFrom 2015 through 2023, the Baton Rouge-based insurer paid, on average, less than 9% of the charges billed by the breast center for more than 7,800 individual medical procedures - even though it had authorized all of them. Thousands of such claims were never paid at all, according to court records. Testimony revealed that the health plan never considered thousands of appeals filed by the center. Corporate documents showed Blue Cross executives had set up secret processes for approving operations and reimbursing the clinic and its doctors that resulted in reduced fees and payment delays. One lucrative strategy: A national-level policy allowed Blue Cross Louisiana to take a cut of any savings it achieved in paying the breast center on behalf of patients covered by out-of-state Blue Cross companies, meaning the less the insurer paid out, the more it earned.\n\nIn Sullivan's words, the insurer was hypocritical, \"morally bankrupt.\" Blue Cross had stranded many of the center's patients with high bills, amounts that it had absorbed over the years. On several occasions, though, Blue Cross executives had signed special one-time deals with the center, known as single case agreements, to pay for their wives' cancer treatment. To Sullivan, it seemed the insurer was willing to pay the center when patients had connections but would fight when patients did not.\n\nBlue Cross declined to comment on any individual cases but said in a statement that single case agreements were \"common in the industry\" and were available to all members when needed to access out-of-network providers.\n\nNobody would take the breast center and its adjoining hospital as an ordinary medical establishment. The two facilities take up a city block along St. Charles Avenue, the thoroughfare famous for its streetcars, Mardi Gras parades and Queen Anne mansions. Patients access the complex - created by merging a former law office, funeral home, car dealership and Dunkin' Donuts - by driving around back where a porte cochere leads into a soaring atrium. Light pours in through windows set in the high ceiling. Arrangements of white orchids are scattered among comfortable couches and chairs. Here, women consult with doctors to plan their treatment. Surgeries are performed at the 39-bed hospital, which has an Icee machine in a family room. New-age music plays softly throughout the building. Rooms are designed to be as homey as possible, with medical gear hidden away and seascapes by a local artist hanging on the wall. One patient's husband referred to it as a \"spa-spital.\"\n\nThe idea of combining the luxury feel of an upscale plastic surgery practice with the mission-driven zeal of a medical clinic came to DellaCroce and Sullivan while they were young surgeons. The two grew up in Louisiana. Sullivan spent much of his childhood in Mandeville, a suburb of New Orleans on the north side of Lake Ponchartrain, his dad employed in the oil and gas industry. His mother wanted him to be a priest or a doctor. \"I definitely was not going to become a priest,\" he said. DellaCroce's father worked at the paper mill in West Monroe in the state's northern neck. His mother, a nurse, gave him an appreciation for medicine as a career that was \"meaningful and challenging.\"\n\nThey became friends while working at the Louisiana State University medical center, where they earned the nickname \"the Sushi Brothers\" for their favorite lunch. They were drawn to microsurgery and breast reconstruction because it was an emerging field that was innovating and improving care. Both men became board-certified in plastic surgery. Sullivan, 60, is the hard-charging businessman, stocky, direct and blunt. DellaCroce, 58, with a ponytail, goatee and soft drawl, is more the diplomat, patient and cerebral. The pair have lectured around the world and written numerous medical journal articles.\n\nThey opened their first office in 2003 in a single room rented from a fellow doctor at what was then known as Memorial Medical Center, the hulking private hospital in New Orleans. They performed operations at facilities throughout the region but found that most gave little consideration to their patients' comfort. They wanted to build a different kind of hospital. \"Can we give them that little bit of extra without breaking the budget to make the experience less awful? Can't make it great, but can you make it less awful?\" DellaCroce explained. \"Can you attend to the human side of this patient and give them the added value of peace and confidence?\" Hurricane Katrina set back their construction plans, and the new edifice, named the St. Charles Surgical Hospital, did not open its doors until 2009. It boasts of being the only hospital in the country devoted solely to care for breast cancer patients who have received mastectomies. The center does not provide radiation or chemotherapy treatments. The majority of patients come from out of state.\n\nWomen seeking to have their breasts restored after a mastectomy face two paths. Some choose a relatively straightforward surgical procedure using implants filled with silicon or another gel. The center specializes in the other option, what's known as autologous tissue reconstruction, where a woman's own fat is taken from one part of the body, like the bottom or the stomach, and used to rebuild the breast. The procedure requires a longer recovery time, but the new breasts become part of the body.\n\nThe transplant surgery is lengthy and complex. Operations can last up to 12 hours with big medical teams involved. One surgeon performs the mastectomy while another creates a new breast by knitting together layers of fat and tissue. Concentration is intense. The surgeons stare through glasses with microscopes to connect new blood vessels with a needle that's thinner than an eyelash, using thread less than half the width of a human hair. DellaCroce and Sullivan invented techniques, for example, allowing tissue to be taken from multiple sites when a woman did not have enough fat in one part of her body for a full restoration.\n\nOne afternoon last fall, DellaCroce strode into a cavernous operating room to check on a patient. On the table in front of him, a woman lay covered in curtains of blue surgical cloth, only her torso exposed. Earlier in the day, a surgical oncologist had removed her right breast as part of a mastectomy to treat her cancer. Later, another surgeon had taken flaps of fat from her stomach and interlaced them with blood vessels to create a new breast to replace the lost one. Now, in the fifth hour of surgery, a physician's assistant leaned over her midsection, closing an incision along her side with some final stitches. Nurses hurried around the space, preparing to wrap up the operation. Paul Simon's \" You Can Call Me Al \" played in the background. The smell of burnt flesh hung in the air. A blue light signaled that the new arteries were successfully pumping blood. \"Wow, that woman looks really good,\" DellaCroce told the physician's assistant. \"Nice job.\"\n\nThere is no denying that the center's high-end treatment means high costs. The median charge for an operation and hospital stay is about $165,000. DellaCroce and Sullivan hired consultants to review other well-regarded practices, who advised them their prices were competitive with their peers. \"We weren't asking to be paid Lebron James, best of the best, even though we feel we're in the top 1 or 2% of the country,\" Sullivan said. \"We just wanted something fair.\"\n\nIt is one of the quirks of the American health care system that insurers almost never pay the prices for procedures demanded by doctors and hospitals.\n\nTo understand why requires a tour of the grand bargain at the heart of the health insurance system. Insurance companies negotiate with hospitals and doctors to discount reimbursements on medical procedures, like office visits or MRI scans. Providers who sign these contracts are in network. Insurance companies like in-network doctors because they can budget for health expenses and set premiums accordingly. Doctors and hospitals agree to be in network because they get a steady stream of insured patients.\n\nDellaCroce and Sullivan held contracts with insurers that resulted in average payments to the center's doctors in the $20,000 to $30,000 range. But DellaCroce and Sullivan never came to an agreement with Blue Cross. That made them an exception in Louisiana - the insurer is so dominant that 97% of local physicians and hospitals are in network. DellaCroce and Sullivan said the company was not offering them enough money - in some cases not even enough to cover the cost of the surgeries, they argued in court documents. The doctors and their hospital remained out of network, meaning they charged Blue Cross the full price for their procedures.\n\nSuch charges are controversial. Insurance companies and many health experts say they are too often inflated and untethered from actual costs. Physicians and hospitals say their fees are justified, reflecting the true price of medical care. In the end, insurers - especially in states like Louisiana, with few competitors - use their market power in negotiations to set reimbursements at what they want to pay, not what doctors charge.\n\nAt Blue Cross, Dwight Brower was charged with reviewing the bills from the breast center. He had worked as a physician at a small family practice in Baton Rouge and then at a local hospital before joining Blue Cross as a medical director. He helped oversee prior authorizations. While many patients assume that an approval means an insurer will pay for an operation, it is simply a recognition that a procedure is medically necessary. Federal law mandates that private insurers cover breast restorations for women who undergo mastectomies because of cancer or genetic risk. And patients, in general, are allowed to choose their own doctors.\n\nHowever, since the center was out of network and had no contract with the insurer, Blue Cross determined how much it would pay for the treatment, and Brower believed that the breast center's bills were exorbitant. \"I did not think that they were reasonable,\" he would later testify . Surgeons doing lung transplants or brain surgery rarely billed Blue Cross more than $50,000 for their work. Why should DellaCroce and Sullivan get so much more? \"Don't get me wrong. The surgeons at the center are extremely skilled,\" he acknowledged. The operations were often lengthy. \"But so are open-heart surgeries,\" he said. \"Relative to some of the other extremely complicated surgeries done by other surgeons in other areas of the body, it just seemed like their fee schedule was extremely high.\"\n\nBlue Cross Louisiana executives testified that they did not even consider doctors' invoices when making decisions on what to reimburse because such charges were \"unregulated\" and \"nonstandard.\" Instead, they paid \" an amount we establish \" - unless the doctor's bill was cheaper. In the end, the insurer said it settled on reimbursing the breast center about the same as in-network doctors performing similar operations, even though DellaCroce and Sullivan did not benefit from having patients referred to them. In practice, that meant the insurer paid out a fraction of the breast center's bills. Of the 7,837 medical procedures in dispute in the lawsuit, involving 1,680 patients, Blue Cross paid about $43 million on invoices totaling $500 million. Some 60% of the claims weren't reimbursed at all. The difference between the bill and the payment could be striking. For example, in the case of Arch, Blue Cross paid $8,580 out of $102,722 for one operation. For another, it paid $3,190 out of $34,975.\n\nExecutives said the Blue Cross reimbursements were fair, designed to keep premiums low for the nearly 2 million Louisianans who depended on the insurer to cover their health care. Paying the breast center's full fees would add to its customers' burden, they said. \"If we were to just agree to any rates or any prices set by physicians or any providers, it would cause cost to be exorbitantly high for both the plan and for members particularly, because we wouldn't be able to forecast or make sure those plans are actually sound,\" said Curtis Anders, the vice president of provider networks for Blue Cross. \"Premiums would increase.\"\n\nFor many out-of-network doctors, payments lower than their invoices are an infuriating part of doing business. They absorb the costs, or pass them on to their patients, a practice known as balance billing that can result in medical debt. DellaCroce and Sullivan were the rare physicians with the tenacity to fight. The center collected money from both insurers and patients - but it carried the unpaid portion of invoices on its books. That amount grew every year as it battled Blue Cross.\n\nDellaCroce and Sullivan were convinced that Blue Cross had singled them out for their obstreperousness, but they had no proof. Then, during a phone call one day, an employee for the center was talking to a Blue Cross representative to obtain a prior authorization. The representative let slip that the request required special handling. The breast center's doctors were flagged on an internal roster. It was called the targeted list.\n\nOn Dec. 8, 2023, several dozen attorneys and paralegals from Chehardy Sherman Williams, one of New Orleans' top law firms, were celebrating their annual holiday party. They had gathered in a private dining room with gilded mirrors and shimmering chandeliers at Arnaud's restaurant, a bastion of Creole cuisine in the heart of the French Quarter. The waiters served shrimp remoulade, prime rib and turtle soup. Small talk filled the air.\n\nSuddenly, several attorneys' cellphones buzzed as they all received the same email, a message from the lawyers for Blue Cross. It contained discovery for the case, more than 42,000 pages of internal documents, emails and policies. Matthew Sherman, one of the attorneys representing the center, turned to a colleague. \"Can you believe this?\" he asked. It was like something from a John Grisham novel, the kind of thing he and his friends had joked about at law school, a document dump at Christmas time. By long tradition, many of New Orleans' biggest law firms hold their holiday parties on the same Friday afternoon in December. Afterward, rival attorneys from around town gather for drinks under a flag of truce at a local bar. Sherman realized there would be no afterparty this year. Nor much of a holiday vacation.\n\nThe delivery of the documents was a Christmas gift nearly 20 years in the making. DellaCroce and Sullivan's first lawsuits against Blue Cross, involving 88 breach-of-contract claims filed in a Louisiana civil court beginning in 2006, were dismissed because of a federal court ruling regarding jurisdiction. A second lawsuit , which lasted from 2010 through 2017, resulted in limited discovery and a two-day trial in federal court. Jurors found that Blue Cross had failed to tell the center how much it would pay for procedures, but they also ruled the center had not been financially harmed. A judge dismissed the remaining claims.\n\nDellaCroce and Sullivan launched their third lawsuit in February 2017 with a novel legal theory: They accused Blue Cross of fraud. They contended that for years the insurer had issued prior authorizations without the intention of paying the actual bills. Their lawyers had sought the targeted list during discovery to help prove the case. Blue Cross denied it existed.\n\nBut now, as Sherman and fellow attorney Patrick Follette began poring over the thousands of documents, they came upon a spreadsheet that said \" Targeted Provider List .\" The first names on the list were DellaCroce and Sullivan. It was labeled \"confidential\" and dated June 2007 - about a year after the pair had filed their first lawsuit against Blue Cross alleging nonpayment. More digging turned up other documents. There was a \"blocked\" list that also featured the two doctors.\n\nA corporate policy document provided what DellaCroce and Sullivan considered the most revealing explanation for Blue Cross' financial motivation. Blue Cross insurers are independent companies that operate under a common set of rules, similar to franchisees in a fast-food chain. When a person covered by Blue Cross in their home state receives treatment in another state, the Blue Cross where the treatment occurs pays the provider and then recoups the cost from the home-state plan. What the attorneys discovered was that Blue Cross Louisiana would receive a share of any savings it could generate for the home-state plan. Say, for instance, Blue Cross Alabama was facing a bill of $5,000 for a procedure. If Blue Cross Louisiana instead paid $1,000, it saved the Alabama plan $4,000. The policy allowed Blue Cross Louisiana to earn 16% of the savings - in this scenario, $640.\n\nFor DellaCroce and Sullivan, the revelations cemented their belief that Blue Cross was a bad corporate actor more interested in power and control than health care. The percentage fee incentivized the insurer to pay the doctors as little as possible. The bigger the savings, the more Blue Cross made. \"It's win-win,\" DellaCroce said. \"That's their pay day.\"\n\nAs the trial approached, Blue Cross attempted to settle the case. DellaCroce and Sullivan refused the offer as too low.\n\nOn the afternoon of Sept. 5, 2024, the case - St. Charles Surgical Hospital, L.L.C. and Center for Restorative Breast Surgery, L.L.C. v. Louisiana Health Service & Indemnity Company D/B/A Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Louisiana, Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Louisiana, Inc. and HMO Louisiana, Inc. - opened in Division C of the Orleans Parish Civil District Court, a high-ceilinged room with dark brown benches and tables, fake marble columns and fluorescent lights. James Williams, the chief litigator for the hospital, had already impressed the 45 potential jurors by memorizing all their names and backgrounds during jury selection. Now, he stood up and placed a football on the plaintiff's table in front of the 12 chosen to try the case, which included a third grade teacher, a movie stunt double and a hotel manager. He warned them that they would hear a lot of \"insurance talk\" from Blue Cross. \"I'm going to ask you, ladies and gentlemen on the jury, keep your eye on the ball. Keep your eye on what this case is about,\" Williams told them. \"If they start saying things like, 'Well, oh, we paid them what we thought was fair, 9%,' keep your eye on the ball, right?\"\n\nOver 10 days - interrupted by a two-day break to allow a hurricane to pass across Louisiana - Williams made his case that Blue Cross had defrauded his clients by making promises to pay but failing to deliver.\n\nMuch of Blue Cross' defense had relied on the notice that a prior authorization was no guarantee of payment. The insurer had not committed fraud, it said, since it never explicitly promised the center to reimburse anything. Udvarhelyi, the former CEO, had insisted on that. But on the stand, Blue Cross witnesses provided a more nuanced explanation. They acknowledged that the disclaimer was not meant as a general excuse to free the company from paying bills. A prior authorization \"usually\" resulted in a payment, testified Brower, who reviewed the center's bills. He said that the notice was intended for specific situations. For instance, Blue Cross would not cover a woman who dropped out of her insurance before the operation. Nor would it pay anything if a patient had not met her deductible. But otherwise, Brower said, Blue Cross intended to compensate for a procedure that it had authorized. \"It's inappropriate for us as a company to approve a code and then turn around and deny it,\" Brower said .\n\nOver the years, the center had appealed thousands of reimbursements for being too low. It hired additional employees to manage the paperwork. At the trial, Blue Cross revealed that it had never considered any of the appeals - nor had it ever told the center that they were pointless. \"An appeal is not available to review an underpayment,\" acknowledged Paula Shepherd, a Blue Cross executive vice president. The insurer simply issued an edict - the payment was correct.\n\nThis was the core of the case. The insurer set the rules. The insurer set the prices. Doctors could appeal to a state insurance regulator. But if that failed, and it often did, the only recourse was a long, costly lawsuit.\n\nWilliams summed up for the jury the center's treatment at the hands of Blue Cross: \"Our payments are slow pay, low pay or no pay.\"\n\nIn countering those arguments, Blue Cross witnesses explained that the insurer was committed to paying for Louisianans' health care and keeping costs low. As a nonprofit, it directed any excess revenue from operations back into the business. (Udvarhelyi, the CEO, did acknowledge that his salary, over $1 million, included bonuses that depended on hitting revenue targets and increasing membership.)\n\nBrian West, a Blue Cross executive who monitored payments, said the center had engaged in \"egregious\" billing practices. \"They are bad actors in the billing world,\" he said. But company witnesses offered only a handful of examples. Sometimes the center mistakenly coded its bills in a way that appeared to charge for four separate breast reconstructions in a single operation. In other cases, the center asked for payment for two surgeons in the room at the same time. But Blue Cross, following Medicare guidelines, would pay two surgeons only 20% more than the reimbursement for a single surgeon.\n\nBlue Cross did not accuse the center of any intentional miscoding - but the sloppy billing led to additional scrutiny, the company's witnesses said. The targeted list, a witness testified, had been created especially for the center, requiring all prior authorization requests to bypass normal routes for a special review by company doctors. The blocked list meant that each bill from the center received a manual scrub by payment specialists before reimbursement. Blue Cross acknowledged the careful checking often resulted in the need for more information from the center, which could result in slower processing of claims. But the lists, executives insisted, were not designed to reduce payments. \"Basically, no harm was done,\" said Becky Juncker, who was involved in approving surgical procedures.\n\nCompany witnesses explained that the 16% received in saving money for out-of-state Blue Cross insurers was a fee to cover the costs of handling adjustments of the claim - though they were not able to explain why Blue Cross did not charge a flat fee for its services.\n\nBlue Cross also defended itself against the accusation that it had paid nothing for 60% of the charges for individual procedures. Witnesses said the insurer had followed industry practice in bundling charges to make a single payment for an operation. An attorney for the center noted that it had never agreed to take bundled payments - Blue Cross had imposed them.\n\nAs to the calls to women like Arch? That was an effort to save members money. \"Our medical area would reach out to our members who were utilizing out-of-network providers to help them understand the, I would say, the financial implications,\" said Shepherd, the Blue Cross executive vice president, in a deposition . \"It could be financially catastrophic to a member to have an out-of-network claim that they are financially responsible for. It's a huge difference.\"\n\nIn summing up the case, Kim Boyle, the lead attorney for the company, told jurors that Blue Cross had not committed fraud. It had acted to ensure the company and its members paid a fair price for the center's services, she said. \"There's no scheme. There's no plot. There's no mafia. There are no Blue Cross employees of Louisiana that are sitting in some smoke-filled room in Baton Rouge, plotting against these plaintiffs on St. Charles Avenue in New Orleans,\" Boyle said. \"It's fiction; it's fancy; it's completely made up.\"\n\nOn Sept. 20, at 1:57 p.m., Judge Sidney H. Cates IV sent the jurors to deliberate. The center attorneys retreated to a nearby hotel to await the verdict. About two hours later, they were summoned back to Division C. Williams put his head down and swore. He worried that such a quick return in the legally complex case meant victory for Blue Cross.\n\nThe center's lawyers paid close attention to Cates as he reviewed the jurors' decision. It was a two-page form. If the jurors found in favor of Blue Cross, the judge would have no reason to read on. Cates flipped to the second page: The jurors had found Blue Cross liable for fraud. \"Please express in dollars the total monetary compensation, if any, Blue Cross owes the hospital and the center for the damages,\" Cates said, reading from the verdict . \"Net damages, $421,488,633.\" The center's lawyers stood and shook hands as the insurer's attorneys prepared to leave the courtroom.\n\nDellaCroce was in surgery at the hospital, having expected a longer deliberation. Sullivan was in the courtroom to hear the verdict. Afterward, jurors approached and thanked him for his work. He teared up. \"We would have given more if we had been asked for more. That's how egregious the fraud was,\" Juliet Laughlin, a 58-year-old property manager who served as forewoman, later said. \"There had been wrong done.\"\n\nBlue Cross has appealed the verdict. A health insurance trade group has warned that the finding sets a dangerous precedent. If allowed to stand, insurance companies in Louisiana may find themselves forced to pay whatever price is demanded by out-of-network doctors - which in turn could raise health insurance premiums across the state, the Louisiana Association of Health Plans said in a statement.\n\nFor DellaCroce and Sullivan, the verdict was vindication. They had refused to sign contracts they thought unfair. They had rejected settlement offers they thought too low. The trial had revealed Blue Cross' domineering behavior. \"Fundamentally, I think their problem was that we were doctors who had control,\" DellaCroce said. \"That was regarded as a threat.\"\n\nIn the months since the judgment, Blue Cross has not changed its practices, the doctors said. It has not approached with an offer that would bring the hospital in network. It still issues prior authorizations for women's surgeries. And it still pays only a fraction of the billed fees.\n\nFreelance photographer Daniella Zalcman contributed reporting.\n\nDonald Trump makes no secret of his loathing for regulations that limit water and energy use by home appliances. For years, he has regaled supporters at his campaign rallies with fanciful stories about their impact. He is so exercised by the issue that, even as global stock markets convulsed Wednesday in response to his tariff plans, Trump took time out to issue an executive order titled \"Maintaining Acceptable Water Pressure in Showerheads.\"\n\nContemporary shower fixtures are only one of the items that rankle the president, who complains that \"there's no water coming and you end up standing there five times longer,\" making it difficult to coif his \"perfect\" hair. He has frequently denounced dishwashers that he claims take so long and clean so poorly that \"the electric bill is ten times more than the water\"; toilets that require flushing \"ten or 15 times\"; and LED lightbulbs, which he faults for making him look orange.\n\nIn his first term, Trump pursued an array of gimmicks to try to undermine the rules. His moves were opposed by industry and environmental groups alike. If it's possible for regulations to be popular, these ones are. They have cut America's water and energy consumption, reduced global-warming emissions and saved consumers money. Legal prohibitions stymied most of Trump's maneuvers back then, and the Biden administration quickly reversed the steps Trump managed to take.\n\nTrump's executive order on showerheads generated headlines , but it's likely to have little effect (more on that later). Far more consequential steps have been taken outside the Oval Office.\n\nWith the aid of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency team, Trump appears to be attempting an end run that could succeed where his past attempts failed: by simply terminating the consulting contract that the Department of Energy relies on to develop and enforce the rules. In late March, DOGE's \"wall of receipts\" stated that it had \"deleted\" a Department of Energy contract for Guidehouse LLP (a PricewaterhouseCoopers spinoff) for \"Appliance Standards Analysis and Regulatory Support Service,\" producing a listed savings of $247,603,000. That item has now disappeared from the DOGE website, and its current status remains unclear.\n\nThis has produced confusion for everyone from appliance manufacturers to government officials to the contractors paid to enforce the rules. If the contract is indeed canceled, experts told ProPublica, it would cripple the government's efficiency standards program, which relies on the consulting firm's technical expertise and testing labs to update standards, ensure compliance and punish violators.\n\n\"It would have a huge impact,\" said George Washington University law professor Emily Hammond, who helped run the program as deputy general counsel at the Department of Energy and now serves on its appliance standards advisory committee. \"DOE does not have the internal capacity to do that work. Taking that away pulls the rug out from under the agency's ability to run that regulatory program.\"\n\nAppliance manufacturers seem almost as concerned. \"This is not a positive development,\" said Josh Greene, vice president for government affairs at A.O. Smith, the largest manufacturer of water heaters in the U.S. Terminating the Guidehouse contract, he said, would create \"a wild Wild West\" where \"upstart manufacturers\" are free to import poor-quality products because \"they know there's no one to enforce the rules. That's not good for American manufacturing and it's not good for consumers.\"\n\nThe Department of Energy has made no public attempts to clarify the matter. An agency spokesperson did not respond to ProPublica's requests for comment. Emails to DOGE and the White House brought no reply. And Guidehouse officials, reportedly eager to lay low, also offered no response to multiple requests for comment.\n\nThe government's efficiency requirements originated with the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, signed into law in 1975, when the concern was an energy shortage, not global warming. Today, the Department of Energy is required to set rules for energy and water use by more than 70 appliances and commercial products sold in the U.S. The agency must consider imposing stricter standards for each product every eight years, based on what is \"technologically feasible and economically justified.\" Manufacturers then have three to five years to make their products measure up.\n\nThe Energy Department typically stiffens a requirement only after years of study, comment, negotiation and testing (and sometimes litigation) among industry, consumer and environmental groups. The law also includes an \"anti-backsliding\" provision that bars relaxation of standards that have been finalized. Guidehouse and its subcontractors have for years performed virtually all the necessary technical work; they also maintain a certification database that U.S. authorities use to keep illegal products from being imported.\n\nRepublican lawmakers, anti-regulation advocates and right-wing media have long decried the efficiency rules as an impingement on personal freedom, limiting product choice. The early rollout of water-throttling products produced some of the issues Trump complains about, lampooned in a 1996 \"Seinfeld\" episode titled \"The Shower Head.\"\n\nBut in the decades since, the standards have been widely embraced, dramatically cutting energy and water consumption, reducing emissions and providing plenty of attractive consumer choices. In 2023, Consumer Reports found that \"even the simplest and least expensive showerheads can provide a satisfying shower.\" Dishwashers and clothes washers clean better while using less than half as much water and energy as they once did. The transition to LED light bulbs, nearly complete, is estimated to have cut energy bills by $3 billion a year and eliminated the need for about 30 large power plants .\n\nIn January, days before Trump returned to office, a Department of Energy report estimated that the efficiency standards are now saving the average American household about $576 a year on their utility bills, while cutting the nation's energy consumption by 6.5% and water consumption by 12%. A 2022 survey by the Consumer Federation of America found that 76% of Americans support the government setting efficiency standards for appliances.\n\nNone of that has slowed Trump's attacks. During his first term, the Department of Energy ignored legal deadlines for considering efficiency updates on 28 products, blocked the long-planned rollout of new lightbulb rules and sought to bypass finalized appliance standards through byzantine legal maneuvers. Among other things, the Energy Department announced special new \"product classes\" for dishwashers, clothes washers and dryers that completed their \"normal\" cycle in an hour or less. This would exempt any such \"short-cycle\" devices that were introduced from the existing limits on water and energy use.\n\nManufacturers never brought those models to market. Most existing appliances already had a \"short cycle\" option that did their job well; those short on time simply had to push that button. And by mid-2022, Biden's Energy Department had reversed Trump's regulatory moves. The department went on to issue an array of tightened home appliance rules jointly recommended by industry and consumer groups; most were finalized early enough to be immune from congressional rollback.\n\nThis didn't stop Trump from boasting on the 2024 campaign trail that he had changed everything during his first term. He vowed to fix it all again when he returned to the White House. \"Eliminate energy efficiency standards for appliances\" was on Project 2025's list of \"needed reforms.\"\n\nSure enough, on his first day back in the White House, Trump issued two executive orders targeting the efficiency rules. On Feb. 11, he posted on Truth Social: \"I am hereby instructing Secretary Lee Zeldin to immediately go back to my Environmental Orders, which were terminated by Crooked Joe Biden, on Water Standard and Flow pertaining to SINKS, SHOWERS, TOLIETS, WASHING MACHINES, DISHWASHERS, etc., and to likewise go back to the common sense standards on LIGHTBULBS, that were put in place by the Trump Administration, but terminated by Crooked Joe. I look forward to signing these orders.\" (In fact, the rules Trump cited were issued and enforced by the Department of Energy, not the Environmental Protection Agency, where Administrator Zeldin presides.)\n\nNone of the standards Trump listed were subject to an executive order, or any other kind of rapid rollback. In simple terms, Trump did not have the legal authority to change these rules.\n\nNo matter. Energy Secretary Chris Wright - who had listed \"affordability and consumer choice in home appliances\" among his top nine priorities - took up the cause. Three days after Trump's Truth Social post, Wright announced that the Department of Energy was postponing \"seven of the Biden-Harris administration's restrictive mandates on home appliances,\" which \"have driven up costs, reduced choice and diminished the quality of Americans' home appliances.\" Wright's list of seven affected \"home appliances\" actually included three types of commercial equipment and three other regulations long past the point where they could be undone.\n\nThat left only one household-product regulation that could be challenged. It involved an item that seemed like an improbable symbol of \"freedom\" and \"consumer choice\": the tankless, gas-fueled hot water heater.\n\nThe vast majority of U.S. homes have traditional water heaters with 40- to 50-gallon tanks. By contrast, tankless gas products represent 10% of sales. They are about the size of a carry-on suitcase and heat a stream of water on demand. They're energy-efficient and roughly twice as expensive as standard heaters.\n\nBut the rules governing tankless gas water heaters were vulnerable because they were issued in the final weeks of Biden's term. That meant lawmakers could reverse them under the Congressional Review Act, which allows lawmakers to block a recently enacted agency rule, if a resolution to do so passes both houses and is signed by the president.\n\nAppearing at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 20, Wright drew cheers as he offered a Trumpian litany - \"My dishwasher has to run for two hours now, and at the end I got to clean the dishes\" - before turning to hot water heaters. \"We have a factory in the southeastern part of the United States that employs hundreds of people to build a particularly popular product these days,\" Wright said. \"It is a tankless water heater powered by natural gas,\" which he described as \"selling like hotcakes.\" So, what did the Biden administration do, he asked. \"They passed a regulation that would make that product illegal, and that company would be dead.\" But under Trump, declared Wright, waving his arms, \"we are fixing that problem. That factory is staying open. ... America is back, baby!\"\n\nWright returned to \"the hot-water thing\" in a FoxBusiness interview a month later. Assailing \"nanny-state, crazy, top-down mandates that makes it more expensive for American consumers and businesses to buy what they want,\" he said the new rule was going to shut down a factory \"just built in the southeast United States.\" Wright acknowledged that U.S. law bars elimination of other efficiency updates that he and Trump have targeted because they've already been finalized. \"We can't officially get rid of them,\" he commented. \"So we just pushed back the enforcement date, hopefully, to never.\"\n\nWright's portrayal omitted significant details. The administration's actions involve a single beneficiary: Rinnai, a Japanese appliance company with $3.3 billion in revenues last year. In 2022, Rinnai opened a $70 million factory south of Atlanta, where about 250 U.S. workers build \"non-condensing\" tankless gas water heaters, a major moneymaker for the company.\n\n\"Non-condensing\" tankless heaters are less efficient and less expensive than \"condensing\" tankless heaters, which reuse heat from their exhaust gases. As a result, Rinnai wouldn't be able to continue selling them when the new standards went into effect in December 2029.\n\nThat, however, wasn't going to put the company out of business; it wasn't likely to shut down its U.S. factory, either, though Rinnai raised that specter in government filings where its U.S. president warned the new standards would make the Georgia plant \" largely obsolete ... eliminating\" all its jobs.\n\nRinnai sells a broad array of products across the world. It also already sold condensing tankless heaters in the U.S. that met the new standard and were imported from Japan. And Rinnai had plans to make them in Georgia, according to the company's most recent annual report . (Rinnai agreed to make its U.S. chief, Frank Windsor, available for an interview with ProPublica, then canceled twice at the last minute. The company ultimately declined to respond to questions about its public representations.)\n\nNonetheless, the company, now backed by the Trump administration, has pursued a multitrack campaign to roll back the new standards. Its efforts appear to be on the point of success. A resolution has passed the House and won Senate approval on Thursday. Rinnai has spent $375,000 on Washington lobbyists since 2023, according to disclosure reports. The company also joined with Republican attorneys general in a court challenge to the energy rule.\n\nThree major Rinnai competitors supported the Biden-era regulations. Wisconsin-based A.O. Smith has actively lobbied against Rinnai's effort to win a congressional rollback. Greene said blocking the standard will \"disadvantage\" U.S. companies, which have already invested in more efficient condensing technology, by allowing continued sale of Rinnai's less expensive competing products. \"In this time of 'America First,' it just seems to us a shame that where we're heading is rewarding foreign manufacturers,\" Greene said. \"There should be a level playing field.\"\n\nMeanwhile the administration's campaign has expanded to multiple fronts. On Wednesday, the Department of Energy announced a review of its procedures for energy standards, which one expert described as a reprise of the first Trump administration's attempts to create procedural hurdles to updating efficiency standards.\n\nThen there was the executive order on showerheads that same day. It, too, seeks to revive a move by the first Trump administration: to circumvent the limits on waterflow by redefining \"showerheads\" to include multiple nozzles, each of which could emit as much water as the entire showerhead was previously allowed. The Biden-era Energy Department killed that regulation, and Trump is attempting to bring it back while proclaiming that \"notice and comment is unnecessary because I am ordering the repeal.\"\n\nThat order will have virtually no effect because manufacturers have little interest in making showerheads that exceed the current limits, according to Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, a nonprofit coalition of groups that support the efficiency rules. \"The president is asserting king-like authority,\" he added, about Trump's claim that he does not have to follow administrative procedures.\n\nIn the end, DOGE could have more of an impact than a would-be monarch, if it's able to kill the Guidehouse contract. Then, deLaski said, \"it would be next to impossible for DOE to enforce its efficiency standards.\"\n\nDoris Burke , Mark Olalde and Pratheek Rebala contributed research.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's executive orders shrinking the federal workforce make a notable exception for public safety staff, including those who fight wildland fires. But ongoing cuts, funding freezes and hiring pauses have weakened the nation's already strained firefighting force by hitting support staff who play crucial roles in preventing and battling blazes.\n\nMost notably, about 700 Forest Service employees terminated in mid-February's \"Valentine's Day massacre\" are red-card-carrying staffers , an agency spokesperson confirmed to ProPublica. These workers hold other full-time jobs in the agency, but they've been trained to aid firefighting crews, such as by providing logistical support during blazes. They also assist with prescribed burns, which reduce flammable vegetation and prevent bigger fires, but the burns can only move forward if there's a certain number of staff available to contain them. (Non-firefighting employees without a red card cannot perform such tasks.)\n\nRed-card-carrying employees are the \"backbone\" of the firefighting force, and their loss will have \"a significant impact,\" said Frank Beum, a board member of the National Association of Forest Service Retirees who spent more than four decades with the agency and ran the Rocky Mountain Region. \"There are not enough primary firefighters to do the full job that needs to be done when we have a high fire season.\"\n\nProPublica spoke to employees across the Forest Service - which manages an area of land nearly twice the size of California - including staff working in firefighting, facilities, timber sales and other roles, to learn how sweeping personnel changes are affecting the agency's ability to function. The employees said cuts, which have hit the agency's recreation, wildlife, IT and other divisions, show the Trump administration is shifting the agency's focus away from environmental stewardship and toward industry and firefighting.\n\nBut notwithstanding Trump's stated guardrails, the cuts have affected the Forest Service's more than 10,000-person-strong firefighting force. Hiring has slowed as there are fewer employees to get new workers up to speed and people are confused about which job titles can be hired. Other cuts have led to the cancellation of some training programs and prescribed burns .\n\n\"It's all really muddled in chaos, which is sort of the point,\" one Forest Service employee told ProPublica.\n\n\"This agency is no longer serving its mission,\" another added.\n\nThe employees asked not to be named for fear of retribution.\n\nThe Forest Service did not respond to questions about the impact of cuts other than to clarify the number of terminated employees. The Forest Service spokesperson said about 2,000 probationary employees - typically new staff and those who were recently promoted, groups that have fewer workplace protections - were fired in February. Others with knowledge of the terminations, including a representative of a federal union and a Senate staffer, said the original number of terminated employees was 3,400 but that decreased, likely as workers were brought back in divisions such as timber sales.\n\nThe White House and a representative from the Department of Government Efficiency did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn early March, an independent federal board that reviews employees' complaints compelled the Department of Agriculture, the Forest Service's parent department, to reinstate more than 5,700 terminated probationary employees for 45 days. During their first weeks back on the payroll, many, including Forest Service personnel, were put on paid administrative leave and given no work.\n\nThe administration and DOGE continue working toward layoffs amid court challenges to their moves. Word circulated throughout the Forest Service in March that departmental leadership had compiled lists containing the names of thousands of additional Forest Service employees who could be soon laid off , according to some workers.\n\nAdditionally, understaffing in the agency's information technology unit is threatening firefighting operations, according to an agency employee. In December, the branch chief overseeing IT for the agency's fire and aviation division left the job. The Department of Agriculture posted the job opening, describing the division as providing \"support to the interagency wildland fire community's technical needs.\" This includes overseeing software that firefighting crews use to request equipment - everything from fire-resistant clothing to hoses - from the agency's warehouses so first responders have uninterrupted access to lifesaving equipment.\n\nThe day after Trump's inauguration, the Department of Agriculture removed the IT job posting. The position remains unfilled, according to an employee with knowledge of the situation.\n\nThe hiring of new firefighters has also bogged down amid the deluge of sometimes-conflicting orders from the administration and DOGE, Forest Service staffers said.\n\n\"We are really, really behind onboarding our employees right now,\" a Forest Service firefighter told ProPublica.\n\nThe staffing issues exacerbate challenges that predate the second Trump administration . To address a massive budget shortfall, the Forest Service under President Joe Biden last year paused the hiring of seasonal workers, except those working on wildfires. (Firefighters did see a permanent pay increase codified by Congress in its recently approved spending bill .)\n\nStill, many permanent employees, including many firefighters, work on a seasonal basis and are placed on an unpaid status for several months each year when there is less work. Uncertainty within the federal government has led many of these employees to give up on government work and look elsewhere.\n\n\"Some of our people have taken other jobs,\" one Forest Service employee told ProPublica. \"People aren't going to wait around.\"\n\nCuts to the agency's legal department will also curb its ability to care for the nation's forests and fight wildfires, an employee told ProPublica. Large prescribed burns and other vegetation-removal projects require environmental review, a process that is often targeted with lawsuits, including by green groups concerned that the efforts go too far in removing trees.\n\nA smaller legal staff could lead to fewer prescribed burns, increasing the risk of catastrophic fires, according to a lawyer for the Department of Agriculture who worked on Forest Service projects. The lawyer was fired in the mid-February purge of probationary employees.\n\n\"Every time we lose a case out West, it means the Forest Service can't do a project, at least temporarily,\" the lawyer said.\n\n\"They're going to get sued more, and they're going to lose more,\" said the lawyer, who was reinstated in March following the board ruling that the Department of Agriculture's mass firings were illegal .\n\nThe employee received back pay but was immediately put on administrative leave. Because of the cuts to support staff, it was several weeks before many of the returning employees were reissued government laptops and badges and allowed to do any work.\n\n\"Government efficiency at its finest,\" the lawyer said.\n\nThe first time I saw Andrew Rabinowitz, it was in April 2017 at Baltimore District Court, where he was representing a property management company owned by the family of Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law. That day, the company had three cases against tenants at Dutch Village, one of the many large apartment complexes the Kushner Companies owned in the Baltimore area.\n\nOne tenant was a Morgan State University student facing struggles typical of residents in the Kushner complexes. She had given notice that she was moving at the end of March, having tired of the perpetually clogged toilet and the ceiling leak in her closet. But when she paid March rent via the automated system tenants had to use, the money somehow ended up with an adjacent Kushner complex, and the company started eviction proceedings - even though she had already signaled her intent to leave a few weeks later.\n\nA sheriff's deputy changed the locks on her door when she was out of town, preventing her from moving her things out. She got her keys back, but by then she no longer had access to a moving truck. The company was also after her for April's rent, despite the fact that it had physically barred her from being able to move before April.\n\nIn court, Rabinowitz, a 33-year-old in a jacket and tie, spoke to the judge in a polished, even-keeled tone, in contrast to the student, who grew more agitated as the hearing went on. The judge sided with Rabinowitz, ordering the student to pay $471.23 for part of April's rent.\n\nWhen I approached Rabinowitz as he was leaving the courthouse, to ask about the company's aggressive approach, he looked startled. \"What's the article regarding?\" he said. \"I'm not inclined to give a statement.\"\n\nThe next day, he was back in court to defend the company against the student's criminal complaint over the unfounded eviction. This time, he offered a deal: He agreed to let her stay, rent-free, until the end of May to give her time to move out, as long as she paid for April. Afterward, she asked Rabinowitz if he could make sure that the hot water would be turned back on. \"I'm just the attorney,\" he demurred. (The hot water stayed off.)\n\nThe next time I saw Rabinowitz in court was in February, almost eight years later. Kushner's father-in-law was back in the White House. But Rabinowitz's situation had changed. He was no longer demanding payment from beleaguered tenants. Instead, he was defending them.\n\nI had learned of his dramatic career shift when I ran into him once in downtown Baltimore. But I needed to see it to believe it. So I tracked him down one midday at the Landlord and Tenant Branch of the District of Columbia Courts, where he now spends his days. As I spotted him, he was in a hallway speaking to a fretful older man who was seeking assistance. \"Give me four minutes. Let me just go check and see if I can serve you,\" Rabinowitz said, before ducking into the office of his new employer, Rising for Justice, a nonprofit that provides free legal representation to low-income tenants facing eviction.\n\nA moment later, after attending to the man, Rabinowitz came over to say hello. He still wore a tie, but now had long hair to go along with it. He was looking far less anxious than he had when I approached him back at the Baltimore courthouse. In fact, he was positively glowing.\n\nSo much has changed in this country and the world since 2017 - much of it, arguably, not for the better. I wanted to know: What had happened with Rabinowitz?\n\nAmerican culture is rife with glamorous depictions of high-stakes, high-paying Big Law firms, from \"L.A. Law\" to \"Michael Clayton\" to \"Suits.\" But there is a humbler realm more typically glimpsed via highway billboards and subway ads. This is the level at which millions of people encounter the justice system, for better or worse.\n\nAnd this is the corner through which Rabinowitz entered the profession. He grew up in Ellicott City, Maryland, outside Baltimore. His mother was dean of admissions at the University of Maryland School of Nursing; his father was chief of social work at the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Washington. He attended Frostburg State University, in western Maryland. Interested in the law, he spent a couple years as a paralegal before heading to law school at Barry University in Orlando, Florida.\n\nHis aspiration was to become a criminal defense attorney, but the job he found after getting his degree was with Barry Glazer, a colorful Baltimore personal injury lawyer known for attention-getting ads. One script went like this: \"I am sick and tired of these insurance companies telling you what good neighbors they are and how you're in such good hands. If your car is totaled and you owe more than it's worth, they give you the lesser amount and you continue to pay a finance company the difference. Don't pee on my leg and tell me it's raining.\" Under pressure from the Bar Association, Glazer changed \"pee\" to \" urinate .\"\n\nIt was an eye-opening experience, the first time Rabinowitz had come into regular contact with people on the lower rungs of the social ladder - people with big problems but unable to afford big firms. He left after a couple years for a small defense practice because he wanted to pursue his original aspiration. This proved disappointing. Criminal law, he found, turned out to be less a stirring quest for justice and more an exercise in squeezing fees out of poor clients in desperate circumstances.\n\nRabinowitz started looking around again, in 2015, and joined Jeffrey Tapper, whose small firm in the Baltimore suburb of Owings Mills specialized in representing landlords large and small as they pursued tenants.\n\nAt first, Rabinowitz liked the work. Despite his natural introversion, he had come to enjoy being in court, in front of a judge. And in this new job, he was in court a lot - as many as 10 hearings per day.\n\nHe prided himself on being able to negotiate settlements, getting landlords to accept less than what they believed they were owed and working out payment plans with tenants. This was what he recalled of the case where I had first met him - that he had been able to work out a deal with the college student to give her an extra month to move out of the Kushner unit.\n\nHe even gave some tenants his phone number, urging them to call if they ended up falling behind again, so they could work something out before it landed them back in court. He wasn't really sure what to think when, one day, he heard a judge say to a tenant, \"Step into the hallway with Mr. Rabinowitz. He's the fairest debt collector in town.\"\n\nTo many people, \"fairest debt collector\" sounds about as noble as \"kindest executioner.\" But the label was apt. A couple of times, he appeared opposite Joe Mack, a tenant's rights attorney whom he had gone to camp with as a kid. Mack recalled Rabinowitz persuading a judge that Mack's client had failed to provide enough notice before breaking a lease and thus owed the landlord a sizable sum. Making the loss easier to take, Mack said, was that Rabinowitz had been respectful in the courtroom. \"I can imagine,\" Mack added, \"that some other things he was doing might have been rougher.\"\n\nMy eventual 2017 article laid bare the harsher reality of many of the cases involving the Kushner complexes. The company pursued one woman for several years for about $3,000, eventually having her wages garnished, even though she had received written permission to break her lease. A second woman ended up in court after moving out from a unit with maggots coming out of the living-room carpet and raw sewage flowing out of the kitchen sink. Yet another was pursued for about $4,000 even though she had written permission to move out of a unit with black mold.\n\nAfter the article appeared, the Maryland attorney general filed suit against the Kushner company, which in 2022 settled with the state for $3.25 million , though the company did not acknowledge wrongdoing. In March, a group of former tenants won class-action status in their own lawsuit against the company . The company, which denied wrongdoing in the class-action case, did not respond to a request for an interview for this article. Over the years, the company has sold most of the properties ProPublica originally reported on.\n\nBack in 2017, a company executive had responded to questions by saying that it had a \"fiduciary obligation\" to its investment partners to collect as much revenue as possible from tenants, and that its practices in doing so were \"consistent with industry standards.\"\n\nRabinowitz offers a similar defense. The Kushner approach was not noticeably different from other big landlords, he said: \"They were all the same.\" He had no particular feelings for the company itself, and he had never actually met Kushner or any other executives. \"They're so disconnected from the property,\" Rabinowitz told me. \"It's just money for them.\" But he was protective of his boss, Tapper, who he felt had treated him fairly. (Tapper died last year.)\n\nRabinowitz himself had not set foot inside the Kushner complexes. The sorts of poor upkeep described in the article did not figure much in the cases, he said. \"I know most people wouldn't want to live in housing like that,\" he said, \"but I remember driving past those communities and I don't remember being like, 'Those were horrible places.'\"\n\nHe insists he did not regret his years working for the Kushners and other landlords. There was a system in place, and he had played a part in that system. \"I honestly felt that if every attorney could have had the same philosophy and treated people fair and put people in the position to take control of their life,\" he said, \"then debt collectors wouldn't be such bad people. They'd be assistants to people paying off their debts.\"\n\nStill, the article instilled an unease that only grew with time. He was almost always facing off against people who lacked their own attorney, in a state with laws that were unusually favorable to landlords. \"It was like a heavyweight sparring featherweights over and over again,\" he said. \"That's just not satisfying.\"\n\nHis longtime partner started to notice that he was agitated on nights before trials; sometimes he'd even mutter things like \"objection!\" in his sleep. \"She could tell my mind was in court, constantly,\" he said. To try and escape the burden, he went whitewater kayaking on weekends.\n\nAround this time, his parents were nearing retirement. Accolades poured in from people they had served over the years, at the nursing schools and the retirement home. One man was wheeled in on his hospital bed to thank Rabinowitz's father. \"When I saw all the people who came out, I realized they had so much impact on so many people's lives,\" Rabinowitz said. He paused. \"And I'm just putting money into rich people's pockets.\"\n\nThen came the coronavirus pandemic. Maryland suspended evictions in March 2020, and, when the moratorium ended in 2021, it passed a law establishing (and funding) the right to an attorney for any tenant facing eviction.\n\nRabinowitz saw his chance. He applied for an entry-level opening in the Baltimore County office of Maryland Legal Aid. The organization recognized his experience and urged him to apply to be the supervisor of a staff of 20 in its newly expanded Baltimore City housing office. The job came with a \"fairly significant\" drop in pay, but he took it.\n\nIt wasn't easy telling Tapper, who had recently offered to make him a partner in the firm before he retired. But Tapper understood. \"I went to the enemy, on the one hand,\" Rabinowitz said. \"On the other hand, he was proud.\"\n\nThe transition was awkward at first. Rabinowitz and his new colleagues at Legal Aid were occasionally facing off against a former colleague. And he could tell that some of his new colleagues were initially wary. After all, while many lawyers move from public-service roles to private practice, precious few head in the other direction. \"People wanted to know if I was for real,\" he said.\n\nA few years later, Rabinowitz made his way to Rising for Justice, as director of the organization's Tenant Justice Program. He now oversees four staff attorneys and a paralegal while supervising about nine law students from Georgetown University and the University of the District of Columbia.\n\nIt means a near-daily rail commute from Baltimore. But he likes working in the Washington court, which has such a nonconfrontational vibe that it makes do without bailiffs. The organization's clients are grateful for the assistance, and he likes that it includes a social-service branch to help people find nonlegal help.\n\nThe law students assigned to him were surprised when they learned that their supervisor had once been on the other side. But they said it came in handy, too. \"We get very emotional. It's easy to get frustrated for your clients and wrapped up and involved,\" said Savannah Myers, a Georgetown student, \"and Drew has the unique perspective to say, 'OK, well, this is what's happening on your end, here's probably what's happening on the other end and here's how you can proceed in the best way to help your client within the legal system.'\"\n\nOne recent day, I watched in court as an older Ethiopian woman faced off against a landlord who was demanding back rent that she owed after having lost her job. The woman, who was using a walker, had an interpreter to assist her but no attorney. She tried to argue that the debt should be lowered because of a broken air conditioner and a problem with vermin in the rental.\n\nAfter the judge, Sherry Trafford, ordered her to make monthly payments of $2,989 to the landlord, she also gently suggested that she seek out help from Rising for Justice in advance of the next hearing on her case.\n\n\"Where are they?\" said the woman.\n\n\"It's at the end of this hallway,\" said Trafford.\n\nThe woman made her way slowly down, and it so happened that the person manning the intake desk at that moment was Andrew Rabinowitz. He welcomed her. \"Do you have some court paperwork?\" he asked through the interpreter, and then came back with a law student to assist her.\n\nLater, Rabinowitz told me that it was poor housing conditions like the ones the woman was dealing with that were his ultimate goad these days. \"That's what motivates me,\" he said. \"I want people to have clean housing like mine.\" Why had those conditions not registered so much with him back when he was on the other side? \"I guess that stuff didn't really get to me,\" he said.\n\nI was struck again by Rabinowitz's reluctance to judge his earlier self. But there was no obscuring one effect of his new role. \"I sleep well,\" he said.\n\nReporting Highlights\n\nThese highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.\n\nThe deportation flight was in the air over Mexico when chaos erupted in the back of the plane, the flight attendant recalled. A little girl had collapsed. She had a high fever and was taking ragged, frantic breaths.\n\nThe flight attendant, a young woman who went by the nickname Lala, said she grabbed the plane's emergency oxygen bottle and rushed past rows of migrants chained at the wrists and ankles to reach the girl and her parents.\n\nBy then, Lala was accustomed to the hard realities of working charter flights for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She'd learned to obey instructions not to look the passengers in the eyes, not to greet them or ask about their well-being. But until the girl collapsed, Lala had managed to escape an emergency.\n\nLala worked for Global Crossing Airlines, the dominant player in the loose network of deportation contractors known as ICE Air. GlobalX, as the charter company is also called, is lately in the news. Two weeks ago, it helped the Trump administration fly hundreds of Venezuelans to El Salvador despite a federal court order blocking the deportations, triggering a showdown that experts fear could become a full-blown constitutional crisis.\n\nIn interviews with ProPublica, Lala and six other current and former GlobalX flight attendants provided a window into a part of the deportation process that is rarely seen and little understood. For migrants who have spent months or years trying to reach this country and live here, it is the last act, the final bit of America they may experience.\n\nAll but one of the flight attendants requested anonymity or asked that only a nickname be used, fearing retribution or black marks as they looked for new jobs in an insular industry.\n\nBecause ICE, GlobalX and other charter carriers did not respond to questions after being provided with detailed lists of this story's findings, the flight attendants' individual accounts are hard to verify. But their stories are consistent with one another. They are also generally consistent with what has been said about ICE Air in legal filings , news accounts , academic research and publicly released copies of the ICE Air Operations Handbook .\n\nThat morning over Mexico, Lala said, the girl's oxygen saturation level was 70% - perilously low compared with a healthy person's 95% or higher. Her temperature was 102.3 degrees. The flight had a nurse on contract who worked alongside its security guards. But beyond giving the girl Tylenol, the nurse left the situation in Lala's hands, she recalled.\n\nLala broke the rule about talking to detainees. The parents told Lala their daughter had a history of asthma. The mom, who Lala said had epilepsy, seemed on the verge of her own medical crisis.\n\nLala placed the oxygen mask on the girl's face. The nurse removed her socks to keep her from further overheating. Lala counted down the minutes, praying for the girl to keep breathing.\n\nThe stories shared by ICE Air flight attendants paint a different picture of deportations from the one presented to the public, especially under President Donald Trump. On social media, the White House has depicted a military operation carried out with ruthless efficiency, using Air Force C-17s, ICE agents in tactical vests and soldiers in camo.\n\nThe reality is that 85% of the administration's \"removal\" flights - 254 flights as of March 21, according to the advocacy group Witness at the Border - have been on charter planes. Military flights have now all but ceased . While there are ICE officers and hired security guards on the charters, the crew members on board are civilians, ordinary people swept up in something most didn't knowingly sign up for.\n\nWhen the flight attendants joined GlobalX, it was a startup with big plans. It sold investors and new hires alike on a vision of VIP clients, including musicians and sports teams, and luxury destinations, especially in the Caribbean. \"You can't beat the eXperience,\" read a company tagline.\n\nBut as the airline grew, more and more of its planes were filled with migrants in chains. Some flight attendants were livid about it.\n\nLast year, an anonymous GlobalX employee sent an all-caps, all-staff screed that ricocheted around the startup. \"WHERE IS THE COMPANY GOING?\" the email asked. \"YOU SIGNED A 5 YEAR CONTRACT WITH ICE? ... WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS BECOMING A PRESTIGE CHARTER AIRLINE?\"\n\nOne flight attendant said he kept waiting for the sports teams his new bosses had talked about as he flew deportation routes. \"You know, the NFL charters, the NBA charters, whatever the hockey one is ...\" he said.\n\nA second said his planes' air conditioning kept breaking - an experience consistent with at least two publicly reported onboard incidents - and their lavatories kept breaking, something another flight attendant reported as well. But the planes kept flying. \"They made us flush with water bottles,\" he said.\n\nBut the flight attendants were most concerned about their inability to treat their passengers humanely - and to keep them safe. (In 2021, an ICE spokesperson told the publication Capital & Main that the agency \"follows best practices when it comes to the security, safety and welfare of the individuals returned to their countries of origin.\")\n\nThey worried about what would happen in an emergency. Could they really get over a hundred chained passengers off the plane in time?\n\n\"They never taught us anything regarding the immigration flights,\" one said. \"They didn't tell us these people were going to be shackled, wrists to fucking ankles.\"\n\n\"We have never gotten a clear answer on what we do in an ICE Air evacuation,\" another said. \"They will not give us an answer.\"\n\n\"It's only a matter of time,\" a third said, before a deportation flight ends in disaster.\n\nLala didn't think she had a chance at a flight attendant job. She hadn't, in truth, remembered applying to GlobalX until a recruiter called to say the startup was coming to her city. \"But I guess I did apply through LinkedIn?\" she said. She'd been working an office job - long hours, little flexibility - and was looking for something new.\n\nThe job interviews were held at a resort hotel. The room was packed with dozens of aspirants when Lala showed up. After the first round, only about 20 were asked to stay. She couldn't believe she was one of them. After the second round came a job offer: $26 an hour plus a daily expense allowance. Soon Lala got a uniform: a blue cardigan, a white polo shirt and an eye-catching scarf in cyan and light green.\n\nFor part of her Federal Aviation Administration-mandated four-week training, her class stayed in a motel with a pool at the edge of Miami International Airport. Just across the street, on the fourth floor of a concrete-clad office building ringed by palm trees, was GlobalX's headquarters.\n\n\"In the beginning, we were told that because it's a charter, it's only gonna be elites, celebrities,\" Lala said. \"Everybody was really excited.\"\n\nBut flying was not going to be all glitz. The real reason for having flight attendants is safety. GlobalX was certified by the FAA as a Part 121 scheduled air carrier, the same as United or Delta, and it and its crew members were subject to the same strict standards.\n\n\"We're there to evacuate you,\" one recruit told ProPublica. \"Yes, we make good drinks, but we evacuate you.\"\n\nLala's class practiced water landings in the pool at the nearby Pan Am Flight Academy. They practiced door drills - yelling out commands, shoving open heavy exit doors - in a replica Airbus A320 cabin. They learned CPR and how to put out fires. They took written and physical tests, and if they didn't score at least 90%, they had to retake them.\n\nThey were reminded, over and over, that their job was a vocation, one with a professional code: No matter who the passengers were, flight attendants were in charge of the cabin, responsible for safety in the air.\n\nLala's official \"airman\" certificate arrived from the FAA a few weeks after training was done. She was cleared to fly, ready to see the world.\n\nBut what she would see wasn't what she signed up for. The company was growing beyond glamorous charters. GlobalX was moving into the deportation business.\n\nHer bosses delivered the news casually, she recalled: \"It was like, 'Oh yeah, we got a government contract.'\"\n\nThe new graduates were offered a single posting: Harlingen, Texas. Deportation flights were five days a week, sometimes late into the night. Lala went to Guatemala, Honduras, Colombia and, for refueling, Panama.\n\nA standard flight had more than a dozen private security guards - contractors working for the firm Akima - along with a single ICE officer, two nurses, and a hundred or more detainees. (Akima did not respond to a request for comment.) The guards were in charge of delivering food and water to the detainees and taking them to the lavatories. This left the flight attendants, whose presence was required by the FAA, with little to do.\n\n\"Arm and disarm doors, that was our duty,\" Lala said.\n\nThe flights had their own set of rules, which the crew members said they learned from a company policy manual or from chief flight attendants. Don't talk to the detainees. Don't feed them. Don't make eye contact. Don't walk down the aisles without a guard escorting you. Don't sit in aisle seats, where detainees could get close to you. Don't wear your company-issued scarf because of \"safety concerns that a detainee might grab it and use it against us,\" Lala said.\n\n\"You don't do nothing,\" said a member of another GlobalX class. \"Just sit down in your seats and be quiet.\" If a detainee looked at him, he was supposed to look out the window.\n\nA rare public statement from the company about life aboard ICE Air came in a 2023 earnings call with GlobalX founder and then-CEO Ed Wegel, when he discussed the company's work for federal agencies like ICE. GlobalX employees \"essentially don't do much on the airplane,\" Wegel said. \"Our flight attendants are there in case of an emergency. The passengers are monitored by guards that are placed on board the airplane by one of those agencies.\"\n\nFielding a question about how GlobalX ensures passengers are treated humanely, Wegel continued: \"There have been threats made to our crew members, and they're especially trained to deal with those. But we haven't seen any mistreatment at all.\"\n\nFlight attendants said they had little to do but sit in their jumpseats after delivering the preflight safety briefing in English to the mostly Spanish-speaking passengers. Above 10,000 feet, the two in the rear usually moved to passenger rows near the cockpit, then sat again. Some did crosswords. Others took photos out the window. On a deportation to Guatemala, one saw his first erupting volcano.\n\nLala had been scared before her first deportation flight, worried that violence might break out. But fear soon gave way to discomfort at how detainees were treated. \"Not being able to serve them, not being able to look at them, I didn't think that was right,\" she said.\n\nSome flight attendants, drawn to the profession because they liked taking care of people, couldn't help but break protocol with passengers. \"If they said 'hola' or something,\" one said, \"I'd say 'hola' back. We're not jerks.\"\n\nAnother recalled taking a planeload of children and their escorts on a domestic transfer from the southern border to an airport in New York. He tried to slip snacks to the kids. \"Even the chaperones were like, 'Don't give them any food,'\" he said. \"And I'm like, 'Where is your humanity?'\" (A second flight attendant said that children on a New York flight were fed by their escorts.)\n\nWhile flight attendants were allowed to interact with the guards, the dynamic was uncomfortable. It came down to a question of who was in charge - and which agency, ICE or the FAA, ultimately held sway. (The FAA declined to comment on this story and directed questions to ICE.)\n\nThe guards often asked flight attendants to heat up the food they brought from home. They asked for drinks, for ice. \"They treated us like we were their maids,\" said Akilah Sisk, a former flight attendant from Texas.\n\n\"In their eyes, the detainees are not the passengers,\" another flight attendant said. \"The passengers are the guards. And we're there for the guards.\"\n\nSome guards thumbed their noses at the FAA safety rules that flight attendants were supposed to enforce while airborne, multiple flight attendants recalled. \"One reported me because I asked him to sit down in the last 10 minutes,\" Sisk said. \"But you're still on a freaking plane. You gotta listen to our words.\"\n\nFlight attendants said that if they told guards to fasten seatbelts during takeoff or stow carry-ons under a seat, they risked getting reported to their bosses at GlobalX, who they said wanted to keep ICE happy. The guards would complain to the in-flight supervisor, Sisk said, and eventually it would get back to the flight attendant.\n\n\"We'd get an email from somebody in management: 'Why are you guys causing problems?'\" another flight attendant recalled. \"They were more worried about losing the contract than about anything else.\"\n\nNothing bothered flight attendants more than the fact that most of their passengers were in chains. What would happen if a flight had to be evacuated?\n\nMost of the migrants crowding the back seats of ICE Air's planes have not been, historically , convicted criminals. ICE makes restraints mandatory nonetheless. \"Detainees transported by ICE Air aircraft will be fully restrained by the use of handcuffs, waist chains, and leg irons,\" reads an unredacted version of the 2015 ICE Air Operations Handbook, which was obtained by the Center for Constitutional Rights, a legal advocacy group.\n\nThe handbook allows for other equipment \"in special circumstances, i.e., spit masks, mittens, leg braces, cargo straps, humane restraint blanket, etc.\" Multiple lawsuits on behalf of African asylum-seekers concern the use of one such item, known as the Wrap , a cross between a straight jacket and a sleeping bag. A flight attendant said detainees restrained in the device are strapped upright in their seats or, if less compliant, lengthwise across a row of seats. Getting \"burritoed, I call it,\" the person said.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties investigated the asylum-seekers' complaints and found ICE lacked \"sufficient policies\" on the Wrap, but how the immigration agency addressed the finding is not publicly known. ICE responded to one lawsuit by saying detainees were not abused; it said another should be dismissed, in part because it was filed in the wrong place. The cases are pending.\n\nUse of the Wrap continues. A video from Seattle's Boeing Field taken in February shows officers and guards carrying a wrapped migrant into the cabin of a deportation plane.\n\nNeither the ICE Air handbook, nor FAA regulations, nor flight attendant training in Miami explained how to empty a plane full of people whose movements were, by design, so severely hampered. Shackled detainees didn't even qualify as \"able-bodied\" enough to sit in exit rows.\n\nTo flight attendants, the restraints seemed at odds with the FAA's \"90-second rule,\" a decades-old manufacturing standard that says an aircraft must be built for full evacuation in 90 seconds even with half the exits blocked.\n\nLala and others said no one told them how to evacuate passengers in chains. \"Honestly, I don't know what we would do,\" she said.\n\nThe flight attendants are not alone in voicing concerns.\n\nIn an interview with ProPublica, Bobby Laurie, an airline safety expert and former flight attendant, called the arrangement on ICE Air flights \"disturbing.\"\n\n\"Part of flight attendant training is locating those passengers who can help you in an evacuation,\" Laurie told ProPublica. That would have to be the guards. \"But if they have to help you,\" who is helping the detainees, Laurie wondered.\n\nAccording to formal ICE Air incident reports reviewed by Capital & Main , the deportation network had at least six accidents requiring evacuations between 2014 and 2019. In at least two cases, both on a carrier called World Atlantic, the evacuations were led not by flight attendants but by untrained guards. Both took longer than 90 seconds, though not by much: two-and-a-half minutes for the first, \"less than 2 minutes\" for the next. But in a third case, it took seven minutes for 115 shackled detainees to escape a smoke-filled jet.\n\nIn one of the World Atlantic incidents, part of the landing gear broke, a wing caught fire and the smell of burning rubber seeped in, according to investigative records obtained by the University of Washington Center for Human Rights. In an email to ICE Air officials, an agency employee aboard the plane later wrote that flight attendants made no emergency announcements for passengers. The flight attendants simply got themselves out.\n\nThe ICE officer, guards and nurse were \"confused on what to do and in which direction to exit during distress,\" the officer wrote. He said that other than the flight crew, \"no one has received any training on emergency evacuation situations.\"\n\nThe University of Washington's collection does not include findings or recommendations from ICE based on what happened, and ICE did not say what they were when asked by ProPublica. The National Transportation Safety Board said that after the accident, World Atlantic launched a campaign to reinspect landing gear, gave employees and contractors further training, and revised its procedures for inspections. The airline did not respond to questions from ProPublica.\n\nOther reports obtained by the University of Washington mention fuel spills, loss of cabin air pressure and a \"large altercation\" on ICE Air after 2019 but no more evacuations, at least as of June 2022. More recent incidents that have been mentioned in the press include an engine fire last summer on World Atlantic and a failed GlobalX air conditioning unit that sent 11 detainees to the hospital with \"heat-related injuries.\"\n\nThe rare guidance some flight attendants said they received on carrying out ICE Air evacuations came during briefings from pilots. What they heard, they said, was chilling and went against their training.\n\n\"Just get up and leave,\" one recalled a GlobalX pilot telling him. \"That's it. ... Save your life first.\"\n\nHe understood the instructions to mean that evacuating detainees was not a priority, or even the flight attendants' responsibility. The detainees were in other people's hands, or in no one's.\n\nWhen asked if they got similar guidance from pilots, three flight attendants said they did not, and one did not answer. Two more, like the first, said pilots gave them instructions that they took to mean they shouldn't help detainees after opening the exit doors.\n\n\"That was the normal briefing,\" said a flight attendant from Lala's class. \"'If a fire occurs in the cabin, if we land on water, don't check on the immigrants. Just make sure that you and the guards and the people that work for the government get off.'\"\n\n\"It was as if the detainees' lives were worthless,\" said the other.\n\nThe day the girl collapsed on Lala's flight, the pilot turned the plane around and they crossed back into the United States.\n\nThe flight landed in Arizona. Paramedics rushed on board and connected the girl to their own oxygen bottle. They began shuttling her off the plane. Her parents tried to join. But the guards stopped the father.\n\nShocked, Lala approached the ICE officer in charge. \"This is not OK!\" she yelled. The mom had seizures. The family needed to stay together.\n\nBut the officer said it was impossible. Only one parent could go to the hospital. The other, as Lala understood it, \"was going to get deported.\"\n\nMost of the flight attendants who spoke with ProPublica are now gone from GlobalX. Some left because they found other jobs. Some left even though they hadn't. Some left because the charter company, as it focused more and more on deportations, shut down the hub in their city.\n\nLala eventually left because of the little girl and her family, because she couldn't do the deportation flights anymore. Her GlobalX uniform hung in her closet for a time, a reminder of her career as a flight attendant. Recently, she said, she threw it away.\n\nShe never learned whether the little girl lived or died. Lala just watched her mom follow her off the plane, then watched the dad return to his seat.\n\n\"I cried after that,\" she said. She bought her own ticket home.\n\nTen years ago, when Wisconsin lawmakers approved a bill to allow unlimited spending in state elections, only one Republican voted no.\n\n\"I just thought big money was an evil, a curse on our politics,\" former state Sen. Robert Cowles said recently of his 2015 decision to buck his party.\n\nAs Wisconsin voters head to the polls next week to choose a new state Supreme Court justice, Cowles stands by his assessment. Voters have been hit with a barrage of attack ads from special interest groups, and record-setting sums of money have been spent to sway residents. What's more, Cowles said, there's been little discussion of major issues. The candidates debated only once.\n\n\"I definitely think that that piece of legislation made things worse,\" Cowles said in an interview. \"Our public discourse is basically who can inflame things in the most clever way with some terrible TV ad that's probably not even true.\"\n\nMore than $80 million has been funneled into the race as of March 25, according to two groups that have been tracking spending in the contest - the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan law and policy group that follows judicial races, and the news outlet WisPolitics. That surpasses the previous costliest judicial race in the country's history, approximately $56 million spent two years ago on the Supreme Court race in Wisconsin.\n\nMoney is pouring into this swing state election so fast and so many ads have been reserved that political observers now believe the current race is likely to reach $100 million by Tuesday, which is election day.\n\n\"People are thoroughly disgusted, I think, across the political spectrum with just the sheer amount of money being spent on a spring Supreme Court election in Wisconsin,\" said Jay Heck, executive director of Common Cause Wisconsin, which has long advocated for campaign finance reform.\n\nBut the elected officials who could revamp the campaign finance system on both sides of the aisle or create pressure for change have been largely silent. No bills introduced this session. No press conferences from legislators. The Senate no longer even has a designated elections committee.\n\nThe current election pits former Republican Attorney General Brad Schimel, now a circuit court judge in conservative-leaning Waukesha County, against Susan Crawford, a judge in Dane County, the state's liberal bastion.\n\nThough the race technically is nonpartisan, the Democratic Party, including former President Barack Obama, has endorsed Crawford; the party has received financial support from liberal billionaire George Soros. On the other side, President Donald Trump posted a message on his social media platform on March 21 urging his supporters to vote for Schimel, and much of Schimel's money comes from political organizations tied to Elon Musk.\n\nThe stakes are high. Whoever wins will determine the ideological bent of the seven-member court just two years after Janet Protasiewicz won a seat on the court and swung it to the liberals. With Protasiewicz on the court, the majority struck down state legislative maps, which had been drawn to favor Republicans, and reinstated the use of drop boxes to collect absentee ballots.\n\nA Schimel victory could resurrect those and other voting issues, as well as determine whether women in the state will continue to be able to access abortion.\n\nTwo pro-Schimel groups linked to Musk - America PAC and Building America's Future - had disclosed spending about $17 million, as of March 25. Musk himself donated $3 million this year to the Republican Party of Wisconsin. In the final stretch of the campaign, news reports revealed that Musk's America PAC plans to give Wisconsin voters $100 to sign petitions rejecting the actions of \"activist judges.\"\n\nThat has raised concerns among some election watchdog groups, which have been exploring whether the offer from Musk amounts to an illegal inducement to get people to vote.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Musk went further, announcing on X a $1 million award to a Green Bay voter he identified only as \"Scott A\" for \"supporting our petition against activist judges in Wisconsin!\" Musk promised to hand out other million-dollar prizes before the election.\n\nMusk has a personal interest in the direction of the Wisconsin courts. His electric car company, Tesla Inc., is suing the state over a law requiring manufacturers to sell automobiles through independent dealerships. Musk and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment about his involvement in the race.\n\nAlso on Schimel's side: billionaires Diane Hendricks and Richard Uihlein and Americans for Prosperity, a dark-money group founded by billionaire Charles Koch and his late brother David. Americans for Prosperity has reported spending about $3 million, primarily for digital ads, canvassing, mailers and door hangers.\n\nA Better Wisconsin Together Political Fund, a union-supported electioneering group , has ponied up over $6 million to advance Crawford. In other big outlays, Soros has given $2 million to the state Democratic Party, while Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, another billionaire, gave $1.5 million. And California venture capitalist Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, donated $250,000.\n\nIn Wisconsin, political parties can steer unlimited amounts to candidates.\n\nState Sen. Jeff Smith, a Democrat and a minority leader, called the spending frenzy \"obscene.\"\n\n\"There's no reason why campaigns should cost as much as they do,\" he said.\n\nAsked for comment about the vast amount of money in the race, Crawford told ProPublica: \"I'm grateful for the historic outpouring of grassroots support across Wisconsin from folks who don't want Elon Musk controlling our Supreme Court.\"\n\nSchimel's campaign called Crawford a \"hypocrite,\" saying she \"is playing the victim while receiving more money than any judicial candidate in American history thanks to George Soros, Reid Hoffman, and JB Pritzker funneling money to her campaign.\"\n\nQuizzed Monday by a TV reporter on whether he would recuse himself if the Tesla case got to the state's high court, Schimel did not commit, saying: \"I'll do the same thing I do in every case. I will examine whether I can truly hear that case objectively.\"\n\nA decade after Wisconsin opened the floodgates to unlimited money in campaigns in 2015, some good government activists are wondering if the state has reached a tipping point. Is there any amount, they ask, at which the state's political leaders can be persuaded to impose controls?\n\n\"I honestly believe that folks have their eyes open around the money in a way that they have not previously,\" Nick Ramos, executive director of the nonpartisan Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, which tracks campaign spending, told reporters during a briefing on spending in the race.\n\nA loosely organized group of campaign reformers is beginning to lay the groundwork for change. The Wisconsin Democracy Campaign recently called a Zoom meeting that included representatives of public interest groups inside and outside of Wisconsin, dark-money researchers and an election security expert.\n\nThey were looking for ways to champion reform during the current legislative session. In particular, they are studying and considering what models make sense and may be achievable, including greater disclosure requirements, public financing and restricting candidates from coordinating with dark-money groups on issue ads.\n\nBut Republicans say that the spending is a natural byproduct of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision, which equated campaign spending with free speech and opened the spigots for big-money races.\n\n\"For the most part, we don't really, as Republicans, want to see the brakes on free speech,\" said Ken Brown, past chair of the GOP Party of Racine, a city south of Milwaukee. Noting he was not speaking for the party, Brown said he does not favor spending limits. \"I believe in the First Amendment. It is what it is. I believe the Citizens United decision was correct.\"\n\nAsked to comment on the current system of unlimited money, Anika Rickard, a spokesperson for the Republican Party of Wisconsin, did not answer the question but instead criticized Crawford and her funders.\n\nAt one point, Wisconsin was seen as providing a roadmap for reform. In 2009, the state passed the Impartial Justice Act. The legislation, enacted with bipartisan support, provided for public financing of state Supreme Court races, so candidates could run without turning to special interests for money.\n\nThe push for the measure came after increased spending by outside special interests and the candidates in two state Supreme Court races: the 2007 election that cost an e stimated $5.8 million and the 2008 contest that neared $6 million , according to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign.\n\nCandidates who agreed in 2009 to public financing and spending limits received grants of up to $400,000 for the race. The money came from the Democracy Trust Fund, which was supported by a $2 income tax check-off.\n\n\"Reformers win a fight to clean up court races,\" the headline on an editorial in The Capital Times read at the time.\n\nBut the law was in place for only one election, in April 2011. Both candidates in the court's general election that year agreed to take public funding, and incumbent Justice David Prosser, a conservative, narrowly won reelection. Then Republicans eliminated funding for the measure that summer. Instead, the money was earmarked to implement a stringent voter ID law.\n\nBy 2015, GOP leaders had completely overhauled the state's campaign finance law, with Democrats in the Assembly refusing to even vote on the measure in protest.\n\n\"This Republican bill opens the floodgates to unlimited spending by billionaires, by big corporations and by monied, special interests to influence our elections,\" Rep. Lisa Subeck, a Democrat, said in the floor debate.\n\nWisconsin is no longer cited as a model. Activists point to other states, including Arizona, Oregon and Rhode Island. Arizona and Oregon established disclosure measures to trace the flow of dark money, requiring campaign spenders to reveal the original source of donations. Rhode Island required ads to name not only the sponsor but the organization's top donors so voters can better access the message and its credibility.\n\nAmid skepticism that Wisconsin will rein in campaign spending, there may be some reason for optimism.\n\nA year ago, a proposed joint resolution in Wisconsin's Legislature bemoaned Citizens United and the spending it had unleashed. The resolution noted that \"this spending has the potential to drown out speech rights for all citizens, narrow debate, weaken federalism and self-governance in the states, and increase the risk of systemic corruption.\"\n\nThe resolution called for a constitutional amendment clarifying that \"states may regulate the spending of money to influence federal elections.\"\n\nAnd though it never came to a vote, 17 members of the Legislature signed on to it, a dozen of them Republicans. Eight of them are still in the Legislature, including Sen. Van Wanggaard, who voted for the 2015 bill weakening Wisconsin's campaign finance rules.\n\nWanggaard did not respond to a request for comment. But an aide expressed surprise - and disbelief - seeing the lawmaker's name on the resolution.\n\nProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox .\n\nLeaders at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ordered staff this week not to release their experts' assessment that found the risk of catching measles is high in areas near outbreaks where vaccination rates are lagging, according to internal records reviewed by ProPublica.\n\nIn an aborted plan to roll out the news, the agency would have emphasized the importance of vaccinating people against the highly contagious and potentially deadly disease that has spread to 19 states, the records show.\n\nA CDC spokesperson told ProPublica in a written statement that the agency decided against releasing the assessment \"because it does not say anything that the public doesn't already know.\" She added that the CDC continues to recommend vaccines as \"the best way to protect against measles.\"\n\nBut what the nation's top public health agency said next shows a shift in its long-standing messaging about vaccines, a sign that it may be falling in line under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines:\n\n\"The decision to vaccinate is a personal one,\" the statement said, echoing a line from a column Kennedy wrote for the Fox News website. \"People should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine and should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines.\"\n\nProPublica shared the new CDC statement about personal choice and risk with Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health. To her, the shift in messaging, and the squelching of this routine announcement, is alarming.\n\n\"I'm a bit stunned by that language,\" Nuzzo said. \"No vaccine is without risk, but that makes it sound like it's a very active coin toss of a decision. We've already had more cases of measles in 2025 than we had in 2024, and it's spread to multiple states. It is not a coin toss at this point.\"\n\nFor many years, the CDC hasn't minced words on vaccines. It promoted them with confidence . One campaign was called \" Get My Flu Shot .\" The agency's website told medical providers they play a critical role in helping parents choose vaccines for their children: \"Instead of saying 'What do you want to do about shots?,' say 'Your child needs three shots today.'\"\n\nNuzzo wishes the CDC's forecasters would put out more details of their data and evidence on the spread of measles, not less. \"The growing scale and severity of this measles outbreak and the urgent need for more data to guide the response underscores why we need a fully staffed and functional CDC and more resources for state and local health departments,\" she said.\n\nKennedy's agency oversees the CDC and on Thursday announced it was poised to eliminate 2,400 jobs there.\n\nWhen asked what role, if any, Kennedy played in the decision to not release the risk assessment, HHS' communications director said the aborted announcement \"was part of an ongoing process to improve communication processes - nothing more, nothing less.\" The CDC, he reiterated, continues to recommend vaccination \"as the best way to protect against measles.\"\n\n\"Secretary Kennedy believes that the decision to vaccinate is a personal one and that people should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine,\" Andrew G. Nixon said. \"It is important that the American people have radical transparency and be informed to make personal healthcare decisions.\"\n\nResponding to questions about criticism of the decision among some CDC staff, Nixon wrote, \"Some individuals at the CDC seem more interested in protecting their own status or agenda rather than aligning with this Administration and the true mission of public health.\"\n\nThe CDC's risk assessment was carried out by its Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, which relied, in part, on new disease data from the outbreak in Texas. The CDC created the center to address a major shortcoming laid bare during the COVID-19 pandemic. It functions like a National Weather Service for infectious diseases, harnessing data and expertise to predict the course of outbreaks like a meteorologist warns of storms.\n\nOther risk assessments by the center have been posted by the CDC even though their conclusions might seem obvious.\n\nIn late February, for example, forecasters analyzing the spread of H5N1 bird flu said people who come \"in contact with potentially infected animals or contaminated surfaces or fluids\" faced a moderate to high risk of contracting the disease. The risk to the general U.S. population, they said, was low.\n\nIn the case of the measles assessment, modelers at the center determined the risk of the disease for the general public in the U.S. is low, but they found the risk is high in communities with low vaccination rates that are near outbreaks or share close social ties to those areas with outbreaks. The CDC had moderate confidence in the assessment, according to an internal Q&A that explained the findings. The agency, it said, lacks detailed data about the onset of the illness for all patients in West Texas and is still learning about the vaccination rates in affected communities as well as travel and social contact among those infected. (The H5N1 assessment was also made with moderate confidence.)\n\nThe internal plan to roll out the news of the forecast called for the expert physician who's leading the CDC's response to measles to be the chief spokesperson answering questions. \"It is important to note that at local levels, vaccine coverage rates may vary considerably, and pockets of unvaccinated people can exist even in areas with high vaccination coverage overall,\" the plan said. \"The best way to protect against measles is to get the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.\"\n\nThis week, though, as the number of confirmed cases rose to 483, more than 30 agency staff were told in an email that after a discussion in the CDC director's office, \"leadership does not want to pursue putting this on the website.\"\n\nThe cancellation was \"not normal at all,\" said a CDC staff member who spoke anonymously for fear of reprisal with layoffs looming. \"I've never seen a rollout plan that was canceled at that far along in the process.\"\n\nAnxiety among CDC staff has been building over whether the agency will bend its public health messages to match those of Kennedy, a lawyer who founded an anti-vaccine group and referred clients to a law firm suing a vaccine manufacturer.\n\nDuring Kennedy's first week on the job, HHS halted the CDC campaign that encouraged people to get flu shots during a ferocious flu season. On the night that the Trump administration began firing probationary employees across the federal government, some key CDC flu webpages were taken down. Remnants of some of the campaign webpages were restored after NPR reported this.\n\nBut some at the agency felt like the new leadership had sent a message loud and clear: When next to nobody was paying attention, long-standing public health messages could be silenced.\n\nOn the day in February that the world learned that an unvaccinated child had died of measles in Texas, the first such death in the U.S. since 2015, the HHS secretary downplayed the seriousness of the outbreak. \"We have measles outbreaks every year,\" he said at a cabinet meeting with President Donald Trump.\n\nIn an interview on Fox News this month, Kennedy championed doctors in Texas who he said were treating measles with a steroid, an antibiotic and cod liver oil, a supplement that is high in vitamin A. \"They're seeing what they describe as almost miraculous and instantaneous recovery from that,\" Kennedy said.\n\nAs parents near the outbreak in Texas stocked up on vitamin A supplements, doctors there raced to assure parents that only vaccination, not the vitamin, can prevent measles .\n\nStill, the CDC added an entry on Vitamin A to its measles website for clinicians.\n\nOn Wednesday, CNN reported that several hospitalized children in Lubbock, Texas, had abnormal liver function , a likely sign of toxicity from too much vitamin A.\n\nTexas health officials also said that the Trump administration's decision to rescind $11 billion in pandemic-related grants across the country will hinder their ability to respond to the growing outbreak, according to The Texas Tribune.\n\nMeasles is among the most contagious diseases and can be dangerous. About 20% of unvaccinated people who get measles wind up in the hospital. And nearly 1 to 3 of every 1,000 children with measles will die from respiratory and neurologic complications. The virus can linger in the air for two hours after an infected person has left an area, and patients can spread measles before they even know they have it.\n\nThis week Amtrak said it was notifying customers that they may have been exposed to the disease this month when a passenger with measles rode one of its trains from New York City to Washington, D.C.\n\nElon Musk's aerospace giant SpaceX allows investors from China to buy stakes in the company as long as the funds are routed through the Cayman Islands or other offshore secrecy hubs, according to previously unreported court records.\n\nThe rare picture of SpaceX's approach recently emerged in an under-the-radar corporate dispute in Delaware. Both SpaceX's chief financial officer and Iqbaljit Kahlon, a major investor, were forced to testify in the case.\n\nIn December, Kahlon testified that SpaceX prefers to avoid investors from China because it is a defense contractor. There is a major exception though, he said: SpaceX finds it \"acceptable\" for Chinese investors to buy into the company through offshore vehicles.\n\n\"The primary mechanism is that those investors would come through intermediate entities that they would create or others would create,\" Kahlon said. \"Typically they would set up BVI structures or Cayman structures or Hong Kong structures and various other ones,\" he added, using the acronym for the British Virgin Islands. Offshore vehicles are often used to keep investors anonymous.\n\nExperts called SpaceX's approach unusual, saying they were troubled by the possibility that a defense contractor would take active steps to conceal foreign ownership interests.\n\nKahlon, who has long been close to the company's leadership, has said he owns billions of dollars of SpaceX stock. His investment firm also acts as a middleman, raising money from investors to buy highly sought SpaceX shares. He has routed money from China through the Caribbean to buy stakes in SpaceX multiple times, according to the court filings.\n\nThe legal dispute centers on an aborted 2021 deal, when SpaceX executives grew angry after news broke that a Chinese firm was going to buy $50 million of the company's stock. SpaceX then had the purchase canceled. In separate testimony, the rocket company's CFO explained that the media coverage was \"not helpful for our company as a government contractor.\" SpaceX's business is built on those contracts, with the U.S. government paying the company billions to handle sensitive work like building a classified spy satellite network.\n\nCompany executives were concerned that coverage of the deal could lead to problems with national security regulators in the U.S., according to Kahlon's testimony and a filing from his attorneys.\n\nSpaceX, which also launches rockets for NASA and sells satellite internet service, is perhaps the most important pillar of Musk's fortune. His estimated 42% stake in the company is valued at around $150 billion. If he owned nothing else, he'd still be richer than Bill Gates.\n\nFederal law gives regulators broad power to oversee foreign investments in tech companies and defense contractors. Companies only have to proactively report Chinese investments in limited circumstances, and there aren't hard and fast rules for how much is too much. However, the government can initiate investigations and then block or reverse transactions they deem a national security threat. That authority typically does not apply to purely passive investments in which a foreign investor is buying only a small slice of a company. But experts said that federal officials regularly ask companies to add up Chinese investments into an aggregate total.\n\nThe U.S. government charges that China has a systematic strategy of using even minority investments to secure leverage over companies in sensitive industries, as well as to gain privileged access to information about cutting-edge technology. U.S. regulators view even private investors in China as potential agents of the country's government, experts said.\n\nThe new materials do not contain allegations that the Chinese investments in SpaceX would violate the law or were directed by the Chinese government. The company did not respond to detailed questions from ProPublica. Kahlon declined to comment on the reasons for SpaceX's approach.\n\nIt's not uncommon for foreigners to buy U.S. stock through a vehicle in the Cayman Islands, often to save money on taxes. But experts said it was strange for the party on the other side of a deal - the U.S. company - to prefer such an arrangement.\n\nProPublica spoke to 13 national security lawyers, corporate attorneys and experts in Chinese finance about the SpaceX testimony. Twelve said they had never heard of a U.S. company with such a requirement and could not think of a purpose for it besides concealing Chinese ownership in SpaceX. The 13th said they had heard of companies adopting the practice as a way to hide foreign investment.\n\n\"It is certainly a policy of obfuscation,\" Andrew Verstein, a UCLA law professor who has studied defense contractors, said of the SpaceX testimony. \"It hints at potentially serious problems. We count on companies to be forthright with the government about whether they've taken money from America's rivals.\"\n\nThe new material adds to the questions surrounding Musk's extensive ties with China, which have taken a new urgency since the world's richest man joined the Trump White House. Musk has regularly met with Communist Party officials in China to discuss his business interests in the country, which is where about half of Tesla cars are built.\n\nLast week, The New York Times reported that Musk was scheduled to get a briefing on secret plans for potential war between China and the U.S. The Times later reported that the briefing was called off, and Trump denied it had ever been scheduled. The president told reporters it would be wrong to show the war plans to the businessman: \"Elon has businesses in China, and he would be susceptible perhaps to that,\" Trump said.\n\nThe Delaware court records reveal SpaceX insiders' intense preoccupation with secrecy when it comes to China and detail a network of independent middlemen peddling SpaceX shares to eager Chinese investors. (Unlike a public company, SpaceX exercises significant control over who can buy into the company, with the ability to block sales even between outside parties.)\n\nBut the case leaves unanswered the question of exactly what percentage of SpaceX is owned by Chinese investors.\n\nThe Financial Times recently reported that Chinese investors had managed to acquire small amounts of SpaceX stock and that they were turning to offshore vehicles to do so. The deals were structured to limit the information investors receive, the outlet said. The Delaware records reveal additional, previously unreported Chinese investments in SpaceX but do not say how much they were worth. The few Chinese investments in SpaceX where a dollar figure is publicly known total well under $100 million.\n\nThe experts said the court testimony is puzzling enough that it raises the possibility that SpaceX has more substantial ties to China than are publicly known and is working to mask them from U.S. regulators. A more innocent explanation, they said, is that SpaceX is seeking to avoid scrutiny of perfectly legal investments by the media or Congress.\n\nOnce a welcome source of cash, Chinese investment in Silicon Valley has become the subject of intense debate in Washington as hostility between the two countries deepened in recent years. Corporate lawyers told ProPublica they'd counsel their clients against requiring the use of offshore vehicles because it could make it look like they are trying to hide something from the government.\n\nBret Johnsen, the SpaceX CFO, testified in the Delaware dispute that the company does not have a formal policy about accepting investments from countries deemed adversaries by the U.S. government. Rather, he said, SpaceX has \"preferences that kind of feel like a policy.\" Sensitive to how such financial ties could make it \"more challenging to win government contracts,\" Johnsen said that he asks fund managers to \"stay away from Russian, Chinese, Iranian, North Korean ownership interest.\"\n\nIn the public portion of his deposition, Johnsen wasn't asked whether routing Chinese money offshore made such investments acceptable to SpaceX. But he lent credibility to Kahlon, the investor who said that was enough to get the green light. Johnsen said that he has a long-standing personal relationship with Kahlon and that he's discussed the company's approach to Chinese ownership with him. The CFO added that he trusts Kahlon to bring in only investors that the company approves of.\n\nOver the years, Kahlon has personally helped Chinese investors buy stakes in SpaceX on \"a number of occasions\" through \"proxies such as British Virgin Islands- or Cayman Islands-based entities,\" according to a filing from his lawyers. He also knows of \"many\" other Chinese investors who own SpaceX shares, the filing said. He learned about them through conversations with investors and brokers, as well \"from having viewed investor lists.\"\n\nKahlon is a consummate SpaceX insider. He \"has been with the company in one form or fashion longer than I have,\" said Johnsen, who's worked at SpaceX for 14 years. Early in his career, Kahlon worked for Peter Thiel at the same venture capital firm that once employed JD Vance, and he first met with SpaceX around 2007 a few years after it was founded.\n\nKahlon eventually opened his own firm called Tomales Bay Capital, becoming a major player among the middlemen who cater to would-be investors in SpaceX. He's helped people like former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos buy pieces of the rocket company. He also said he has served as a \"back channel\" between SpaceX and international regulators as the company sought to bring its satellite internet products to countries like India.\n\nKahlon and Johnsen were forced to testify after the deal with a Chinese firm fell apart in late 2021, sparking years of litigation. That year, Kahlon had the opportunity to buy more than half a billion dollars of SpaceX stock from a West Palm Beach private equity firm. Kahlon had already brought Chinese money into SpaceX before, he testified, and he again turned to China as he gathered funds to purchase the stake.\n\nKahlon soon connected with a Shanghai-based company called Leo Group, short for \"Love Each Other.\" As Kahlon made his pitch during their first call, Leo was told that \"it would be best not to disclose the name of SpaceX,\" an executive at the Chinese company later testified. \"They deemed that information to be quite sensitive.\"\n\nLeo quickly sent Kahlon $50 million. He then messaged another business associate in China: \"Have any folks interested in spcex still?\"\n\nKahlon testified that he was planning to tell Johnsen about the Leo investment and expected the CFO to sign off on it. But the deal blew up after Leo mentioned SpaceX in a regulatory filing that generated widespread coverage in the Chinese business press. (Whether Leo had Kahlon's permission to make the disclosure is a matter of dispute.) In a panic, Kahlon enlisted a Leo vice president to try to get the articles taken down. But when Johnsen and Tim Hughes, SpaceX's top in-house lobbyist, spotted the stories, they grew alarmed.\n\n\"This is not helpful for our company as a government contractor,\" the SpaceX CFO later testified regarding the press attention. \"It, in essence, arms our competitors with something to use as a narrative against us.\"\n\n\"In my entire professional career, this was literally the worst situation that I've been in,\" Kahlon said. \"I failed at what I thought was a core responsibility in the relationship we had.\"\n\nSpaceX ultimately decided to let Kahlon buy only a smaller portion of the stake, purchasing much of the half-billion dollar investment itself. According to contemporaneous messages and testimony from Kahlon, he was told that decision was made by Musk. However, Kahlon continued to have a strong relationship with SpaceX after the mishap, court records say, with the company allowing his firm to keep buying a large quantity of shares.\n\nMusk's business interests in China extend far beyond SpaceX's ownership structure - a fact that has drawn criticism from Republican lawmakers over the years. In 2022, after Tesla opened a showroom in the Chinese region where the government runs Uyghur internment camps, then-Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted, \"Nationless corporations are helping the Chinese Communist Party cover up genocide.\"\n\nIn addition to Tesla's sprawling factory in Shanghai, last year, almost 40% of Tesla's sales were to Chinese customers. The company has also secured major tax breaks and regulatory victories in the country. In 2019, the Chinese premier offered Musk the country's equivalent of a green card.\n\nIn recent years, the billionaire has offered sympathetic remarks about China's desire to reclaim Taiwan and lavished praise on the government. \"My experience with the government of China is that they actually are very responsive to the people,\" Musk said toward the end of Trump's first term. \"In fact, possibly more responsive to the happiness of people than in the U.S.\"\n\nDo you have any information we should know about Elon Musk's businesses?

The standoff lasted 10 hours until the rabbi, drawing on extensive security training, hurled a chair at the assailant. The hostages escaped.\n\n\"We are alive today because of that education,\" Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker said after the attack.\n\nThe averted tragedy at Congregation Beth Israel is cited as a success story for the largely unseen prevention work federal authorities have relied on for years in the fight to stop terrorist attacks and mass shootings. The government weaves together partnerships with academic researchers and community groups across the country as part of a strategy for addressing violent extremism as a public health concern.\n\nA specialized intervention team at Boston Children's Hospital treats young patients - some referred by the FBI - who show signs of disturbing, violent behavior. Eradicate Hate, a national prevention umbrella group, says one of its trainees helped thwart a school shooting in California last year by reporting a gun in a fellow student's backpack. In other programs, counselors guide neo-Nazis out of the white-power movement or help families of Islamist extremists undo the effects of violent propaganda.\n\nThe throughline for this work is federal funding - a reliance on grants that are rapidly disappearing as the Trump administration guts billions in spending.\n\nTens of millions of dollars slated for violence prevention have been cut or are frozen pending review as President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency steamrolls the national security sector. Barring action from Congress or the courts, counterterrorism professionals say, the White House appears poised to end the government's backing of prevention work on urgent threats.\n\n\"This is the government getting out of the terrorism business,\" said one federal grant recipient who was ordered this week to cease work on projects including a database used by law enforcement agencies to assess threats.\n\nThis account is drawn from interviews with nearly two dozen current and former national security personnel, federally funded researchers and nonprofit grant recipients. Except in a few cases, they spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation from the Trump administration.\n\nDozens of academic and nonprofit programs that rely on grants from the Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department and other agencies are in crisis mode, mirroring the uncertainty of other parts of the government amid Trump's seismic reorganization.\n\n\"We're on a precipice,\" said the leader of a large nonprofit that has received multiple federal grants and worked with Democratic and Republican administrations on prevention campaigns.\n\nProgram leaders describe a chilling new operating environment. Scholars of white supremacist violence - which the FBI for years has described as a main driver of domestic terrorism - wonder how they'll be able to continue tracking the threat without running afoul of the administration's ban on terms related to race and racism.\n\nThe training the rabbi credits with saving his Texas synagogue in 2022 came from a broader community initiative whose federal funding is in limbo. One imperiled effort, FEMA's Nonprofit Security Grant Program, has helped Jewish institutions across the country install security cameras, train staff and add protective barriers, according to the nonprofit Secure Community Network, which gives security advice and monitors threats to Jewish communities nationwide.\n\nIn July 2023, access-control doors acquired through the grant program prevented a gunman from entering Margolin Hebrew Academy in Memphis. In 2021, when gunfire struck the Jewish Family Service offices in Denver, grant-funded protective window film stopped bullets from penetrating the building.\n\n\"These are not hypothetical scenarios, they are real examples of how NSGP funds prevent injuries and deaths,\" Michael Masters, director of the Secure Community Network, wrote this month in an op-ed in The Jerusalem Post calling for continued funding of the program .\n\nNow the security grants program has been shelved as authorities and Jewish groups warn of rising antisemitism . The generous reading, one Jewish program leader said, is that the funds were inadvertently swept up in DOGE cuts. Trump has been a vocal supporter of Jewish groups and, as one of his first acts in office, signed an executive order promising to tackle antisemitism .\n\nStill, the freeze on grants for synagogue protections has revived talk of finding new, more independent funding streams.\n\nThroughout Jewish history, the program director said, \"we've learned you need a Plan B.\"\n\nThe White House did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nFor more than two decades, the federal government has invested tens of millions of dollars in prevention work and academic research with the goal of intervening in the crucial window known as \"left of boom\" - before an attack occurs.\n\nThe projects are diffuse, spread across several agencies, but the government's central clearinghouse is at Homeland Security in the Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships, often called CP3. The office houses a grant program that since 2020 has awarded nearly $90 million to community groups and law enforcement agencies working at the local level to prevent terrorism and targeted violence such as mass shootings.\n\nThese days, CP3 is imploding. Nearly 20% of its workforce was cut through the dismissal of probationary employees March 3. CP3 Director Bill Braniff , an Army veteran who had fiercely defended the office's achievements in LinkedIn posts in recent weeks, resigned the same night.\n\n\"It is a small act of quiet protest, and an act of immense respect I have for them and for our team,\" Braniff wrote in a departing message to staff that was obtained by ProPublica. In the note, he called the employees \"wrongfully terminated.\"\n\nSome of this year's CP3 grant recipients say they have no idea whether their funding will continue. One awardee said the team is looking at nightmare scenarios of laying off staff and paring operations to the bone.\n\n\"Everybody's trying to survive,\" the grantee said. \"It feels like this is a tsunami and you don't know how it's going to hit you.\"\n\nCurrent and former DHS officials say they don't expect the prevention mission to continue in any meaningful way, signaling the end to an effort that had endured through early missteps and criticism from the left and right.\n\nThe prevention mission evolved from the post-9/11 growth of a field known as countering violent extremism, or CVE. In early CVE efforts, serious scholars of militant movements jostled for funding alongside pseudo-scientists claiming to have discovered predictors of radicalization. CVE results typically weren't measurable, allowing for inflated promises of success - \"snake oil,\" as one researcher put it.\n\nWorse, some CVE programs billed as community partnerships to prevent extremism backfired and led to mistrust that persists today. Muslim advocacy groups were incensed by the government's targeting of their communities for deradicalization programs, blaming CVE for stigmatizing law-abiding families and contributing to anti-Muslim hostility. Among the most influential Muslim advocacy groups, it is still taboo to accept funding from Homeland Security.\n\nDefenders of CP3, which launched in 2021 from an earlier incarnation, insist that the old tactics based on profiling are gone. They also say there are now more stringent metrics to gauge effectiveness. CP3's 2024 report to Congress listed more than 1,000 interventions since 2020, cases where prevention workers stepped in with services to dissuade individuals from violence.\n\nThe probationary employees who were dismissed this month represented the future of CP3's public health approach to curbing violence, say current and former DHS officials. They were terminated by email in boilerplate language about poor performance, a detail that infuriated colleagues who viewed them as accomplished social workers and public health professionals.\n\nThere were no consultations with administration officials or DOGE - just the ax, said one DHS source with knowledge of the CP3 cuts. Promised exemptions for national security personnel apparently didn't apply as Trump's Homeland Security agenda shrinks to a single issue.\n\n\"The vibe is: How to use DHS to go after migrants, immigrants. That is the vibe, that is the only vibe, there is no other vibe,\" the source said. \"It's wild - it's as if the rest of the department doesn't exist.\"\n\nThis week, with scant warning, Homeland Security cut around $20 million for more than two dozen programs from another wing of DHS, including efforts aimed at stopping terrorist attacks and school shooters.\n\nA Homeland Security spokesperson confirmed \"sweeping cuts and reforms\" aimed at eliminating waste but did not address questions about specific programs. DHS \"remains focused on supporting law enforcement and public safety through funding, training, increased public awareness, and partnerships,\" the statement said.\n\nOne grant recipient said they were told by a Homeland Security liaison that targeted programs were located in places named on a Fox News list of \"sanctuary states\" that have resisted or refused cooperation with the government's deportation campaign. The grantee's project was given less than an hour to submit outstanding expenses before the shutdown.\n\nThe orders were so sudden that even some officials within the government had trouble coming up with language to justify the termination notices. They said they were given no explanation for how the targeted programs were in violation of the president's executive orders.\n\n\"I just don't believe this is in any way legal,\" said one official with knowledge of the cuts.\n\nCuts are reshaping government across the board, but perhaps nowhere more jarringly than in the counterterrorism apparatus. The administration started dismantling it when the president granted clemency to nearly 1,600 defendants charged in connection with the storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThe pardons overturned what the Justice Department had celebrated as a watershed victory in the fight against domestic terrorism.\n\nSenior FBI officials with terrorism expertise have left or are being forced out in the purge of personnel involved in the Jan. 6 investigation. In other cases, agents working terrorism cases have been moved to Homeland Security to help with Trump's mass deportation effort, a resource shift that runs counter to the government's own threat assessments showing homegrown militants as the more urgent priority. The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWithout research backing up the enforcement arm of counterterrorism, analysts and officials say, the government lacks the capacity to evaluate rapidly evolving homegrown threats.\n\nResearchers are getting whiplash as grant dollars are frozen and unfrozen. Even if they win temporary relief, the prospect of getting new federal funding in the next four years is minimal. They described pressure to self-censor or tailor research narrowly to MAGA interests in far-left extremism and Islamist militants.\n\n\"What happens when you're self-silencing? What happens if people just stop thinking they should propose something because it's 'too risky?'\" said one extremism scholar who has advised senior officials and received federal funding. \"A lot of ideas that could be used to prevent all kinds of social harms, including terrorism, could get tossed.\"\n\nAmong the projects at risk is a national compilation of threats to public officials, including assassination attempts against Trump; research on the violent misogyny that floods social media platforms; a long-term study of far-right extremists who are attempting to disengage from hate movements. The studies are underway at research centers and university labs that, in some cases, are funded almost entirely by Homeland Security. A stop-work order could disrupt sensitive projects midstream or remove findings from public view.\n\n\"There are both national security and public safety implications for not continuing to study these very complicated problems,\" said Pete Simi, a criminologist at Chapman University in California who has federally funded projects that could be cut.\n\nOne project never got off the ground before work was suspended.\n\nSix months ago, the National Institute of Justice, the research arm of the Justice Department, announced the Domestic Radicalization and Violent Extremism Research Center of Excellence as a new hub for \"understanding the phenomenon\" of extremist violence.\n\nWork was scheduled to start in January. The website has since disappeared and the future of the center is in limbo.\n\nOther prevention initiatives in jeopardy at the Justice Department include grant programs related to hate crimes training, which has been in demand with recent unrest on college campuses. In the first weeks of the Trump administration, grant recipients heard a freeze was coming and rushed to withdraw remaining funds. Grant officers suggested work should cease, too, until directives come from the new leadership.\n\nAnne Speckhard, a researcher who has interviewed dozens of militants and works closely with federal counterterrorism agencies, pushed back. She had around 200 people signed up for a training that was scheduled for days after the first funding freeze. Slides for the presentation had been approved, but Speckhard said she wasn't getting clear answers from the grant office about how to proceed. She decided to go for it.\n\n\"I think the expected response was, 'You'll just stop working, and you'll wait and see,' and that's not me,\" said Speckhard, whose International Center for the Study of Violent Extremism receives U.S. funding along with backing from Qatar and private donations.\n\nAs the virtual training began, Speckhard and her team addressed the murkiness of the Justice Department's support in a moment that drew laughter from the crowd of law enforcement officers and university administrators.\n\n\"We said, 'We think this is a DOJ-sponsored training, and we want to thank them for their sponsorship,'\" Speckhard said. \"'But we're not sure.'\"\n\nIn late October, ProPublica published one of its most prophetic stories in our history. You can be forgiven if you missed it at the time. There was a lot going on in the days before the election, and the headlines were dominated by seemingly consequential issues like the racist humor of a comedian who addressed Donald Trump's rally at Madison Square Garden.\n\nBut if you weren't among the several hundred thousand people who read our story, \"' Put Them in Trauma': Inside a Key MAGA Leader's Plans for a New Trump Agenda ,\" in real time, you may have seen it referenced since Trump took office in January.\n\nThe story drew on private recordings of a series of speeches given in 2023 and 2024 by Russell Vought obtained by our colleagues at Documented , a news site with a remarkable knack for uncovering information powerful interests would prefer remained secret.\n\nVought, a self-described Christian nationalist who served as the director of the Office of Management and Budget in Trump's first term, was known for his provocative public pronouncements. But he went even further in private, envisaging a Trump presidency in which regulatory agencies would be shut down and career civil servants would be too depressed to get out of bed.\n\n\"We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected,\" Vought said in one recording . \"When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work because they are increasingly viewed as the villains. We want their funding to be shut down so that the EPA can't do all of the rules against our energy industry because they have no bandwidth financially to do so.\n\n\"We want to put them in trauma.\"\n\nVought spoke openly about the ongoing planning to defund independent federal agencies and demonize government scientists. \"We have detailed agency plans,\" he said. \"We are writing the actual executive orders. We are writing the actual regulations now, and we are sorting out the legal authorities for all of what President Trump is running on.\"\n\nVought argued that the radical steps were necessary because Trump's opponents were themselves attempting to end democracy. \"The stark reality in America is that we are in the late stages of a complete Marxist takeover of the country,\" he said in one speech. \"Our adversaries already hold the weapons of the government apparatus, and they have aimed it at us. And they are going to continue to aim it until they no longer have to win elections.\"\n\nIt's hard to imagine a more prescient piece of journalism. The story captured, as few did, the breadth and ferocity of the coming attack on the federal government. Vought has returned to his post as the budget office's director, and his plans for eviscerating entire agencies and decimating the morale of federal workers have turned into reality. Trump 47 looks very different from Trump 45, just as Vought told his audiences that it would.\n\nSo why didn't this story drive more of a national conversation when it appeared?\n\nAs a news organization that tries to spur change by bringing new facts to light, we think about this question a lot. Our job at ProPublica is to both get the story and get it into the heads of a critical mass of citizens and elected officials.\n\nI've been an investigative reporter and editor for nearly three decades, and I still struggle to predict which of our stories will catalyze national conversations. Our 2018 story about the recording of a young girl in a immigration detention center prompted the Trump administration to end its policy of family separation at the border. Many other powerful stories fail to break through.\n\nPart of the problem, of course, is the proliferation of media. Every day, dozens of important-sounding stories vie for readers' attention along with the flood of posts on social media and texts from friends and colleagues. And that's not to mention all the podcasts and multipart dramas on Netflix and HBO.\n\nThis was an issue long before Trump and his allies adopted a \"flood the zone\" strategy with multiple norm-challenging actions, but it seems even more acute right now.\n\nIt is often said of journalists that we write the rough draft of history. But our work differs from historians in a crucial aspect: Scholars typically are chronicling events after the outcome is clear. As journalists, we face a tougher challenge as we try to find the stories in the cacophony of daily events that tell us something about where we're going.\n\nA lot of what we do as reporters is akin to squinting through opaque windows at events unfolding in a very dimly lit room. We can see who is inside and how they're moving, but our lack of context often prevents us from understanding what's really happening. We default to assuming that the future will be roughly like the past, guessing that, say, Trump 47 will be roughly like Trump 45 with fewer guardrails.\n\nVought could not have been clearer that this was not the case, and he had the credentials that should have made what he was saying entirely credible. After all, Vought was the author of the plan in Trump's first term to make it easier to fire large numbers of civil servants. He was a key member of Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation project that described in copious detail how a second Trump administration might unfold.\n\nStill, there was at least one data point that perhaps prevented readers from viewing his speeches as predictive as they turned out to be. As our story made clear, Vought despises the Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies, a core Republican ally in bringing conservative voices into the judiciary and federal law enforcement. We quoted him as asserting that \"the vaunted so-called Federalist Society and originalist judges\" were serving as a \"Praetorian Guard\" for the Democrats.\n\nThat view would seem to make him something of a fringe thinker in MAGA world, which relied on the Federalist Society to pick the judges who make up the conservative supermajority on the high court.\n\nThings look different today. Seen against the backdrop of recent events, Vought's disdain for the rule-of-law scruples of Federalist Society legal thinkers seems entirely in line with Trump's recent post suggesting a federal judge shouldn't have authority over his administration.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, Danielle Sassoon, one of the Federalist Society's bright lights, a Yale Law graduate who had clerked for conservative icon Antonin Scalia, resigned as acting U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York rather than carry out orders from the Trump Justice Department. In refusing to drop the corruption case against New York Mayor Eric Adams, Sassoon wrote that she understood her duty as a prosecutor to mean \"enforcing the law impartially, and that includes prosecuting a validly returned indictment regardless of whether its dismissal would be politically advantageous, to the defendant or those that appointed me.\"\n\nMany years ago, a New York Times investigative reporter and I were discussing a story we had worked on that had been sharply and justifiably criticized as new facts emerged. \"I can be fair and accurate,\" he said. \"But fair, accurate and prescient is beyond me.\"\n\nIt seems appropriate to give Vought the last word since the worldview he described has proven so accurate. What sounded grandiose in the preelection days seems today like a reasonable summary of the path Trump and his allies have chosen.\n\n\"We are here in the year of 2024, a year that very well [could] - and I believe it will - rival 1776 and 1860 for the complexity and the uncertainty of the forces arrayed against us,\" Vought said, citing the years when the colonies declared independence from Britain and the first state seceded over President Abraham Lincoln's election.\n\n\"God put us here for such a time as this.\"\n\nI'm not sure about the role of the almighty in ProPublica's work in the coming years. But we feel equally strongly that we're here for a \"time such as this.\"\n\nIn 2019, the Keller Independent School District in North Texas looked a lot like its counterpart just 30 miles to the east in the Dallas suburb of Richardson. Each served about 35,000 children and had experienced sharp increases in the racial diversity of students in recent decades. Each was run by a school board that was almost entirely white.\n\nIn the five years since, the districts have followed strikingly divergent paths as culture war battles over how to teach race and gender exploded across the state.\n\nIn Keller, candidates backed by groups seeking to limit the teaching of race and gender took control of the school board and immediately passed sweeping policies that gave outsized power to any individual who wanted to prevent the purchase of books they believed to be unsuitable for children.\n\nThough more than half of Keller's students are from racially diverse backgrounds, the district in 2023 nixed a plan to buy copies of a biography of Black poet Amanda Gorman after a teacher at a religious private school who had no children in the district complained about this passage: \"Amanda realized that all the books she had read before were written by white men. Discovering a book written by people who look like her helped Amanda find her own voice.\" The passage, the woman wrote, \"makes it sound like it's okay to judge a book by the authors skin color rather than the content of the book.\"\n\nBoard members at the Richardson school district went in the opposite direction, even as they contended with similar pressure from groups aiming to rid the district of any materials that they claimed pushed critical race theory, an advanced academic concept that discusses systemic racism. The school board did not ban library books but instead allowed parents to limit their own children's access to them, keeping them available for other students.\n\nOne major difference contributed to the districts' divergence: the makeup of their school boards.\n\nThe way communities elect school board members plays a key, if often overlooked, role in whether racially diverse districts like Keller and Richardson experience takeovers by ideologically driven conservatives seeking to exert greater influence over what children learn in public schools, ProPublica and The Texas Tribune found. Since the pandemic, such groups have successfully leveraged the state's long-standing and predominantly at-large method of electing candidates to flip school boards in their direction.\n\nMost of Texas' 1,000 school districts use an at-large method, where voters can cast ballots for all candidates. Supporters say that allows for broader representation for students, but voting rights advocates argue that such systems dilute the power of voters of color. If board members are elected districtwide, there tends to be less diversity, according to research, which also shows that if they are elected by smaller geographic zones, candidates of color often have more success.\n\n\"What you're seeing happening in Texas is how at-large districts make it easy for somebody to come in, usually from the outside, and hijack the process and essentially buy a board,\" said Michael Li, senior counsel for the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonprofit public policy institute that champions small-donor campaign financing. \"Because of this conflux of factors - at-large elections and large amounts of outside money - it just sort of defeats the idea of representative democracy.\"\n\nProPublica and the Tribune examined 14 rapidly diversifying suburban school districts where children from diverse backgrounds now make up more than half of the student population. In the six districts that used at-large voting systems, well-funded and culture-war-driven movements successfully helped elect school board members who have moved aggressively to ban or remove educational materials that teach children about diversity, even in districts where a majority of children are not white. Nearly 70% of board members in such districts live in areas that are whiter than their district's population.\n\nEight nearby school systems with similar demographics employ single-member voting systems to elect school board candidates. Under the single-member system, voters within certain boundaries elect a board member who specifically represents their area. Candidates in those districts received less campaign support from ideologically driven political action committees, and none of the districts experienced school board takeovers fueled by culture war issues.\n\nAbout 150 Texas school districts have transitioned to a single-member system since the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which is intended to prevent voter discrimination and has brought greater racial representation to local governments. Richardson joined that list in 2019 after a former Black board member sued the district.\n\nSuch legal challenges, however, could soon become more difficult. In one of his first acts in office, President Donald Trump froze civil rights litigation against school districts accused of discriminating against minority groups, and many legal experts believe that under his administration, federal prosecutors will refuse to bring challenges against at-large systems. DOJ officials did not respond to questions from the news organizations.\n\nTrump, a staunch critic of diversity and inclusion programs, has threatened to cut federal funding to schools that he says are pushing \"inappropriate racial, sexual or political content onto the shoulders of our children.\"\n\nDistricts whose boards oppose sweeping efforts to restrict curriculum and books related to race and racism face even more headwinds in Texas. In January, Gov. Greg Abbott vowed to ban diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in public schools, a move that would expand the state's existing ban on college campuses. And Texas lawmakers continue to target the books students can access. One bill, authored by North Texas state Sen. Angela Paxton , the wife of Attorney General Ken Paxton , would require every district in the state to follow a version of Keller's library book purchase policy.\n\nThe president of the Keller board, Charles Randklev, did not respond to multiple requests for comment, and the district did not answer written questions. District officials have previously said that the board represents all students, not just those in a specific neighborhood or area.\n\nBut Laney Hawes, the parent of four students in the district and an outspoken critic of the school board, said the policy on library purchases spawned a backdoor channel to banning materials about race. That, she said, has deprived her children of reading books about Americans like Gorman that provide points of view they might not find otherwise.\n\n\"They have created a system that allows anyone in the community to complain about any book for any reason, and now that book is not on library shelves,\" said Hawes, who is white. She added that the book does not contain any sexually explicit material and was strictly targeted because it dealt with race.\n\n\"They just hate the racial undertones.\"\n\nSchool districts across Texas have drawn considerable attention for removing books from their shelves, but board members in Keller went further when they passed a policy in August 2022 that, in practice, allowed community members to block proposed purchases.\n\nStudents spoke out against the district's removal policies during a board meeting months later, pleading for access to books about race. One biracial student, who has since graduated, told the board that books about characters from different racial backgrounds helped her feel more accepted.\n\n\"All kids deserve to see themselves in literature,\" the student said. \"Racial minorities being written into a story does not instantly equate the book to being propaganda. Having books that mirror the experience of race is not pushing an agenda. It's simply documenting the hardships that consistently happen to most students of color that they're able to relate to. Concealing ideas just because they tell an uncomfortable truth is not protecting your children.\"\n\nThe students' pleas didn't sway the board, and by July 2023, challenges to such books began pouring in.\n\nOne person opposed the purchase of \"Jim Crow: Segregation and the Legacy of Slavery.\" The person, who did not provide their name, pointed to a photo of a young girl participating in a Black Lives Matter protest with the caption: \"Just as in the past, people continue fighting for change.\" They also took issue with this quote: \"You can't 'get over' something that is still happening. Which is why black Americans can't 'get over' slavery or Jim Crow.\"\n\nThe photo and the quotes, the book challenger said, were \"potentially CRT,\" showed the Black Lives Matter Movement in \"a positive light\" and claimed \"oppression is still happening.\"\n\nAnother person challenged the planned purchase of \"Our Skin: A First Conversation About Race,\" saying that the book started \"beautifully,\" but that \"unfortunately tenets of CRT, social justice, and anti-white activism are portrayed.\" The person, who used a pseudonym, did not offer specifics.\n\nAdministrators removed those books, the Gorman biography and 26 others from the purchase list after receiving the complaints, according to district officials. Librarians can reinstate books on future lists, but 75% of those flagged for further review never made it to the shelves, an online search of district libraries shows. That includes the three books about race.\n\nHawes, who heads two PTA groups at her children's schools, said book challenges and complaints have come from allies of school board members. In 2022, Patriot Mobile Action, a North Texas Christian nationalist PAC funded by a cellphone company, spent more than $115,000 supporting three ideologically driven conservatives running for control of the school board.\n\nLeigh Wambsganss, Patriot Mobile's spokesperson and executive director of the PAC, declined to comment but said in a 2022 podcast that the PAC chose candidates based on their Christian conservative views and sought out those who \"absolutely would stand against critical race theory.\" Patriot Mobile supported eight candidates in three other North Texas districts that used at-large voting during the same election cycle. All of them won their races.\n\n\"We weren't prepared for what was coming,\" Hawes said. \"We were literally up against a machine.\"\n\nAnother PAC, KISD Family Alliance, spent $50,000 to help elect the same Keller school board candidates. Its donors included conservative activist Monty Bennett, who previously told the Tribune that he believes schools have been taken over by ideologues \"pushing their outlandish agendas.\" Neither Bennett nor the PAC's treasurer responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe slate of Keller candidates, whose combined campaign war chests dwarfed that of their opponents' by a more than 4 to 1 margin, focused their agendas squarely on culture war issues related to library books and curriculum.\n\n\"While I have many priorities I want to focus on, if concerns over child safety, and sexualization and politicization of children make me a one-issue candidate, so be it. I will be a one-issue candidate all day long,\" Joni Shaw Smith wrote on her campaign website. Smith, who is now a board member, declined to comment.\n\nHer election contributed to what would become a sweep of the seven seats on the board. Five of those seats are held by board members who live in the city of Keller, where three-quarters of residents are white and the median household income of more than $160,000 is among the highest in the state.\n\nMost of the Keller district's 42 schools, however, are located in the more diverse neighborhoods of Fort Worth.\n\nThirty miles away, the makeup of Richardson's school board changed dramatically after the district settled a lawsuit filed in 2018 by David Tyson Jr. He argued that the continued use of at-large voting to select candidates was a \"relic of the district's segregated past.\"\n\nTyson became the district's first Black board member when he was elected in 2004. After he retired in 2010, he watched with growing consternation as no candidates from diverse backgrounds followed in his footsteps, even though students of color accounted for nearly 70% of the district's population.\n\nFrustrated, Tyson sued Richardson, challenging its system for electing candidates under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He and Richardson officials settled the lawsuit in 2019, and the district converted primarily to a system in which candidates needed to live within specific boundaries and receive a majority of votes from residents who also lived within those boundaries to be elected.\n\nAs ideologically driven candidates swept Keller school board elections, similar efforts played out differently in Richardson. In 2022, two candidates supported by groups seeking to limit instruction and library books that deal with race and gender ran against two candidates of color with differing views. A local PAC that accused the district of teaching \"CRT nonsense\" in a mailer hired the same Republican campaign consulting firm that was working in support of the Keller candidates.\n\nDespite being outspent 2-to-1, the candidates of color won their elections. Their wins gave Richardson four board members of diverse backgrounds, a remarkable evolution from an all-white board just three years earlier. And, as nearby districts began mass removals of library books dealing with race and gender, the Richardson school board embraced an \"opt-out\" process to give concerned parents control over their children's reading \"without impacting the choices of other families who may have different values, wishes or expectations.\" Opponents say opt-out systems do not go far enough in protecting students from materials they deem objectionable.\n\n\"Single-member districts benefited us in making sure our school board maintains the diversity, and diversity of thought, we have, and not just fall into those culture wars,\" said Vanessa Pacheco, one of the board members who won.\n\nPacheco said not being consumed by such fights allowed the board to focus on \"real stuff\" like dual-language classes for elementary students, expanding pre-K opportunities and scheduling school events for parents in the evenings and on weekends to account for working families.\n\nSo striking was the district's atmosphere following the 2022 election that a Dallas Morning News commentary dubbed Richardson a \"no-drama district\" in a sea of school boards consumed by fights over race and gender.\n\nTyson, whose lawsuit set the stage for the Richardson school board's dramatic transformation, said that the shift in voting methods has accomplished what he had hoped for.\n\n\"The goal was to get representation,\" he said. \"We're a majority-minority school district, and so we need to have a majority-minority representation on the school board.\"\n\nHawes watched as voters down the road in Richardson rejected candidates seeking to limit what the district's diverse student body could read and learn. She watched as the board itself grew increasingly diverse. And she watched with a touch of envy as the district embraced the idea that parents and community members who opposed certain books should not make decisions for every child in the district.\n\nWith Richardson as their north star, Hawes and a growing number of concerned parents began discussing ways to force the Keller school district to adopt what they believed was a more representative voting system. It wasn't just a question of race for Hawes. It was also about geographic diversity. Board members who live in the city of Keller hold a majority, even though less than a third of students in the district attend schools there.\n\nSo last year, Hawes and other concerned parents met with law firms and the NAACP and began planning a petition drive that would require the board to hold an election to do away with at-large voting. Members planned to meet in January to finalize a strategy.\n\nThen, in mid-January, the Keller school board shocked many in the community by proposing to split the district in two, separating the whiter, more affluent city of Keller to the east from the neighborhoods of northern Fort Worth, which are home to the majority of the district's students, including many who are low income. Like many districts in the state, Keller faces a massive budget shortfall.\n\nRandklev, the board president, defended the split as financially beneficial for both districts in a Facebook post last month. He also wrote that \"neighboring school districts have been forced into single-member districts, and that's a no-win situation regardless of where you live.\" He did not explain his position but said the proposed split \"could provide programming opportunities that best reflect local community goals and values and foster greater parent and community involvement.\"\n\nBut many parents, including Dixie Davis, who previously ran unsuccessfully for the board, said the proposed change would leave the vast majority of the district's low-income student population, and most of its students of color, with uncertain access to facilities like an advanced learning center and the district's swimming complex.\n\nOn Friday, board members abandoned plans to divide the school district in two, citing the cost of restructuring the district's debt. But their push to split the district has further energized efforts by some parents to do away with at-large voting. Brewer Storefront, the same law firm that fought to change the voting system in Richardson, has filed a similar legal challenge in federal court against Keller and concerned parents have launched a petition drive to force the district to vote on its at-large system. The district has not yet filed a response to the lawsuit and did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\n\"With the momentum and uproar around this proposed district split, it's now or never to get this done,\" Davis said. \"It'll be a huge uphill battle, but this is our best shot.\"\n\nLexi Churchill , ProPublica and The Texas Tribune, and Jessica Priest , The Texas Tribune, contributed research.\n\nThe for-profit prison company GEO Group has surged in value under President Donald Trump . Investors are betting big on immigration detention. Its stock price doubled after Election Day.\n\nBut despite its soaring fortunes, the $4 billion company continues to resist having to pay detainees more than $1 a day for cleaning facilities where the government has forced them to live.\n\nAt the 1,575-bed detention center GEO runs for Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Tacoma, Washington, detainees once prepared meals, washed laundry and scrubbed toilets, doing jobs that would otherwise require 85 full-time employees, the company estimated. The state's minimum wage at the time was $11 an hour. (It's now $16.66.) In 2017, Washington sued GEO to enforce it, and in October 2021 a federal jury ruled unanimously in the state's favor.\n\nThis year, GEO and Washington are back in court - for a third time - as the company tries to reverse the earlier decision that sided with the state. GEO has brought in contract cleaners at the Tacoma facility while the case plays out, keeping detainees there from paid work and from having a way to earn commissary money.\n\nThe legal battle has national repercussions as the number of ICE detainees around the country rises to its highest level in five years. The vast majority are held in private facilities run by GEO or corporate competitors like CoreCivic. If following state minimum wages becomes the norm, Trump's immigration crackdown could cost the country even more than it otherwise would - unless private detention centers absorb the cost themselves or decide to cut back on cleaning, which Tacoma detainees have already accused GEO of doing.\n\nGEO frames the lawsuit as a fight over the federal government's authority to make the laws of the nation. Multiple courts have decided that the Fair Labor Standards Act, which sets the federal minimum wage, does not apply to detained migrants. At issue in the Tacoma case is the state minimum wage.\n\n\"Simply put, we believe the State of Washington has unconstitutionally violated the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution,\" GEO wrote in a news release.\n\nThe company did not respond to a request for comment from ProPublica. ICE and CoreCivic declined to comment.\n\nGEO's latest legal salvo came last month.\n\nA three-judge panel at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had recently affirmed lower courts' rulings. GEO had to pay state minimum wage at the Tacoma facility. The company was also ordered to hand over $17 million in back wages, plus $6 million for \"unjust enrichment.\" The combined penalties amounted to less than 1 percent of GEO's total revenues in 2024.\n\nRather than pay up, GEO petitioned on Feb. 6 for a rehearing by the full 9th Circuit. In the news release, it vowed to \"vigorously pursue all available appeals.\"\n\nIt isn't that GEO lacks the ability to pay, the company has made clear in legal filings. Its gross profit from its Tacoma facility, today called the Northwest ICE Processing Center, was about $20 million a year when Washington filed its lawsuit. The company told a judge in 2021 it could \"pay the Judgments twenty times over.\"\n\nThe real issue is the precedent the Tacoma case could set. GEO, which manages 16 ICE detention facilities across the country, faces similar lawsuits in California and Colorado. The California case, also before the 9th Circuit, is on hold pending the outcome of Washington's. Colorado's is winding its way through a lower court.\n\nGEO is expected to fight the case all the way to the Supreme Court, if needed.\n\nIf eventually forced to pay state minimum wages across the country, the company could decide to pay detainees more or else hire outside employees at all its locations - either of which would potentially eat into its profits, stock price and dividends.\n\nThe company also could try to renegotiate its long-term contracts with ICE for a higher rate of reimbursement, Lauren-Brooke Eisen, an expert in incarceration, noted in an article for the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nOr GEO could respond to higher labor costs another way. After the jury decision against it in 2021, the company paused Tacoma's Voluntary Work Program , as it is known, rather than pay detainees there minimum wage. Some could no longer afford phone calls to family members. (For such detainees, the program had never been entirely voluntary. \"I need the money desperately,\" one testified. \"I have no choice.\")\n\nThe facility also \"got really gross\" after the sudden stoppage, a Mexican detainee told the Associated Press at the time. \"Nobody cleaned anything.\"\n\nGEO brought in contract cleaners eventually.\n\nMike Faulk, a spokesperson for the Washington state attorney general's office, said testimony in the minimum-wage issue highlights the problem with housing detainees in private prisons: profit motive. Not only did GEO pay $1 a day for cleaning in Tacoma, it budgeted less than $1 per meal that each detainee ate, one kitchen worker testified. \"So the grade of food is abysmal,\" Faulk said of the detainee's testimony. \"He routinely picked out grasshoppers/insects from the food.\"\n\nFor its part, GEO argues that Washington wants to unfairly - and hypocritically - hold the Tacoma facility to a standard that even state facilities don't have to meet. The company has noted that a carveout in Washington law exempts state prisons from minimum-wage requirements, allowing the state to pay prisoners no more than $40 a week. The federal government, taking GEO's side, has made the same point in \"friend of the court\" briefs under both the first Trump administration and the Biden administration. So did a dissenting judge in the recent 9th Circuit decision.\n\nBut to liken state prisons to a privately run immigration facility is an \"apples and oranges\" comparison, the 9th Circuit decided. Washington doesn't let private companies run its state prisons. And the migrants in Tacoma are detained under civil charges, not as convicted criminals.\n\nAs judges have noted, GEO's contract with ICE states that the prison company must follow \"all applicable federal, state, and local laws and standards,\" including \"labor laws and codes.\" It also holds that GEO must pay detainees at least $1 a day for the Voluntary Work Program. The federal government \"made a deliberate choice to dictate to GEO the minimum rate,\" the 9th Circuit wrote in its most recent decision, but \"it also made a deliberate choice not to dictate to GEO a maximum rate.\"\n\nConditions in Tacoma are worsening as the number of detainees rises, according to Maru Mora Villalpando, founder of the activist group La Resistencia. The group is in regular contact with people inside the detention center.\n\nMeal service, Mora Villalpando said, is faltering: \"Dinner used to be at 5. Then 6. Now it's 9.\"\n\nCleaning is faltering, too, she said. Without detainee labor, the outside cleaners have to do it all.\n\n\"But these people,\" Mora Villalpando said, \"can't keep up.\"\n\nOn Feb. 20, nearly 7,000 probationary employees at the Internal Revenue Service began receiving an unsigned letter telling them that they had been fired for poor performance.\n\nTrump administration lawyers insist that the IRS and other federal agencies have acted within their authority when they ordered waves of mass terminations since Trump took office. But according to previously unreported emails obtained by ProPublica, a top lawyer at the IRS warned administration officials that the performance-related language in his agency's termination letter was \"a false statement\" that amounted to \"fraud\" if the agency kept the language in the letter.\n\nThe emails reveal that in the hours before the IRS sent out its Feb. 20 termination letter, a fierce dispute played out at the agency's highest levels.\n\nJoseph Rillotta, a senior IRS lawyer, wrote that \"no one\" at the IRS had taken into account the performance of the probationary workers set to be fired. Rillotta urged that the language be struck from the draft termination letter.\n\nIf the falsehood wasn't removed, Rillotta said he would file a report with the inspector general for the IRS.\n\nNo one appeared to respond to Rillotta's first email. In a follow-up email, he said he was \"pleading with you to remove the clause,\" adding: \"It is not an immaterial false statement, because it is designed to improve the government's posture in litigation (to the detriment of the employees that we are terminating today).\"\n\nBecause it was not true, he wrote, \"That renders it, as I see it, an anticipatory fraud on tribunals of jurisdiction over these employment actions.\"\n\nRillotta was again ignored. The IRS sent out the Feb. 20 termination notice with the disputed language in it, according to copies received by fired workers who shared them with ProPublica. The notice said the decision to fire the workers had taken \"into account your performance\" as well as administration guidance and \"current mission needs.\"\n\nIn fact, many of the employees had received laudatory reviews with no hint of any concerns.\n\nSoon afterward, the inspector general for the IRS took preliminary steps to look into the matter, according to a person familiar with the effort who wasn't authorized to speak with reporters. This person said they told the investigator that they agreed with Rillotta that the performance rationale was false.\n\nMichelle Bercovici, a lawyer who represents federal workers, told ProPublica that Rillotta's ignored warnings should make it easier for plaintiffs to show that the mass firings were \"arbitrary and capricious,\" the legal standard needed to invalidate a federal agency's action. She added that the emails could also help plaintiffs recover attorneys' fees from the government.\n\n\"When an agency acts based on false information, not only does it set the action up for being overturned,\" she said. \"It also means the agency is not going to have many defenses to its actions and could be liable for fees.\"\n\nSpokespeople for the Treasury Department and IRS did not respond to requests for comment. An Office of Personnel Management spokesperson referred ProPublica to a revised memorandum stating that OPM \"is not directing agencies to take any specific performance-based actions regarding probationary employees.\"\n\nThe terminations at the tax agency were among the deep cuts to federal agencies by the Trump administration and its Department of Government Efficiency, led by the billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk.\n\nMultiple federal lawsuits are now challenging the Trump administration's mass firings. Last week, two federal judges temporarily blocked the IRS and other firings, but the lawsuits continue.\n\nThe issue of whether the performance rationale was legitimate has been central to the suits. One suit , brought by a group of labor unions, advocacy groups and other parties in California federal court, alleges that OPM directed the probationary firings and so \"perpetrated one of the most massive employment frauds in the history of this country, telling tens of thousands of workers that they are being fired for performance reasons, when they most certainly were not.\"\n\nIn response, administration lawyers denied that OPM directed agencies to fire probationary workers based on performance or misconduct. Instead, the filing says, \"OPM reminded agencies of the importance of the probationary period in evaluating applicants' continued employment and directed agencies to identify all employees on probationary periods and promptly determine whether those employees should be retained at the agency.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs later expanded that suit to include the Treasury Department, which oversees the IRS, as one of the defendants. In mid-March, Judge William Alsup issued a preliminary injunction in the case, saying the administration's probationary firings were based on \"a lie.\" Alsup ordered several federal agencies, including the Treasury, to reinstate thousands of fired employees. The Trump administration has appealed Alsup's ruling.\n\nAnother suit , filed in Maryland federal court by nearly two dozen Democratic state attorneys general, also claims that the IRS mass firings were unlawful and should be reversed. (In that case, administration lawyers asserted that the mass firings were lawful.)\n\nCourt filings in both cases have partially revealed how the administration chose to make the legally questionable decision to fire probationary workers en masse on performance grounds..\n\nAt the IRS, the plan to fire probationary employees began in early February, according to an affidavit filed in the Maryland case.\n\nA high-ranking Treasury Department official instructed a senior IRS personnel employee named Traci DiMartini to identify all probationary IRS employees and fire them \"based on performance,\" according to an affidavit DiMartini later filed in court.\n\nDiMartini had \"never heard of mass probationary employee firings,\" she stated in her affidavit.\n\nWhen DiMartini asked the Treasury Department official why they were firing so many probationary employees, she was told that the order came from OPM , which was staffed by Trump appointees and members of DOGE.\n\nIn her affidavit, DiMartini confirmed what Rillotta wrote in his emails - that it was false to say probationary employees were fired for performance. DiMartini's office \"did not review or consider\" any probationary employees' job performance or conduct. Nor did the Treasury Department. \"I know this because this fact was discussed openly in meetings,\" DiMartini stated in her affidavit.\n\nAccording to DiMartini's affidavit, OPM drafted the IRS mass-termination letter. While Treasury officials made several changes to it, the IRS's personnel office where DiMartini worked \"was not permitted to make any changes to the letter,\" DiMartini's affidavit said.\n\nDiMartini refused to sign the mass-termination letter, according to her affidavit. The then-acting commissioner of the IRS, Douglas O'Donnell, also refused to sign the letter.\n\nWhen thousands of affected IRS employees finally received the letter, it arrived from a generic email account. No agency official's name appeared anywhere in the document.\n\nDo you have any information we should know about the IRS, DOGE or the Trump administration's mass firings?

The shutdown left exposed open pits of soil contaminated with dioxin, the deadly byproduct of Agent Orange, which the American military sprayed across large swaths of the country during the Vietnam War. After Rubio's orders to stop work, the cleanup crews were forced to abandon the site, and, for weeks, all that was covering the contaminated dirt were tarps, which at one point blew off in the wind.\n\nAnd even more pressing, the officials warned in a Feb. 14 letter obtained by ProPublica, Vietnam is on the verge of its rainy season, when torrential downpours are common. With enough rain, they said, soil contaminated with dioxin could flood into nearby communities, poisoning their food supplies.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people live around the Bien Hoa air base, and some of their homes abut the site's perimeter fence, just yards from the contaminated areas. And less than 1,500 feet away is a major river that flows into Ho Chi Minh City, population 9 million.\n\n\"Simply put,\" the officials added, \"we are quickly heading toward an environmental and life-threatening catastrophe.\"\n\nThey received no response from Washington, according to three people familiar with the situation.\n\nInstead, Rubio and Peter Marocco, another top Trump appointee, have not only ordered the work to stop, but they also have frozen more than $1 million in payments for work already completed by the contractors the U.S. hired. The company overseeing the project is Tetra Tech, a publicly traded consulting and engineering firm based in the U.S., and a Vietnamese construction firm has been tasked with the excavation work.\n\nThen, on Feb. 26, Rubio and Marocco canceled both companies' contracts altogether before apparently reversing that decision about a week later, agency records show. As of Thursday, the companies had not been paid.\n\nThe Trump administration has told the courts repeatedly that its process to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development, which manages the project's funds, has been careful and considered. But the botched situation at Bien Hoa is a stark example of the whiplash, conflicting messages and dire consequences that aid organizations worldwide have faced since early February.\n\nNow, after losing several weeks because of the administration's orders, the companies are scrambling - at their own expense - to secure the Bien Hoa site before it starts raining, according to documents reviewed by ProPublica and several people familiar with the current situation.\n\nThe USAID officials who would typically travel to the air base to provide oversight have been placed on administrative leave or prevented from traveling to check on the work. They've also been forbidden from communicating with the Vietnamese government or the companies working at the base, sources say, though they believe that directive was lifted after the contracts were recently reinstated. The confusion has left many at both the embassy and in Washington in the dark about where the situation stands.\n\nTo ascertain the current status of the work, ProPublica hired a reporter to visit the air base on Friday.\n\nWorkers are laboring in 95 degree heat, surrounded by toxic soil. The site has a skeleton crew of less than half of what they previously had, according to workers and documents reviewed by ProPublica. Some staffers found new jobs during the suspension. People working at the site told the reporter they are worried about completing the work before the rainy season descends and are terrified the U.S. will pause the work again.\n\nSince 2019, the U.S. government has collaborated with Vietnam's Ministry of Defense to clean up the Bien Hoa air base and agreed to spend more than $430 million for the project. Unlike other foreign aid programs, addressing Agent Orange is more akin to restitution than charity because the U.S. brought the deadly substance there in the first place. \"The dioxin remediation program is one of the core reasons why we have an extraordinary relationship with Vietnam today,\" a State Department official told ProPublica, \"a country that should by all rights hate us.\"\n\nWith enough contaminated soil to fill about 40,000 dump trucks, the Bien Hoa air base is the largest deposit of postwar pesticides remaining in Vietnam after a decadeslong cleanup campaign. Human rights groups, environmentalists and diplomats consider the cleanup work - along with disability assistance that the U.S. has provided to Agent Orange victims across the country - to be one of the most successful foreign aid initiatives of all time.\n\nAll of that was now in peril, the officials wrote in their Feb. 14 letter to USAID officials in Washington. \"What immediate actions can be taken to avert a potential life-threatening incident while still maintaining compliance with the Executive Order and the suspension directives?\" the officials wrote.\n\nU.S. officials in Vietnam grew increasingly panicked. The ambassador sent a diplomatic cable to Washington, and Congress and USAID's inspector general each received a whistleblower complaint, multiple people told ProPublica.\n\n\"Halting a project like that in the middle of the work, that's an environmental crime,\" said Jan Haemers, CEO of another organization that previously worked in Vietnam to clean up Agent Orange in the soil. \"If you stop in the middle, it's worse than if you never started.\"\n\nThe State Department said in a statement that the contracts at Bien Hoa are \"active and running\" but did not respond to detailed follow-up questions. Tetra Tech and the Vietnamese construction firm did not respond to questions for this story. The Vietnamese Embassy and Ministry of Defense did not return requests for comment. But the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs made a statement on Feb. 13 that it was \" deeply concerned \" about USAID program suspensions, specifically mentioning the Bien Hoa project.\n\nTrump's aides, including billionaire Elon Musk, began dismantling the U.S. foreign assistance system almost immediately after the inauguration. They dismissed USAID staff en masse, issued sweeping stop-work orders, froze funds and eventually canceled most of the agency's contracts with aid organizations around the world, leaving countless children, refugees and other desperately vulnerable people without critical services .\n\nOn Monday, Rubio boasted on X that they had cut 83% of USAID's programs because they didn't align with Trump's agenda.\n\nAfter terminating the contracts, Rubio, Musk and Marocco reversed several of their decisions in Vietnam, designating the Bien Hoa project as one of the few programs to survive, at least for now.\n\nEvery president since George W. Bush - including Trump - has made good on the American promise to repair relations with Vietnam by cleaning up Agent Orange and helping those sick or disabled from dioxin poisoning. In 2017, Trump landed at Danang Airport, a prior cleanup site, ahead of a free-trade meeting with Asia-Pacific countries. The U.S. now conducts $160 billion in annual commerce with Vietnam, which has also become a key partner against China's growing influence in the South China Sea. The Pentagon and Vietnamese military now work together as well , including efforts to locate the remains of soldiers missing in action from the war 50 years ago.\n\n\"All of this is underpinned by the cooperation on Agent Orange,\" said Charles Bailey, a former Ford Foundation representative in Vietnam who co-wrote a book on the country's relations with the U.S. in the wake of the war. \"It's like pulling out one or two legs of the stool.\"\n\nThe Bien Hoa project was formally launched and initial contracts signed during Trump's first presidency. In another example of the administration's confusing stance toward the project, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told his Vietnamese counterpart on a Feb. 7 phone call that Trump wanted to enhance defense ties by addressing war legacy issues, which include Agent Orange remediation. About half of the project's funding comes from the Pentagon's budget, though it's funneled through USAID, so it was also caught up in the foreign aid freeze.\n\nEnvironmental consultants, foreign policy experts and government officials said the episode in Bien Hoa shows the administration did not do a thoughtful audit. \"One might imagine a less reckless government looking at what we're doing carefully and then deciding what's in our interest,\" David Shear, a former U.S. ambassador to Vietnam under Barack Obama, told ProPublica.\n\n\"But,\" he said, \"this is government reform by meat cleaver.\"\n\nThe mixture known as Agent Orange is a combination of two herbicides that the U.S. brought to Vietnam in huge volumes to kill off jungles and mangroves that hid opposition forces during the Vietnam war. The mixture contained dioxin, a deadly substance that not only causes a range of cancers and other illnesses, but is also linked to birth defects for babies exposed in utero. During the war, the U.S. sprayed more than 10 million gallons of the herbicides across vast swaths of the country, exposing U.S. soldiers as well as millions of Vietnamese people and their future children to the deadly toxic substance.\n\nStorage sites like the air bases of Danang and Bien Hoa were heavily contaminated as barrels leaked, broke or were otherwise mishandled. Over the decades, dust has blown the contaminated soil off the bases and abundant rains have pushed the dioxin into waterways and the densely packed surrounding neighborhoods, contaminating fish as well as ducks and chicken that people raise for food. Soil samples at the Bien Hoa base have shown dioxin at levels as high as 800 times the allowed amount in Vietnam.\n\nFor decades since the war, and despite extensive documentation of higher rates of cancers and birth defects among people who had been exposed to the chemicals, the U.S. denied the mass toll Agent Orange had taken on Vietnamese people - as well as on American veterans, as ProPublica has previously reported . But starting in the mid-2000s under President George W. Bush, the U.S. began earmarking federal dollars for dioxin remediation in Vietnam to clean up the contamination sites and the two nations' troubled relationship.\n\nThe cleanup work is dangerous and laborious. People hired by the contractors wear extensive protective equipment in the sweltering humidity and must have their blood tested regularly for dioxin. When levels get too high, they are no longer allowed to work at the site. There are supposed to be extensive safety checks in place to ensure the dirt doesn't poison military officials or the surrounding community.\n\nThe plan at Bien Hoa is to excavate a half-million cubic meters of the most contaminated soil and enclose it underground or cook it in an enormous furnace, which hasn't been built yet, until the dioxin no longer poses a threat. The work requires extensive pumping and management of dioxin-contaminated water. Contractors are halfway through a 10-year project set to happen in stages, and the bulk of the excavation work must be done between December and April when there is less rain.\n\nAfter Rubio first issued sweeping stop-work orders to aid organizations and contractors around the world in late January, workers from the site were told to stay home for weeks. The companies stopped receiving money to cover payroll and their past invoices. Huge mounds of tarp-covered dirt dotted sections of the base.\n\nUSAID and State Department staff scrambled to get the project back online through the State Department's confusing waiver process and appealed to counterparts in the U.S. A group of Democratic senators sent a letter to Hegseth and Rubio urging them to pay the contractors. \"It would be difficult to overstate the damage to the relationship that would result if the U.S were to walk away from these war legacy programs,\" they wrote. They got no response.\n\nOne of the senators who signed the letter, Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., told ProPublica that abandoning the Bien Hoa cleanup is \"a betrayal of the goodwill our two nations built over 30 years\" and a \"gift to our adversaries.\"\n\nEven off-season rains pushed the sites to the brink, two sources said, with water pooling up to the edge of protective aprons, threatening to spill out onto an active military runway after recent rainstorms.\n\nHeavier rains typically start in April before the downpours of the rainy season in May.\n\nThe contractors are desperately trying to secure the contaminated dirt and pits before then, according to interviews this week with several people working there. But they are two months behind schedule.\n\n\"The problem is that the Trump administration has destroyed USAID, so it's very unclear how we're going to complete this project,\" said Tim Rieser, a longtime aide to former Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who led a bipartisan delegation to break ground in Bien Hoa in 2019. \"The people making the decisions probably know the least.\"\n\nAlex Mierjeski contributed research.\n\nReporting Highlights\n\nThese highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.\n\nOn Jan. 19, 2024, the sheriff of Jacksonville, Florida, released a 27-page manifesto left behind by Ryan Palmeter, a 21-year old white man who had murdered three Black people at a Dollar General store before turning the gun on himself.\n\nThe Florida Times-Union, a prominent local news outlet, said it would not be publishing the document, which it said used the N-word 183 times and had an \"overall theme of white superiority.\" T.K. Waters, the sheriff, said he had posted what he described as the \"rantings of an isolated, hateful, madman\" to keep his promise of public transparency. An attorney for one of the victims' families urged the public \"to not give Palmeter the satisfaction of publishing or distributing his manifesto,\" saying it \"contains not one redeemable thought.\"\n\nThousands of miles away, in Elk Grove, California, Dallas Humber saw Palmeter's view of the world as perfect for her audience of online neo-Nazis. Humber, a now-35-year-old woman with a penchant for dyeing her hair neon colors, was a leading voice in an online network of white supremacists who had coalesced in a dark corner of Telegram, a social media and messaging service with almost a billion users worldwide.\n\nShe and her comrades called this constellation of interlocking Telegram accounts Terrorgram. Their shared goal was to topple modern democracies through terrorism and sabotage and then replace them with all-white ethno-states.\n\nHumber quickly turned Palmeter's slur-riddled manifesto into an audiobook that she narrated in a monotone. Then she sent it into the world with her signature line:\n\n\"So, let's get this party started, Terrorbros.\"\n\nThe manifesto immediately began to spread, pinballing around the worldwide Terrorgram scene, which celebrated mass shooters like Palmeter as \"saints.\"\n\nThe Terrorgram story is part of a much larger 21st century phenomenon. Over the past two decades, massive social networks like X, Facebook and Telegram have emerged as a powerful force for both good and evil. The ability to connect with like-minded strangers helped fuel uprisings like the Arab Spring and Iran's pro-democracy movements. But it has also aided extremists, including brutal jihadist organizations like the Islamic State group and white supremacists around the world.\n\nTelegram, which is massively popular outside of the U.S., boasted an array of features that appealed to Humber and her fellow Terrorgammers. They could send encrypted direct messages, start big chat groups and create public channels to broadcast their messages. In the span of five years, they grew Terrorgram from a handful of accounts into a community with hundreds of chats and channels focused on recruiting would-be terrorists, sharing grisly videos and trading expertise on everything from assassination techniques to the best ways to sabotage water systems and electrical transmission lines. On one of her many accounts, Humber posted step-by-step instructions for making pipe bombs and synthesizing HMTD, a potent explosive.\n\nHumber went by a series of usernames but was eventually publicly exposed by a group of California activists. ProPublica and FRONTLINE reviewed chat logs - some provided by the Australian anti-fascist research organization The White Rose Society - court records and Humber's other digital accounts to independently confirm her identity.\n\nU.S. prosecutors say Humber helped lead the Terrorgram Collective, a transnational organization that ran popular Terrorgram accounts, produced sophisticated works of propaganda and distributed an alleged hit list of potential assassination targets. She is currently facing a host of federal terrorism charges, along with another alleged Terrorgram leader, Matthew Allison, a 38-year-old DJ from Boise, Idaho. Both have pleaded not guilty.\n\nTo trace the rise and fall of Terrorgram, ProPublica and FRONTLINE obtained a trove of chat logs and got access to some of the extremists' private channels, allowing reporters to track in real time their posts and relationships. We combed through legal documents, talked with law enforcement officials and researchers in six countries and interviewed a member of the collective in jail. Taken together, our reporting reveals new details about the Terrorgram Collective, showing how Humber and her compatriots were powerful social media influencers who, rather than peddling fashion or food, promoted murder and destruction.\n\nThe material illustrates the tension faced by every online platform: What limits should be imposed on the things users post or discuss? For years, social networks like Facebook and X employed thousands of people to review and take down offensive content, from pornography to racist memes to direct incitement of violence. The efforts at content moderation prompted complaints, primarily from conservatives, that the platforms were censoring conservative views of the world.\n\nTelegram was created in 2013 by Pavel Durov, a Russian-born technologist, and his brother Nikolai. Pavel Durov, a billionaire who posts pictures of himself on Instagram, baring his chiseled torso amid rock formations and sand dunes, became the face of the company. He marketed the platform as a free-speech-focused alternative to the Silicon Valley social media platforms, which in the mid-2010s had begun aggressively policing disinformation and racist and dehumanizing content. Telegram's restrictions were far more lax than those of its competitors, and it quickly became a hub for hate as well as illegal activity like child sexual exploitation and gunrunning.\n\nOur review of thousands of Terrorgram posts shows that the lack of content moderation was crucial to the spread of the collective's violent content. Telegram's largely hands-off approach allowed Humber and her alleged confederates to reach an international audience of disaffected young people.\n\nThey encouraged these followers to turn their violent thoughts into action. And some of them did.\n\nProPublica and FRONTLINE identified 35 crimes linked to Terrorgram, including bomb plots, stabbings and shootings. Each case involved an individual who posted in Terrorgram chats, followed Terrorgram accounts or was a member of an organized group whose leaders participated in the Terrorgram community.\n\nOne of the crimes was a 2022 shooting at an LGBTQ+ bar in Bratislava, Slovakia, that left two people dead and another injured. In an earlier story, ProPublica and FRONTLINE detailed how the shooter, Juraj Krajčík, was coached to kill over three years by members of the Terrorgram Collective , a process that started when he was just 16 years old.\n\nRadka Trokšiarová survived the Bratislava attack after being shot twice in the leg. \"Sometimes I catch myself wishing to be able to ask the gunman: 'Why did you do it? What was the point and purpose of destroying so many lives?'\" she said.\n\nTelegram declined repeated requests to make its executives available for interviews and would not answer specific questions about Humber and other Terrorgram leaders. But in a statement, the company said, \"Calls for violence from any group are not tolerated on our platform.\"\n\nThe company said that Telegram's \"significant growth has presented unique moderation challenges due to the sheer volume and diversity of content uploaded to the platform,\" but that since 2023 it has stepped up its moderation practices, using AI and a team of about 750 contractors. Telegram said it now \"proactively monitors public content across the platform and takes down objectionable content before it reaches users and has a chance to be reported.\"\n\nRight-wing extremists were flocking to Telegram by 2019.\n\nMany had been effectively exiled from major social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, which, in response to public pressure, had built vast \"trust and safety\" teams tasked with purging hateful and violent content. The companies had also begun using a shared database of hashes - essentially digital fingerprints - to quickly identify and delete videos and images produced by terror groups.\n\nEven 8chan, an anonymous message board frequented by extremists, had begun pulling down particularly egregious posts and videos. Users there openly discussed moving to Telegram. One lengthy thread encouraged white supremacists to start using Telegram as a tool for communicating with like-minded people and spreading radical ideas to those they considered \"normies.\" \"It offers a clean UI\" - user interface - \"and the best privacy protection we can get for this sort of social,\" wrote one 8chan poster.\n\nPavel Durov, the 40-year-old Telegram co-founder, had positioned himself as a stalwart champion of privacy and free expression, arguing that \"privacy is more important than the fear of terrorism.\" After the Iranian government blocked access to the app in that country in 2018, he called free speech an \"undeniable human right.\"\n\nTo the extremists, Telegram and Durov seemed to be promising to leave them and their posts alone - no matter how offensive and alarming others might find their messages.\n\nAmong those who joined the online migration were Pavol Beňadik and Matthew Althorpe. The two men quickly began testing Telegram's limits by posting content explicitly aimed at inspiring acts of white supremacist terrorism.\n\nThen 23, Althorpe came from a small town on the Niagara River in Ontario, Canada; Beňadik, who was 19 at the time, lived in a village in Western Slovakia and went by the online handle Slovakbro.\n\nBoth were believers in a doctrine called militant accelerationism, which has become popular with neo-Nazis over the past decade, the chat logs show. Militant accelerationists want to speed the collapse of society by committing destabilizing terrorist attacks and mass killings. They have frequently targeted their perceived enemies, including people of color, Muslims, Jews, gays and lesbians.\n\nTelegram gave them the ability to share tactics and targets with thousands of potential terrorists around the globe. Day after day they urged their followers to go out and kill as many people as possible to advance the white supremacist cause.\n\nBeňadik had been immersed in the extremist scene since at least 2017, bouncing from one online space to the next, a review of his online life shows. He'd spent time on Facebook, Twitter, Discord, Gab and 4chan, another low-moderation message board.\n\nBeňadik would later tell authorities that he was inspired by Christopher Cantwell, a New Hampshire white supremacist known as the \"Crying Nazi\" for posting a video of himself sobbing after learning that he might be arrested for his actions during the deadly 2017 rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. From Slovakia, Beňadik listened to Cantwell's podcast, which featured long racist diatribes and interviews with white nationalist figures like Richard Spencer.\n\nBy 2019, Beňadik had created a chat group on Telegram in which he encouraged his followers to firebomb businesses, torch the homes of antifascists and seek out radioactive material to build dirty bombs and detonate them in American cities.\n\nAlthorpe started a channel and uploaded a steady stream of violent propaganda, the Telegram chat logs show. He named his channel Terrorwave Refined.\n\n\"Direct action against the system,\" Althorpe argued in one post, is \"the ONLY path toward total aryan victory.\" Althorpe often shared detailed material that could aid in carrying out terrorist attacks, such as instructions for making the explosive thermite and plans for building assault rifles that couldn't be traced by law enforcement.\n\nOther sizable social media platforms or online forums would have detected and deleted the material posted by Althorpe and Beňadik. But on Telegram, the posts stayed up.\n\nSoon others were creating similar content. In the summer of 2019, the duo began circulating online flyers listing allied Telegram chat groups and channels. Early on the network was small, just seven accounts.\n\nBeňadik and Althorpe began calling this new community Terrorgram. The moniker stuck.\n\n\"I decided to become a fucking content producer,\" Beňadik would later say on a podcast called HateLab, which has since been deleted. \"I saw a niche and I decided to fill it.\"\n\nThey were becoming influencers.\n\nAs the pair grew their audience on Telegram, they studied a massacre that had occurred a few months earlier in New Zealand.\n\nA heavily armed man had murdered 51 Muslims at two mosques, livestreaming the carnage from a GoPro camera strapped to his ballistic helmet. To explain his motivations, Brenton Tarrant had drafted a 74-page treatise arguing that white people were being wiped out in an ongoing genocide. He described the Muslim worshippers he murdered as \"invaders\" and invoked a conspiracy theory claiming they were part of a plot to replace people of European ancestry with nonwhite people.\n\nTarrant's slaughter had sent a surge of fear through New Zealand society. And his written and visual propaganda, which was aimed at inspiring more violence, had spread widely. Researchers would later discover that more than 12,000 copies of the video had been posted online in the 24 hours after the massacre.\n\nWithin the Terrorgram community, Tarrant became an icon.\n\nOn Telegram, Beňadik and Althorpe dubbed him a \"saint\" - an honorific they bestowed on someone who killed in the name of the white supremacist movement.\n\nThe two men saw Tarrant's crime as a template for future attacks. Over and over, the duo encouraged their subscribers to follow Tarrant's example and become the next saint.\n\nFor extremism researchers, the rise of the Terrorgram community was alarming. \"Neo-Nazis, white nationalists and antigovernment extremists are publishing volumes of propaganda advocating terrorism and mass shootings on Telegram,\" warned an investigator with the Southern Poverty Law Center in June 2019. The investigator said he was unable to even reach anyone at Telegram at the time to discuss the matter.\n\nBy August 2019, the Terrorgram network had grown to nearly 20 chat groups and channels. The Terrorwave Refined channel had ballooned to over 2,000 subscribers. \"Thanks to everyone who helped us hit 2,000!\" wrote Althorpe in a post. \"HAIL THE SAINTS. HAIL HOLY TERROR.\"\n\nIn addition to his chat groups, Beňadik created an array of channels to distribute propaganda and guides to weaponry and explosives. One of the most popular attracted nearly 5,000 subscribers.\n\n\"He was, I would say, a key architect behind Terrorgram,\" said Rebecca Weiner, deputy commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism at the New York Police Department. Weiner's unit spent years monitoring the Terrorgram scene and assisted the FBI in investigating cases linked to the community.\n\nWhen compared to mainstream social media, the numbers were tiny. But looked at a different way, they were stunning: Althorpe and Beňadik had built an online community of thousands of people dedicated to celebrating and committing acts of terrorism.\n\nOne of them was Jarrett Smith, a U.S. Army private based at Fort Riley in Kansas who was a regular in Beňadik's chat group during the fall of 2019.\n\nA beefy guy who enjoyed posting photos of himself in military gear, Smith had a love of explosives - he urged his fellow Terrorgrammers to bomb electric power stations, cell towers and natural gas lines - and contempt for federal law enforcement agents. \"Feds deserve to be shot. They are the enemy,\" he wrote in one chat thread.\n\nDays after making the post, Smith unknowingly began communicating with a federal agent who was posing as an extremist.\n\nIn a string of direct messages, the undercover agent asked for Smith's help in assassinating government officials in Texas. \"Got a liberal texas mayor in my sights!\" wrote the agent.\n\nHappy to oblige, Smith provided the agent with a detailed step-by-step guide to building a potent improvised explosive device capable of destroying a car, as well as how-tos for several other types of bombs.\n\nHe was arrested that September and later pleaded guilty to charges that he shared instructions for making bombs and homemade napalm. Smith was sentenced to 30 months in prison.\n\nThe Terrorgram community was becoming a significant concern for law enforcement.\n\nAn October 2019 intelligence bulletin noted: \"Telegram has become increasingly popular with WSEs\" - white supremacist extremists - \"due to frequent suspensions and censorship of their accounts across multiple social media platforms. Currently, WSEs are able to maintain relatively extensive networks of public channels some of which have thousands of members with minimal disruptions.\"\n\nThe bulletin was produced by the Central Florida Intelligence Exchange, an intelligence-sharing center staffed by federal, state and local law enforcement personnel. Today, that five-page document - which was not meant for public dissemination - seems prescient.\n\nIt noted that while jihadist organizations and white supremacists were posting similar content on the platform, Telegram was treating the two camps in \"vastly different\" ways. The company, which had been headquartered in the United Arab Emirates since 2017, routinely shut down accounts created by the Islamic State group but it would \"rarely remove WSE content, and typically only for high-profile accounts or posts that have received extensive media attention.\"\n\nBy 2020, a pattern emerged: When Telegram did take down an account, it was often quickly replaced by a new one - sometimes with a near-identical name.\n\nWhen the company deleted Althorpe's Terrorwave Refined channel, he simply started a new one called Terrorwave Revived and began posting the same material. Within seven hours, he had attracted 1,000 followers, according to a post he wrote at the time.\n\nThe Terrorgrammers saw the modest attempts at content moderation as a betrayal by Pavel Durov and Telegram. \"You could do anything on 2019 Telegram,\" wrote Beňadik in a 2021 post. \"I told people how to plan a genocide,\" he said, noting that the company did nothing about those posts.\n\nApple, Google and Microsoft distribute the Telegram app through their respective online stores, giving them a measure of control over what their users could see on the platform. As the Terrorgram community attracted more notice from the outside world, including extremism researchers and law enforcement, these tech giants began restricting certain Terrorgram chats and channels, making them impossible to view.\n\nStill, the Terrorgrammers found ways to evade the blackouts and shared the work-arounds with their followers. The network eventually grew to include hundreds of chats and channels.\n\nThe Center for Monitoring, Analysis and Strategy, a German organization that studies online extremism, \"has tracked about 400 channels and 200 group chats which are considered part of the Terrorgram community on Telegram,\" said Jennefer Harper, a researcher with the center.\n\nAs the content spread, so did crime. Using court records, news clips and Telegram data collected by Open Measures, a research platform that monitors social media, ProPublica and FRONTLINE identified a string of crimes tied to Terrorgram.\n\nNicholas Welker, who was active in the Terrorgram community, is serving a 44-month prison sentence for making death threats toward a Brooklyn-based journalist reporting on a neo-Nazi group.\n\nA Missouri man who planned to blow up a hospital with a vehicle bomb was killed during a shootout with FBI agents in 2020; his neo-Nazi organization had posted in Beňadik's chat group and was using it to enlist new members.\n\nThe most deadly known crime stemming from Terrorgram occurred in 2022 Brazil, where a teenager who was allegedly in contact with Humber shot 15 people, killing four. The teen was later hailed as a saint by the Terrorgrammers.\n\nWhile Terrorgram started as a loose collection of chats and channels, by 2021 Althorpe and Beňadik had created a more formal organization, according to Canadian court records and interviews with law enforcement sources in Slovakia. Their small, clandestine group was the Terrorgram Collective.\n\nThe organization began producing more sophisticated content - books, videos and a roster of alleged assassination targets - and distributing the material to thousands of followers.\n\nCourt documents, a U.S. State Department bulletin and Telegram logs show that over the next three years, the collective would come to include at least six other people in five countries.\n\nOver 14 months, the group generated three books and repeatedly posted them in PDF form on Terrorgram accounts. Ranging in length from 136 to 268 pages, the books offer a raft of specific advice for planning a terror attack, including how to sabotage railroads, electrical substations and other critical infrastructure. The publications also celebrated a pantheon of white supremacist saints - mass murderers including Timothy McVeigh, who in 1995 bombed a federal building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people.\n\n\"That combination of tactical guidance plus propaganda is something that we'd seen a lot of coming out of ISIS in years past,\" said Weiner of the NYPD. She added that the books are filled with \"splashy graphics\" designed to appeal to young people.\n\n\"It's a real manual on how to commit an act of terrorism,\" Jakub Gajdoš, who helped oversee an investigation of Beňadik and Terrorgram for Slovakia's federal police agency, said of one book. \"A guide for killing people.\"\n\nAt least two Americans were involved in creating one of the books, according to U.S. federal prosecutors: Humber and Allison, the DJ from Boise, Idaho. The chat logs show they were both prolific creators and influencers in the Terrorgram community who frenetically generated new content, including videos, audiobooks, graphics and calendars, which they posted on an array of channels.\n\nAllison made around 120 Terrorgram videos, including editing \"White Terror,\" a quasi-documentary glorifying more than 100 white murderers and terrorists. Narrated by Humber, the video starts with the man who assassinated Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 and concludes with the young man who shot and killed 10 Black shoppers in a Buffalo supermarket in 2022.\n\nThese \"white men and women of action have taken it upon themselves to wage war against the system and our racial enemies,\" Humber intones. \"To the saints of tomorrow watching this today, know that when you succeed you will be celebrated with reverence and your sacrifice will not be in vain.\"\n\nThe pair also allegedly helped create \"The List,\" a detailed hit list of American politicians, corporate executives, academics and others, according to court documents. The List was shared on a series of dedicated Telegram channels, as well as an array of other accounts, some made to look like legitimate news aggregators. Each entry included a photo of the target and their home address.\n\nIt was an escalation - and from court documents it's clear that The List captured the attention of U.S. law enforcement agents, who worried that it might trigger a wave of assassinations.\n\nThe collective's books influenced a new generation of armed extremists, some of them in their teens.\n\nOne of these young disciples was Juraj Krajčík. The Slovakian student had joined Beňadik's chat groups at the age of 16 and had become a frequent poster.\n\nProPublica and FRONTLINE obtained an extensive trove of Terrorgram chat logs that show how Beňadik mentored Krajčík and played a profound role in shaping his beliefs. Over the span of three years, Beňadik, Allison and Humber all urged the teen to take action, the chat logs show.\n\nOn the night of Oct. 12, 2022, Krajčík, armed with a handgun, opened fire on three people outside of Tepláreň, a small LGBTQ+ bar in Bratislava's Old Town neighborhood, killing Juraj Vankulič and Matúš Horváth and wounding their friend Radka Trokšiarová.\n\n\"I was in terrible pain because the bullet went through my thighbone,\" she recalled. \"I am still in pain.\"\n\nKrajčík took off on foot, and hours later he killed himself in a grove of trees next to a busy roadway. He was 19.\n\nSix thousand miles away in California, Humber promptly began making celebratory posts. Krajčík, she exclaimed, had achieved sainthood.\n\nShortly after the Bratislava attack, Humber messaged Allison on Telegram, according to court records recently filed by federal prosecutors in the U.S.\n\nShe told him she'd been communicating with another Terrorgrammer who was planning a racially motivated school shooting.The attack occurred weeks later in Aracruz, Brazil, when a 16-year-old wearing a skull mask shot 15 people at two schools, killing four. Another saint.\n\nOn a Terrogram channel, Humber posted a ZIP file with info on the attack, including 17 photos and four videos. The massacre, she noted, was motivated by \"Hatred of non-Whites.\" And she made a pitch tailored for the next would-be teenage terrorist: The assailant, she wrote in a post, would get a \"SLAP ON THE WRIST\" prison sentence due to his age.\n\nWhile Krajčík was planning his attack, law enforcement agencies in Europe, the U.S. and Canada were quietly pursuing the leaders of the Terrorgram Collective.\n\nBeňadik was the first to fall. Using information collected by the FBI, investigators in Slovakia arrested him in May 2022 while he was on break from college. He'd been studying computer science at the Brno University of Technology in the Czech Republic.\n\nWhile in jail, Beňadik admitted his involvement with Terrorgram. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six years in prison shortly after the Tepláreň attacks.\n\nDescribing Beňadik as \"extremely intelligent,\" prosecutor Peter Kysel said he believes the student never met with any of his fellow Terrorgrammers in person and didn't even know their real names. \"All the contacts was in the cyberspace,\" he said.\n\nBut Beňadik misled investigators about his connection to Krajčík, saying they had one brief interaction, via direct message. \"This was the only communication,\" said Daniel Lipšic, the prosecutor who investigated the Tepláreň attack.\n\nIn fact, Beňadik and Krajčík had many conversations, the logs obtained by ProPublica and FRONTLINE show. The pair repeatedly discussed targeting Tepláreň, with the older man writing that killing the bar patrons with a nail bomb wasn't brutal enough. Krajčík posted frequently about his animus toward gays and lesbians, which Beňadik encouraged.\n\nAlleged Terrorgram Collective co-founder Althorpe is also in custody. Canadian prosecutors have accused him of helping to produce the Terrorgram Collective publications, through which they say he \"promoted genocide\" and \"knowingly instructed\" others to carry out \"terrorist activity.\"\n\nAt the time of his arrest, Althorpe was running a small company selling components for semi-automatic rifles such as AK-47s and AR-15s. He has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial.\n\nIn the U.S., Humber and Allison are facing trial on charges including soliciting people to kill government officials through The List, distributing bomb-making instructions and providing material support to terrorists. Prosecutors say the two have been involved with the Terrorgram community since 2019.\n\nThe 37-page indictment says they incited the attack on Tepláreň, noting that Krajčík \"had frequent conversations with HUMBER, ALLISON, and other members of the Terrorgram Collective\" before carrying out the crime.\n\nIn a jailhouse interview that Allison gave against his lawyer's advice, he admitted he produced content for the collective, including editing the \"White Terror\" video. Still, Allison insisted he never incited others to commit crimes and claimed The List wasn't meant to be a guide for assassins. He said it was merely an exercise in doxxing, similar to how right-wing activists are outed by anti-fascist activists.\n\nAll of his Telegram posts are protected under the First Amendment, according to a motion filed by his lawyers. They argue that while he was active in Telegram chats and channels, there is nothing in the government's evidence to support the claim that he was a Terrorgram leader. \"The chats are mostly a chaotic mix of hyperbole and posts without any recognized leader,\" his lawyers wrote in the motion.\n\nLooking pale and grim, Humber declined to be interviewed when ProPublica and FRONTLINE visited the Sacramento County Jail. Her attorney declined to comment on the case.\n\nDuring the last days of the Biden administration, in January 2025, the State Department officially designated the Terrorgram Collective a global terrorist organization, hitting three more collective leaders in South Africa, Croatia and Brazil with sanctions. In February, Australia announced its own sanctions on Terrorgram, the first time that country's government has imposed counterterrorism financing sanctions on an organization that is entirely based online.\n\n\"The group has been majorly impacted in terms of its activity. We've seen many chats being voluntarily closed as people feel at risk of legal action, and we've seen generally the amount of discourse really reducing,\" said Milo Comerford, an extremism expert at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a London-based nonprofit that tracks hate groups and disinformation. The \"organizational capabilities of the Terrorgram Collective itself have been severely undermined.\"\n\nThe demise of Terrorgram has coincided with reforms announced at Telegram in the wake of one co-founder's arrest last year in France. Pavel Durov is charged with allowing criminal activity, including drug trafficking and child sexual abuse, to flourish on his platform. He has called the charges \"misguided,\" saying CEOs should not be held liable for the misuse of their platforms. He was ordered to remain in France during the ongoing investigation, and, depending on the outcome, could face trial next year.\n\nIn a statement, the company said, \"Mr. Durov firmly denies all allegations.\"\n\nThe company said it has always complied with the European Union's laws. \"It is absurd to suggest that Telegram's owner is responsible for the actions of a negligible fraction (<0.01%) of its 950M+ active users.\"\n\nStill, after the arrest, the company announced a slew of reforms designed to make Telegram safer. It promised to police illegal content on the platform and share the IP addresses and phone numbers of alleged lawbreakers with authorities.\n\nIn response, white supremacists began to flee the platform.\n\nPete Simi, a sociology professor who studies extremism at Chapman University in Orange, California, said the incendiary ideas promoting race war and violence that animated the Terrorgram Collective will migrate to other platforms. \"Especially given the broader climate that exists within our society,\" Simi said. \"There will be new Terrorgrams that take its place by another name, and we will continue to see this kind of extremism propagated through platforms of various sorts, not just Telegram.\"\n\nToday, many extremists are gathering on X, where owner Elon Musk has loosened content restrictions. White supremacists frequently post a popular Terrorgram slogan about killing all Black people. There are several Brenton Tarrant fan accounts, and some racist and antisemitic influencers who were previously banned now have hundreds of thousands of followers.\n\nA review by ProPublica and FRONTLINE shows the company is removing some violent white supremacist content and suspending some extremist accounts. It also restricts the visibility of some racist and hateful posts by excluding them from search results or by adding a note to the post saying it violates X's rules of community conduct. And we were unable to find posts on the platform that shared the bomb-making and terrorism manuals that had previously appeared on Telegram. The news organizations reached out to X multiple times but got no response.\n\nIn early March, a person who had a history of posting Nazi imagery shared a 21-second video lionizing Juraj Krajčík. The clip shows one of his victims lying dead on the pavement.\n\nTom Jennings, Annie Wong, Karina Meier and Max Maldonado of FRONTLINE, and Lukáš Diko of the Investigative Center of Jan Kuciak contributed reporting.\n\nSaying the Trump administration is sabotaging civil rights enforcement by the Department of Education, a federal lawsuit filed Friday morning seeks to stop the president and Secretary Linda McMahon from carrying out the mass firing of civil rights investigators and lawyers.\n\nTwo parents and the Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, a national disability rights group, jointly filed the lawsuit. It alleges that decimating the department's Office for Civil Rights will leave the agency unable to handle the public's complaints of discrimination at school. That, they said, would violate the equal protection clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe complaint comes three days after the Education Department notified about 1,300 employees - including the entire staff in seven of the 12 regional civil rights offices - that they are being fired, and the day after a group of 21 Democratic attorneys general sued McMahon and the president. That lawsuit alleges the Trump administration does not have the authority to circumvent Congress to effectively shutter the department.\n\nThe complaint filed on Friday argues that the \"OCR has abdicated its responsibility to enforce civil rights protections\" and that the administration has made a \"decision to sabotage\" the Education Department's civil rights functions. That, the lawsuit alleges, overrides Congress' authority. It names the Education Department, McMahon and the acting head of OCR, Craig Trainor.\n\n\"Through a series of press releases, policy statements, and executive orders, the administration has made clear its contempt for the civil rights of marginalized students,\" the lawsuit says.\n\nThe parents' lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. It asks the court to declare the \"decimation\" of the OCR unlawful and seeks an injunction to compel the office to \"process OCR complaints promptly and equitably.\"\n\nA Department of Education spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But the department has said it would still meet its legal obligations.\n\nThe lawsuit brought by the attorneys general was filed in federal court in Massachusetts. It alleges the firings are \"so severe and extreme that it incapacitates components of the Department responsible for performing functions mandated by statute.\" It cites the closing of the seven regional OCR outposts as an example.\n\nEach year, the OCR investigates thousands of allegations of discrimination in schools based on disability, race and gender and is one of the federal government's largest civil rights units. At last count there were about 550 OCR employees; at least 243 union-represented employees were laid off Tuesday.\n\nThe administration plans to close OCR locations in Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, New York, Philadelphia and San Francisco. Offices will remain in Atlanta, Denver, Kansas City, Seattle and Washington, D.C.\n\nThe lawsuit brought by the parents and advocacy group reveals concerns by students and families who have pending complaints that, under President Donald Trump, are not being investigated. There also are concerns that new complaints won't get investigated if they don't fall under one of the president's priorities: curbing antisemitism, ending participation of transgender athletes in women's sports and combating alleged discrimination against white students.\n\nAfter Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20, the administration implemented a monthlong freeze on the agency's civil rights work. Although OCR investigators were prohibited from working on their assigned discrimination cases, the Trump administration launched a new \"End DEI Portal\" meant only to collect complaints about diversity, equity and inclusion in schools. It has said it is trying to shrink the size of government, including the Education Department, which Trump has called a \"big con job.\"\n\nTrump's actions so far have led many to wonder \"if there is a real and meaningful complaint investigation process existing at the moment,\" said Johnathan Smith, an attorney at the National Center for Youth Law, which represents the plaintiffs. Smith is a former deputy assistant attorney general in the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division.\n\n\"They are putting the thumb on the scale of who the winners and losers are before they do the investigation, and that is deeply problematic from a law enforcement perspective,\" Smith said.\n\nThe lawsuit is perhaps the most substantive legal effort to require the Education Department to enforce civil rights since 1970, when the NAACP sued the agency for allowing segregation to continue. That lawsuit resulted in repeated overhauling of the OCR and 20 years of judicial oversight, with the goal of ensuring that the division fairly investigated and enforced discrimination claims.\n\nStudents and families turn to the OCR after they feel their concerns have not been addressed by their schools or colleges. Both individuals named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit are parents of students whose civil rights complaints were being investigated - until Trump took office.\n\nOne of the plaintiffs, Alabama parent Nikki S. Carter, has three students and is an advocate for students with disabilities in her community. Carter is Black. According to the lawsuit, Carter filed a complaint with OCR in 2022 alleging discrimination on the basis of race after her children's school district, the Demopolis City Schools, twice banned Carter from school district property.\n\nWhen reached by ProPublica, the district superintendent said he's not aware of the lawsuit or the civil rights complaint and could not comment; he is new to the district.\n\nThe district has said it barred Carter after a confrontation with a white staff member. But Carter has said that a white parent who had a similar confrontation wasn't banned, leading her to believe that the district punished her because of her advocacy. She said it prevented her from attending parent-teacher conferences and other school events.\n\nThe other parent, identified by the initials A.W., filed a complaint with OCR alleging their child's school failed to respond properly to sexual assault and harassment by a classmate.\n\nInvestigations of both families' discrimination complaints have stopped under the new OCR leadership, according to the lawsuit.\n\nWhen President Donald Trump announced his marquee government cost-cutting initiative, he left no doubt about whom he intended to run it: Elon Musk. Still, questions about the scope of Musk's authority have hounded the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency ever since.\n\nAs DOGE began to order massive budget cuts and layoffs, and those affected by the moves began to raise questions in the press and in court about their legality, administration officials equivocated on Musk's exact role, asserting he was simply a senior adviser to the president and had no official position in DOGE.\n\nFive weeks after its creation and under pressure from a growing cascade of lawsuits, the White House revealed in late February that an obscure bureaucrat named Amy Gleason had been acting as DOGE's administrator since nearly day one.\n\nHowever, ProPublica has found that she does not appear to be running the budget-slashing group, according to interviews with six current and former government officials. All spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of losing their jobs.\n\n\"I get the sense that Amy is in the role of scapegoat,\" said one source who had been in meetings with Gleason.\n\nThe exact chain of command at DOGE is not clear to most federal employees who brush up against the team. But sources told ProPublica that longtime Musk lieutenant Steve Davis, a former executive of Musk's Boring Company and SpaceX, appears to be administering day-to-day operations. And at times, Musk himself issues commands from inside the Secretary of War Suite in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, next to the White House, said a person familiar with the matter.\n\n\"I don't know who Amy Gleason even is,\" said one person who's worked closely with DOGE's leadership in a federal agency. \"Davis runs the show.\"\n\nMusk, Davis and Gleason did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSince DOGE was created by executive order on Jan. 20, the Trump administration has gone to great lengths to put legal distance between Musk and the entity, saying he is neither an employee nor its head. And even though the order creates the role of an administrator - someone to coordinate with the White House and help place DOGE teams inside agencies - the Trump administration deflected questions about who was in that position for over a month.\n\nThe arrangement has confounded judges overseeing challenges to DOGE's authority. \"The whole operation, it raises questions,\" remarked U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang, adding that the lack of clarity was \"highly suspicious.\"\n\nThis setup could make it more difficult to prove that Musk has violated conflicts of interests laws, which generally bar federal employees from getting involved in government matters that impact their own business interests.\n\nBy denying that Musk is the legal DOGE administrator \"it gets him more removed, and it could make it harder to prove a violation,\" said Richard Painter, a former top ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News, Musk dismissed concerns about conflicts, saying, \"I'll recuse myself\" if issues arise.\n\nThe announcement that placed Gleason in between Musk and DOGE's daily operations appeared haphazard: Gleason was on vacation in Mexico when Trump's press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, named her as acting administrator to a group of reporters in Washington. Gleason told colleagues the White House had not coordinated the announcement with her.\n\nOther parts of the rollout were equally perplexing: Leavitt asserted Gleason had been the administrator since nearly its inception - but colleagues said Gleason only began running staff meetings about a month into the administration with a small group of career technologists that predated the Trump administration.\n\nMeanwhile, Gleason told her former colleagues back in Nashville, Tennessee - where she recently worked as a health technology executive - she was planning on returning there in a few short months.\n\nOne government worker who has been in meetings with Gleason described her as \"someone with little to no actual decision-making\" responsibilities.\n\nShe revealed as much to colleagues in meetings in recent weeks, where she made clear she was not deeply involved in the DOGE budget cutting that has put humanitarian programs in peril and forced thousands of employees out of work, sources who were in those meetings told ProPublica.\n\nOne reason it's so difficult to pin down who is in charge of DOGE: It contains two separate teams that are almost entirely walled-off from each other.\n\nIn forming DOGE, Trump folded the entity into the existing U.S. Digital Service, a small unit of tech experts housed within the White House focused on improving government software platforms. While DOGE, on paper, has a similar mission, the actual work of Musk's group has been far more expansive, such as cutting funding to programs and gaining access to sensitive agency data systems, as ProPublica and other media have reported.\n\nIn recent weeks, many holdover digital service workers have resigned or been laid off, and only a small group of a few dozen federal technologists remain. Gleason is only in charge of this smaller group, the sources said.\n\nOfficials who worked with Gleason, who served in the Digital Service during the prior Trump and Biden administrations, spoke highly of her dedication to the mission. One noted she helped upgrade health care technology across government, such as digitizing COVID-19 test results during the pandemic.\n\n\"My sense of her initial expectations was that USDS was going to have a synergy with DOGE ... while also making government work better,\" a former colleague said. \"She was not expecting DOGE to come in and dismantle USDS.\"\n\nThe secrecy surrounding Gleason's appointment extends to all of DOGE. The Trump administration has offered scant information about its employees - except when compelled by lawsuits. In an effort to gain a clearer understanding of how the group operates, ProPublica has spent weeks identifying and profiling its staff.\n\nAmong them are engineers, lawyers, technology executives and consultants. Many were recruited from Musk's businesses, including SpaceX, Tesla and Neuralink, or from firms owned by his business associates. Today ProPublica is adding 20 names to our running list, bringing the total to 66. None have responded to requests for comment.\n\nSome have been enlisted to oversee cuts at the very agencies that conducted oversight of the industries where they'd previously worked.\n\nDOGE assigned Tyler Hassen, an energy industry executive, to the Department of the Interior. Scott Langmack and Michael Alexander Mirski - two executives from real estate firms - have been seen at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. And former Tesla lawyer Daniel Abrahamson has worked for DOGE at the Department of Transportation - an agency reportedly in the midst of several investigations over the safety of Teslas. Tesla has defended the safety of its vehicles.\n\nNone of the DOGE staffers replied to requests for comment. The Interior Department said it doesn't comment on personnel, adding that there were no \"DOGE staffers\" at the agency, and the Transportation Department did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThree of the names ProPublica is adding to our tracker are engineers from Musk's SpaceX who have been issued ethics waivers by Trump administration lawyers to do work that could potentially benefit one of Musk's companies. SpaceX, which includes internet satellite service Starlink, and Verizon are reportedly competing for control of a $2.4 billion Federal Aviation Administration contract, according to The Washington Post.\n\nSpaceX responded to that reporting in a post on X. \"Recent media reports about SpaceX and the FAA are false,\" it wrote. \"There is no effort or intent for Starlink to 'take over' any existing contract.\" The FAA did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nPublicly, Musk continues to champion DOGE's mission. \"The people voted for major government reform,\" he said, \"and that's what the people are going to get.\"\n\nby Christopher Bing, Avi Asher-Schapiro and Annie Waldman\n\nKirsten Berg , Al Shaw and Andy Kroll contributed reporting.\n\nIf you ask a National Park Service ranger how the Trump administration's cost cutting will affect your next park visit, you might get talking points instead of a straight answer.\n\nA series of emails sent late last month to front-line staff at parks across the country provided rangers with instructions on how to describe the highly publicized staff cuts. Park leaders further instructed staff to avoid the word \"fired\" and not blame closures on staffing levels.\n\nOn Feb. 14, at least 1,000 park service employees were terminated as part of broad reductions to the federal workforce by the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency . As a result, visitor centers have reduced hours, tours of popular attractions have been canceled, lines have spiraled , bathrooms may go uncleaned , habitat restoration has ceased and water has gone unchecked for toxic algae .\n\nMeanwhile, rangers have been ordered to describe these cuts - or \"attrition\" and \"workforce management actions,\" according to the talking points - as \"prioritizing fiscal responsibility\" and \"staffing to meet the evolving needs of our visitors.\" They also should tell visitors the parks will continue to ensure \"memorable and meaningful experiences for all.\"\n\nIf asked about limited offerings, one park's rangers were instructed to say \"we are not able to address park or program-level impacts at this time.\"\n\nThe guidance mirrors other measures instituted by the Trump administration to dictate how federal employees communicate with the public. This month, employees at the National Cancer Institute were told they needed approval for any communication dealing with 23 \"controversial, high profile, or sensitive\" issues, including peanut allergies and autism. Agencies across the federal government have begun compiling lists of words to avoid because they could conflict with Trump's ban on diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, The New York Times has reported.\n\nThe guidance handed down to park employees puts rangers in a particularly difficult position, said Emily Douce, deputy vice president of government affairs at the National Parks Conservation Association, an advocacy organization for the parks. Rangers pride themselves on knowledge of their parks and their responsibility to accurately educate the public about the habitats, wildlife and geology of those special places.\n\n\"They shouldn't be muzzled to not talk about the impacts of what these cuts mean,\" Douce said. \"If they are asked, they should be truthful on how federal dollars are being used or taken away.\"\n\nAn NPS spokesperson said in an emailed statement that any assertion that park staff are being \"silenced is flat-out wrong\" and that talking points are a \"basic tool\" to \"ensure consistent communication with the public.\"\n\n\"The National Park Service is fully committed to responsible stewardship of our public lands and enhancing visitor experiences - we will not be distracted by sensationalized attacks designed to undermine that mission,\" the statement said.\n\nThe spokesperson also criticized park staff who spoke with a ProPublica reporter. \"Millions of hardworking Americans deal with workplace challenges every day without resorting to politically motivated leaks,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nOne park ranger, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, said the talking points prevent rangers from telling the public the truth. Some employees have delivered the statements in an exaggerated \"monotone\" to convey to visitors they are toeing the company line but there's more to the story, the ranger said.\n\n\"We have a duty to tell the public what's going on,\" the ranger said. \"If that's saying, 'We just don't have the staff to stay open and that's what these firings are doing,' I think the people have a right to know. Every person we lose hurts.\"\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the firings, parks quickly closed visitor centers, ended tours and altered other services. Some parks were clear on social media that the staffing cuts had resulted in the closures. But recently parks have been more vague in discussing the impact and not offered explanations for particular closures.\n\nThe administration has reinstated about 50 NPS employees and announced it will proceed with the hiring of seasonal employees, a workforce that is essential to park operations during the busy summer season. The hiring process, however, has been delayed, which may lead to operation disruptions. And more cuts are likely coming. The Hill recently reported that the administration is considering a 30% payroll reduction for the NPS.\n\nThe cuts come as the parks are seeing increases in visitation, which hit a record in 2024 for the first time since 2016. Although the new data was released on the park service's website last week, the administration didn't publicize that milestone with a news release as it has in the past. The terminations also come amid staffing shortages across the service.\n\nAviva O'Neil, executive director of the Great Basin National Park Foundation, a nonprofit organization that supports a small park in a remote corner of Nevada, bristled at the idea put forth in the talking points that parks can continue to provide the same level of \"memorable experiences\" with the cuts. When the park lost five of its 26 permanent employees in February, it was forced to close tours of a signature attraction, Lehman Caves. To help restore services, the foundation raised the money to temporarily hire the terminated workers.\n\n\"How do they do their day-to-day operations when they don't have the staff?\" she said.\n\nSince the arrival of a team from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, Social Security is in a far more precarious place than has been widely understood, according to Leland Dudek, the acting commissioner of the Social Security Administration. \"I don't want the system to collapse,\" Dudek said in a closed-door meeting last week, according to a recording obtained by ProPublica. He also said that it \"would be catastrophic for the people in our country\" if DOGE were to make changes at his agency that were as sweeping as those at USAID , the Treasury Department and elsewhere.\n\nDudek's comments, delivered to a group of senior staff and Social Security advocates attending both in person and virtually, offer an extraordinary window into the thinking of a top agency official in the volatile early days of the second Trump administration. The Washington Post first reported Dudek's acknowledgement that DOGE is calling the shots at Social Security and quoted several of his statements. But the full recording reveals that he went much further, citing not only the actions being taken at the agency by the people he repeatedly called \"the DOGE kids,\" but also extensive input he has received from the White House itself. When a participant in the meeting asked him why he wouldn't more forcefully call out President Donald Trump's continued false claims about widespread Social Security fraud as \"BS,\" Dudek answered, \"So we published, for the record, what was actually the numbers there on our website. This is dealing with - have you ever worked with someone who's manic-depressive?\"\n\nThroughout the meeting, Dudek made alarming statements about the perils facing the Social Security system, but he did so in an oddly informal, discursive manner. It left several participants baffled as to the ultimate fate of the nation's largest and most popular social program, one that serves 73 million Americans. \"Are we going to break something?\" Dudek asked at one point, referring to what DOGE has been doing with Social Security data. \"I don't know.\"\n\nBut then he said, in a more reassuring tone: \"They're learning. Let people learn. They're going to make mistakes.\"\n\nDudek embodies the dramatic whipsawing of life as a public servant under DOGE. For 25 years, he was the ultimate faceless bureaucrat: a midlevel analyst who had bounced between federal agencies, ultimately landing at the Social Security Administration and focusing on information technology, cybersecurity and fraud prevention. He was largely unknown even within the agency. But in February, he suddenly vaulted into the public eye when he was put on leave for surreptitiously sharing information with DOGE. It appeared that he might lose his job, but then he was unexpectedly promoted by the Trump administration to the position of acting commissioner. At the time, he seemed unreservedly committed to the DOGE agenda, writing - then deleting - a bellicose LinkedIn post in which he expressed pride in having \"bullied agency executives, shared executive contact information, and circumvented the chain of command to connect DOGE with the people who get stuff done.\"\n\nNow, only weeks into his tenure, he was taking a far more ambivalent posture toward not just DOGE but Trump. On multiple occasions during last week's meeting, according to the recording, Dudek framed the choices that he has been making in recent weeks as \"the president's\" agenda. These choices have included planned cuts of at least 7,000 Social Security employees; buyouts and early retirement offered to the entire staff of 57,000, including those who work in field offices and teleservice centers helping elderly and disabled people navigate the program ; cuts to disability determination services ; the dissolution of a team that had been working to improve the user experience of the ssa.gov website and application process; a reduction of the agency's footprint across the country from 10 regional offices to four; the terminations of 64 leases, including those for some field office and hearing office space; proposals to outsource Social Security customer service; and more.\n\n\"I work for the president. I need to do what the president tells me to do,\" Dudek said, according to the recording. \"I've had to make some tough choices, choices I didn't agree with, but the president wanted it and I did it,\" he added later. (He didn't name specific actions that Trump did or did not direct.)\n\nAt still another point, Dudek said that \"I don't want to fire anyone\" but that \"a lot of the structural changes that you've seen me make at headquarters, I've had long conversations with the White House about, and the DOGE team. ... And that's not to say I don't have some more hard choices to come. The president has an agenda. I'm a political appointee. I need to follow that agenda.\"\n\nDudek also more than once dismissed Trump's claims about Social Security fraud, which the president amplified just hours after Dudek's meeting in a speech to Congress in which he implied that millions of probably-dead people over the age of 100 are receiving Social Security benefits. There are indeed 110-year-old and older people in one of the Social Security databases that the DOGE team has been looking at, Dudek said, but those people are \"not in pay status\" - they're not actually being paid benefits. \"These are records we never bothered with,\" he explained.\n\nStill, Dudek and two of his deputies, who also spoke intermittently at the meeting, seemed hesitant to more publicly resist Trump's misstatements. A spokesperson chimed in to say that they were proud of a recent press release in which, in mild language, they'd obliquely contradicted some of the false claims. The other official said that DOGE's narrative about dead people receiving benefits \"got in front of us\" but that \"it's a victory that you're not seeing more [misinformation], because they are being educated.\"\n\nSpokespersons for Dudek and the Social Security Administration, the White House and Elon Musk did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nDudek's remarks come at a time when many Social Security employees are feeling confused about Dudek, his role versus DOGE's and what it all means for the future of the Social Security Administration, according to ProPublica's conversations with more than two dozen agency staffers. Many said that because the recent cuts at the agency have been carried out in a piecemeal fashion, the public doesn't seem to be grasping the totality of what is happening to the program, which is having its 90th anniversary this year.\n\nThe layoffs - and the looming specter of potentially thousands more employees taking a buyout by a Friday deadline - have meant even less attention to the complicated casework of low-income elderly people and people with physical and intellectual disabilities, as ProPublica has reported .\n\nMeanwhile, DOGE, which Musk has portrayed as a squad of techno-efficiency geniuses, has actually undermined the efficiency of Social Security's delivery of services in multiple ways, many employees said. Under DOGE, several Social Security IT contracts have been canceled or scaled back. Now, five employees told ProPublica, their tech systems seem to be crashing nearly every day, leading to more delays in serving beneficiaries. This was already a problem, they said, but it has gotten \"much worse\" and is \"not the norm,\" two employees said.\n\nAnd under a policy that DOGE has applied at many agencies , front-line Social Security staff have been restricted from using their government purchase cards for any sum above $1. This has become a significant problem at some field offices, especially when workers need to obtain or make copies of vital records or original documents - birth certificates and the like - that are needed to process some Social Security claims, one management-level employee said.\n\n\"Elections have consequences,\" Dudek wrote in a March 1 email to the agency's staff.\n\nIn the meeting last week, Dudek was asked about many of these organizational changes, according to the recording. Regarding the closure and consolidation of regional offices as well as the cuts to the part of the agency that helps evaluate disability claims, which is already severely backlogged, he said: \"It certainly was done at the administration level. That would have not been my first preference. I think we need to see what's going to happen in terms of fallout.\"\n\n\"Again,\" he said, \"I work for the president. DOGE is part of that.\"\n\nDudek, who had been scheduled to speak for only 15 minutes, according to a copy of the agenda, instead spoke for around an hour, talking about everything from his upbringing by a disabled mother who'd depended on Social Security, to a 1989 book titled \"Bureaucracy\" that mentions Trump. He continued to vacillate between sharing advocates' concerns for vulnerable Social Security recipients and sticking up for some of what DOGE has been trying to do at his agency.\n\n\"I actually like having the kids around,\" he said, adding that although they were unfamiliar with the \"nuances\" of Social Security, he was trying to get them to be more thoughtful. \"They're thinking about work differently.\"\n\nHe confirmed that the DOGE team members had broad access to Americans' Social Security numbers and other personal data, but he claimed that if they were to do anything illegal with that information, he'd have them investigated and potentially prosecuted. He said he wanted to bulk up resources for field offices and customer service, even as front-line workers received buyout offers just like other staffers.\n\nThroughout, Dudek emphasized that he wanted constructive feedback and open conversation, because he cares deeply about the Social Security Administration and the people it serves. He was honest about his shortcomings: \"I'm in a role that I did not expect to be in,\" he said. \"I am an IT guy and a fraud guy.\"\n\nDudek will eventually be replaced by Frank Bisignano, Trump's long-term pick to run the Social Security Administration. At times, Dudek sounded fatalistic.\n\n\"I'm the villain,\" he said in the recording. \"I'm not going to have a job after this. I get it.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has shut down a unit of the Department of Veterans Affairs created under President Joe Biden to address disparities in how the federal government provides disability compensation to military service members.\n\nThe closure of the Veterans Benefits Administration's Office of Equity Assurance effectively hobbles internal efforts at the VA to investigate and eliminate long-standing racial inequities the department itself has acknowledged.\n\nThe office was eliminated as part of the Trump administration's purge of programs broadly aimed at addressing diversity, equity or inclusion, according to emails obtained by ProPublica. But several VA sources said that the office was not exclusively focused on race, and that it takes on cases for a range of veterans to ensure no one is denied proper benefits - including for reasons of age, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation and geographic location.\n\nRep. Mark Takano, a California Democrat, criticized the Trump administration's action as \"excessive\" and \"reckless.\"\n\n\"The closure of the OEA will undoubtedly have disastrous effects on the care we offer veterans,\" Takano, former chair and now ranking member of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, said in a statement to ProPublica. \"This office was making it easier for minority veterans to access care and benefits. Its closure will directly impact the care and benefits received by minority veterans.\"\n\nRichard Brookshire, co-founder of the Black Veterans Project, a nonprofit focused on rectifying discrimination faced by Black veterans, echoed Takano's concerns.\n\n\"It's a first step toward gutting the second-largest agency in our federal government,\" he said. \"The consequences will be dire, wide-reaching and deadly.\"\n\nVA spokesperson Peter Kasperowicz declined to say whether the agency would continue to study racial disparities. But he emphasized in a statement that newly installed VA Secretary Douglas Collins \"treats all veterans and beneficiaries fairly and equally, so the Office of Equity Assurance is no longer needed.\"\n\nHe added: \"The money saved by closing the office will be redirected to improve health care, benefits and services for Veterans, all of whom we treat fairly and equally. VA will always fulfill its duty to provide veterans, families, caregivers and survivors the health care and benefits they have earned. That is a promise.\"\n\nThe VA grew significantly under the Biden administration, with tens of thousands of employees added to beef up capacity in conjunction with the passage of the PACT Act. The 2022 law expanded health care and benefits for an estimated 3.5 million veterans exposed to toxic substances from burn pits and other chemicals.\n\nThe Biden administration also created the OEA and several other initiatives to help analyze and rectify discrimination in the delivery of health care, benefits and other services. Those moves were seen as a direct response to long-standing complaints by minority veterans.\n\nThe closure of the OEA is just one of several disruptive staff cuts at the VA in recent weeks. Around 2,400 VA employees have lost their positions since the Trump administration began slashing the federal workforce, with significantly more firings to come.\n\nThe department currently employs around 470,000 workers. Kasperowicz said that the administration plans would shed nearly 15% of its workforce, dropping the total to roughly 398,000.\n\nWorkers assigned to the OEA were informed on Feb. 14 via email that their positions were terminated immediately and that the office was being \"liquidated.\" The notices were sent to nearly all of the office's employees, effectively dissolving the unit, sources familiar with the firings told ProPublica.\n\nThe administration reversed at least some of the terminations later that month, according to correspondence obtained by ProPublica. Workers who were attached to the OEA have now been placed on administrative leave pending a possible reassignment within the VA or another federal department, according to sources familiar with the department who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.\n\n\"But even if they are reassigned, it won't be to the OEA,\" said one official familiar with the moves. \"It's definitely gone.\"\n\nBlack veterans and their advocates have long complained of a divide in how claims are handled. An ongoing suit filed by the National Veterans Council for Legal Redress against the government gave the suspicions new life.\n\nThe group's case was bolstered by data unearthed through Freedom of Information Act requests from the Black Veterans Project, which found that the VA was far more likely to reject applications for service-related disabilities by Black veterans than their white counterparts.\n\nAttorneys for the federal government asked the judge overseeing the suit to dismiss the claims, stating that only the VA secretary has jurisdiction to decide disputes over award benefits and that the court lacks the jurisdiction to hear them.\n\nA 2023 U.S. Government Accountability Office report also concluded that there were disparities. It found that the department approved compensation applications for service-related disabilities like hearing loss, impaired limb movement and post-traumatic stress by Black veterans at lower rates than veterans of other races.\n\nThe report found that between 2010 and 2020 the approval rate for benefit applications made by White male veterans was 3% to 22% higher than Black male veterans for the selected medical conditions.\n\nThe OEA's demise is just one part of an ongoing rollback of the racial equity programs the Trump administration has called \"radical and wasteful.\"\n\nSince Trump entered office, a webpage detailing the VA's work to address equity and diversity appears to have been scrubbed from its website. In January, the administration fired the heads of internal advisory groups formed to address the concerns and needs of minority and female veterans.\n\nOne of those groups, the Center for Minority Veterans, worked in conjunction with the OEA to address racial disparities in disability compensation. Between 2013 and 2018, the advisory group raised its concerns over the Black veterans' lower rate of claims approval to VA leadership five times, according to the National Veterans Council for Legal Redress suit.\n\nMariela Roca, a former Republican congressional hopeful, took over as director of the advisory group last week. It's unclear what specific strategies the group will pursue to advance the needs and concerns of minority veterans under new leadership. Roca did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nReporting Highlights\n\nThese highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.\n\nOn a Monday last month, after a conservative Maine legislator expressed outrage on Facebook about a transgender girl winning a high school pole vaulting event, the hammer of the federal government began to swing.\n\nBy Friday of that week, Feb. 21, President Donald Trump singled out Maine's governor during a White House event and threatened to cut off the state's federal funding. \"See you in court,\" Gov. Janet Mills shot back.\n\nThen came a barrage of investigations and threats: The U.S. Department of Education opened inquiries into the Maine Department of Education and the student's school district , alleging they had violated federal civil rights law. The same day, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services targeted the Maine Education Department , too, as well as the state's university system.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture then launched an investigation into the university system ; and on Tuesday, the university said the USDA had halted funding as the agency investigates \"prospective\" civil rights violations, records show.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice sent a letter that \"Maine should be on notice\" that the agency was poised to sue. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration even pulled $4.5 million for marine research, but it didn't touch the 33 other grantees who get similar funding.\n\nThen last week, the Social Security Administration briefly became the sixth federal agency to target Maine, canceling contracts that allowed hospitals to automatically report births and funeral homes to report deaths.\n\nAlthough the Social Security contracts were reinstated, and the state may reapply for the marine research funding, the moves had already wreaked havoc.\n\nNow, more federal agencies are pressing down on Maine than there are transgender girls competing in girls' sports in the state. Only two transgender girls are competing this school year, according to the Maine Principals' Association.\n\n\"The president is trying to crush the opposition. He's trying to crush Maine,\" said David Webbert, a longtime civil rights attorney in Maine. To Webbert, it's as if Trump is saying: \"'Maine believes in transgender rights? Well, you're going to see what happens to you.'\"\n\nSome view Maine as a test case for how the Trump administration may try to force its policies on states, regardless of existing state laws. In public comments, residents have invoked the state's motto to rally Mainers: \"Dirigo,\" Latin for \"I lead.\"\n\n\"It's Maine now, but what state is it going to be next? This is not just a Maine issue, but Maine spoke up. So right now, it's, 'Let's make an example out of Maine,'\" said Kris Pitts, executive co-director of the nonprofit MaineTransNet.\n\nState officials, thrust into the spotlight, have been trying to avoid becoming more of a target, carefully choosing their words and declining interviews with reporters. And Mills hasn't challenged Trump again publicly on this issue.\n\nThere are signs the administration is preparing to force other states to follow the president's directives: The DOJ recently sent letters to California and Minnesota threatening to sue those states if they don't ban transgender girls from athletics.\n\nThe Trump administration also is taking a multiagency approach with Columbia University. On Friday, several federal agencies canceled a combined $400 million in grants and contracts because, the administration alleged, the university was not sufficiently combatting antisemitism.\n\nThe press release announcing the multimillion-dollar punishment contained a caution for noncompliant institutions: \"Doing business with the Federal Government is a privilege.\"\n\nNearly everything about the blitz of investigations in Maine, including how they're being carried out, is not ordinary.\n\nFederal agencies that don't usually enforce civil rights laws in schools launched inquiries. HHS, for instance, usually focuses on health care access for people with disabilities or language translation, and there's no evidence it's conducted an investigation of Maine in the past 20 years.\n\nNot only did it dive into Maine's policies on transgender athletes, it reached a conclusion with unprecedented speed.\n\nInvestigations like this typically take months, if not years, according to a review of federal investigation data and records by ProPublica and the Bangor Daily News. But just one business day after announcing the investigation, the federal agency decided the Maine Department of Education wasn't giving girls equal opportunities and had violated Title IX \"by allowing male athletes to compete against female athletes,\" according to a letter from HHS to the state .\n\nIt sent that finding to the general inbox at the Maine attorney general's office after interviewing no one from that office, the Education Department, governor's office or officials from two high schools cited in the letter for allowing transgender athletes to compete against girls, according to those agencies and schools.\n\nThe Maine attorney general's office pointed out that the letter cited an incorrect sum of federal funding that flows to the state. Legal experts also viewed its interpretation of Title IX as problematic. Trump's Feb. 5 \" Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports \" executive order asserted that transgender girls can't play girls' sports under that federal law. But Title IX has never required schools to exclude them, and Trump's order can't rewrite federal law, said Deborah Brake, a professor at University of Pittsburgh School of Law.\n\n\"The president can put out an executive order saying anything he wants,\" Brake said, but \"there has never been a court decision interpreting Title IX to require the exclusion of transgender girls from girls' sports.\"\n\nIn a statement, the agency reiterated that Maine could lose federal funding if it didn't comply with its position. \"HHS will investigate and enforce Title IX to the full extent permitted by law to uphold fairness, safety, dignity, and biological truth in women's and girls' educational athletic opportunities. Men have no place in women's sports,\" it said.\n\nThe USDA investigation of the University of Maine, launched on a Saturday, the day after Mills' exchange with Trump, also is unusual. In announcing the investigation, the department said $100 million to the university was at risk because of the state's \"blatant disregard\" of Trump's order; a university system spokesperson said that amount reflected multiple years of funding.\n\nThen came a series of questions, according to records obtained by the Bangor Daily News and ProPublica . At 10:50 a.m. the following Tuesday, a USDA official sent a University of Maine official 10 yes-or-no questions about its transgender athlete policies - and gave her 1 hour, 10 minutes to respond. The officials agreed to discuss the questions over a Zoom call, and, about five hours after that call, the USDA sent a list of follow-up questions. The agency wanted those answers by 1 p.m. the following day.\n\nSherron Jernigan, a USDA civil rights director for the animal and plant inspection service, sent the questions :\n\n\"Does the University of Maine System provide sex-separated toilet, locker room, and shower facilities for male student athletes and female student athletes?\" The university answered \"yes.\"\n\n\"Does the University of Maine System permit a biological male to participate in individual or team contact sports with biological females?\" The university answered \"no.\"\n\nThe university's Title IX coordinator told the USDA that none of the seven universities within the system has transgender athletes participating in NCAA-sanctioned sports. (Of the more than 500,000 students who compete on NCAA teams across the country, fewer than 10 are transgender, the league's president recently told a U.S. Senate panel.)\n\nIn her response to follow-up questions, Liz Lavoie, the university's Title IX coordinator, added that the USDA had not given the university \"any explanation as to the basis or scope of its inquiry, or the steps in the process.\"\n\n\"Further, we have been given mere hours to respond to both sets of questions and we are responding in good faith but find the approach concerning given the lack of official service and the informal nature that the questions and interview have been presented,\" Lavoie wrote.\n\nThe USDA did not issue any findings after the questioning, but the agency already is taking action. On Tuesday, the university said the USDA had frozen funding that could affect research on everything from the contamination of Maine farms by forever chemicals to the sustainability of Maine's lobster industry. Last fiscal year, the USDA awarded nearly $30 million to the University of Maine.\n\nA USDA spokesperson said the agency would not comment on a pending investigation.\n\nWebbert, the civil rights attorney, called the federal government's inquiries \"a show.\"\n\n\"It's a political move dressed up, very barely, with a legal process, but it's a fake legal process. So it is very concerning because they're not even trying to make it look like it's due process,\" he said. \"It reeks of pure politics.\"\n\nThe federal government has made no effort to hide the ideological perspective that its various inquiries are seeking to enforce in Maine and the rest of the county, according to documents obtained by ProPublica and the Bangor Daily News. In announcing its action in Maine, HHS said it wanted to \"restore biological truth to the federal government\" and in its findings cited an article from OutKick, a Fox-owned conservative news site with a mission of \"exposing the destructive nature of 'woke' activism.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Office for Civil Rights in the U.S. Department of Education - which does have a mandate to investigate gender-based discrimination in schools and, with more than 500 people, dwarfs most of the nation's civil rights enforcement divisions - seemed to conclude that Maine was violating Title IX before it finished investigating.\n\nThe press release announcing the launch of the investigation quoted the department's acting assistant secretary for civil rights, Craig Trainor: \"It is shameful that Governor Mills refuses to stand with women and girls. Her rejection of the antidiscrimination obligations that Maine voluntarily accepted when it agreed to receive federal taxpayer dollars is unlawful.\"\n\nTrainor linked to \"credible local reporting\" around the pole vaulter in his letter to Maine officials announcing the civil rights investigation. The report came from the Maine Wire, an online outlet founded by a conservative think tank based in the state. The office hasn't made contact with Maine since it notified state agencies of its investigation, according to the Maine agencies.\n\nThe Education Department did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMaine's governor never believed her state would receive an impartial investigation. \"I imagine that the outcome of this politically directed investigation is all but predetermined,\" Mills said in a statement after the Education Department investigation began. She has since declined to discuss her view of Maine's transgender athlete policy.\n\nBut she has reiterated that Trump legally can't force the state to violate its own law, the Maine Human Rights Act, which prevents discrimination based on gender identity.\n\nMainers aren't sure what this full-court press will mean for their state; keeping up with it is hard enough. State Sen. Joe Rafferty, a Democrat who co-chairs the Legislature's committee on education and cultural affairs, expressed disbelief when a reporter informed him that HHS' investigation only lasted four days. He wasn't aware it had officially started.\n\n\"That is why I think part of this is a mirage,\" he said of the various investigations. The eventual resolution, he said, is more likely to be settled in a courtroom.\n\nIndeed, HHS referred its finding to the DOJ, which can sue Maine to remove its federal funding. (The health agency also expanded its investigation last week to include the Maine Principals' Association and the Maine high school where the pole vaulter is a student, according to the agency.) The results of that lawsuit could have significant implications, said Brake, the law professor. Not once since Congress enacted Title IX in 1972 has the DOJ ever cut off funding for a violation.\n\nAll the federal attention has been unsettling to some Mainers, welcomed by others who don't want transgender girls playing girls' sports and disruptive to the 625-student Greely High School, which the transgender pole vaulter attends.\n\n\"It's just upsetting to everybody at school to be the center of attention and focus. It's unnerving to go to school and the school is surrounded by police and reporters on every corner,\" Gia Drew, who leads a statewide LGBTQ+ advocacy group called EqualityMaine, said of what she's hearing from the community. \"It's hard to focus on a calculus test when your friends are under attack. It affects not just trans people but everyone who is part of a school system.\"\n\nAfter state Rep. Laurel Libby, a Republican from Auburn, singled out the student on her Facebook page and brought Trump's attention to Maine, parents in the school district planned to show support by displaying signs and handing out treats before classes began, said state Rep. Christina Mitchell, a Democrat who represents Cumberland, home to Greely High School. She's also a school board member in the district.\n\nBut there were television trucks and a police presence surrounding the school, so parents decided not to add to the commotion.\n\nThe Bangor Daily News and ProPublica reached out to the family of the student athlete but received no response. Mitchell said other students, including the transgender student's teammates and competitors, are supportive of her. \"Nobody was making a fuss,\" she said.\n\nAnd many in Maine don't want a fuss. Even as Mills' response to Trump made some proud - you can now buy \"See you in court\" T-shirts - others recognized that it launched Maine into the nation's consciousness. \"You watch it and feel like: 'Oh, all eyes will be here. This will be something big,'\" said Pitts, with MaineTransNet.\n\nLibby and other Republican lawmakers have welcomed the chance to amplify their viewpoint that allowing transgender girls in sports is unsafe and discriminates against girls. Another Republican lawmaker introduced a bill to the Legislature to require transgender athletes to compete on teams matching the gender they were assigned at birth.\n\n\"All of the accomplishments of women over the years are being erased by men masquerading as women, erasing us from the history books,\" Libby said in a weekly address from Maine House Republicans.\n\nWhile Libby has been censured by Democrats who control the Maine House for her initial Facebook post about the pole vaulter, she has continued to make appearances on right-wing media to urge the governor to stop supporting the right of transgender girls to compete in girls' sports. On Tuesday, she filed a lawsuit in Maine District Court against the state's House speaker over the censure, accusing him of stripping her voting rights \"in retaliation for protected speech on a highly important and hotly debated matter of public concern,\" according to the complaint. Her party has rallied around her and her cause.\n\n\"Allowing biological boys to compete with our girls, is not only unpopular, and unfair, but it is also illegal,\" Republican House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham of Winter Harbor said in a written statement . \"Governor Mills should abandon this indefensible position and uphold Title IX protections for our girls.\"\n\nMaine institutions being targeted by the federal government have continued to follow state law. And at a regularly scheduled school board meeting at Greely High School on Thursday night, the board president pledged the district's \"unwavering support\" of all students.\n\nMitchell said that Maine may be the federal government's target now, but other states could be next.\n\n\"I think you have to stand up to it. Whatever you think is right, you have to stand up for it, because, if you don't, it'll just keep going and spread to other places,\" Mitchell said. \"We're a small state, but if you give an inch, you know?\"\n\nby Callie Ferguson and Erin Rhoda, Bangor Daily News, and Jennifer Smith Richards and Jodi S. Cohen, ProPublica\n\nEli Hager contributed reporting.\n\nReporting Highlights\n\nTerrorgram Network:  Juraj Krajčík subscribed to at least 49 extremist Telegram chats and channels, many of them nodes in the Terrorgram network, before he killed two people at an LGBTQ+ bar.\n\nThese highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.\n\nThe teen entered the chat with a friendly greeting.\n\n\"Hello lads,\" he typed.\n\n\"Sup,\" came a reply, along with a graphic that read \"KILL JEWS.\" Another poster shared a GIF of Adolf Hitler shaking hands with Benito Mussolini. Someone else added a short video of a gay pride flag being set on fire. Eventually, the talk in the group turned to mass shootings and bombings.\n\nAnd so in August 2019, Juraj Krajčík, then a soft-faced 16-year-old with a dense pile of brown hair, immersed himself in a loose collection of extremist chat groups and channels on the massive social media and messaging platform Telegram. This online community, which was dubbed Terrorgram, had a singular focus: inciting acts of white supremacist terrorism.\n\nOver the next three years, Krajčík made hundreds - possibly thousands - of posts in Terrorgram chats and channels, where a handful of influential content creators steered the conversation toward violence. Day after day, post after post, these influencers cultivated Krajčík, who lived with his family in a comfortable apartment in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia. They reinforced his hatreds, fine-tuned his beliefs and fed him tips, encouraging him to attack gay and Jewish people and political leaders and become, in their parlance, a \"saint.\"\n\nOn Oct. 12, 2022, Krajčík, armed with his father's .45-caliber handgun, opened fire on three people sitting outside an LGBTQ+ bar in Bratislava, killing two and wounding the third before fleeing the scene.\n\nThat night, as police hunted for him, Krajčík spoke on the phone with Marek Madro, a Bratislava psychologist who runs a suicide hotline and mental health crisis team. \"He hoped that what he had done would shake up society,\" recalled Madro in an interview, adding that the teen was \"very scared.\"\n\nDuring the call, Krajčík kept repeating phrases from his manifesto, according to Madro. The 65-page document, written in crisp English and illustrated with graphics and photos, offered a detailed justification for his lethal actions. \"Destroy the degenerates!\" he wrote, before encouraging people to attack pride parades, gay and lesbian activists, and LGBTQ+ bars.\n\nEventually Krajčík, standing in a small grove of trees alongside a busy roadway, put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger.\n\nThe next day, Terrorgram influencers were praising the killer and circulating a PDF of his manifesto on Telegram.\n\n\"We thank him from the bottom of our hearts and will never forget his sacrifice,\" stated one post written by a Terrorgram leader in California. \"FUCKING HAIL, BROTHER!!!\"\n\nThe story of Krajčík's march to violence shows the murderous reach of the online extremists, who operated outside the view of local law enforcement. To police at the time, the killings seemed like the act of a lone gunman rather than what they were: the culmination of a coordinated recruiting effort that spanned two continents.\n\nProPublica and the PBS series FRONTLINE, along with the Slovakian newsroom Investigative Center of Jan Kuciak, pieced together the story behind Krajčík's evolution from a troubled teenager to mass shooter. We identified his user name on Telegram, which allowed us to sift through tens of thousands of now-deleted Telegram posts that had not previously been linked to him. Our team retraced his final hours, interviewing investigators, experts and victims in Slovakia, and mapped the links between Krajčík and the extremists in Europe and the U.S. who helped to shape him.\n\nThe Terrorgram network has been gutted in recent months by the arrests of its leaders in North America and Europe. Telegram declined repeated requests to make its executives available for interviews but in a statement said, \"Calls for violence from any group are not tolerated on our platform.\" The company also said that since 2023 it has stepped up moderation practices.\n\nStill, at a time when other mainstream social media companies such as X and Meta are cutting back on policing their online content, experts say the violent neo-Nazis that populated Telegram's chats and channels will likely find an online home elsewhere.\n\nAt first, Krajčík didn't fit in with the Terrorgrammers. In one early post in 2019, he argued that the white nationalist movement would benefit from large public protests. The idea wasn't well received.\n\n\"Rallies won't do shit,\" replied one poster.\n\nAnother told the teen that instead of organizing a rally, he should start murdering politicians, journalists and drag performers. \"You need a mafia state of mind,\" the person wrote.\n\nKrajčík had found his way to the Terrorgram community after hanging out on 8chan, a massive and anonymous forum that had long been an online haven for extremists; he would later say that he was \"redpilled\" - or radicalized - on the site.\n\nOn 8chan, people posted racist memes and made plenty of vile comments. But the Terrorgram scene was different. In the Terrorgram chats people discussed, in detail, the best strategies for carrying out spectacular acts of violence aimed at toppling Western democracies and replacing them with all-white ethno-states.\n\nThe chats Krajčík joined that summer of 2019 were administered by Pavol Beňadik, then a 20-year-old Slovakian college student who had helped create the Terrorgram community and was one of its leading personalities.\n\nA hybrid of a messaging service like WhatsApp and a social media platform like X or Facebook, Telegram offered features that appealed to extremists like Beňadik. They could engage in private encrypted discussions, start big chat groups or create public channels to broadcast their messages. Importantly, Telegram also allowed them to post huge PDF documents and lengthy video files.\n\nIn his Terrorgram chats, Beňadik, who used the handle Slovakbro, relentlessly pressed for violent actions - although he never took any himself. Over two days in August, he posted instructions for making Molotov cocktails and pipe bombs, encouraged people to build radioactive dirty bombs and set them off in major cities, and called for the execution of police officers and other law enforcement agents. \"TOTAL PIG DEATH,\" he wrote.\n\nAt the time, the chats were drawing hundreds of participants from around the world, including a large number of Americans.\n\nBeňadik, who was from a small village in western Slovakia, took a special interest in Krajčík, chatting with him in the Slovak language, discussing life in their country, and making him feel appreciated and respected.\n\nFor Krajčík, this was a change. In his daily life outside of Terrorgram, he \"felt completely unnoticed, unheard,\" said Madro, who spoke with several of Krajčík's classmates. \"He often talked about his own feelings and thoughts publicly and felt like no one took him seriously.\"\n\nKrajčík started spending massive amounts of time in the chat. On a single day, he posted 117 times over the span of 10 hours. The teen's ideas began to closely echo those of Beňadik.\n\nIn late September, two regulars had a friendly mixed martial arts bout and streamed it on YouTube. Krajčík shared the link with the rest of the chat group, who cheered and heckled as their online friends brawled. Beňadik encouraged Krajčík to participate in a similar bout in the future.\n\n\"Porozmýšlam,\" replied Krajčík: \"I'll think about it.\"\n\nFor Beňadik, the combatants were providing a good example. He wanted Terrorgrammers to transform themselves into Aryan warriors, hard men capable of doing serious physical harm to others.\n\nIn reality, Krajčík was anything but a tough guy. A \"severely bullied student,\" Krajčík had transferred to a high school for academically gifted students, a school official told the Slovak newspaper Pravda. Two therapists \"worked intensively with him for two years until the pandemic broke out and schools closed,\" the official said.\n\nBeňadik created at least five neo-Nazi channels and two chat groups on Telegram, one of which eventually attracted nearly 5,000 subscribers. He crafted an online persona as a sage leader, offering tips and guidance for carrying out effective attacks. He often posted practical materials, such as files for 3D-printing rifle parts, including auto sears, which transform a semiautomatic gun into a fully automatic weapon. \"Read useful literature, get useful skills,\" he said in an interview with a podcast. \"You are the revolutionary, so act like it.\"\n\nIt was only a month after joining Beňadik's Terrorgram chats that Krajčík first mentioned Tepláreň, the LGBTQ+ bar in Bratislava he eventually attacked. On Sept. 18, 2019, he shared a link to a website called Queer Slovakia that featured an article on the bar.\n\nBeňadik responded immediately, writing that he was having a \"copeland moment\" - a reference to David Copeland, a British neo-Nazi who planted a nail bomb at an LGBTQ+ pub in London in 1999. The explosion killed three people and wounded nearly 80 others.\n\n\"I DON'T ACTUALLY WANT TO NAIL BOMB THAT JOINT,\" Beňadik continued. He wanted to do something far worse. \"Hell,\" Beňadik wrote, would be less brutal than what he had in mind.\n\nAnother Terrorgrammer offered a suggestion: What about a bomb loaded with \"Nails + ricin + chemicals?\"\n\nKrajčík sounded a note of caution. \"Just saying it will instantly make a squad of federal agents appear behind you and arrest you,\" he wrote. Beňadik responded by complaining that Slovakia wasn't producing enough \"saints,\" implicitly encouraging his mentee to achieve sainthood by committing a lethal act of terror.\n\nTwo days later, Krajčík posted photos of people holding gay pride flags in downtown Bratislava. They were \"degenerates,\" he wrote, repeatedly using anti-gay slurs.\n\nOne chat member told Krajčík he should've rounded up a group of Nazi skinheads and assaulted the demonstrators.\n\nThen Krajčík posted a photo of Tepláreň.\n\nBeňadik responded that \"airborne paving stones make great gifts for such businesses.\"\n\nIn the chat, Beňadik repeatedly posted a PDF copy of the self-published memoirs of Eric Rudolph, the American terrorist who bombed the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta and several other sites before going on the run. The autobiography contains a detailed description of Rudolph's bombing of a lesbian bar, which wounded five people.\n\nUrging Krajčík to read the book, Beňadik described it as \"AMAZING\" and a \"great read.\" Rudolph, he wrote, had created the \"archetype\" for the \"lone wolf\" terrorist.\n\nEventually, Krajčík joined at least 49 extremist Telegram chats, many of them nodes in the Terrorgram network, according to analysis by Pierre Vaux, a researcher who investigates threats to democracy and human rights abuses.\n\nWhile Terrorgram started as a loose collection of accounts, by 2021 Beňadik and some of his fellow influencers had created a more formal organization, which they called the Terrorgram Collective, according to interviews with experts and court records from Slovakia, the U.S. and Canada.\n\nThe organization began producing more sophisticated content - books, videos and a roster of potential assassination targets - and distributing the material to thousands of followers.\n\nKrajčík was a fan of the collective's books, which are loaded with highly pixelated black-and-white graphics and offer a raft of specific advice for anyone planning a terror attack.\n\nBy the summer of 2022, Krajčík had become a regular poster in a Terrorgram chat run by another alleged leader of the collective, Dallas Humber of Elk Grove, California, a quiet suburb of Sacramento.\n\nHumber went by a series of usernames but was eventually publicly exposed by a group of activists, and later arrested and charged with terrorism-related offenses. ProPublica and FRONTLINE reviewed chat logs - provided by the anti-facist Australian research organization The White Rose Society - and other online materials, as well as court records, to independently confirm her identity.\n\nBeňadik was arrested in Slovakia and charged with more than 200 terrorism offenses. He pleaded guilty and would be sentenced to six years in prison.\n\nIn his absence, Humber quickly slipped in as mentor and coach to Krajčík.\n\nShe was explicit about her intentions, constantly encouraging followers in her chats and channels to go out and kill their perceived enemies - including Jewish and Muslim people, members of the queer community and anybody who wasn't white. Her job, she wrote in one post, was to embrace disaffected young white men and guide them \"through the end of the radicalization process.\"\n\nOn Aug. 2, 2022, Humber and Krajčík discussed a grisly incident that had occurred several days earlier: A white man had beaten to death a Nigerian immigrant on a city street in northern Italy.\n\nThe killing, which was documented on video, was \"fucking glorious,\" wrote Humber, using a racial slur to describe the victim. \"Please send any more pics, articles, info to the chat as more details come out,\" she posted.\n\nKrajčík wrote that he didn't know much about the circumstances surrounding the crime but was still convinced the murderer had chosen \"the right path.\"\n\nThe killer, wrote Humber, would make an \"ideal\" boyfriend. \"Every girl wants a man who would kill a [racial expletive] for her 🥰 how romantic.\"\n\nThree days later, Humber's chat was alive with tributes to and praise for another killer. Wade Page, a Nazi skinhead and former U.S. Army soldier, had murdered six Sikh worshippers at a temple outside of Milwaukee a decade earlier. (A seventh would later die of their injuries.)\n\nWhen police confronted Page, he began shooting at them, hitting one officer 15 times before killing himself.\n\nHumber was a big fan of the killer. Page, she wrote, planned the attack thoroughly and chose his targets carefully. \"He even made a point to desocialize and cut ties with those close to him,\" Humber noted. \"No chance of them disrupting his plans.\"\n\n\"Page did his duty,\" Krajčík wrote.\n\nDuring the same time period, Krajčík started doing reconnaissance on potential targets in his city, staking out the apartment of then-Prime Minister Eduard Heger, a Jewish community center and Tepláreň, the bar.\n\nHe posted photos of the locations on his private Twitter account. And in a series of cryptic tweets, Krajčík hinted at the violence to come:\n\n\"I don't expect to make it. In all likelyhood I will die in the course of the operation.\"\n\n\"Before an operation, you will have to mentally deal with several important questions. You will have to deal with them alone, to not jeopardize your mission by leaking it.\"\n\n\"I want to damage the System to the best of my abilities.\"\n\nThen, on Oct. 11, 2022, he wrote:\n\n\"I have made my decision.\"\n\nThe next evening, after spending a half-hour outside the prime minister's apartment, Krajčík made his way to Tepláreň. The bar sat on a steep, winding street lined with cafes, clothing boutiques and other small businesses. For about 40 minutes he lurked in a shadowy doorway up the hill. Then, at about 7 p.m., he approached a small group of people sitting in front of the bar and began shooting.\n\nHe killed Matúš Horváth and Juraj Vankulič and wounded Radka Trokšiarová , shooting her twice in the leg.\n\nKrajčík, then 19, fled the scene. He had just committed a terrorist attack that would shock the nation.\n\nIn court records, U.S. prosecutors have linked both Humber and another alleged Terrorgram leader, Matthew Allison of Boise, Idaho, to Krajčík's crime. The pair were charged last fall with a raft of felonies related to their Terrorgram posts and propaganda, including conspiring to provide material support to terrorists and soliciting the murder of federal officials.\n\nKrajčík \"was active on Terrorgram and had frequent conversations with ALLISON, HUMBER, and other members of the Terrorgram Collective,\" prosecutors allege in the indictment. In another brief, they say Krajčík shared his manifesto with Allison before the attack. Then, immediately after the murders, he allegedly sent Allison direct messages saying, \"not sure how much time I have but it's happening,\" and \"just delete all messages about this convo.\"\n\nThe Terrorgram posts cited in court documents corroborate our team's reporting.\n\nAllison spoke with one of our reporters from jail against his lawyer's advice. He said he did not incite anyone to violence and that prosecutors had misconstrued the communications with Krajčík. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges, and in a motion, his legal team indicated it would argue that all of his posts are protected by the First Amendment. Humber also pleaded not guilty. She declined to be interviewed and to comment through her lawyer.\n\nWhile Krajčík was at large, Slovakian authorities tapped Madro, the psychologist, to try to communicate with the young man. \"After 12 text messages, he finally picked up the phone,\" Madro recalled.\n\nThe brief conversation ended with Krajčík killing himself. \"The shot rang out and there was silence,\" Madro said.\n\nWithin hours, Humber was making celebratory posts. Krajčík, she exclaimed, had achieved sainthood. \"Saint Krajčík's place in the Pantheon is undisputed, as is our enthusiastic support for his work,\" she wrote on a Terrorgram channel where she posted a picture of the victims on the ground, blood streaking the pavement.\n\nShe and Allison also circulated his manifesto.\n\nIn it, Krajčík praised the Terrorgram Collective for its \"incredible writing and art,\" \"political texts\" and \"practical guides.\" And he thanked Beňadik: \"Your work was some of the first that I encountered after making the switch to Telegram, and remains some of the greatest on the platform.\"\n\nWhile they were spreading Krajčík's propaganda, the owner of Tepláreň, Roman Samotný, was mourning.\n\nThe bar \"was kind of like a safe island for queer people here in Slovakia,\" he recalled in an interview. \"It was just the place where everybody felt welcomed and just accepted and relaxed.\"\n\nBefore the attack, Samotný's major concern was that some homophobe would smash the bar's windows. After the murders, he said, \"the biggest change is the realization that we are not anymore safe here. ... I was never thinking that we can be killed because of our identity.\"\n\nSamotný has closed the bar.\n\nThe survivor, Trokšiarová , was left with lingering physical pain and emotional distress. \"I was deeply confused,\" she said. \"Why would anyone do it?\"\n\nEmployees at the National Cancer Institute, which is part of the National Institutes of Health, received internal guidance last week to flag manuscripts, presentations or other communications for scrutiny if they addressed \"controversial, high profile, or sensitive\" topics. Among the 23 hot-button issues, according to internal records reviewed by ProPublica: vaccines, fluoride, peanut allergies, autism.\n\nWhile it's not uncommon for the cancer institute to outline a couple of administration priorities, the scope and scale of the list is unprecedented and highly unusual, said six employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly. All materials must be reviewed by an institute \"clearance team,\" according to the records, and could be examined by officials at the NIH or its umbrella agency, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nStaffers and experts worried that the directive would delay or halt the publication of research. \"This is micromanagement at the highest level,\" said Dr. Georges C. Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.\n\nThe list touches on the personal priorities of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist who has repeatedly promoted medical conspiracy theories and false claims. He has advanced the idea that rising rates of autism are linked to vaccines, a claim that has been debunked by hundreds of scientific studies . He has also suggested that aluminum in vaccines is responsible for childhood allergies (his son reportedly is severely allergic to peanuts ). And he has claimed that water fluoridation - which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has called \"one of the 10 greatest public health achievements of the 20th century\" - is an \"industrial waste.\"\n\nIn confirmation hearings in January, Kennedy said that he was not \"anti-vaccine,\" and that as secretary, he would not discourage people from getting immunized for measles or polio, but he dodged questions about the link between autism and vaccines.\n\nAnother term on the list, \"cancer moonshot,\" refers to a program launched by President Barack Obama in 2016. It was a priority of the Biden administration , which intended for the program to cut the nation's cancer death rate by at least half and prevent more than 4 million deaths.\n\nThe list is \"an unusual mix of words that are tied to activities that this administration has been at war with - like equity, but also words that they purport to be in favor of doing something about, like ultraprocessed food,\" Tracey Woodruff, director of the Program on Reproductive Health and the Environment at the University of California, San Francisco, said in an email.\n\nThe guidance states that staffers \"do not need to share content describing the routine conduct of science if it will not get major media attention, is not controversial or sensitive, and does not touch on an administration priority.\"\n\nA longtime senior employee at the institute said that the directive was circulated by the institute's communications team, and the content was not discussed at the leadership level. It is not clear in which exact office the directive originated. The NCI, NIH and HHS did not respond to ProPublica's emailed questions. (The existence of the list was first revealed in social media posts on Friday.)\n\nHealth and research experts told ProPublica they feared the chilling effect of the new guidance. Not only might it lead to a lengthier and more complex clearance process, it may also cause researchers to censor their work out of fear or deference to the administration's priorities.\n\n\"This is real interference in the scientific process,\" said Linda Birnbaum, a former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences who served as a federal scientist for four decades. The list, she said, \"just seems like Big Brother intimidation.\"\n\nDuring the first two months of Donald Trump's second presidency, his administration has slashed funding for research institutions and stalled the NIH's grant application process .\n\nKennedy has suggested that hundreds of NIH staffers should be fired and said that the institute should deprioritize infectious diseases like COVID-19 and shift its focus to chronic diseases, such as diabetes and obesity.\n\nObesity is on the NCI's new list, as are infectious diseases including COVID-19, bird flu and measles.\n\nThe \"focus on bird flu and covid is concerning,\" Woodruff wrote, because \"not being transparent with the public about infectious diseases will not stop them or make them go away and could make them worse.\""

      "text": "Jasmine Crockett criticized over comment mocking Greg Abbott's wheelchair\n\nWASHINGTON - U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett , D-Dallas, disparagingly called Gov. Greg Abbott \"Hot Wheels\" to mock his use of a wheelchair Saturday, prompting fierce backlash from Republicans.\n\n\"Jasmine Crockett is despicable,\" Attorney General Ken Paxton said on social media.\n\n\"Shameful,\" U.S. Sen. John Cornyn posted.\n\n\"Jasmine Crockett is the perfect spokesperson for today's Democrats - out of touch and completely unhinged,\" said Mike Marinella, a spokesperson for the National Republican Congressional Committee. \"When you've got no message and no agenda, all that's left is hate.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Randy Weber , R-Friendswood, plans to file a motion to censure Crockett on Wednesday, according to a draft of the motion obtained by the Tribune.\n\nCrockett made the remark during a dinner in Los Angeles hosted by the Human Rights Campaign, a pro-LGBTQ rights organization. Addressing the crowd, she quipped: \"Y'all know we got Gov. Hot Wheels down there. Come on now. And the only thing hot about him is that he is a hot ass mess, honey.\"\n\nAbbott has used a wheelchair for over 40 years. He was struck by a falling tree in 1984 while jogging, crushing multiple vertebrae. He was 26 at the time.\n\nCrockett is not the first to land in hot water after mocking Abbott's disability. Then-Travis County Judge Sarah Eckhardt apologized in 2019 after she said Abbott \"hates trees because one fell on him.\" Eckhardt is now a state senator. Two staffers of Empower Texans, a right-wing advocacy group, drew condemnation from their fellow Texas Republicans in 2020 after audio surfaced of them cursing out the governor and deriding his disability.\n\nAddressing the comments, Abbott said on Tuesday night that Democrats \"have no vision, no policy. They have nothing to sell but hate.\"\n\n\"The bottom line is that Republican states like Texas are leading the way, and with comments like this by Democrats, we will just leave them in the dust in future elections,\" Abbott said to Fox News' Sean Hannity.\n\nIn a social media post, Crockett asserted she was mocking Abbott's policies, not disability.\n\n\"I wasn't thinking about the governor's condition-I was thinking about the planes, trains, and automobiles he used to transfer migrants into communities led by Black mayors, deliberately stoking tension and fear among the most vulnerable,\" Crockett wrote. \"Literally, the next line I said was that he was a \"Hot A-- Mess,\" referencing his terrible policies. At no point did I mention or allude to his condition. So, I'm even more appalled that the very people who unequivocally support Trump-a man known for racially insensitive nicknames and mocking those with disabilities-are now outraged.\"\n\nCrockett is known for her withering criticisms of Republicans, emerging as a high-profile messenger for Democrats as they go on the offense against President Donald Trump . She has gone viral for her clashes with Republicans during committee hearings.\n\nShe drew particular attention when she shot back at U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, for mocking her appearance. The Georgia Republican said during a committee hearing last year that Crockett's \"fake eyelashes are messing up what you're reading.\"\n\nCrockett shot back in a now viral moment where she asked about the propriety of using the phrase a \"bleach blonde bad built butch body,\" a remark aimed at Greene. The line has since appeared on merchandise, and Crockett's campaign applied to trademark the line last year.\n\nDisclosure: Human Rights Campaign has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

With cases continuously rising and the rest of the country's unvaccinated population at the outbreak's mercy, Texas must create stricter quarantine requirements, increase the vaccine rate, and improve contact tracing to address this measles epidemic before it becomes a nationwide problem, warn infectious disease experts and officials in other states.\n\n\"This demonstrates that this (vaccine exemption) policy puts the community, the county, and surrounding states at risk because of how contagious this disease is,\" said Glenn Fennelly, a specialist in pediatric infectious diseases and chair of the Department of Pediatrics at Texas Tech University. \"We are running the risk of threatening global stability.\"\n\n[ After COVID, Texas is less prepared for the next pandemic ]\n\nThe measles outbreak - the largest in the state in 30 years - has spread from two cases in late January to more than 270 cases and now includes 11 counties, most of them in the rural South Plains region.\n\nSo far this year, there have been more than 300 cases of measles confirmed across 15 states, as of March 13. The Texas outbreak, which makes up the bulk of those cases, is only linked to cases in New Mexico and Oklahoma, where state officials said this month that someone associated with the Texas outbreak was exposed.\n\nLast month, Texas officials reported that an unvaccinated, otherwise healthy school-aged child died from measles, the first death from the virus in a decade.\n\nThis month, New Mexico officials said an unvaccinated adult in Lea County, about 50 miles away from the outbreak's epicenter of Gaines County, who died had tested positive for measles. Officials are still confirming whether the cause of death was measles, according to the New Mexico Department of Health.\n\n\"This is a very multi-jurisdictional outbreak with three states involved and about seven or eight different local health departments, in addition to some areas where the state serves as the local health department. There are a lot of moving parts,\" said Katherine Wells, director of public health for the City of Lubbock, during a Tuesday meeting of the Big Cities Health Coalition, a national organization for large metropolitan health departments.\n\nMost of Texas' measles cases are in unvaccinated school-aged children and are concentrated in the Mennonite community in Gaines County, which traditionally has low vaccination rates.\n\nWells said efforts to increase the vaccination rates in Gaines County, which is about 70 miles from Lubbock, and the surrounding region have been slow as trust in the government has seemingly reached an all-time low.\n\n\"We are seeing, just like the rest of Americans, this community has seen a lot of stories about vaccines causing autism, and that is leading to a lot of this vaccine hesitancy, not religion,\" she said.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to the politicization of vaccines and overall weariness to health mandates like quarantines and masks. Public health officials are now battling misinformation and public resistance to measles.\n\nWells said because the state can't stop people from traveling, she fully expects this outbreak to last a year, and the surrounding states and the nation should prepare themselves for a potential spread.\n\n\"Measles is going to find those pockets of unvaccinated individuals, and with the number of cases and ability for people to travel, there is that risk of it entering other unvaccinated pockets anywhere in the United States right now,\" Wells said.\n\nFennelly was living in New York in the 1990s when pamphlets started getting passed around the Hebrew community warning against the unfound dangers of the measles vaccine. Soon, the vaccine refusal rate began to climb, and an outbreak started filling hospitals with sick infants.\n\nNow, decades later, Fennelly is watching the same series of events play out in Texas.\n\n\"This could have been predicted. There have been steady rates of increased personal belief exemptions over the last several years leading to pockets of under-vaccination across the state,\" he said.\n\nIn the West Texas region, misinformation about vaccines, distrust of local public health officials, and fear of government authority overruling family autonomy have reigned supreme, creating the pockets that measles infiltrated this year.\n\nHowever, this is not just a South Plains problem but a statewide issue as vaccine exemptions continue to grow.\n\n\"We have several pockets of population that have high unvaccinated groups. We sent out a letter to public and private school districts with low vaccination rates explaining the situation and asking them to update their children's shots,\" said Phil Huang, director and health authority for Dallas County Health and Human Services, during the Big Cities Health Coalition meeting.\n\nTexas requires children and students to obtain vaccines to attend schools, child care centers, and college. However, individuals can claim they are exempt if they are in the military, have a religious or personal belief that goes against getting immunized, or if a health provider determines it is not safe to do so.\n\nSince 2018, the number of requests to the Texas Department of State Health Services for an exemption form has doubled from 45,900 to more than 93,000 in 2024.\n\nData suggests that vaccine exemptions and those living in areas with higher vaccine exemption rates for measles and pertussis are at increased risk of contracting these diseases. The authors of this data collection concluded that \"geographic pockets of vaccine exemptions pose a risk to the whole community.\"\n\nFennelly said the hurdles to obtaining exemptions are easy to clear, leading to an increasing number of people refusing the vaccine.\n\nState lawmakers this session have filed more than a dozen bills that would strengthen or expand vaccine exemptions.\n\n\"We don't have the capacity in Texas to deal with so many sick children if this continues to spread. We are already at our limit with seasonal influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. Our doctors are at their limit,\" Fennelly said.\n\nSimbo Ige, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health, had to deal with a measles outbreak in her city a year ago, with 64 individuals testing positive, 57 of whom were associated with a shelter. She said the quickest way they controlled the outbreak was quickly administering more than 30,000 doses of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine.\n\nA Chicago Department of Health report projected a high probability of an outbreak of more than 100 cases without the city's rapid intervention.\n\n\"It required a lot of education and messaging because people wanted the answer to why I need to get vaccinated. We started listing out the reasons - parents won't be able to go to work, kids can't go to school, and even worse, kids can get sick and die,\" Ige said. \"It's 2025. We shouldn't be having children dying from measles in this day and age. We have the tools. We just have to amplify the message.\"\n\nNew Mexico's public health officials started spreading awareness of vaccinations immediately after they learned Texas had its first measles case and before New Mexico got its first case.\n\n\"We started setting up clinics and getting the ball rolling,\" Jimmy Masters, the southeast region director for the New Mexico Department of Health, said. \"Let's see what we can do to get people in the doors and vaccinated beforehand.\"\n\nNearly 9,000 New Mexicans have received measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine shots between Feb. 1 and March 10. During that same time period last year, officials vaccinated 5,342 people.\n\nTexas has held multiple vaccination clinics in the outbreak area, but according to the Texas Department of State Health Services, only 350 doses have been administered.\n\nNew Mexico has also emphasized its Vaxview website that keeps track of residents' immunizations, allowing concerned people to check within seconds if they need a shot. Texas has a vaccine tracking program known as ImmTrac2, but it's an opt-in program that doesn't have most adult records. If someone doesn't opt in by age 26, their records will not be retained.\n\n\"We told people to contact us to ensure their vaccine status is up to date,\" Masters said. \"If they aren't sure, just call the health office so we can find out for them. And if they don't have their records updated for the vaccine, then we can ask them to come in and take advantage of the clinics or come in as walk-ins.\"\n\nBecause of this, most of Lea County is considered immunized, Masters said, so public health officials in New Mexico don't view the outbreak as rapidly evolving.\n\nBack in Texas, the opposite is playing out. Advice from public health officials is seemingly ignored, and vaccine efforts are struggling.\n\n\"We need to have a consistent message from all levels. We need to reinforce the message that vaccines are safe and vaccines are how you prevent this, and we have concerns when other messages dilute this message,\" Huang said.\n\nTexas Department of State Health Services officials are also encouraging people to vaccinate, but whether people will listen is out of the agency's control.\n\n\"The only way to stop the virus from spreading is to get more people immunized. We are ...providing education about the severe complications associated with measles infection, and directing them to locations where they can get vaccinated,\" said Lara Anton, spokesperson for the state health agency.\n\nFennelly said the main difference between Lea County and Gaines County is the public acceptance of the vaccine and public health in general. He said if Texas wants to improve, there should be studies on why people are so hesitant to accept vaccines.\n\n\"We need to be asking why Gaines County? What are the concerns, and how do we, the health profession and public health officials, most effectively confront and allay those fears,\" he said. \"People shouldn't be more afraid of the vaccine than the disease.\"\n\nA person with measles visits a friend, another visits kids at a college, and the other has friends over. Public health departments in West Texas are trying to trace the spread of measles, since other than strongly suggesting people quarantine, there's nothing more local officials can do to prevent infected individuals from traveling.\n\n\"We shouldn't be surprised in this kind of environment that we will have more cases,\" said David Lakey, the vice chancellor for health affairs and the chief medical officer at the University of Texas System. \"I think we need to work with individuals to ensure they stay home during an event like this.\"\n\nState lawmakers have stripped control from cities and counties from implementing mandates, such as closing businesses and schools. While some of these laws apply only to COVID-19, public health experts say it has created an environment where state health officials can only offer suggestions to Texans with little enforcement, allowing measles to continue to spread.\n\n\"The state of Texas is taking it seriously and trying to balance how they approach this while respecting the laws of the state and also people's freedoms,\" Lakey said. \"They are doing it while also making sure that we are doing everything it can to identify people, provide vaccines, isolate individuals, and take all the other steps to address an event like this.\"\n\nWith young children particularly vulnerable to the disease, Lakey said hospitals must screen people entering hospitals.\n\nWells said there have been a couple of women who gave birth at a Lubbock hospital who were infected with measles or were recently exposed to it, and babies six months old or younger have needed treatment with immunoglobulin because of exposure.\n\n\"That's really why measles is so scary. It's so communicable, and it's so easy to enter some of the very vulnerable areas where babies don't have those vaccinations yet,\" she said. \"That's going to be day cares, schools, hospitals, pediatricians offices, and we're seeing those cases more and more as this outbreak continues.\"\n\nThis potential spread makes contact tracing necessary, but Wells said it is one of their region's most significant challenges besides testing. While a laboratory set up in Lubbock has cut down wait times for tests results from 72 hours to one day, Wells said rural Texas doesn't have the staff to track the travel of more than 270 people.\n\n\"This is going to be a large outbreak, and we are still on the side where we are increasing the number of cases, both because we're still seeing spread and also because we have increased testing capacity, so more people are getting tested,\" she said.\n\nNew Mexico has a lead investigator for contact tracing who interviews the patients, gathers medical records, establishes a point of contact, and organizes vaccinations for those who were potentially exposed to prevent spread.\n\nWhile West Texas officials try to follow the same policies, the health care system is decentralized, meaning the contact tracing is done by the local health authority first, and then, if necessary, the state gets involved and possibly, assistance from the CDC.\n\nChris Van Deusen, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said while the state is not necessarily struggling to contact trace, he acknowledges the extra manpower it requires.\n\n\"That also depends on the individuals talking with us and sharing that information. So that can be difficult, particularly when dealing with a more insular community. It can be difficult to make inroads, and that is why the local process is important,\" Van Deusen said.\n\nExperts say that as travel season ramps up and if Texas can't seem to stop the spread, states nationwide should prepare themselves for what may come.\n\n\"The message to health departments is be ready, and schools need to think about this and government officials because this really does have the potential to grow beyond these three states,\" Wells said.\n\nDisclosure: Texas Tech University and University of Texas System have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

Find a complete list of them here .\n\nIn 2019, the Keller Independent School District in North Texas looked a lot like its counterpart just 30 miles to the east in the Dallas suburb of Richardson. Each served about 35,000 children and had experienced sharp increases in the racial diversity of students in recent decades. Each was run by a school board that was almost entirely white.\n\nIn the five years since, the districts have followed strikingly divergent paths as culture war battles over how to teach race and gender exploded across the state.\n\nIn Keller, candidates backed by groups seeking to limit the teaching of race and gender took control of the school board and immediately passed sweeping policies that gave outsized power to any individual who wanted to prevent the purchase of books they believed to be unsuitable for children.\n\nThough more than half of Keller's students are from racially diverse backgrounds, the district in 2023 nixed a plan to buy copies of a biography of Black poet Amanda Gorman after a teacher at a religious private school who had no children in the district complained about this passage: \"Amanda realized that all the books she had read before were written by white men. Discovering a book written by people who look like her helped Amanda find her own voice.\" The passage, the woman wrote, \"makes it sound like it's okay to judge a book by the authors skin color rather than the content of the book.\"\n\nBoard members at the Richardson school district went in the opposite direction, even as they contended with similar pressure from groups aiming to rid the district of any materials that they claimed pushed critical race theory, an advanced academic concept that discusses systemic racism. The school board did not ban library books but instead allowed parents to limit their own children's access to them, keeping them available for other students.\n\nOne major difference contributed to the districts' divergence: the makeup of their school boards.\n\nThe way communities elect school board members plays a key, if often overlooked, role in whether racially diverse districts like Keller and Richardson experience takeovers by ideologically driven conservatives seeking to exert greater influence over what children learn in public schools, ProPublica and The Texas Tribune found. Since the pandemic, such groups have successfully leveraged the state's long-standing and predominantly at-large method of electing candidates to flip school boards in their direction.\n\nMost of Texas' 1,000 school districts use an at-large method, where voters can cast ballots for all candidates. Supporters say that allows for broader representation for students, but voting rights advocates argue that such systems dilute the power of voters of color. If board members are elected districtwide, there tends to be less diversity, according to research, which also shows that if they are elected by smaller geographic zones, candidates of color often have more success.\n\n\"What you're seeing happening in Texas is how at-large districts make it easy for somebody to come in, usually from the outside, and hijack the process and essentially buy a board,\" said Michael Li, senior counsel for the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonprofit public policy institute that champions small-donor campaign financing. \"Because of this conflux of factors - at-large elections and large amounts of outside money - it just sort of defeats the idea of representative democracy.\"\n\nProPublica and the Tribune examined 14 rapidly diversifying suburban school districts where children from diverse backgrounds now make up more than half of the student population. In the six districts that used at-large voting systems, well-funded and culture-war-driven movements successfully helped elect school board members who have moved aggressively to ban or remove educational materials that teach children about diversity, even in districts where a majority of children are not white. Nearly 70% of board members in such districts live in areas that are whiter than their district's population.\n\nEight nearby school systems with similar demographics employ single-member voting systems to elect school board candidates. Under the single-member system, voters within certain boundaries elect a board member who specifically represents their area. Candidates in those districts received less campaign support from ideologically driven political action committees, and none of the districts experienced school board takeovers fueled by culture war issues.\n\nAbout 150 Texas school districts have transitioned to a single-member system since the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which is intended to prevent voter discrimination and has brought greater racial representation to local governments. Richardson joined that list in 2019 after a former Black board member sued the district.\n\nSuch legal challenges, however, could soon become more difficult. In one of his first acts in office, President Donald Trump froze civil rights litigation against school districts accused of discriminating against minority groups, and many legal experts believe that under his administration, federal prosecutors will refuse to bring challenges against at-large systems. DOJ officials did not respond to questions from the news organizations.\n\nTrump, a staunch critic of diversity and inclusion programs, has threatened to cut federal funding to schools that he says are pushing \"inappropriate racial, sexual or political content onto the shoulders of our children.\"\n\nDistricts whose boards oppose sweeping efforts to restrict curriculum and books related to race and racism face even more headwinds in Texas. In January, Gov. Greg Abbott vowed to ban diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in public schools, a move that would expand the state's existing ban on college campuses. And Texas lawmakers continue to target the books students can access. One bill, authored by North Texas state Sen. Angela Paxton , the wife of Attorney General Ken Paxton , would require every district in the state to follow a version of Keller's library book purchase policy.\n\nThe president of the Keller board, Charles Randklev, did not respond to multiple requests for comment, and the district did not answer written questions. District officials have previously said that the board represents all students, not just those in a specific neighborhood or area.\n\nBut Laney Hawes, the parent of four students in the district and an outspoken critic of the school board, said the policy on library purchases spawned a backdoor channel to banning materials about race. That, she said, has deprived her children of reading books about Americans like Gorman that provide points of view they might not find otherwise.\n\n\"They have created a system that allows anyone in the community to complain about any book for any reason, and now that book is not on library shelves,\" said Hawes, who is white. She added that the book does not contain any sexually explicit material and was strictly targeted because it dealt with race.\n\n\"They just hate the racial undertones.\"\n\nSchool districts across Texas have drawn considerable attention for removing books from their shelves, but board members in Keller went further when they passed a policy in August 2022 that, in practice, allowed community members to block proposed purchases.\n\nStudents spoke out against the district's removal policies during a board meeting months later, pleading for access to books about race. One biracial student, who has since graduated, told the board that books about characters from different racial backgrounds helped her feel more accepted.\n\n\"All kids deserve to see themselves in literature,\" the student said. \"Racial minorities being written into a story does not instantly equate the book to being propaganda. Having books that mirror the experience of race is not pushing an agenda. It's simply documenting the hardships that consistently happen to most students of color that they're able to relate to. Concealing ideas just because they tell an uncomfortable truth is not protecting your children.\"\n\nThe students' pleas didn't sway the board, and by July 2023, challenges to such books began pouring in.\n\nOne person opposed the purchase of \"Jim Crow: Segregation and the Legacy of Slavery.\" The person, who did not provide their name, pointed to a photo of a young girl participating in a Black Lives Matter protest with the caption: \"Just as in the past, people continue fighting for change.\" They also took issue with this quote: \"You can't 'get over' something that is still happening. Which is why black Americans can't 'get over' slavery or Jim Crow.\"\n\nThe photo and the quotes, the book challenger said, were \"potentially CRT,\" showed the Black Lives Matter Movement in \"a positive light\" and claimed \"oppression is still happening.\"\n\nAnother person challenged the planned purchase of \"Our Skin: A First Conversation About Race,\" saying that the book started \"beautifully,\" but that \"unfortunately tenets of CRT, social justice, and anti-white activism are portrayed.\" The person, who used a pseudonym, did not offer specifics.\n\nAdministrators removed those books, the Gorman biography and 26 others from the purchase list after receiving the complaints, according to district officials. Librarians can reinstate books on future lists, but 75% of those flagged for further review never made it to the shelves, an online search of district libraries shows. That includes the three books about race.\n\nHawes, who heads two PTA groups at her children's schools, said book challenges and complaints have come from allies of school board members. In 2022, Patriot Mobile Action, a North Texas Christian nationalist PAC funded by a cellphone company, spent more than $115,000 supporting three ideologically driven conservatives running for control of the school board.\n\nLeigh Wambsganss, Patriot Mobile's spokesperson and executive director of the PAC, declined to comment but said in a 2022 podcast that the PAC chose candidates based on their Christian conservative views and sought out those who \"absolutely would stand against critical race theory.\" Patriot Mobile supported eight candidates in three other North Texas districts that used at-large voting during the same election cycle. All of them won their races.\n\n\"We weren't prepared for what was coming,\" Hawes said. \"We were literally up against a machine.\"\n\nAnother PAC, KISD Family Alliance, spent $50,000 to help elect the same Keller school board candidates. Its donors included conservative activist Monty Bennett, who previously told the Tribune that he believes schools have been taken over by ideologues \"pushing their outlandish agendas.\" Neither Bennett nor the PAC's treasurer responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe slate of Keller candidates, whose combined campaign war chests dwarfed that of their opponents' by a more than 4 to 1 margin, focused their agendas squarely on culture war issues related to library books and curriculum.\n\n\"While I have many priorities I want to focus on, if concerns over child safety, and sexualization and politicization of children make me a one-issue candidate, so be it. I will be a one-issue candidate all day long,\" Joni Shaw Smith wrote on her campaign website. Smith, who is now a board member, declined to comment.\n\nHer election contributed to what would become a sweep of the seven seats on the board. Five of those seats are held by board members who live in the city of Keller, where three-quarters of residents are white and the median household income of more than $160,000 is among the highest in the state.\n\nMost of the Keller district's 42 schools, however, are located in the more diverse neighborhoods of Fort Worth.\n\nThirty miles away, the makeup of Richardson's school board changed dramatically after the district settled a lawsuit filed in 2018 by David Tyson Jr. He argued that the continued use of at-large voting to select candidates was a \"relic of the district's segregated past.\"\n\nTyson became the district's first Black board member when he was elected in 2004. After he retired in 2010, he watched with growing consternation as no candidates from diverse backgrounds followed in his footsteps, even though students of color accounted for nearly 70% of the district's population.\n\nFrustrated, Tyson sued Richardson, challenging its system for electing candidates under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He and Richardson officials settled the lawsuit in 2019, and the district converted primarily to a system in which candidates needed to live within specific boundaries and receive a majority of votes from residents who also lived within those boundaries to be elected.\n\nAs ideologically driven candidates swept Keller school board elections, similar efforts played out differently in Richardson. In 2022, two candidates supported by groups seeking to limit instruction and library books that deal with race and gender ran against two candidates of color with differing views. A local PAC that accused the district of teaching \"CRT nonsense\" in a mailer hired the same Republican campaign consulting firm that was working in support of the Keller candidates.\n\nDespite being outspent 2-to-1, the candidates of color won their elections. Their wins gave Richardson four board members of diverse backgrounds, a remarkable evolution from an all-white board just three years earlier. And, as nearby districts began mass removals of library books dealing with race and gender, the Richardson school board embraced an \"opt-out\" process to give concerned parents control over their children's reading \"without impacting the choices of other families who may have different values, wishes or expectations.\" Opponents say opt-out systems do not go far enough in protecting students from materials they deem objectionable.\n\n\"Single-member districts benefited us in making sure our school board maintains the diversity, and diversity of thought, we have, and not just fall into those culture wars,\" said Vanessa Pacheco, one of the board members who won.\n\nPacheco said not being consumed by such fights allowed the board to focus on \"real stuff\" like dual-language classes for elementary students, expanding pre-K opportunities and scheduling school events for parents in the evenings and on weekends to account for working families.\n\nSo striking was the district's atmosphere following the 2022 election that a Dallas Morning News commentary dubbed Richardson a \"no-drama district\" in a sea of school boards consumed by fights over race and gender.\n\nTyson, whose lawsuit set the stage for the Richardson school board's dramatic transformation, said that the shift in voting methods has accomplished what he had hoped for.\n\n\"The goal was to get representation,\" he said. \"We're a majority-minority school district, and so we need to have a majority-minority representation on the school board.\"\n\nHawes watched as voters down the road in Richardson rejected candidates seeking to limit what the district's diverse student body could read and learn. She watched as the board itself grew increasingly diverse. And she watched with a touch of envy as the district embraced the idea that parents and community members who opposed certain books should not make decisions for every child in the district.\n\nWith Richardson as their north star, Hawes and a growing number of concerned parents began discussing ways to force the Keller school district to adopt what they believed was a more representative voting system. It wasn't just a question of race for Hawes. It was also about geographic diversity. Board members who live in the city of Keller hold a majority, even though less than a third of students in the district attend schools there.\n\nSo last year, Hawes and other concerned parents met with law firms and the NAACP and began planning a petition drive that would require the board to hold an election to do away with at-large voting. Members planned to meet in January to finalize a strategy.\n\nThen, in mid-January, the Keller school board shocked many in the community by proposing to split the district in two, separating the whiter, more affluent city of Keller to the east from the neighborhoods of northern Fort Worth, which are home to the majority of the district's students, including many who are low income. Like many districts in the state, Keller faces a massive budget shortfall.\n\nRandklev, the board president, defended the split as financially beneficial for both districts in a Facebook post last month. He also wrote that \"neighboring school districts have been forced into single-member districts, and that's a no-win situation regardless of where you live.\" He did not explain his position but said the proposed split \"could provide programming opportunities that best reflect local community goals and values and foster greater parent and community involvement.\"\n\nBut many parents, including Dixie Davis, who previously ran unsuccessfully for the board, said the proposed change would leave the vast majority of the district's low-income student population, and most of its students of color, with uncertain access to facilities like an advanced learning center and the district's swimming complex.\n\nOn Friday, board members abandoned plans to divide the school district in two, citing the cost of restructuring the district's debt. But their push to split the district has further energized efforts by some parents to do away with at-large voting. Brewer Storefront, the same law firm that fought to change the voting system in Richardson, has filed a similar legal challenge in federal court against Keller and concerned parents have launched a petition drive to force the district to vote on its at-large system. The district has not yet filed a response to the lawsuit and did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\n\"With the momentum and uproar around this proposed district split, it's now or never to get this done,\" Davis said. \"It'll be a huge uphill battle, but this is our best shot.\"\n\nLexi Churchill , ProPublica and The Texas Tribune, and Jessica Priest , The Texas Tribune, contributed research.\n\nTwo people have been arrested and charged with performing illegal abortions at a Houston-area health clinic, the first criminal charges brought under the state's near-total abortion ban.\n\nMaria Margarita Rojas, 48, a midwife, and Jose Ley, her employee, were charged with the illegal performance of an abortion, as well as practicing medicine without a license. The abortion charge is a second-degree felony, which comes with up to 20 years in prison.\n\nRojas, who identified herself as \"Dr. Maria,\" operated a network of clinics in Waller, Cypress and Spring. According to a news release from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, the clinics \"unlawfully employed unlicensed individuals who falsely presented themselves as licensed medical professionals.\" Rojas, with Ley's assistance, attempted an abortion on a person identified as E.G. on two separate occasions in March, according to court records. In its bail motion, the state says Rojas also performed an abortion in Harris County earlier this year.\n\nCourt records show Rojas was first arrested on March 6, charged with practicing medicine without a license and given a $10,000 bond. She was again arrested Monday morning, alongside Ley, and charged with practicing medicine without a license and performing illegal abortions.\n\nWaller County District Attorney Sean Whittmore told The Texas Tribune that Paxton's office brought the case to his attention. The Office of the Attorney General does not have independent prosecutorial authority in Texas, but Whittmore, a former assistant attorney general who was appointed district attorney by Gov. Greg Abbott in December 2023, said he invited the state to handle the prosecution. Whittmore said the case will next go to a grand jury to consider indictment.\n\nThe state recommended Rojas and Ley each be held on a million dollar bond. On Monday, a Waller County judge ordered their bonds set at $500,000 for the abortion-related charges and $200,000 for the medical license charges.\n\nAbortion is banned in Texas, except in narrow circumstances to save the life of a pregnant patient. The law does not allow for the person who terminated their pregnancy to be prosecuted.\n\n\"In Texas, life is sacred. I will always do everything in my power to protect the unborn, defend our state's pro-life laws, and work to ensure that unlicensed individuals endangering the lives of women by performing illegal abortions are fully prosecuted,\" Paxton said in a statement. \"Texas law protecting life is clear, and we will hold those who violate it accountable.\"\n\nCalls to Rojas' clinics were not immediately answered Monday. Holly Shearman, a midwife who runs Tomball Birth Center, where Rojas worked part-time providing prenatal care, said she was \"shocked\" by the news of her arrest. She described Rojas as a devout Catholic and skilled midwife whose clinics provided health care to a primarily Spanish-speaking, low-income community.\n\n\"I don't believe it for one second,\" she said about the allegations. \"I've known her for eight years and I've never heard her talk about anything like that. I just can't picture Maria being involved in something like this.\"\n\nRobert Morris, Texas megachurch pastor and former Trump adviser, indicted for child sex crimes \" was first published by The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan media organization that informs Texans - and engages with them - about public policy, politics, government and statewide issues.\n\nRobert Morris, the Dallas-area megachurch pastor who resigned last year amid sexual abuse allegations, has been indicted in Oklahoma for child sex crimes that date back to the 1980s.\n\nMorris is a former spiritual adviser to President Donald Trump , and Gateway - one of the nation's largest megachurches - has been particularly active in politics. In 2020, Trump held a \"Roundtable on Transition to Greatness\" there that was attended by then-U.S. Attorney General William Barr and other prominent Republicans.\n\nMorris faces five counts of lewd or indecent acts with a child, the Oklahoma Attorney General's Office said in a Wednesday evening press release.\n\nThe indictment comes less than a year after Morris resigned from Gateway Church in Southlake after an adult woman, Cindy Clemishire, said Morris repeatedly sexually assaulted her while she was a child in Oklahoma in the 1980s. Morris was at the time working as a traveling preacher.\n\nIn a Wednesday text message, Clemshire said through an attorney that she was grateful for the indictments.\n\n\"After almost 43 years, the law has finally caught up with Robert Morris for the horrific crimes he committed against me as a child,\" she said. \"Now, it is time for the legal system to hold him accountable. My family and I are deeply grateful to the authorities who have worked tirelessly to make this day possible and remain hopeful that justice will ultimately prevail.\"\n\nClemshire's disclosures last summer set off a political maelstrom in Texas and nationally, and prompted prominent Republicans to call for Morris to resign. Among those who said he should step down was Rep. Nate Schatzline, a Fort Worth Republican.\n\nSchatzline is a pastor at Mercy Culture Church, a Tarrant County congregation that was founded with financial support from Gateway. Since then, Mercy Culture has become an epicenter of fundamentalist Christian movements and a staple of that Tarrant County GOP often hosting political events and figures.\n\nGateway has been similarly active in local politics: Ahead of contentious local school board elections in 2021, the church was accused of violating federal rules on political activity by churches after it displayed the names of candidates, including some church members, who were running for office.\n\nMorris denied the allegations at the time, saying that the church was not endorsing candidates but thought the church's roughly 71,000 members would \"want to know if someone in the family and this family of churches is running.\"\n\nTexas is facing its worst measles outbreak in decades, as cases have jumped from two to 124 in just one month. A child is dead, 18 more are hospitalized and the worst is likely still ahead, public health experts say, as Texas' decreasing vaccination rates leave swaths of the state exposed to the most contagious virus humans currently face.\n\nState and local health officials are setting up vaccine clinics and encouraging people to get the shot, which is more than 97% effective at warding off measles.\n\nBut neither Gov. Greg Abbott nor lawmakers from the hardest hit areas have addressed the outbreak publicly in press conferences, social media posts or public calls for people to consider getting vaccinated. State and local authorities in West Texas have not yet enacted more significant measures that other places have adopted during outbreaks, like excluding unvaccinated students from school before they are exposed, or enforcing quarantine after exposure.\n\nThe response to Texas' first major public health crisis since COVID is being shaped by the long-term consequences of the pandemic, experts say - stronger vaccine hesitancy, decreased trust in science and authorities, and an unwillingness from politicians to aggressively push public health measures like vaccination and quarantine.\n\n\"Everybody is so sensitive to the vaccine topic due to COVID,\" said Ector County Judge Dustin Fawcett. \"We need to be very careful about how we address this topic ... Our job is to provide the resources, not to tell people what they need to do.\"\n\nIf there was ever an appetite for more aggressive government response to a disease outbreak, it's long gone in Texas, said Catherine Troisi, an infectious disease epidemiologist at UTHealth Houston.\n\n\"I think there's less political will now\" than before COVID, she said. \"Texas is such an independent state. People don't want to be told what to do, forgetting that what they do can affect others. And measles is an example of that.\"\n\nWhen Clark County, Washington identified its third measles case in January 2019, the county quickly declared a public health emergency. The state soon followed suit.\n\n\"You gotta jump on this,\" said public health director Dr. Alan Melnick. \"Measles is one where you have to jump on it right away, and all hands on deck.\"\n\nThe county ordered all unvaccinated students in the county to stay home from school for 21 days, whether or not they'd been exposed. Melnick said this was a difficult decision, but he saw it as the only way to stop the highly contagious disease from spreading like wildfire through the schools.\n\n\"It doesn't matter whether it's rural or urban. If you have congregate settings and if you have susceptible, exposed people, you have to do it,\" he said. \"Or you're not going to get control over this.\"\n\nClark County's outbreak ended four months later, with 71 total cases and no deaths. The public health response cost $2.3 million . Melnick said Texas' fast rising case counts worried him, and he was shocked that unvaccinated students in the area were still being allowed to go to school.\n\n\"I'm just blown away,\" he said. \"This is not politics. I'm just talking science and medicine here.\"\n\nSchool districts in Texas are required to exclude unvaccinated students for at least 21 days after they are exposed to measles. Because measles is so contagious and can remain in the air for up to two hours after an infected person has left the area, large numbers of students could be excluded from school at once, Texas Department of State Health Services spokesperson Lara Anton said.\n\nBut to proactively exclude unvaccinated students before they are known to be exposed requires the Texas health commissioner to declare a public health emergency, which can be activated when there is a health threat that potentially poses a risk of death or severe illness or harm to the public. Anton said there are no plans to declare an emergency at this time, noting that more than 90% of Texans are vaccinated for measles.\n\nState and local authorities are also recommending that unvaccinated people who have been exposed to measles quarantine at home for 21 days. But that quarantine period is not enforced or tracked, Anton said.\n\nIn Ector County, where there have been two confirmed cases, Fawcett said he doesn't anticipate state or local authorities pursuing widespread shutdowns like during COVID.\n\n\"We haven't really been given guidance of what perhaps even we should do\" in case of a county outbreak, he said. \"My best guess is to provide resources and information. There's not going to be a call to quarantine, or any of that, unless an outbreak happens at a particular educational facility.\"\n\nIn a statement, Andrew Mahaleris, Abbott's press secretary, said Texas was prepared to \"deploy all necessary resources to ensure the safety and health of Texans,\" noting that DSHS was helping local authorities with epidemiology, immunization and specimen collection, and had activated the State Medical Operations Center to coordinate the response.\n\nHouse Speaker Dustin Burrows , a Republican from Lubbock, said in a statement that he was closely monitoring the situation, and was praying for the family who tragically lost their child.\n\n\"At this time, there are no local unmet needs, but we are remaining vigilant and will respond as needed,\" he said.\n\nState Rep. Ken King and state Sen. Kevin Sparks , Republicans who represent Gaines County, did not respond to requests for comment about the measles outbreak. Neither they nor Abbott or Burrows have posted publicly about the outbreak.\n\nThe last few weeks have felt like deja vu for Lubbock public health authority Dr. Ron Cook. A deadly disease is on the warpath. There's a vaccine that can save lives. But too many in his community simply won't take it.\n\n\"There's all kinds of social media stuff, anecdotal treatments, or people saying, 'let's have a measles party,' or this is just big government overreach,\" he said.\n\nCook and his team are having to battle long-standing misinformation about the measles vaccine, as well as new concerns from people who developed anti-vaccine views during the pandemic, he said. The number of people requesting vaccine exemptions for their children has almost doubled since 2018, to almost 100,000 families in 2024.\n\nAnytime a community drops below 95% vaccination status, they are vulnerable to a measles outbreak, Troisi said. Gaines County, the epicenter of the outbreak, has among the lowest vaccination rates in the state at 82% in 2024 but half of counties in Texas are below the recommended vaccination rate.\n\nAerial view of the West Texas town of Seminole on Feb. 20, 2025. Credit: Eli Hartman for The Texas Tribune\n\nThat's a lot of people who might get the measles, Troisi said.\n\n\"This is entirely due to low vaccination rates. Measles spreads because kids aren't vaccinated,\" she said. \"And kids aren't vaccinated because there is so much misinformation out there. There's so much distrust of government.\"\n\nThe only answer, other than letting measles rip through whole communities of unvaccinated children, is to increase vaccination rates, Troisi said. Katherine Wells, public health director for the City of Lubbock, said they've vaccinated more than 100 people over the weekend, many of whom said they felt like measles wasn't a big enough threat to justify getting the shot before now.\n\nIn previous outbreaks, some areas have taken more extreme measures to enforce vaccination, either by revoking religious exemptions or, in the case of an outbreak in New York in 2019, mandating people in the most impacted areas get the shot, with a $1,000 fine for non-compliance. The Orthodox Jewish community at the heart of the outbreak challenged the order in court, but it was upheld by a judge.\n\n\"A fireman need not obtain the informed consent of the owner before extinguishing a house fire,\" Judge Lawrence Knipel wrote in his ruling. \"Vaccination is known to extinguish the fire of contagion.\"\n\nBut Troisi and other public health experts don't anticipate similar action in Texas. Since the pandemic, Texas' elected leaders have shown more support for the opposite, opposing vaccine mandates and loosening Texas' vaccine exemption rules. There are bills proposed this session that would make it easier for parents to opt out of vaccines and prohibit schools from excluding unvaccinated students during an outbreak like the one Texas is currently facing.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the current measles outbreak will impact the direction of these bills, but Dr. Peter Hotez, a leading vaccine expert and dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, said he's not optimistic that this will be a turning point.\n\n\"There was no auto-correction after 40,000 Texans needlessly died because they refused the COVID vaccine,\" he said. \"It just spilled over more to childhood immunizations. So I don't know what brings us back, exactly.\"\n\nAn outbreak of measles in West Texas has grown to 58 cases, including four patients who said they were vaccinated against the disease.\n\nTen more cases were added to the Department of State Health Services' count Tuesday, including for the first time the four who self-reported they were vaccinated against the disease, according to the agency's latest update . A spokesperson with DSHS said health investigators are in the process of confirming whether the four were, in fact, vaccinated against measles and how many doses they may have received.\n\nDSHS initially warned of two cases of measles in underage children in Gaines County in late January. The disease has since spread to four other counties and 58 people - most of whom are children - but 45 of the cases are still in Gaines County. Lubbock County, which reported a single case, is the largest county in which a case was reported.\n\nThirteen patients have been hospitalized, according to DSHS, and spokesperson Lara Anton said officials are still unsure what the initial source of exposure was. The outbreak is Texas' largest in more than 30 years, and comes at a time where vaccination rates among children have dropped . Almost 97% of Texas kindergarteners were vaccinated against measles in 2019, compared to 94.3% in 2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nDespite the increase in infections among those potentially vaccinated, a DSHS spokesperson said virologists do not currently see \"any evidence\" the measles virus present in the patients has mutated into a vaccine-resistant variant.\n\nThe measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, commonly referred to as the MMR vaccine, is about 93% effective with one dose and 97% effective with two doses, according to the CDC. The first dose is usually administered to infants aged 12 to 15 months, while the second dose is given to kids between 4 and 6. Follow-up doses are not required if patients received them in their youth, and older eligible patients can be immunized at any period.\n\nMeasles' symptoms include high fever, watery eyes, runny nose and rashes, which can be minor or full-body. Symptoms can become serious and even fatal, especially among children and those who are unvaccinated. One in five unvaccinated people who are infected are hospitalized, according to the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.\n\nPart of what makes measles so infectious is the virus' ability to stay active long after a patient has left, as the virus can stay active for up to two hours in the air and on surfaces, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nAnton said the outbreak has especially affected the large Mennonite community in Gaines County. While the Mennonite Church does not forbid or disavow vaccinations, Anton said their communities tend to be undervaccinated, which drastically increases the likelihood of infection. Measles has a 90% infection rate among unvaccinated people who are exposed to the virus, according to WHO.\n\nAlongside the decrease in vaccination numbers, Texas lawmakers have introduced over 20 bills into the Legislature aimed at loosening vaccine requirements across the state with the support of vaccine-hesitant or anti-vaccine groups.\n\nWASHINGTON - Sen. John Cornyn is facing what could be the toughest primary challenge of his career as the state party takes a decidedly rightward turn and his popularity among Republican voters dips from 2020 highs.\n\nIt's a remarkable turn for the four-term senator who - before last year losing his bid for party leader - had never lost an election in his life, served in the highest echelons of the Senate Republican Conference, had an early hand in the Republican takeover of Texas and secured a host of legislative wins directly impacting the state.\n\nAttorney General Ken Paxton has repeatedly hinted that he's interested in challenging Cornyn in the Republican primary, saying on Fox News he could be making moves soon.\n\n\"As far as my plans, right now, I don't know. I'm just going to serve as attorney general,\" Paxton said. \"I'm looking potentially at the U.S. Senate. We'll look at that over the next couple of months.\"\n\nCornyn's office confirmed last week that he was still in the race.\n\nBut polling suggests that if Cornyn and Paxton were to have a primary today, Paxton would win. Among Republican-identifying voters, Cornyn has an approval rating of 48% - one of the lowest of state-wide office holders, according to a polling aggregate by the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin . Paxton, meanwhile, has an approval rating of 60% among Republican-identifying voters. Texas' other senator, Ted Cruz , has an approval rating of 78% among Republicans.\n\nIf Cornyn were to retire, several members of the U.S. House could also launch a bid. U.S. Reps. Beth Van Duyne of Irving, Wesley Hunt of Houston and Ronny Jackson of Amarillo have all been discussed in Republican circles, though none have publicly vocalized their intentions as Paxton has.\n\nJackson was Trump's physician in the White House, and Trump's endorsement in his first race for Congress in 2020 helped Jackson beat controversy in the primary over allegations of workplace abuse during his time in the White House. Jackson is an impressive fundraiser for a House member in a deeply red seat, raising more than $6 million in the last election cycle. He invested in Spanish-language ads in 2022 to raise his name recognition among voters outside his district. Jackson's campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nVan Duyne was the first mayor to endorse Trump when she was mayor of Irving, and was the 2024 Texas GOP victory chair, campaigning for Cruz and Trump.\n\nHer campaign didn't say if she was considering entering the primary. \"Beth is focused on delivering President Trump's America First agenda: secure borders, confronting Mexican cartels, tax relief and lower costs for working families, American energy dominance, and an economy with rising wages,\" her campaign said in a statement.\n\nHunt led much of the Trump campaign's outreach to Black men in the last election cycle and interviewed to be his Defense secretary late last year. Trump endorsed Hunt in his Congressional races in 2020 and 2022, and Hunt has proven himself a prodigious fundraiser, raising more than $7 million in his first U.S. House race. Hunt was recognized with a primetime speaking slot at the Republican National Convention this year. Hunt's campaign declined to comment for this story.\n\nBut Cornyn is not making any signs of stopping. He has taken on more committee assignments this year - several that will be central to some of the biggest policy priorities of the Trump presidency. He finished 2024 with $4.1 million in cash on hand, according to a source briefed on his fundraising operation, and has been meeting with some of his biggest supporters throughout Texas since the beginning of the year.\n\nWhen asked if he would still run for reelection shortly after losing the leadership race, Cornyn said, \"absolutely.\"\n\nCornyn has faced primary challenges from the right before and mobilized his formidable operation to quash them.\n\nHe ran against a crowded primary in 2014 with seven Republicans hoping to unseat him, including then-U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman . The Friendswood Republican at the time cited Cornyn's distaste for Sen. Ted Cruz's filibuster against government funding legislation that would fund the Affordable Care Act. Cornyn, who was Senate minority whip at the time, said the tactic was not effective, though he shared Cruz's antipathy for the health care law.\n\nCornyn obliterated the opposition. He won his primary with 62% of the vote. Stockman secured just over 17%. Cornyn raised over $11 million in that race. Stockman raised just over $115,000.\n\nIn 2020, Cornyn faced a potential challenge from U.S. Rep. Pat Fallon , R-Sherman, who was then a state senator. Fallon said at the time that Cornyn \"has had 18 years. Some of the things you agree with until you check under the hood\" as he launched an exploratory committee into a Senate run.\n\nBut Cornyn was armed not only with his bountiful funds but also endorsements from across the Republican ideological spectrum. Cruz endorsed Cornyn in December 2018 - two years early and less than a month after securing his own victory against Democratic U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke. Gov. Greg Abbott , Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and Trump also endorsed Cornyn ahead of the 2020 primary.\n\nFallon eventually decided against running in the primary and ran for the U.S. House that year. Cornyn won reelection handily. Fallon did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThis time, Cornyn has not yet secured the endorsements that helped stave off a primary challenge in 2020. Cruz, whom Cornyn helped with over $500,000 in his own competitive reelection campaign last year, has not endorsed in the Senate primary.\n\nWhen asked if he had spoken to Cornyn about endorsing him, Cruz said \"it's early to worry about politics in a race two years away. John Cornyn and I have worked together very closely for the last 13 years, and we will continue to work together very closely.\"\n\n\"We'll have plenty of time to have those conversations,\" Cruz continued when asked why he was not endorsing early like in 2018. He had the same answer when asked about a potential Paxton run.\n\nCruz and Paxton operate in overlapping orbits, with senior staff for Cruz previously serving in Paxton's operation. Cruz also defended Paxton through his impeachment and enjoys considerably higher popularity among the conservative base than Cornyn.\n\nCruz notably voted for one of Cornyn's opponents , the right-wing Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, in the first round of voting in the majority leader race. He would not say if he voted for Cornyn or Sen. John Thune of South Dakota in the second round. Thune won the majority leader race with 29 out of 53 votes.\n\nAbbott's and Patrick's campaigns did not respond when asked if they would endorse Cornyn.\n\nThe endorsement that could count the most is Trump's. His endorsement has catapulted multiple Republicans through crowded primaries in Texas.\n\nThe president has so far made no indication whom he would support. With the primary more than a year away, there's plenty of time to audition for the presidential blessing.\n\nFew have done more for Trump's cause - and done so more brazenly - than Paxton. He led a lawsuit challenging the results of the 2020 election and repeatedly sued the Biden administration to stop its legislative agenda. Trump gave the attorney general a special shout out during his inauguration this year. Trump even floated his name for U.S. attorney general last year.\n\nCornyn, meanwhile, has appeared averse toward Trump in the past. He told reporters in May 2023 that Trump's \"time has passed him by,\" suggesting that Trump didn't have enough appeal in a general election to win. He also expressed concern in a June interview with CBS Texas about Trump's federal indictment on keeping classified documents in his private residence, saying Trump had \"created a circumstance for himself, which is, I think, very serious.\"\n\nCornyn eventually endorsed Trump after he won the New Hampshire primary.\n\nSince Trump won back the presidency, Cornyn has not given Trump any reason to criticize him. He has steadfastly supported all of Trump's nominees , even his most controversial ones. He voted to advance Tulsi Gabbard, the former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii, to serve as Trump's director of national intelligence, despite misgivings even among Republicans about her past comments supporting Russian President Vladimir Putin and ousted Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.\n\nCornyn has also joined Abbott in calling for the federal government to reimburse Texas for Operation Lone Star and is a founding member of the DOGE Caucus, aligning himself with the cost-cutting mission spearheaded by Elon Musk.\n\nDespite his electoral doubts, Cornyn's support for the president within the chamber has been consistent through the years. He was Senate majority whip during the first years of Trump's presidency, herding his conference to support the president's agenda on tax cuts and judicial nominations - including the controversial appointment of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Cornyn voted more than 92% of the time with Trump's agenda during his first presidency, and he voted for every Trump appointee in both the Executive and Judiciary at the time.\n\nThat hasn't spared him from Trump's criticisms, particularly over his work on the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, a gun safety bill passed following the Robb Elementary shooting in Uvalde. The bill was the first gun safety bill signed into law in decades and invested heavily in community safety measures and limited the ability of  high-risk individuals to access firearms.\n\nTrump called Cornyn a Republican in name only for his support of the bill, posting on social media at the time: \"The deal on 'Gun Control' currently being structured and pushed in the Senate by the Radical Left Democrats, with the help of Mitch McConnell, RINO Senator John Cornyn of Texas, and others, will go down in history as the first step in the movement to TAKE YOUR GUNS AWAY. Republicans, be careful what you wish for!!!\"\n\nCornyn and Paxton have had a storied distaste for each other. Before his time in the Senate, Cornyn served as the first Republican Texas attorney general in more than a century. He transformed the position from a sleepy government office to a major force in conservative politics.\n\nCornyn said he was \"disturbed\" by Paxton's various legal troubles and that it was an \"embarrassment\" that they had not been resolved before Paxton's 2022 primary.\n\nPaxton has accused Cornyn of being a Republican in name only, urging someone to primary him. He rallied the MAGA base to denounce Cornyn's bid for majority leader, writing on social media: \"Republicans deserve better in their next leader and Texans deserve another conservative senator.\"\n\nThe differences go beyond personality. Paxton said in early 2024 that it was \"unbelievable\" that Cornyn would vote for $95 billion in military aid for U.S. allies. Foreign military aid emerged as a major fault line between traditional defense Republicans and the far right last year. Cornyn shot back that Paxton's \"criminal defense lawyers are calling to suggest you spend less time pushing Russian propaganda and more time defending long-standing felony charges.\"\n\nWhen Cornyn was eyeing a run for Senate majority leader, Paxton was vocally against the bid, writing on social media that Cornyn was \"anti-Trump, anti-gun, and will be focused on his highly competitive primary campaign in 2026.\"\n\nCornyn replied: \"Hard to run from prison, Ken.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Texas Tribune at https://www.texastribune.org/2025/02/11/cornyn-paxton-possible-senate-primary/ .\n\nThe Texas Tribune is a member-supported, nonpartisan newsroom informing and engaging Texans on state politics and policy.

While transgender care for minors was legal in 2022 when the records were sourced, the hospital publicly had said it would end providing the care after Gov. Greg Abbott ordered the parents of children undergoing transition-related care be investigated for child abuse. The Texas Supreme Court later ruled Abbott had no grounds to order the Department of Family and Protective Services to investigate the families.\n\nHaim never contested that he leaked the records, however he did maintain throughout the legal proceedings that no laws were broken because personally identifiable patient information was not disclosed.\n\nThe case quickly became a lightning rod for anti-transgender activists and politicians who describe Haim as a whistleblower for exposing an alleged \"secret transgender program.\" Transgender care in Texas, especially for minors, has long been under fire by Republicans in the state. Only weeks after Rufo published the records provided by Haim, Texas passed an outright ban on transition-related care for minors.\n\nTransition-related care can include anything from mental health counseling and social affirmation of gender through pronoun changes or medical interventions like puberty blockers or surgery, however instances of physical treatment among youth are rare .\n\nThe dismissal follows an X post from Haim's wife Andrea accusing Lowery of \"weaponizing the DOJ\" against her husband. The alleged weaponization of the justice system also has been a highlight of President Donald Trump's campaign, who signed an executive order Monday claiming the Biden Administration had a systematic campaign of weaponized prosecution.\n\nTexas House Rep. Brian Harrison , R-Midlothian, was one of dozens of people congratulating Haim for the dropped charges, and said he spoke with Haim on the phone to congratulate him directly for the update.\n\n\"We still must get to the bottom of the potential crimes he exposed, for which he should've been praised... not prosecuted,\" Harrison said in an X post Friday.\n\nThe case was set to begin a jury trial on Feb. 10, according to the court's website.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Texas Tribune at https://www.texastribune.org/2025/01/24/transgender-care-data-leak-texas-childrens-hospital/ .\n\nThe Texas Tribune is a member-supported, nonpartisan newsroom informing and engaging Texans on state politics and policy. Learn more at texastribune.org.\n\nWhen President Donald Trump appeared in a New York courtroom last spring to face a slew of criminal charges, he was joined by a rotating cadre of lawyers, campaign aides, his family - and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.\n\nPaxton had traveled to be with Trump for what he described on social media as a \"sham of a trial\" and a \"travesty of justice.\" Trump was facing 34 counts of falsifying records in the case, which focused on hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential campaign to keep her from disclosing their sexual relationship.\n\n\"It's just sad that we're at this place in our country where the left uses the court system not to promote justice, not to enforce the rule of law, but to try to take out political opponents, and that's exactly what they're doing to him,\" Paxton said on a conservative podcast at the time .\n\n\"They've done it to me.\"\n\nA year earlier, the Republican-led Texas House of Representatives voted to impeach Paxton over allegations, made by senior officials in his office, that he had misused his position to help a political donor. Trump was not physically by Paxton's side but weighed in repeatedly on social media, calling the process unfair and warning lawmakers that they would have to contend with him if they persisted.\n\nWhen the Texas Senate in September 2023 acquitted Paxton of the impeachment charges against him, Trump claimed credit. \"Yes, it is true that my intervention through TRUTH SOCIAL saved Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton from going down at the hands of Democrats and some Republicans ...\" Trump posted on the social media platform he founded.\n\nThe acquittal, however, did not wholly absolve Paxton of the allegations brought by his former employees. The FBI has been investigating the same accusations since at least November 2020. And come Monday, when Trump is inaugurated for his second term, that investigation will be in the hands of his Department of Justice.\n\nPaxton and Trump have forged a friendship over the years, one that has been cemented in their shared political and legal struggles and their willingness to come to each other's aid at times of upheaval. Both have been the subjects of federal investigations, have been impeached by lawmakers and have faced lawsuits related to questions about their conduct.\n\n\"If there's one thing both guys share in common, people have been after them for a while in a big way. They've been under the gun. They've shared duress in a political setting,\" said Bill Miller, a longtime Austin lobbyist and Paxton friend. \"They've both been through the wringer, if you will. And I think there's a kinship there.\"\n\nNeither Trump nor Paxton responded to requests for comment or to written questions. Both men have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, claiming that they have been the targets of witch hunts by their political enemies, including fellow Republicans.\n\nTheir relationship is so cozy that Trump said he'd consider naming Paxton as his U.S. attorney general pick. He ultimately chose another political ally, former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi .\n\nAlthough Trump did not select Paxton, the two men will get yet another opportunity to have each other's backs now that he has returned to office, both when it comes to the federal investigation into Paxton and pushing forward the president's agenda.\n\nBefore and during Trump's first term, Paxton filed multiple lawsuits challenging policies passed under former President Barack Obama. He then aggressively pursued cases against President Joe Biden's administration after Trump lost reelection. Such lawsuits included efforts to stop vaccine mandates, to expedite the deportation of migrants and to block federal protections for transgender workers.\n\nTrump has supported Paxton over and over, not only as the Texas politician sought reelection but also as he faced various political and legal scandals. The president-elect's promises to exert more control over the Justice Department, which has traditionally operated with greater independence from the White House, could mark an end to the long-running investigation into Paxton, several attorneys said.\n\nJustice Department and FBI officials declined to comment on the story and the status of the investigation, but as recently as August, a former attorney general staffer testified before a grand jury about the case, Bloomberg Law reported . Paxton also referenced the FBI's four-year investigation of him during a speech in late December without mentioning any resolution on the case. The fact that Paxton hasn't been indicted could signal that investigators don't have a smoking gun, one political science professor told ProPublica and The Texas Tribune, but a former federal prosecutor said cases can take years and still result in charges being filed.\n\n\"As far as I'm aware, this is pretty unprecedented, this level of alliance and association between those two figures,\" said Matthew Wilson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.\n\nIn 2020, when then-U.S. Attorney General William Barr found no evidence to support Trump's claims that voter fraud turned the election results in his opponent's favor, Paxton emerged to take up the argument.\n\nHe became the first state attorney genera l to challenge Biden's win in court, claiming in a December 2020 lawsuit that the increased use of mail ballots in four battleground states had resulted in voter fraud and cost Trump the election.\n\nTrump eagerly supported the move on social media, writing, \"We will be INTERVENING in the Texas (plus many other states) case. This is the big one. Our Country needs a victory!\"\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court declined to take the case , ruling that Texas had no legal interest in how other states conduct their elections. Trump, however, didn't forget Paxton's loyalty.\n\nHe offered Paxton his full-throated endorsement during the 2022 primary race for attorney general against then-Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush. His decision to back Paxton, who was under federal criminal investigation at the time and had been indicted on state securities fraud charges, was a major blow to Bush, the grandson and nephew of two former Republican presidents. Bush had endorsed Trump for president even though Trump defeated his father, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, in the Republican primary and repeatedly disparaged his family.\n\nTrump properties in Florida and New Jersey served as locations for at least two Paxton campaign fundraisers over the course of that campaign. And at a rally in Robstown in South Texas, Trump repeated debunked claims that the election was stolen and said he wished Paxton had been with him at the White House at the time. \"He would've figured out that voter fraud in two minutes,\" Trump said.\n\nWhile Paxton pursued reelection, FBI agents executed a search warrant at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort as part of an investigation into how his administration handled thousands of government documents, many of them classified. Paxton led 10 other Republican state attorneys general in intervening in court on Trump's behalf, arguing in a legal filing that the Biden administration could not be trusted to act properly in the case.\n\nPaxton won another term in office in November 2022, but the celebration was short-lived. Six months later, the Texas House of Representatives considered impeaching him over misconduct allegations including bribery, abuse of office and obstruction related to his dealings with Nate Paul, a real estate developer and political donor. Paxton has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nHours before the House voted on whether to impeach Paxton, Trump weighed in on social media.\n\n\"I love Texas, won it twice in landslides, and watched as many other friends, including Ken Paxton, came along with me,\" he wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. \"Hopefully Republicans in the Texas House will agree that this is a very unfair process that should not be allowed to happen or proceed - I will fight you if it does. It is the Radical Left Democrats, RINOS, and Criminals that never stop. ELECTION INTERFERENCE! Free Ken Paxton, let them wait for the next election!\"\n\nDespite Trump's threat, the House voted 121-23 in May 2023 to impeach Paxton. The Senate then held a trial that September to determine Paxton's fate. \"Who would replace Paxton, one of the TOUGHEST & BEST Attorney Generals in the Country?\" Trump posted before the Senate acquitted Paxton.\n\nTrump is among the few people who understand what it's like to be under the kind of scrutiny Paxton has faced and how to survive it, Miller said.\n\n\"There is that quality [they share] of, 'Don't count me out,'\" he said. \"'If you're counting me out, you're making a mistake.'\"\n\nOn Monday, Trump will become the first president also to be a convicted felon. A jury found Trump guilty on all counts of falsifying records in the hush money case. A judge, however, ruled that he will not serve jail time in light of his election to the nation's highest office.\n\nTrump has repeatedly decried the case, as well as the Justice Department's investigations that resulted in him being charged in June 2023 with withholding classified documents and later with conspiring to overturn the 2020 election by knowingly pushing lies that the race was stolen. Jack Smith, the special counsel who led the DOJ investigations, dropped both cases after Trump's reelection. A Justice Department policy forbids prosecutions against sitting presidents, but in a DOJ report about the 2020 election released days before the inauguration, Smith asserted that his investigators had enough evidence to convict Trump had the case gone to trial.\n\nNot only have Paxton and Trump supported each other through turmoil that could have affected their political ambitions, they have taken similar tacks against those who have crossed them.\n\nAfter surviving his impeachment trial in 2023, Paxton promised revenge against Republicans who did not stand by him. He had help from Trump, who last year endorsed a challenger to Republican Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan, calling Paxton's impeachment \"fraudulent\" and an \"absolute embarrassment.\" Phelan, who has defended the House's decision to impeach Paxton, won reelection but resigned from his speaker post.\n\nFor his part, Trump has tried a legal strategy that Paxton has employed many times, using consumer protection laws to go after perceived political adversaries. In October, Trump sued CBS News over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Vice President Kamala Harris , saying the news organization's edits \"misled\" the public. Instead of accusing CBS of defamation, which is harder to prove, his lawsuit argues that the media company violated Texas' consumer protection act, which is supposed to protect people from fraud. The case is ongoing. In moving to dismiss the case, CBS' attorneys have said the Texas law was designed to safeguard people from deceptive business practices, \"not to police editorial decisions made by news organizations with which one disagrees.\" (Marc Fuller, one of the CBS attorneys, is representing ProPublica and the Tribune in an unrelated business disparagement case.)\n\nThe move indicates a broader, more aggressive approach that the Justice Department may pursue under the Trump administration, said Paul Nolette, director of the Les Aspin Center for Government at Marquette University, who researches attorneys general.\n\n\"It's a signal to me that, yes, the federal DOJ is going to follow the path of Paxton, and perhaps some other like-minded Republican AGs who have been using their office to also go after perceived enemies,\" Nolette said.\n\nOn Dec. 21 , six weeks after Trump won reelection, Paxton stepped onstage in a Phoenix convention center at the AmericaFest conference, hosted by the conservative organization Turning Point USA.\n\nThe event followed Trump's comeback win. It also represented a triumphant moment for Paxton: He'd not only survived impeachment, but prosecutors agreed earlier in the year to drop long-standing state securities fraud charges against him if he paid about $270,000 in restitution and performed community service.\n\nBut Paxton spent much of his 15-minute speech ticking off the grievances about what he claimed had been attacks on him throughout his career, including impeachment by \"supposed Republicans\" and the FBI case.\n\nHe praised Trump's selection of Bondi to run the DOJ. It was time to clean house in a federal agency that had become focused on \"political witch hunts and taking out people that they disagree with,\" Paxton said.\n\nBefore taking office, Trump threatened to fire and punish those within the Justice Department who were involved in investigations that targeted him. FBI director Christopher Wray, a Republican whom Trump appointed during his first term in office, announced in December that he would resign after the president-elect signaled that he planned to fire him. After facing similar threats, Smith, the special prosecutor who led the DOJ investigations, stepped down this month.\n\nIn his speech, Paxton made no mention of the agency's investigations into Trump, nor did he connect the DOJ to his own case. But a Justice Department that Trump oversees with a heavy-handed approach could benefit the embattled attorney general, several attorneys told ProPublica and the Tribune.\n\nTrump could choose to pardon Paxton before the case is officially concluded. He used pardons during his first presidency, including issuing one to his longtime strategist Steve Bannon and to Charles Kushner, his son-in-law's father. He's been vocal about his plans to pardon many of the Jan. 6 rioters on his first day in office.\n\nMore concerning, however, is if Trump takes the unusual approach of personally intervening in the federal investigation, something presidents have historically avoided because it is not a political branch of government, said Mike Golden, who directs the Advocacy Program at the University of Texas School of Law.\n\nAny Trump involvement would be more problematic because it would happen behind closed doors, while a pardon is public, Golden said.\n\n\"If the president pressures the Department of Justice to drop an investigation, a meritorious investigation against a political ally, that weakens the overall strength of the system of justice in the way a one-off pardon really doesn't,\" Golden said.\n\nMichael McCrum, a former federal prosecutor in Texas who did not work on the Paxton case, said \"we'd be fools to think that Mr. Paxton's relationship with the Trump folks and Mr. Trump personally wouldn't play some factor in it.\"\n\n\"I think that the case is going to die on the vine,\" McCrum said.\n\nMiller, Paxton's friend, agreed.\n\n\"I would expect his troubles are behind him.\"\n\n\" Texas GOP chair denies church-state separation as lawmakers, pastors prep for 'spiritual battle' \" was first published by The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan media organization that informs Texans - and engages with them - about public policy, politics, government and statewide issues.\n\nSign up for The Brief , The Texas Tribune's daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\n\nThe medical director of the Texas Medical Board has retired, less than two weeks after conservative lawmakers publicized his employment with a Planned Parenthood laboratory.\n\nDr. Robert Bredt has worked as medical director for the state medical licensing agency since 2012, earning $185,000 a year. While the members of the licensing board are appointed by Gov. Greg Abbott , the medical director role is hired by agency leadership.\n\nAccording to his resumé, Bredt also worked at Planned Parenthood South Texas Laboratory since 2011, as well as Genics Laboratory in Las Vegas and San Antonio since 2022. Bredt, 62, is also a professor, consultant and laboratory inspector.\n\nBredt submitted his retirement paperwork on Tuesday, which was also his last day of work, a medical board spokesperson said in an email. Bredt declined to comment.\n\nThis kerfuffle began not with a debate about reproductive health care, but rather, another highly politicized fight about COVID treatments. The Texas Medical Board has been locked in an ongoing legal battle with Dr. Mary Talley Bowden, a Houston ear, nose and throat doctor, about her anti-vaccine stances and use of ivermectin to treat COVID. In 2023, the board filed an official complaint against Bowden, alleging she violated the standard of care, failed to maintain patient-doctor confidentiality and acted unprofessionally by treating a COVID patient without examining them\n\nAfter she refused to settle, Bowden ended up before an administrative law judge through the State Office of Administrative Hearings. As part of that case, the Texas Medical Board filed a motion asking to introduce Bredt as an expert witness, to testify about the board's usual practices and procedures. The motion included Bredt's resumé, which showed his employment at a Planned Parenthood lab.\n\nState Rep. Brian Harrison , a conservative Republican from Midlothian and frequent critic of the medical board, said he made the decision to go public with this information \"within minutes\" after he learned about it.\n\n\"There's some real irony here in that in their zeal to prosecute a doctor, they had to make public that the medical director ... is literally also a Planned Parenthood employee,\" Harrison told The Texas Tribune on Wednesday.\n\nHe posted Bredt's resumé on X and sent Abbott a letter demanding Bredt's termination. He said he would file legislation to defund the medical board, and his office would call the agency every day until Bredt was fired.\n\n\"This fox must be removed from the guardianship of the henhouse,\" he wrote to Abbott.\n\nHarrison also said Abbott should direct all state agencies to ensure none of their employees work for Planned Parenthood. While there is no law or regulation prohibiting a state employee from also working at Planned Parenthood, the reproductive health care organization has long been enemy number one of Texas conservatives. The state sacrificed millions of federal dollars to keep Planned Parenthood providers out of the Medicaid program, leading dozens of family planning clinics to close in the process, and is currently trying to bankrupt Planned Parenthood with a $1.8 billion lawsuit.\n\nPlanned Parenthood clinics in Texas no longer provide abortions, but that has done little to reduce conservatives' vitriol towards the health care provider. In a letter sent to members of the Texas Medical Board just before the end of the year, calling for Bredt's termination, state Rep. Briscoe Cain , a Republican from Deer Park, called Planned Parenthood \"a criminal enterprise that profits off of killing babies.\"\n\nIn a statement, Planned Parenthood South Texas CEO Laura Terrill accused politicians of wasting \"valuable time and resources playing doctor in an act of political theatre.\"\n\n\"Dr. Bredt's work at Planned Parenthood South Texas (PPST) reflects his unwavering commitment to providing the highest standards of medical care,\" she wrote in a statement. \"Planned Parenthoods in Texas follow the law, full stop. We have, and always will, comply with state and federal regulations while focusing on what truly matters: delivering essential health care services to the tens of thousands of Texans who depend on us every day.\"\n\nHarrison said Wednesday that he is pleased Bredt no longer works for the state, but is outraged that he was hired in the first place. He wants an investigation into the medical board, and the executive branch's hiring practices, and said he may still push a bill to defund the board itself.\n\nThis is not the first time Harrison has led a charge to force a state entity to bow to his vision of conservative values. Last year, he claimed credit for Texas A&M getting rid of its LGBTQ studies minor, although the university said he played no role, and forced the Texas Workforce Commission to remove a line on its website saying it would investigate claims of discrimination based on gender identity.\n\nDisclosure: Planned Parenthood has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

They have picked fruits and vegetable in fields, cooked in restaurant kitchens, cleaned hospitals and started small businesses. They have become stitched into communities from El Paso to Beaumont.\n\nNow some of their employers worry that many of them could get deported when President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House.\n\nA number of Texas business leaders interviewed by the Tribune describe a sort of wait-and-see apprehension about Trump's pledged mass deportations. The impact any deportations could have on Texas' economy will largely depend on the specifics of what Trump does, business leaders say. But those specifics are not yet clear.\n\n\"I don't think any of us know exactly what's coming as far as policy - we've heard all of the rhetoric,\" said Andrea Coker of the North Texas Commission, a nonprofit that promotes the Dallas region.\n\nThe owner of a Rio Grande Valley agriculture import-export business who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of legal repercussions said four of his seven employees are undocumented. A majority of similar businesses would take a hit should the government deport undocumented people en masse, the business owner estimated.\n\nWithout undocumented workers, he said, \"We wouldn't survive and we'll have to close.\"\n\nA farm worker moves containers to be filled with grapefruit near Mission on Dec. 16, 2024. Credit: Michael Gonzalez for The Texas Tribune\n\nHe said he hired undocumented workers because he struggled to find U.S. citizens and legal residents willing to do the grueling work.\n\n\"The people who are here legally don't want to work here. They'd rather collect unemployment,\" he said. \"We've hired people who were documented, but they don't last.\"\n\nIn speaking about mass deportations, Trump and his incoming aides have said they will prioritize deporting people with a criminal history , while also noting that anyone who has entered the country illegally has committed a crime . Any large-scale deportation plans are sure to face legal and logistical challenges.\n\nBut Texas' state leaders are eager to help Trump , and the state is a target-rich environment. T he Pew Research Center estimates that unauthorized immigrants make up approximately 8% of the state's workforce, including a large presence in the hospitality, restaurants, energy and construction industries.\n\nThe state comptroller's office did a study in 2006 to find out how the state economy would look without the estimated 1.4 million undocumented immigrants living in Texas in 2005. The study said their absence would cost the state about $17.7 billion in gross state product - a measure of the value of goods and services produced in Texas. The state has not updated the study since ; analysis replicated by universities and think tanks have reached similar conclusions that undocumented Texans contribute more to the economy than they cost the state.\n\n\"We know that immigrants are punching above their weight,\" said Jaime Puente, director of economic opportunity at the left-leaning nonprofit Every Texan. \"We are looking at a significant loss of productivity.\"\n\nAmong major Texas industries, construction has the highest proportion of undocumented workers, according to the Pew Research Center . Mass deportations could disrupt the state's homebuilding industry in the midst of a housing shortage, which could lead to fewer new homes built and even higher home prices and rents, according to housing experts.\n\nA recent paper from researchers at the University of Utah and the University of Wisconsin-Madison explored the aftermath of the deportation of more than 300,000 undocumented immigrants nationwide from 2008 to 2013. In the places where deportations happened, the study found, homebuilding contracted because the local construction workforce shrank and home prices rose. The researchers discovered that other construction workers lost work too because homebuilders cut back on new developments.\n\nA construction worker along Highway 1604 in San Antonio on Dec. 19, 2024.

Nearly 100 years later, Marek's family owns a large Houston-based construction firm with roughly 1,000 employees.\n\n\"I have watched the stages of immigration,\" said Marek, 77. \"Eighty-five years later and our immigrants are here, and like they've always been, to do the work that no one else wants to do or can do.\"\n\nMarek sees a long overdue opportunity to fix a lingering mess - the country's immigration laws. He said deportations \"will be terribly expensive and terribly nonproductive\" but granting widespread amnesty to undocumented people would not work either.\n\nMarek believes giving a path to citizenship to people who arrived in the country as children and received deportation protection through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, could help the state reduce its workforce shortage. He also believes in the creation of a similar program for adults to gain legal status - which he calls \"Adult DACA\" - so that they can work legally.\n\n\"It's not just construction. Who's picking all the fruit and all the vegetables? Who's milking all those cows? Every job you look at all over the United States, there are immigrants,\" Marek said. \"We gotta have the business community step up. That's the key because the business community, more than anybody, is responsible for the labor.\"\n\nIn the oil-rich Permian Basin, mass deportations could reduce populations in cities and in turn result in closed businesses and the disappearance of sales tax dollars, said Virginia Bellew, executive director of the Permian Basin Regional Planning Commission.\n\n\"I think you've seen communities just waiting [to see what Trump does], don't want to take any steps to predict, discuss, or make decisions,\" Bellew said.\n\nIn Austin, a 43-year-old man who arrived from Mexico 25 years ago said his first job involved sweeping up debris at a construction site for less than $8 an hour. Today he is a foreman for a general contractor, supervising projects and coordinating crews. He asked his name not be published for fear of jeopardizing his pending residency application.\n\nHe said he is not letting himself be consumed by the fear of Trump's promises of mass deportations. He has deep roots in Texas now. He and his wife have raised their three kids in Austin in a house they built themselves.\n\nHis kids are U.S. citizens and his wife has legal status through DACA. He's in the process of applying for legal residency through his eldest daughter, a student at St. Edward's University in Austin.\n\n\"I try to be a great citizen,\" he said in Spanish. \"[Trump] can not deport everyone because there are so many of us who are indispensable to this country.\"\n\nDisclosure: Every Texan and the North Texas Commission have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

New York has a shield law that protects providers from out-of-state investigations and prosecutions, which has served as implicit permission for a network of doctors to mail abortion pills into states that have banned the procedure.\n\nTexas has vowed to pursue these cases regardless of those laws, and legal experts are divided on where the courts may land on this issue, which involves extraterritoriality, interstate commerce and other thorny legal questions last meaningfully addressed before the Civil War.\n\nIn this case, Paxton accuses Dr. Margaret Carpenter of mailing pills from New York to a 20-year-old woman in Collin County. The woman allegedly took the medication when she was nine weeks pregnant. When she began experiencing severe bleeding, the lawsuit says, she asked the man who impregnated her to take her to the hospital. He had not been aware she was pregnant or seeking an abortion, according to the filing.\n\nThe lawsuit does not say whether the woman successfully terminated her pregnancy or experienced any long-term medical complications. Mifepristone and misoprostol, the medications Carpenter is accused of sending, are more than 95% effective if taken before 10 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nPaxton is asking a Collin County court to block Carpenter from violating Texas law, and order her to pay $100,000 for every violation of the state's near-total abortion ban. Texas' near-total abortion ban comes with up to life in prison, fines of at least $100,000 and the loss of a provider's Texas medical license.\n\nCarpenter is not licensed to practice in Texas, according to the complaint. She is the founder of the Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine, a national group that helps doctors in states with shield laws provide telemedicine consultations and abortion pills to patients in states that have banned abortions.\n\nThe group was founded after the overturn of Roe v. Wade by Carpenter, Dr. Linda Prine, and Julie Kay, a former ACLU lawyer who successfully argued the case that overturned Ireland's abortion ban. They support doctors who want to become \"shield providers\" by advising them on licensure, data security, pharmacy contacts and legality.\n\nCarpenter also works with AidAccess, an international medication abortion provider, and helped found Hey Jane, a telehealth abortion provider.

Henry Cuellar is claiming some credit for Texas' controversial buoys to prevent migrants from crossing the Rio Grande, saying he pitched the idea to Border Patrol years ago.\n\nThe conservative Democrat said in a recent interview with Newsweek that he made the pitch to Border Patrol to prevent migrants from claiming asylum by setting foot on U.S. territory.\n\n\"I said, if you put a wall in Texas in the river, you're about a quarter mile away. So when somebody crosses and touches the riverbanks, they can claim asylum,\" Cuellar told the news magazine.\n\nIn a brief interview with The Texas Tribune, Cuellar added that the idea didn't go anywhere at the time because the International Boundary and Water Commission didn't give the necessary permits. But he was enthusiastic about an alternative to a land-based border wall in his district.\n\nGov. Greg Abbott deployed buoys and razor wire on the border last year to deter migrants from crossing the Rio Grande. Dozens of people have died trying to cross the river in recent years. Then-Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador criticized the tactics last year after a body was reported on one of the buoys.\n\nTexas Democrats in Congress, including Cuellar, sent a letter to President Joe Biden urging his administration to investigate Abbott's actions under Operation Lone Star, including the use of razor wire and buoys on the Rio Grande. The letter asserts the buoys and razor wire are \"potentially illegal and may violate multiple bilateral treaties\" designating water rights between the United States and Mexico. Every Democrat in Texas' congressional delegation at the time signed onto the letter.\n\nCuellar, who has represented the 28th Congressional District since 2005, expressed similar concerns during a press conference in 2023 about Operation Lone Star, where he said the buoys could change the border if there is flooding and that Border Patrol agents have expressed concerns that the razor wire can impede them.\n\n\"We need to have border security, but at the same time, we have to respect the rights and the dignity of the migrants who are trying to come into the U.S.,\" Cuellar said at the news conference. \"One of the things that we've asked the state and that I've asked the federal government is, are we coordinating with the state, and it looks like the state is going solo on this.\"\n\nSpeaking with The Texas Tribune, Cuellar said he was not opposed to the use of buoys, but he signed onto the 2023 letter in opposition to the state's unilateral use of the barriers without working with the federal government. He said he was optimistic the state will work with the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump on hardening the border.\n\nCuellar also said he didn't want to take credit away from Abbott for deploying the buoys.\n\n\"I'm not taking anything from Governor Abbott,\" Cuellar said. \"I congratulate him.\"\n\nCuellar is among the most conservative Democrats in Congress and has occasionally crossed over to support Republican efforts on border security. He helped launch a Democratic task force on border security earlier this year.\n\nHe has recently shown openness to working with Trump's administration, saying he saw opportunities for \"common ground\" with Tom Homan, Trump's border czar. Homan served as director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during Trump's first term. The pair plans to meet sometime next week. Cuellar said he could see an agreement with the Trump administration on working with Mexico to keep migrants from reaching the U.S. border.\n\nCuellar remains politically battered, reeling from a federal indictment charging him with bribery, money laundering and working on behalf of the Azerbaijani government and a Mexican bank. He has denied the allegations and won reelection in November by 5.6 percentage points. He won reelection in 2022 by more than 10 points.\n\nRepublicans declined to heavily fund a challenge against Cuellar this year despite the indictment, which came out after the first round of the district's Republican primary. But South Texas remains a major target for the party, and national Republicans have telegraphed they are keeping their sights on the district in the future.\n\nCuellar's trial is set to begin next spring in Houston, in which more details of his alleged criminal activity are expected to be aired out. He is charged with accepting nearly $600,000 in bribes to advance the interests of Azerbaijan's oil and gas sector and the business interests of Banco Azteca. He is accused of setting up money-laundering schemes to conceal the bribes with the help of his wife, Imelda. Cuellar said his behavior was in line with other members of Congress.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Texas Tribune at https://www.texastribune.org/2024/12/04/henry-cuellar-texas-rio-grande-border-buoys-immigration/ .\n\nThe Texas Tribune is a member-supported, nonpartisan newsroom informing and engaging Texans on state politics and policy.

The far-right now has the Legislature firmly in its grip and, emboldened by the recent election, they're gearing up to make growing trans animus the social issue of the session.\n\n[ After Texas banned puberty blockers and hormones for trans kids, adults lost care, too ]\n\nNationwide, Republicans have successfully pushed these laws as a way to protect children, by prohibiting them from medically transitioning before they turn 18 and stopping trans students from playing on sports teams that don't align with their biological sex.\n\nTexas has so far marched in lockstep with its conservative cousins in passing laws aimed at children. But some lawmakers want to further restrict the lives of trans adults as well, filing bills about bathroom use, gender identity markers on official documents and funding for gender reassignment surgery.\n\n\"The American people and especially Texans that I represent, they've had enough of it,\" Rep. Brian Harrison , an arch-conservative from Midlothian, told The Texas Tribune. \"They're forcing you to celebrate something that's at odds with objective reality, and in many instances, forcing tax dollars to fund it.\"\n\nThe limit on how far Texas will go on this issue lies in the hands of conservative lawmakers, as the state is unlikely to face federal pushback as they did during the Biden administration. Incoming President Donald Trump has vowed to get Congress to pass a bill declaring there are only two genders, and to keep \"transgender insanity the hell out of our schools.\"\n\n\"I don't see any reason the state would moderate its position at this point,\" said Andrew Proctor, a political science professor at the University of Chicago who studies LGBTQ political issues. \"If anything, the things they want to pursue will be easier now.\"\n\nIn 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, and conservatives began casting around for a new social issue to back. They landed on the small but growing trans population, and the incremental discrimination protections they'd gained during the Obama administration.\n\nThe next year, in 2017, there were a few dozen anti-trans bills filed in state houses across the country. Many, like Texas' bathroom bill, failed. At that time, 57% of Republicans said society had gone \"too far\" in accepting trans people.\n\nThen, they honed in on children. Terry Schilling, president of the American Principles Project, a right-wing political advocacy group, helped shape the messaging around this issue. He said conservatives are willing to be \"polite\" to people who identify as trans - to a point.\n\n\"Once you go into my daughter's athletics or in her locker room or showers, once you start giving kids gender transitions that mutilate them and sterilize them, then we're in a whole different world,\" he told The Texas Tribune after the election.\n\nAll major medical associations acknowledge that gender dysphoria, the distress someone can feel when their physical presentation doesn't match the gender they identify as, is a real medical condition best treated with gender-affirming care . That can range from social transition, in which someone goes by different pronouns or dresses differently, to medical treatments, including puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgeries. Minors rarely undergo surgery to transition, and all decisions are made in consultation with their parents and medical professionals.\n\nNonetheless, the conservative messaging resonated. Last year, almost 80% of Republicans said society had gone too far in accepting trans people, and this year, even with Texas laying dormant, there were 669 anti-trans bills filed in state legislatures across the country.\n\nBut despite this sharp increase in anti-trans sentiment, it's not entirely clear what Americans want their government to do about it. More than half of Republicans do not want to ban gender-affirming care for minors, and almost as many want to protect trans people from discrimination in jobs, housing and public spaces.\n\nTexas' ban on gender-affirming care for minors was widely condemned by medical associations, doctors, advocates and trans people, who called the laws \" dangerous ,\" \" cruel and grotesque ,\" and \" devastating .\" Every Republican, and a handful of Democrats, voted for the ban.\n\nNow, trans people, advocates and health care providers are bracing for what comes next.\n\n\"It's almost necessary, based on their framework and the way they frame these cases, that they would argue that access to care for adults would be a violation in the same way as for children,\" said Elana Redfield, the federal policy director at the Williams Institute, a research center on gender identity law and public policy at the University of California Los Angeles. \"Texas has already made it pretty clear they intend to do that.\"\n\nIn 2024, an off year for the Texas Legislature, other Republican states charged ahead, setting the agenda for what lawmakers might do when they reconvene in January. No state has fully banned adults from accessing gender-affirming care, but some, such as Florida, have significantly restricted the provision of these treatments, discouraging doctors and patients alike.\n\nTexas lawmakers are already filing bills to tee up these issues. Sen. Bob Hall , a Republican from Edgewood, and Rep. Ellen Troxclair , an Austin Republican, have filed bills requiring government records to reflect that there are only two genders, tightly defining male and female based on reproductive organs. Other bills would prevent trans people from amending their birth certificates to reflect their gender identity.\n\nThese laws have the effect of \"erasing transgender people altogether,\" Redfield said. Some of this is already under way: Earlier this year, the Texas Department of Public Safety, under scrutiny from Attorney General Ken Paxton, began refusing to change the sex listed on someone's driver's license, even with a court order. The agency also began compiling names of people seeking the change.\n\nLawmakers are also hoping to resurrect the bathroom issue, as well as requiring trans people to be placed in jails or prisons based on the sex they were assigned at birth.\n\nHarrison, the Midlothian Republican, has filed a bill that would forbid state funding to be used for transition-related care.\n\nThis idea gained traction during the presidential election, when Trump accused Vice President Kamala Harris of supporting taxpayer-funded gender reassignment surgery. In a small number of cases, federal inmates have won court battles that required the federal government to pay for their transition-related medical care.\n\nHarrison said his focus is purely about how tax dollars are spent, and it's the media who portrays these as social issues.\n\n\"We are making the lives harder for Texans of all stripes when we make them poorer, and we certainly shouldn't make them poorer in the pursuit of leftist ideology,\" he said.\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in a lawsuit challenging Tennessee's gender-affirming care ban for minors, a case that could determine how far states like Texas can go with these restrictions. The U.S. Department of Justice sued in 2023, saying the law unconstitutionally discriminates on the basis of gender.\n\nThe suit was one of several attempts by the Biden administration to insulate trans people from the impacts of conservative state laws.\n\n\"The Biden administration has been the most explicitly protective administration for transgender people,\" Redfield said. \"We can anticipate the incoming president will claw back as much of that as possible.\"\n\nIn his first term, Trump ejected trans people from the military and reversed many Obama-era discrimination protections. In his recent presidential campaign, he ran heavily on this record, culminating in an ad that said \"Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\"\n\nProject 2025, the policy blueprint created by the conservative Heritage Foundation that many hope Trump will pull from, calls for removing \"sexual orientation\" and \"gender identity\" from all federal rules, regulations and legislation, and restricting gender-affirming care across age groups.\n\nTrans people and advocates are preparing for what Congress and the White House might do, as well as where state legislatures might go without federal oversight to rein them in. Many groups are recommending trans people proactively change their government documents to align with their gender identity, where that's still allowed; stock up on transition-related medications; and prepare to move states or leave the country, if needed.\n\nWhatever Trump does on this issue, Texas is expected to go even further.\n\n\"Texas better do at least as good a job as Washington, D.C. is going to do on that front,\" Harrison said. \"And that's what I'm committed to ensuring happens.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Texas Tribune at https://www.texastribune.org/2024/12/04/texas-transgender-restrictions-legislative-session/ .\n\nThe Texas Tribune is a member-supported, nonpartisan newsroom informing and engaging Texans on state politics and policy.

Then it grows stiff.\n\nThen it's quick. There's nothing to be done. The cow dies.\n\nSince early 2023, the Grandview rancher has watched more than 35 of his 150 Black Angus cattle perish. July was especially brutal. In the span of a week, Coleman lost a 3-week-old calf; a cow; and Little Red, a strong bull full of spirit, leaving Coleman with nothing but unanswered questions.\n\n\"This is destroying our lives,\" Coleman said. \"You never know what you're going to get every day when you get down here.\"\n\nNext door, James Farmer has lost two calves, and found two of his wife's beloved horses toppled to the ground like dominos, their bodies swarmed by buzzards.\n\n\"It's hard for me to tell her, because I know she's gonna break down,\" he said. \"Why are our animals dying? Just back to back? It never ends.\"\n\nMonths before, the men said they noticed a gag-inducing sewage smell drifting from smoking piles of fertilizer on their neighbor's property. Heavy rains then washed some of the fertilizer onto their land. Soon after, they said they found fish floating dead in the stock ponds their livestock drink from.\n\nThe Colemans have lost more than 35 animals. One went blind before dying, they said, a white film coating the pupil. A pair of calves died less than a week after birth. They found dead fish floating in their stock ponds. When an animal dies it's a race against time. Coleman and his neighbor James Farmer scramble to beat the buzzards and coyotes to the carcass, then drive it to a lab in College Station. Credit: Courtesy of Tony and Karen Coleman\n\nThey contacted the county with their concerns, triggering a nine-month investigation. That's when their cattle and horses began to die.\n\nAn environmental crime investigator in Johnson County collected samples of the dead animals' tissue and organs, the water they drank from, the soil and the fertilizer that was applied next door.\n\nAfter the county received test results, the two families finally got their answer: The animals had been killed by something in the fertilizer.\n\nThe fertilizer had been made with biosolids, part of an effort to find a climate-friendly method to recycle municipal sewage. But the fertilizer also contained synthetic and highly hazardous chemicals known as PFAS, which are found in hundreds of household products and have had devastating effects on farms and ranches that inadvertently spread them on their land.\n\nAn untold number of farms and ranches across Texas and the rest of the nation may have also used fertilizer made from sewage tainted with these \"forever chemicals\" - which don't break down in the environment - without knowing it.\n\nPFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are man-made chemicals used since the 1940s that have a singular ability to repel oil and water and resist heat. They are used in products like nonstick cookware, pizza boxes, waterproof mascara, toilet paper, soaps and rain jackets.\n\nThere are more than 12,000 types of PFAS, but researchers have only studied the health effects of roughly 150. They can contaminate food and water and build up in the body over time. Exposure to certain PFAS has been linked to cancer , low birth rates and birth defects, damage to the liver and immune system, and other serious health problems. One study found the chemicals in the blood of nearly 97% of all Americans.\n\nDue to their widespread use in consumer products, forever chemicals have been discharged into waterways by chemical manufacturers, trucked to landfills with household trash or flushed into city sewers via toilets, sinks, showers and washing machines.\n\nThen they end up in local wastewater treatment plants where the solids are separated from sewage. Fertilizer companies who are often paid to haul these biosolids away process them into fertilizer that's sold to farmers and ranchers as a cheaper alternative to chemical fertilizers.\n\nA number of Texas wastewater plants have contracts with fertilizer companies to take their biosolids, including Fort Worth, Houston, San Antonio, Dallas and Arlington. Nationally, more than half of sewage sludge was treated and spread on land, according to one study ; 19 billion pounds of it was spread on American farms between 2016 and 2021, the nonprofit Environmental Working Group found in 2022.\n\nWastewater treatment and biosolids experts call this an environmental win-win because those solids don't go to landfills or incinerators - processes that create greenhouse gasses, which contribute to climate change.\n\nBut nobody knows how much of that fertilizer is contaminated with PFAS, which can be absorbed by crops, consumed by livestock, and then enter the food supply. There are no requirements to test biosolids for PFAS, or to warn farmers and ranchers that they could be using contaminated fertilizer made with biosolids on their land.\n\n\"Some people are saying, [PFAS contamination] are isolated incidents. No, they're not. I guarantee that this is a problem in every single state that uses biosolids,\" said Kyla Bennett, a former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency employee who is now a science policy director for the nonprofit group Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility.\n\n\"The reason we're not hearing about it all over the country, in all 50 states, is because nobody's looking for this problem,\" Bennett added.\n\nAccording to EPA data analyzed by the nonprofit Environmental Working Group in 2022, an estimated 5% of all crop fields in the U.S. - up to 20 million acres - could have used fertilizer made with biosolids. In Texas, more than 157,000 dry metric tons of biosolids-based fertilizer were applied to agricultural lands in 2018.\n\nWhile the EPA recently set limits for a handful of the chemicals in drinking water, those rules do not cover biosolids.\n\n\"The evidence is out there\" that PFAS are a health hazard, Bennett said. \"We shouldn't have to wait [for the EPA to act].\"\n\nWithout federal regulations, some states have taken action , requiring wastewater treatment plants to test their biosolids for PFAS or setting their own limits for PFAS in biosolids. Texas is not among them. State environmental regulators said in a statement they're not required to by law.\n\nKaren said her dad's farm land doesn't feel the same anymore - the PFAS has cast a shadow on it. If they sold any cattle, she said, it would feel like a betrayal of her father's memory. She's relying on her faith as a moral compass to guide her - even if it means hard choices. \"We believe in Jesus. And at the end of my time, when I have to stand in front of Jesus and I get to see my dad again, I have to answer for the decisions that we're making right now,\" Karen Coleman said.\" src=\"https://thumbnails.texastribune.org/935W7LMmANadeSFImmtI1n08od8=/1200x804/smart/filters:quality(75)/https://static.texastribune.org/media/files/a97d6e6fd014bd6ee2e0cab002d0038f/Colemans%20and%20Ranch%20AS%20TT%2001.jpg\">\n\nTony Coleman took over the farm in 2018 after his wife's father died from liver cancer. Karen Coleman said the farm doesn't feel the same anymore - the PFAS contamination has cast a shadow over it. If they sold cattle now, she said, it would feel like a betrayal of her father's memory. \"We believe in Jesus. And at the end of my time, when I have to stand in front of Jesus and I get to see my dad again, I have to answer for the decisions that we're making right now,\" she said. Credit: Azul Sordo for The Texas Tribune\n\nColeman and other Johnson County farmers who know their land is contaminated are now faced with an existential dilemma: Do they sell their cattle and their crops, knowing they're likely laced with PFAS, or face financial ruin?\n\nColeman and Farmer have both decided not to sell any cattle. That means the men now run zombie farms. They pay to feed animals and harvest hay that they won't sell - a single 900-pound steer could sell for $4,800, Coleman said.\n\n\"Everything we plant here is just sucking this [PFAS] stuff up,\" Coleman said. \"The cows drink the water and eat the grass. For them there is no escaping.\"\n\nThe Johnson County Courthouse in downtown Cleburne on July 29, 2024. Credit: Azul Sordo for The Texas Tribune\n\nIn February, Johnson County residents packed the courthouse and listened intently as Dana Ames, an environmental crime investigator for the county, and other local officials explained the findings from the nine-month investigation into the noxious smells and dead livestock.\n\nAmes, who spent $35,000 of the county's money on the investigation and sent samples to a lab in Pennsylvania, told residents that the liver of the Coleman's stillborn calf contained 610,000 parts per trillion of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, or PFOS, one of the many types of forever chemicals.\n\nThe tissue from a calf belonging to Farmer that died a week after being born tested at 320 ppt of PFOS.\n\nCurrently, there are no federal food safety standards for PFAS. In Maine, which in 2016 became the first state to detect PFAS contamination at a farm, state officials issued limits for beef containing PFOS at 3.4 parts per billion and milk containing PFOS at 210 parts per trillion - meaning that beef or milk exceeding these levels should be considered unsafe for consumption. Maine, which has discovered 78 contaminated farms and shut five of them down, has been the only state to set its own PFAS limits for food.\n\nSamples of the pond water where the ranching families' livestock drink from ranged from 84 ppt to 1,333 ppt of PFAS.\n\nThe county also tested the fertilizer their neighbor spread on his farm and found 27 types of PFAS chemicals, including four out of the five the EPA has set limits for in drinking water.\n\nJohnson County Commissioner Larry Woolley at his desk in Cleburne. Credit: Azul Sordo for The Texas Tribune\n\n\"These people were led to believe this was safe and a cheap fertilizer,\" County Commissioner Larry Woolley said at the meeting. \"And this isn't just isolated to this one incident or multiple counties. This is going on all over.\"\n\n\"The amount of beef and milk that's gone into the food chain, who knows what their PFAS levels are? The level of victimization is widespread,\" he added.\n\nThe Colemans, Farmer and four other local farmers have sued Synagro, the Maryland-based company that produced the biosolids-based fertilizer applied on their neighbor's fields, and Renda Environmental, a Texas-based fertilizer company that sold to the neighbor before Synagro. The lawsuit claims the companies knew about the contaminants in the fertilizer and failed to provide adequate warnings to its customers.\n\nSynagro denies the allegations. Kip Cleverley, a spokesperson with the company, said the company did its own testing on the land where the fertilizer was applied and preliminary results found PFAS levels in the single digits parts per trillion in the surface water. The company did not provide its test results to the Tribune, saying its analysis was still in progress.\n\n\"The data strongly suggests that the farm where biosolids were used could not be a source for the PFAS allegedly found on the plaintiffs' farms,\" Cleverley said.\n\nRenda Environmental told the Tribune the company does not comment on pending litigation.\n\nIn a separate lawsuit filed against the EPA in June by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility on behalf of the farmers, the group claimed the agency failed to implement restrictions on PFAS in biosolids despite knowing the health risks posed by the chemicals. Johnson County later joined the suit.\n\n\"My heart breaks [for the farmers],\" said Bennett, the group's science policy director. \"It could be years until the EPA sets biosolids regulations. Somebody needs to hold their feet to the fire ... farmers are losing their livelihoods.\"\n\nThe biosolids used to create the fertilizer that allegedly contaminated the Colemans' and Farmers' farms came from Fort Worth's Village Creek Water Reclamation Facility, which treats sewage from 1 million people, many industries and 23 communities in North Texas. It generates between 27,000 to 31,000 tons of biosolids per year.\n\nTop right: Mary Gugliuzza, spokesperson for Fort Worth Water said the wastewater treatment plant is \"passive receivers\" of forever chemicals, meaning they don't produce them at the treatment plant, but come into the wastewater treatment plant from residential homes, commercial businesses, institutions, and in some cases industrial users.\n\nBottom left: People flush all sorts of things containing PFAS down the toilet, including wipes, menstrual products, rocks, toys, sticks and plastic. During the first step of the wastewater treatment process, raw sewage passes through screens, which helps remove the trash.

All trash is taken to a landfill.\n\nBottom right: Air is pumped into pools filled with wastewater known as aeration basins. The water looks like it's boiling from oxygen being fed into it.

Those results showed PFAS in the biosolids, but Gugliuzza said that's the case at wastewater facilities across the country.\n\nSynagro has contracts with more than 1,000 municipal wastewater plants, industrial, and agricultural customers in North America - including Fort Worth - to turn biosolids, which one employee described as resembling chocolate milk, into fertilizer that it markets as nutrient rich and environmentally friendly.\n\nIn 2022 Synagro processed 6.5 million tons of biosolids nationwide.\n\n\"The [EPA] has not suggested that any changes in biosolids management is required because of the presence of trace amounts of PFAS,\" Cleverly, the company spokesperson, said.\n\nIn September, the EPA responded to the lawsuit saying it has complete discretion over which pollutants to regulate under federal law - so it can't be sued.\n\nBut the agency is now studying the presence of PFAS in wastewater and sewage sludge nationally and conducting a risk assessment on the use of biosolids and sewage sludge containing the two most widely used and studied forever chemicals - PFOA and PFOS - focusing on health risks through exposure to soil, water, crops, meat and dairy. It expects to publish the results by the end of this year, which will determine whether new federal rules are necessary.\n\nIn the wastewater treatment process at the San Antonio Water System's  Steven M.

But the rest is diverted for agricultural use in Texas.\n\nAt San Antonio's wastewater treatment plant, water is removed from sewage sludge by using a machine that squeezes it between two tensioned belts or by spreading it in drying beds so the sun evaporates the moisture. Once it's dried to a crumb-like texture, the biosolids are piled into black mountains then transported to other facilities where two Texas compost companies turn it into fertilizer.\n\nPitched as a cost-effective way to improve soil fertility, biosolids have been applied to land in the U.S. since the 1970s . Scientists say they contain nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium that helps plants grow.\n\nThe EPA only requires wastewater treatment plants to test biosolids for heavy metals and pathogens that can be harmful to health.\n\nSand drying uses rectangular sand beds where sewage sludge is spread and left to dry using sunlight.

It takes money.\"\n\nThe cost of removal is significant: A 2023 report by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency found that it would cost between $2.7 million and $18 million per pound to remove and destroy PFAS from municipal wastewater, depending on facility size, and between $1 million and $2.7 million per pound of PFAS removed from biosolids.\n\nAdam Krantz, the CEO of the National Association of Clean Water Agencies, a group representing municipal wastewater treatment agencies, said the cost of remediation could be passed down to water utility customers, but argues that \"polluters should pay.\"\"It really is the corporate polluter that needs to foot the bill for this as the wrongdoer,\" he said.\n\nOthers, like Janine Burke-Wells, executive director for the North East Biosolids & Residuals Association, which represents wastewater treatment facilities and biosolids producers, said that the responsibility to curb PFAS should fall on everyone.\n\n\"Unless we really eliminate all the sources of PFAS there's always going to be a background level because [PFAS] is in everything,\" Burke-Wells said.\n\nCounty Commissioner Larry Woolley drives past PFAS-affected land in Grandview on July 29, 2024. Credit: Azul Sordo for The Texas Tribune\n\nIn Johnson County, Woolley drives his silver pickup down rural roads, pointing out hay bales and miles of milo grain, corn and wheat - crops the county commissioner says have been blessed by heavy rainfall earlier this year.\n\nWoolley, a former agriculture teacher who moved to Grandivew in 1982, says he's spent sleepless nights worrying about PFAS' impacts on ranching families in this county of 180,000 residents.\n\n\"I lay awake at night thinking of the magnitude of this whole deal. It's just crazy,\" Woolley said. \"This is just the tip of the iceberg. I think there's gonna be so much public outcry on this ... it's gonna be hard for our state officials to ignore that.\"\n\nFollowing the county's investigation, Woolley led the charge to pass a local resolution urging farmers to stop using biosolids on their land.\n\nThe resolution called for Fort Worth to stop sending its biosolids to fertilizer companies until the TCEQ tests them for the presence of PFAS and asked the EPA to set limits on PFAS in biosolids. The resolution also called on state lawmakers to regulate the application of biosolids-based fertilizer on farmland or give power to counties to do so.\n\n\"That's the hard part,\" Woolley said. \"We don't have authority to ban biosolids.\"\n\nIn July, neighboring Ellis County passed a similar resolution calling for regulation and legislation to restrict the application of biosolids on farms and ranches until further testing is done. Since then, Kaufman, Henderson, Somervell and Wise counties have done the same.\n\nWoolley has traveled around the state to sound the alarm about PFAS at conferences for county officials. He said he and his staff are preparing to go to Austin to meet with state lawmakers during the next legislative session. He hopes they will introduce new bills that will address PFAS contamination in biosolids, including giving counties money to test for the contaminants, and require TCEQ to test biosolids statewide for forever chemicals.\n\nSo far, there have been no bills filed by state lawmakers regarding PFAS contamination in biosolids ahead of the legislative session that begins in January.\n\nIn 2021, Michigan began requiring all municipal wastewater treatment plants to test their biosolids for PFAS before spreading them on agricultural land. The state also began prohibiting the application of biosolids containing more than 150 parts per billion of PFOS on agricultural land. Since then, the state has lowered that threshold to 100 ppb and added another type of PFAS to the list, PFOA.\n\nWhat experts refer to as the \"Michigan model\" has now been embraced by other states including California, Wisconsin and Washington. Connecticut and Maine have banned the use of biosolids on agricultural fields.\n\nEllen Mallory, a professor of sustainable agriculture at The University of Maine, said state response has been crucial given the lack of standards at the federal level.\n\n\"The important part here is it's really hard to have any response to PFAS contamination if we don't have any standards. So a state like Texas that has no standards, what do you do? How do you help farmers determine if their food is safe or not?\" she said.\n\nMeanwhile, Tony Coleman and his wife are still watching their livestock die. They pack dead cattle in a big cooler, load them onto a trailer and drive 140 miles to a laboratory at College Station where vet technicians perform a necropsy and remove tissue to be tested for PFAS.\n\nThe couple both work two jobs and are looking for a third. They're worried they have lost the ability to make a living off their own land.\n\n\"We can't consciously sell you a side of beef and then you eat it and you get sick. What kind of people does that make us?\" Coleman said.\n\nDisclosure: San Antonio Water System has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

Learn more at texastribune.org.\n\nLast year, state Rep. David Cook of Mansfield was quietly but steadily climbing the ranks of Texas politics.\n\nThe sophomore lawmaker had been named vice chair of the committee overseeing the state's criminal laws. He carried and passed a GOP priority bill aimed at reining in \"rogue\" progressive district attorneys. And he had a coveted seat on the powerful Calendars Committee, which acts as the House gatekeeper because it controls which bills reach the floor for a vote and which never see the light of day.\n\nCook's promising start was a clear indication House Speaker Dade Phelan considered him an ally.\n\nThen, in September, Cook made an audacious gambit by announcing he would join an increasingly crowded field challenging Phelan for the speaker's gavel. By the end of that month, Cook emerged as the consensus pick of the anti-Phelan House Republicans to replace the sitting speaker.\n\nIn announcing his run for speaker , Cook said that political infighting, breakdowns in communication and a lack of transparency from Phelan had hindered the Republican majority's work. He promised to engage regularly with lawmakers if elected.\n\n\"My philosophy is rooted in returning power to the members and fostering an environment where we can work together effectively,\" he said.\n\nCook, whose voting record placed him near the ideological middle of the House Republicans, is an unlikely choice to be standard-bearer for a coalition looking to oust Phelan on the grounds that he is too moderate. The group is dominated by social conservatives from the chamber's rightmost flank, many of whom opposed Attorney General Ken Paxton's impeachment last year or won their seats by defeating members like Cook who had supported it .\n\nThey want to further disempower the House's Democratic minority by putting Republicans in charge of every legislative committee. They also want to speed the passage of conservative legislation and ensure that major GOP bills reach the floor before any Democratic measures.\n\nOn paper, other GOP candidates who'd announced challenges to Phelan appeared more representative of the insurgent crowd, including Rep. Shelby Slawson of Stephenville, one of the House's most conservative members, and Rep. John Smithee of Amarillo, who won plaudits from the far right for vigorously opposing Paxton's impeachment.\n\n\"If you're a reformer, I'm not sure how they settled on him,\" said Rep. Carl Tepper , R-Lubbock, a Phelan supporter.\n\nNow, Cook and Phelan are waging a behind-the-scenes battle for control of the Texas House, each projecting confidence that they have a path to victory despite shaky public support.\n\nIn early December, the House GOP Caucus is scheduled to meet to settle on their endorsed nominee for speaker. Under the group's rules - which are occasionally disregarded by members - whoever gets 60% or more of the votes at the meeting will be the caucus' endorsed candidate and should receive support from all Republican members when the vote goes to the full House.\n\nPhelan, a Beaumont Republican who has served as speaker for two terms and a House member since 2015, insists he has enough votes to lead the chamber for a third time in January - but he has not produced a list of supporters. Cook is touting 47 Republicans who would back him, short of the threshold required to gain the endorsement of the House GOP Caucus and far short of the 76 lawmakers from either party he would need to win the real speaker's election on the House floor in January.\n\nHis allies remain hopeful that enough Republicans will buckle under the pressure of drawing a career-threatening primary challenge from Phelan's deep-pocketed political foes if they lend their support to the incumbent speaker. But that threat has not produced any new pledges for Cook since he announced his initial list of supporters, signaling that Phelan could keep the gavel with backing from the chamber's 62 Democrats and a minority of the Republican caucus.\n\nCook and Phelan both declined comment for this story.\n\nThe caucus meeting is a pivotal moment for Cook's bid. The 53-year-old lawmaker will either emerge as the clear frontrunner to lead the chamber or potentially be relegated to the doghouse next session for challenging the sitting speaker.\n\nCook's roots in the Texas Capitol go back more than 30 years to 1993 when he got his start as a legislative aide for conservative Democrat Rep. Jerry Johnson of Nacogdoches while attending Stephen F. Austin State University.\n\nBut his biggest mentor and influence in the Legislature was the late Republican Sen. Chris Harris of Arlington, whom he worked for as an aide in the mid-1990s. The two became law partners at Harris' family and business law firm, where Cook now works as managing partner.\n\nAs a lawyer in Tarrant County, Cook was able to rub elbows with movers and shakers in Texas' largest Republican county who could help him launch a political career.\n\nIn 2008, he won his first election for mayor of Mansfield, a suburb south of Arlington with about 50,000 residents. During his 12 years at the helm, the city's population grew by more than 40%, part of the explosive growth seen throughout the North Texas suburbs.\n\nLarry Broseh, a longtime Mansfield city council member, said Cook helped usher the city out of its \"sleepy, bedroom community era\" into a booming suburb marked by mixed-use developments and a growing web of master-planned communities.\n\nHe began to show some of the hallmarks of how he would govern as a state legislator, focusing on a conservative approach to the city's finances and promoting economic growth, over culture wars.\n\n\"He was definitely a coalition builder,\" Broseh said, describing how the seven-person council typically decided matters with 7-0 or 6-1 votes. \"I've worked with four mayors throughout my tenure, and by far I think he was the most collaborative person.\"\n\nBroseh said he was \"surprised as much as the next person\" when he heard that Cook was challenging Phelan, in part because Cook had left City Hall for the Capitol so recently. But Broseh contended that Cook's ability to build alliances and find common ground - underscored by his work as a family law mediator - would serve him well in the race.\n\nIn late 2019, Cook launched a primary challenge against longtime Arlington Rep. Bill Zedler, a staunch social conservative and member of the Texas House Freedom Caucus. Zedler bowed out of the race, citing health concerns, and Cook went on to win the seat in 2020.\n\nIn his first session the following year, he filed 10 bills, several of which dealt with family law. He passed his first law, making it easier to modify child support and other family legal orders - his only bill to reach the governor's desk that year.\n\nCook was more productive during his second term in 2023, when Phelan named him vice chair of the Criminal Jurisprudence Committee and placed him on the Calendars Committee.\n\nThat year he filed 69 bills and passed 14 of them , including the Republican priority that allowed courts to remove district attorneys for misconduct if they did not pursue certain types of crimes. The bill, which was signed into law and took effect last September, targets progressive prosecutors in large urban counties who have declined to pursue low-level marijuana possession cases and vowed not to prosecute abortion-related crimes.\n\nLast year, Cook also took two of the most consequential votes of his short legislative career. Near the end of the spring regular session, he was one of 60 House Republicans who voted to impeach Paxton for allegedly accepting bribes and abusing the power of his office, charges on which he was later acquitted by the Senate . Cook was the only member to note in the House record after the vote that he supported some - but not all - of the articles of impeachment.\n\nLater that year, Cook sided with Gov. Greg Abbott's bid to enact a private school voucher program, voting against an amendment that stripped vouchers from a broader education bill.\n\nThose two votes paved the way for an ugly primary season. To vote for impeachment meant Paxton's far-right allies were coming for your seat. To vote against vouchers meant that Abbott and a lineup of pro-voucher groups might spend millions to oust you. Despite his impeachment vote, Cook managed to avoid a primary challenge, which kept his name out of the headlines during a period of intraparty mudslinging.\n\nCapitol observers and legislative colleagues said Cook tends to push his bills through quietly, steering clear of the bomb-throwing tactics intended to attract attention and rile controversy.\n\nBill Miller, a veteran Austin-based lobbyist, described Cook as \"a watcher and absorber\" with a tendency to keep his cards close to his vest. He said Cook's style is reminiscent of former House Speaker Joe Straus, who also emerged from the background after just two terms to challenge an incumbent speaker.\n\n\"He's one of the members, I put him in the category of people, they're smart, they pay attention, and they keep their own counsel,\" he said.\n\nCook sometimes sided with Phelan's team to beat back ideas pushed by the right wing of the GOP.\n\nLast year, he voted with Republicans and Democrats to redo a vote on a bill that would give tax breaks to businesses that bring jobs to Texas , after some of his far-right colleagues snuck in an amendment targeting transgender health care and abortion access. He later supported the bill's passage when the amendment was removed.\n\nCook also supported legislation to legalize sports gambling , which many social conservatives, including some of those now in his camp, oppose.\n\nLuke Macias, a consultant to some of the state's most socially conservative legislators, said focusing the race on Cook's record is a mistake.\n\n\"The coalition that's formed has formed around how the House operates,\" he said. \"It's not formed around a personality on either side but on structurally changing the Texas House in a way that's better for every single member.\"\n\nOn top of removing Democrats from leadership positions, the anti-Phelan coalition also wants the speaker to ensure Republican priorities receive floor votes early in the session, among other demands laid out in their manifesto called the \" Contract with Texas ,\" to which Cook has committed .\n\nRep. Tony Tinderholt , R-Arlington, said Cook's decision to sign onto that pledge, which was drafted by lawmakers pushing for a new speaker, was a major factor in deciding to support him. Tinderholt, one of the chamber's most hard-right conservatives who is often at odds with House leadership, said he doesn't always agree with Cook on policy but likes that he treats other House members with respect.\n\n\"This quality in David is what makes him a good consensus candidate to unite Republicans,\" Tinderholt said in an email. \"His governing philosophy is in the middle of our caucus and his track record of treating members with dignity and respect is impeccable.\"\n\nRep. Ellen Troxclair , a Lakeway Republican who is one of Cook's core supporters, said he won her over in part by showing her and other freshman members respect despite their lack of seniority.\n\n\"In an atmosphere that tended to tell freshmen to keep their heads down and mouths shut, David had the opposite approach, where he really wanted to help the new class be successful,\" Troxclair said. \"I know that was appreciated not just by me but by my other classmates who had similar experiences.\"\n\nCook's public support has stalled since the late September meeting after which he put out a list of 48 supporters. That number has dropped to 47 after one of his pledges, Republican Steve Kinard of Collin County, lost his challenge to Rep. Mihaela Plesa , a Democrat.\n\nTo win the GOP caucus endorsement, he needs 53 votes when the group meets on Dec. 7.\n\nMost of the 41 other House Republicans have yet to voice their support for either GOP speaker candidate. Cook has tried to win over some of those unpledged caucus members, so far to no avail.\n\nWith neither candidate touting enough votes for the caucus' stamp of approval, the possibility of a third GOP contender has gained traction. Some lawmakers are actively calling uncommitted Republicans and those on Cook's pledge list to see if they would entertain breaking away for a new to-be-determined candidate, according to three sources who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the race candidly. The idea, they said, is to lay the groundwork for someone who could draw support from the pro- and anti-Phelan camps if Cook and Phelan deadlock at the caucus meeting.\n\nMiller, the Austin lobbyist, said the fluid state of the race means that, for now, many members see little upside in voicing public support for either candidate and risking political exile if they pick the losing horse.\n\n\"They want to bet right, or more importantly, they don't want to bet wrong,\" Miller said.\n\nThe outcome will shape much of the direction of Texas politics next year, with the speaker wielding enormous control over the fate of major bills and billions in taxpayer dollars. Phelan's reelection would likely ensure a rancorous session between the two legislative chambers, with the Senate controlled by Phelan's political rival, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who tried to end the speaker's political career by backing a primary challenger earlier this year. If Phelan is deposed, Patrick and the rest of the GOP's most conservative faction could have a willing ally in driving a hardline agenda through the Legislature.\n\nTepper said he has decided to vote for Phelan because he views him as the stronger conservative, particularly on tax policy. He said he likes Cook personally but questioned some of his bills, including proposed changes to background checks for public sector employees. Based on his conversations with the Mansfield lawmaker, Tepper said Cook seemed \"very friendly to the cities,\" perhaps from his time as mayor. Tepper hopes to continue curbing the power of municipalities, a long-running priority of many Texas GOP lawmakers.\n\nOn Sunday, Rep. Jared Patterson, R-Frisco, a Phelan ally, told CBS News Texas that he is \"fully supportive\" of Phelan serving a third term as speaker. Others say they want to \"maintain\" the House's current trajectory, as Reps. Drew Darby of San Angelo and Cole Hefner of Mount Pleasant, told The Texan. They point to conservative wins on abortion, property taxes and more under Phelan's leadership.\n\nPhelan has also tried to shore up support by adding firepower to his staff, hiring longtime lobbyist Mike Toomey as his chief of staff and bringing on former Gov. Rick Perry as a senior adviser. Perry told KXAN earlier this month that Phelan has \"got the votes\" to hold onto the gavel.\n\nBut with a majority of Republicans behind Cook, Phelan's current path to 76 votes relies on support from the Democratic minority. And the speaker's opponents say that the entrance of two Democrats into the speaker's race - Ana-Maria Ramos of Richardson and John Bryant of Dallas - suggests that Phelan may not have as firm a lock on the Democratic caucus as his camp believes.\n\nTinderholt, meanwhile, said he believes Cook already has enough backing to reach the 60% threshold for the GOP caucus' endorsement.\n\n\"I believe those votes are already secured,\" Tinderholt said, \"and the only path that Dade Phelan has to the speakership is to reject the caucus vote and rely on the Democrat caucus to support him on the floor.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Texas Tribune at https://www.texastribune.org/2024/11/27/david-cook-dade-phelan-texas-house-speaker/ .\n\nThe Texas Tribune is a member-supported, nonpartisan newsroom informing and engaging Texans on state politics and policy.

Vicente Gonzalez , D-McAllen, has a message to his fellow Democrats in Congress. Actually, he has a few of them.\n\nNo. 1: Don't tell him how to handle his business, he's going to represent his district the way he knows is best. And No. 2: Clean up your own act.\n\nIn a recent interview with The Texas Tribune, the four-term Democratic congressman, with a penchant for going rogue, took a shiv to the Democratic playbook. He said the party's fixation on abortion this cycle was \"lazy\" and out of touch with his majority-Catholic district. He urged the party to, in some cases, soften its defenses of transgender rights, even if that means voting against the Democratic base. He said Democrats had insufficiently attacked Republicans on economic issues. And he said the Democrats were plagued with \"incompetence\" in gauging the driving issues for voters in districts like his.\n\n\"Their messaging is off. I also believe their polling is off. Democratic polling has been consistently off beyond the margin of error for the last two or three cycles,\" Gonzalez said in his Capitol Hill office. It's \"incompetence, at the end of the day. I think they need to get rid of people.\"\n\nGonzalez won his competitive South Texas district - which runs from the Mexican border in Brownsville to Corpus Christi along the Gulf Coast - by less than 3 percentage points this year, fending off Republicans' biggest offensive effort in the state. He outperformed Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost to President Donald Trump in every county in his district.\n\nGonzalez is one of the most conservative Democrats in Congress, at times voting with Republicans on issues related to energy and the border . He caused House Democratic leadership headaches as he pushed back on President Joe Biden 's climate and infrastructure agenda before eventually supporting the legislation , citing concerns it would negatively impact his district's energy interests.\n\nGonzalez said his ability to see the social conservatism of his district and knowing when to break from the national party helped preserve his place in Congress.\n\n\"I told the entire caucus, don't ever try to whip me again because I know my district better than anybody in this room,\" Gonzalez said. \"Having me 97% of the time is better than having my opponent 100% of the time. We need to give that leeway, especially to frontline members. Nobody knows our districts better than us.\"\n\nRepublicans poured millions of dollars into supporting their candidate, former U.S. Rep. Mayra Flores , this cycle, viewing Gonzalez's proclivity for off-color comments - including comparing Latino Trump supporters to \"Jews for Hitler\" in March - as a major vulnerability.\n\nThe race was among the most expensive U.S. House races in Texas this year. Flores, who previously represented the district for a few months in 2022 after winning a special election, spent over $5.7 million in the race as of mid-October.\n\nVicente Gonzalez's supporters watch the televised debate live between him and Republican challenger Mayra Flores in Rancho Viejo on Oct. 17, 2024. Credit: Michael Gonzalez for The Texas Tribune\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the House Majority PAC, the party's two biggest outside spending groups for House races, spent over $1 million with ads supporting Gonzalez.\n\nBut Gonzalez has serious issue with the way both groups operated in his district. Neither group responded to requests for comment.\n\nGonzalez said it was an error to focus so heavily on abortion in a region that is overwhelmingly Catholic. He said the strategy showed congressional Democrats \"don't know the region and they get lazy about it,\" leaning on the issue because it was salient in the 2022 midterms. Abortion was a central issue in TV ads aired in his district to help him by national Democrats, which Gonzalez said was out of touch with voters more concerned about the rising cost of living.\n\nThe ad \"was hitting my opponent on abortion in an 80% Catholic community. Somebody needs to get fired for that,\" Gonzalez said. \"Whoever was the decision maker to do that in South Texas should be gone, because they clearly don't know the district.\"\n\nA photograph of Gonzalez, his wife Lorena Saenz, President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden is displayed with other memorabilia in his office at the Cannon House Office Building in Washington, D.C. Credit: Shuran Huang for The Texas Tribune\n\nGonzalez saw some room for abortion to be an effective element to a winning strategy, but he said the messaging should be targeted on digital platforms to young women rather than blasted on television ads. Gonzalez still went after Flores on abortion when the two shared a debate stage in October .\n\nGonzalez said Democrats focused too much on TV ads generally in Texas and should have spent more time door knocking and talking to voters.\n\nGonzalez also lamented that Democrats don't have a winning strategy to counter anti-trans attacks that Republicans used through the latter part of the cycle. The National Republican Congressional Committee and Sen. Ted Cruz 's reelection campaign both poured money into ads attacking Democrats as wanting to use taxpayer money to fund gender transitions for children and to allow boys to play in girls sports. Democrats and LGBTQ+ rights activists denounced the ads as spreading dangerous misinformation about trans youth.\n\nGonzalez was among the few Democrats to tackle the ads head on, issuing his own counter ad rebuffing the Republicans' claims, saying he never supported tax-funded sex changes. He said more Democrats should feel comfortable following his lead, even if it leads to pushback from the progressive base.\n\n\"I think we need to protect every community in America,\" Gonzalez said. \"But there are issues that I don't agree with, like boys and girls bathrooms, or boys competing in girls sports, and I think we should be outspoken about it. I don't think Democrats should have to hide from a message like that.\"\n\nGonzalez has supported pro-trans legislation in the past, voting in 2021 for the Equality Act, which would protect trans people from discrimination.\n\nRepublicans are poised to continue their attacks on transgender rights, emboldened by voter response to their ads nationwide. And Democrats are already being confronted with the issue as the first transgender member of Congress, Rep.-elect Sarah McBride of Delaware, is set to be sworn in in January. Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina introduced a bill that would ban McBride from using the women's bathrooms or locker rooms in the Capitol complex.\n\nWhen asked if he would vote for Mace's bill, Gonzalez said: \"That's a very, very tough conversation that needs to be had by Democrats. And I think at the end of the day, we got to vote our district and vote what we really believe. And I don't believe that boys should be in girls' bathrooms.\" He did not specify how he would vote on the bill.\n\nMcBride has agreed not to use women's restrooms and stressed she does not want her gender to become a distraction. All members of Congress have private bathrooms. She did not respond to a request for comment on Gonzalez's remarks.\n\nGonzalez said Democrats should have invested in attack ads targeting Republican candidates who want to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Title I funding for schools in low-income communities, as Republicans have cast Democrats as supporting measures to defund the police. South Texas Republicans deny they want to cut funding for the programs.\n\nGonzalez also suggested he was not impressed with Democrat Michelle Vallejo, who challenged U.S. Rep. Monica De La Cruz in the 15th Congressional District. She lost both in 2022 and 2024, by double digits despite support from the DCCC and investment from the House Majority PAC. She ran in 2022 on a progressive platform, focusing on reproductive rights and expanding access to health care. She moderated her tune this cycle, but was unable to close or even shrink the gap.\n\nGonzalez said the district needs a moderate Democrat to win. \"It's a tough district, especially for somebody who initially campaigned as a progressive. It's kind of hard to turn the clock back,\" Gonzalez said.\n\nStill, Vallejo made positive strides. She outperformed Harris in her district by seven percentage points. Vallejo declined to comment.\n\nGonzalez formerly represented the 15th Congressional District for six years before switching to the 34th district in 2022 following redistricting. Then-DCCC Chair Sean Patrick Maloney preferred Gonzalez, a well-funded incumbent, stay in the more competitive 15th District to give Democrats a better shot at holding onto all of their South Texas seats, Gonzalez said. But Gonzalez defended the move, saying his home was drawn into the new 34th district and he had to prioritize his own race.\n\nGonzalez is optimistic that Democrats can continue holding on to South Texas despite the heavy investment from Republicans, saying Republicans have a \"low quality of candidate,\" including Flores and De La Cruz.\n\nDe La Cruz, who outperformed Trump in her district, shot back at Gonzalez's comments in a statement. \"It's funny he'd say that, considering I chased him out of this district and he's underperformed in the last three elections,\" De La Cruz said. \"He can focus on pettiness - I'll keep picking up his slack and delivering results for South Texas.\"\n\nGonzalez called Flores' victory in a 2022 special election a \"fluke,\" saying she got elected solely because Republicans poured millions of dollars into a special election that national Democrats did not pay much attention to.\n\n\"We welcome Vicente Gonzalez's self-delusion as the ground shifts underneath him. Donald Trump romped across South Texas, \" said Delanie Bomar, a spokesperson for the National Republican Congressional Committee, House Republicans' campaign arm. \"It's only a matter of time before those same voters toss Gonzalez from office, too.\"\n\nThe Texas Tribune answering reader questions about 2024 elections.

The previous owner had not let the state construct a wall there and had \"actively blocked law enforcement from accessing the property,\" according to the letter the GLO sent Trump.\n\nA Trump campaign spokesperson did not immediately respond Tuesday to a request for comment.\n\nA cornerstone of Trump's campaign was his pledge to clamp down on immigration by returning policies from his first term and deporting undocumented people en masse on a scale the country has not experienced in decades. Former aides - including some who are set to rejoin him - have described incorporating staging areas near the border to detain and deport people.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News posted Tuesday , Buckingham said she was \"100% on board with the Trump administration's pledge to get these criminals out of our country.\"\n\nBuckingham had previously said she approved an easement within 24 hours of acquiring the Starr County land to let the Texas Facilities Commission, which is overseeing the state's border wall construction, to begin building a wall. In the Fox interview, she said that move was followed by \"brainstorming\" with her team.\n\n\"We figured, hey, the Trump administration probably needs some deportation facilities because we've got a lot of these violent criminals that we need to round up and get the heck out of our country,\" Buckingham said. She noted the land is mostly flat, \"easy to build on,\" accessible to international airports and near the Rio Grande.\n\n\"We're happy to make this offer and hope they take us up on it,\" she added.\n\nTrump's vow to carry out mass deportations is certain to encounter logistical and legal challenges, like the ones that stifled promises from his first campaign once he assumed office.\n\nHowever, Trump's Cabinet picks indicate he is moving ahead in trying to carry out the deportations. He has selected Stephen Miller, an architect of the previous Trump administration's border and immigration policy, to return as a top aide and has named Tom Homan, a former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to be his \"border czar.\"\n\nAnd Texas is poised to try to help him implement the policies . After Trump left office in 2021, Gov. Greg Abbott launched an unprecedented border enforcement operation that included building a military base in Eagle Pass and the deployment of thousands of Department of Public Safety troopers and state National Guard troops to the border.\n\nCNN reported Saturday that Texas' \"border czar\" - Michael Banks, who serves as a special adviser to Abbott - has been a part of behind-the-scenes discussions with Trump's team about immigration initiatives.\n\nDisclosure: The Texas General Land Office has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

Board members reserve the right to change their votes.\n\nThe curriculum was designed with a cross-disciplinary approach that uses reading and language arts lessons to advance or cement concepts in other disciplines, such as history and social studies. Critics, which included religious studies experts, argue the curriculum's lessons allude to Christianity more than any other religion, which they say could lead to the bullying and isolation of non-Christian students, undermine church-state separation and grant the state far-reaching control over how children learn about religion. They also questioned the accuracy of some lessons.\n\nThe curriculum's defenders say that references to Christianity will provide students with a better understanding of the country's history.\n\nTexas school districts have the freedom to choose their own lesson plans. If the state-authored curriculum receives approval this week, the choice to adopt the materials will remain with districts. But the state will offer an incentive of $60 per student to districts that choose to adopt the lessons, which could appeal to some as schools struggle financially after several years without a significant raise in state funding.\n\nThree Republicans - Evelyn Brooks, Patricia Hardy and Pam Little - joined the board's four Democrats in opposition to the materials.\n\nLeslie Recine - a Republican whom Gov. Greg Abbott appointed to temporarily fill the State Board of Education's District 13 seat vacated by former member Aicha Davis, a Democrat who ran successfully for a Texas House seat earlier this year - voted for the curriculum. Abbott handpicked Recine, potentially a deciding vote on the materials, to fill the seat through the end of the year days before the general election, bypassing Democrat Tiffany Clark. A majority of District 13 residents voted this election for Clark to represent them on the board next year. She ran unopposed.\n\nBoard members who signaled their support for the curriculum said they believed the materials would help students improve their reading and understanding of the world. Members also said politics in no way influenced their vote and that they supported the materials because they believed it would best serve Texas children.\n\n\"In my view, these stories are on the education side and are establishing cultural literacy,\" Houston Republican Will Hickman said. \"And there's religious concepts like the Good Samaritan and the Golden Rule and Moses that all students should be exposed to.\"\n\nThe proposed curriculum prompts teachers to relay the story of The Good Samaritan - a parable about loving everyone, including your enemies - to kindergarteners as an example of what it means to follow the Golden Rule. The story comes from the Bible, the lesson explains, and \"was told by a man named Jesus\" as part of his Sermon on the Mount, which included the phrase, \"Do unto others as you would have done unto you.\" Many other religions have their own version of the Golden Rule.\n\nBrooks, one of the Republicans who opposed the materials Tuesday, said the Texas Education Agency is not a textbook publishing company and that treating it like such has created an uneven playing field for companies in the textbook industry. Brooks also said she has yet to see evidence showing the curriculum would improve student learning.\n\nHardy, a Republican who also opposed the materials, said she did so without regard for the religious references. She expressed concern about the curriculum's age appropriateness and her belief that it does not align with state standards on reading and other subjects.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the Democrats who voted against the curriculum said they worried the materials would inappropriately force Christianity on public schoolchildren. Others cited concerns about Texas violating the Establishment Clause, which prohibits states from endorsing a particular religion.\n\n\"If this is the standard for students in Texas, then it needs to be exactly that,\" said Staci Childs, a Houston Democrat. \"It needs to be high quality, and it needs to be the standard, free of any establishment clause issues, free of any lies, and it needs to be accurate.\"\n\nMore than 100 Texans signed up Monday to speak for and against the state-authored curriculum.\n\nCourtnie Bagley, education director for the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a conservative think tank that helped develop the curriculum, told board members that the Texas Education Agency has made every effort to respond to concerns from the public. She said rejecting the lessons would give other materials not owned by the state an unfair advantage.\n\n\"It would create a double standard, as Bluebonnet Learning has been held to a different and more stringent review process than other materials under consideration,\" Bagley said.\n\nOpponents argued that revisions did not go far enough, and some questioned whether the state's intentions with crafting a curriculum that leans heavily on Christianity are political.\n\n\"I am a Christian, and I do believe that religion is a part of our culture, but our nation does not have a religion. We're unique in that,\" said Mary Lowe, co-founder of Families Engaged for an Effective Education. \"So I do not think that our school districts should imply or try to overtly impress to young impressionable children that the state does have a state religion.\"\n\nEducation officials say references to Christianity will provide students with a better understanding of the country's history, while other supporters have stated their belief that the use of religious references does not violate the U.S. Constitution's Establishment Clause. Legal experts note that recent rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court's conservative majority have eroded decades of precedent and made it unclear what state actions constitute a violation of the establishment clause.\n\nState leaders also say the materials cover a broad range of faiths and only make references to religion when appropriate. Education Commissioner Mike Morath has said the materials are based on extensive cognitive science research and will help improve student outcomes. Of 10 people appointed to an advisory panel by the Texas Education Agency to ensure the materials are accurate, age-appropriate and free from bias, at least half of the members have a history of faith-based advocacy.\n\nThe Texas Tribune recently reported how parents, historians and educators have criticized the ways the materials address America's history of racism, slavery and civil rights. In public input submitted in response to the curriculum and in interviews with the Tribune, they have said the materials strip key historical figures of their complexities and flaws while omitting certain context they say would offer children a more accurate understanding of the country's past and present. Board member Rebecca Bell-Metereau, a San Marcos Democrat, and other Texans referenced the Tribune's reporting during public testimony on Monday.\n\nIn response to those concerns, the Texas Education Agency has said the lessons will provide students with \"a strong foundation\" to understand more complex concepts as they reach later grades. State officials have also said those materials are written in an age-appropriate manner.\n\nDisclosure: Texas Public Policy Foundation has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

Lee's \"excellent abilities\" as general of the Confederate Army, which fought to maintain slavery, and his desire to find \"a peaceful way to end the disagreement\" with the North. It does not teach that Lee enslaved people or highlight his racist views that Black people were neither intelligent nor qualified to hold political power.\n\nA lesson on Martin Luther King Jr. mostly emphasizes his nonviolent advocacy without acknowledging his swift criticism and recognition of the conditions that pushed people to violence or his belief that \"large segments of white society\" were more concerned about \"tranquility and the status quo than about justice and humanity,\" according to one of his speeches.\n\nMoreover, a fifth grade lesson on World War II describes how Nazi Germany's Nuremberg laws \"were created to dehumanize and target Jewish people.\" But it does not teach how those laws drew inspiration from Jim Crow and the dehumanization of Black people in America.\n\nTexas school districts have the freedom to choose their own lesson plans. If the state-authored curriculum receives approval this week, the choice to adopt the materials will remain with districts. But the state will offer an incentive of $60 per student to districts that choose to adopt the lessons, which could appeal to some as schools struggle financially after several years without a significant raise in state funding.\n\nThe Texas Education Agency has told the Tribune that many of the curriculum's historical references are meant to build \"a strong foundation for students to understand the more complex concepts\" as they get older.\n\nThe curriculum was designed with a cross-disciplinary approach that uses reading and language arts lessons to advance or cement concepts in other disciplines, such as history and social studies. While the curriculum makes it clear that the state does not intend for these materials to replace grade-level social studies instruction, it also states that certain specifics about American history are necessary \"so that students can understand and retell the story of our nation's birth.\"\n\nIn response to concerns Texans shared through public input about vague and inaccurate historical references, the Texas Education Agency made minor revisions to certain texts but largely defended its choices by saying that \"the content in these instructional materials is written in an age-appropriate and suitable manner.\"\n\nSeveral of the nearly a dozen parents, historians and educators whom the Tribune interviewed about the curriculum agree that age appropriateness is an important factor to consider when teaching history.\n\nTeaching elementary school kids about slavery in a meaningful way \"can build on children's instincts and help students apply them to their classrooms, communities and study of the United States,\" according to Learning for Justice, a community education program of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which created a guide for history teachers.\n\nRather than poring over the gruesome details of the Transatlantic Slave Trade, for instance, the organization recommends intentionally building instruction \"that prepares students to understand the long, multidimensional history of slavery and its enduring consequences,\" similar to how math instructors teach the basics of addition and subtraction long before students learn algebra.\n\nThat includes teaching that many of the founding fathers enslaved people, that enslavers often separated entire families for profit and as a form of punishment, and that the forced labor of enslaved people built many important buildings and institutions, according to Learning for Justice.\n\nHistorians interviewed by the Tribune also say that if the state is unwilling to use the materials it designed as a vehicle to provide students a more comprehensive picture of the country's history, then education officials should reconsider its cross-disciplinary approach and whether the proposed reading and language arts curriculum is the appropriate venue for such lessons.\n\n\"I would just start, as a basic premise, that you not lie to kids,\" said Michael Oberg, a history professor at the State University of New York College at Geneseo who previously taught in Texas and followed debates over the state's social studies standards. Oberg pointed to excerpts of the state curriculum about the founding fathers' desire for liberty and equality and Robert E. Lee's leadership as lessons he believes leave out significant historical context.\n\nHow the curriculum covers other major historical chapters also calls into question why lessons on some events are considered age appropriate and others are not.\n\nIn stark contrast to the state curriculum's lack of detail when covering American slavery, for example, a fifth-grade lesson on World War II is clear and precise about the horrors of the Holocaust, which it defines as \"the state-sponsored and systematic persecution and murder of six million Jewish people by the Nazi regime and its collaborators.\" The lesson further highlights how Jewish people \"were dehumanized, imprisoned, attacked and murdered\" and \"stripped of their rights, dignity and lives.\"\n\nHow Texas schools teach U.S. history to children has been the focus of intense political conflict in recent years. The state passed legislation in 2021 making it illegal for schools to teach slavery and racism as part of the \"true founding\" of the country.\n\nThe legislation came about after the summer of mass protests for racial justice in response to the murder of George Floyd, a Black man killed by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020. In the years that followed, Republican state lawmakers across the country pushed for legislation outlawing what Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick once described as \"woke philosophies\" maintaining that people, by virtue of their race or sex, are either oppressed or inherently racist. Many State Board of Education members have successfully campaigned on similar ideas in recent years.\n\nNow, the 2021 law prompts Texas schools to teach children that slavery and racism are \"deviations from, betrayals of, or failures to live up to the authentic founding principles of the United States, which include liberty and equality.\"\n\nThe law has sowed fear and confusion about what teachers are allowed to teach, while causing others to stray away or move quickly past certain topics like slavery and civil rights, said Jerrica Liggins, secondary education curriculum director for the Paris school district. Students are the ones who ultimately suffer, she said.\n\n\"Left out of the curriculum, I would say it would be anyone of color. But if you think about left out in the classroom, it's everyone. Because we're not giving them everything the way it happened,\" Liggins said. \"I'd say we were kind of sugar-coating it to make it seem to be more pleasant when it was really horrific.\"\n\nCaleb McDaniel, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian who teaches at Rice University, worries the state curriculum's framing of American slavery could diminish its significance and make it difficult for students to understand. The Civil War lesson he reviewed, for instance, doesn't detail the legal mechanisms built into the Constitution that enabled slavery to expand in the decades leading up to the war. The lessons about the founding fathers, he said, also fail to provide students a full picture of who the men were.\n\nGeorge Washington is quoted in the curriculum, for example, as saying \"there is not a man living who wishes more sincerely than I do, to see a plan adopted for the abolition\" of slavery. But the quote is cherry-picked from a longer letter in which Washington criticizes Quaker abolitionists in Philadelphia who are working to free enslaved people, McDaniel noted.\n\nMcDaniel added that the materials he reviewed reflect how history curricula have come a long way from a time when some would question whether slavery was the cause of the Civil War. But he said their evolution has not quite \"reached its ending point.\"\n\n\"I think the serious study of the American past reveals a lot of inequality and a lot of failures to live up to the ideals of democracy, and racial injustice is a key example of that,\" McDaniel said. \"I would challenge the idea that calling attention to that and helping students understand that part of our history is ideological in some way.\"\n\nMark Chancey, a religious studies professor at Southern Methodist University, was one of several people who provided public input about how the curriculum addresses slavery and religion.\n\nChancey said the materials' whitewashing of the nation's founders stood out to him, as did the repeated insistence that they sought freedom for all Americans. He also pointed out that for a curriculum that its defenders claim will teach children about the role Christianity played in the nation's founding, it fails to address the fact that many people used the religion to justify their support of slavery.\n\n\"Public schools are educating for civic purposes. We're developing our citizenry. We're preparing students to function in a pluralistic democracy and to deliberate about different ideas,\" Chancey said. \"Students need to have an accurate understanding of history to do that, and many of these lessons work against that goal by oversimplifying American history to the point of distortion.\"\n\nThe state cannot afford to produce another generation of children who don't have an accurate understanding of history, added Susan Nayak, a mother of an Austin school district graduate who provided public input to the Texas Education Agency on the curriculum.\n\n\"You can't just, 'Oh, this person is just a hero, and we're just going to talk about their good parts, and that's it.' I just don't think that's helpful for kids,\" Nayak said. \"They understand that they are not all good and all bad. And experiencing these people, historical figures, as true, complex humans, is actually helpful for them.\"\n\nPublic education advocates plan to continue calling on the State Board of Education to reject the materials, said Emily Witt, senior communications and media strategist for the Texas Freedom Network, which produced a report on the curriculum and raised concerns about the religious emphasis and whitewashing of American history.\n\nBoard members have also raised concerns about the curriculum, though some of their worries are different.\n\nPatricia Hardy, a Fort Worth Republican serving on the board, said she's still reviewing the materials. But thus far, she doesn't think they do an adequate job of merging reading and social studies lessons. The history lessons are scattered and not in chronological order, she said, which could make it difficult for students to retain the information. Nor does she find the history lessons - like a second grader learning about the Emancipation Proclamation - age appropriate.\n\n\"It does need to be taught, but it's got to be taught at the right place,\" said Hardy, a former history teacher and social studies coordinator.\n\nSome parents told the Tribune it's crucial that their children see themselves accurately reflected in the state's history lessons.\n\nKeiawnna Pitts, a Round Rock community activist and mother of four, who is Black, acknowledged that kids are impressionable but said they're exposed early in their lives to topics like race outside of their homes and classrooms. She also said children start asking questions from a young age. Glossing over the difficult parts of history, she said, does not help them to make sense of the world around them.\n\n\"Why do we need to introduce it to our kids early? Because I need them to think critically past what is being told to them,\" Pitts said. \"We're gonna have to be the ones teaching our kids, because this is what we're gonna always get - what they're comfortable with.\"\n\nDisclosure: Rice University, Southern Methodist University, Southern Poverty Law Center and Texas Freedom Network have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

Tim Walz encouraged Texas Democrats to elect U.S. Rep. Colin Allred to the Senate, telling a group of Dallas donors Monday that the race against Sen. Ted Cruz is within reach.\n\n\"You've got a senate race you can win in Texas,\" Walz said. \"My God, just do it for all of America. Replace Ted.\"\n\nWalz made the remarks during a brief visit to the state for a fundraiser organized by Vice President Kamala Harris' victory fund. Texas is one of Democrats' top flip targets in the U.S. Senate along with Florida. An Aug. 31 poll by The University of Texas' Texas Politics Project put Cruz ahead of Allred by 8 percentage points.\n\nWalz also touched on a number of issues impacting Texas, including the state's abortion restrictions, which he said \"creates a nightmare, and a dangerous situation,\" and ballot access laws, which he said were intentionally designed to keep Democratic voters away from the polls.\n\n\"For them, it's much easier to do voter suppression than voter outreach,\" Walz quipped of Republicans.\n\nWalz also touched on Tuesday's presidential debate - the first between Harris and former President Donald Trump - saying that Harris will likely focus on economic issues.\n\n\"We get an opportunity tomorrow for Vice President Harris to be on that debate stage to make the case for an economy that's for everyone,\" Walz said.\n\nMacarena Martinez, Cruz's campaign spokesperson, took aim at Walz's comments Monday afternoon.\n\n\"Tim Walz has a knack for watching things burn to the ground, so it's natural that he's supporting Colin Allred and his campaign,\" Martinez said in a statement.\n\nThe fundraiser, held at the HALL Arts Hotel Dallas, was sold out. It featured several major Democratic fundraisers in Texas, including Regina Montoya, a former Clinton administration official who co-chairs the Lawyers for Harris committee. Attorneys Jill Louis and Paul Coggins and former congressional candidate Sima Ladjevardian also helped host. Several of the same hosts also threw a Dallas fundraiser for President Joe Biden in March when he was still at the top of the party's ticket.\n\nDespite the presidential campaign's swings through Texas to raise money, it is not targeting the state as a flip opportunity. The lack of attention irks some down-ballot Texas Democrats , who feel greater attention from the top would give the final needed push to turn the state blue in other races.\n\nAllred so far has kept his race independent of the presidential race, focusing on collaborating with down ballot candidates in the state.\n\nWalz visited Dallas with his daughter, Hope. San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg, LULAC President Roman Palomares, Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilbero Hinojosa and Texas Democratic Party Executive Director Monique Alcala greeted him on his arrival.\n\nNirenberg, who is term-limited out of his office next year, has traveled the country as a surrogate for the Harris Campaign. He hasn't made clear his future plans but said during this year's Texas Tribune Festival that \"it would be an honor to serve in a Harris administration\" if asked.\n\nA group of Democratic state lawmakers on Friday asked the U.S. Justice Department to investigate potential violations of federal law and civil and voting rights related to Texas state leaders' recent voter roll purge , raids of Latinos' homes in connection to alleged election fraud, probing of voter registration organizations and ongoing scrutiny of groups that work with migrants.\n\n\"Collectively, these actions have a disproportionate impact on Latinos and other communities of color, which is sowing fear and will suppress voting,\" twelve Texas senators wrote in the letter . \"We urge the DOJ to investigate Texas ... and to take all necessary action to protect the fundamental rights of all Texans and ensure all citizens' freedom to vote is unencumbered.\"\n\nThe request for federal authorities to intervene is the latest escalation in response to what Texas leaders have often described as efforts to secure elections.\n\nThe efforts, however, have just as often provoked condemnation and worries from civil rights groups and Democrats that the state is violating Texans' rights and trying to scare people away from the polls.\n\nThe League of United Latin American Citizens, a large Latino civil rights organization founded in 1929, made a similar plea to the feds earlier this week. Several of the group's elderly members were the targets last week of search warrants related to an investigation into alleged election fraud being conducted by Attorney General Ken Paxton 's office.\n\nPaxton's office has said little about that probe other than it pertains to allegations of election fraud and vote harvesting. Affidavits for warrants obtained by The Texas Tribune show that investigators were looking into allegations that a Frio County political operator had illegally harvested votes for multiple local races.\n\nLULAC leaders have blasted the investigation as an effort to intimidate voters.\n\nIn the letter requesting a civil rights review, they wrote about Lydia Martinez, an 80-year-old grandmother with 35 years as a LULAC member who was woken up at 6 a.m. by armed authorities who interrogated her for hours and confiscated her devices, personal calendar and voter registration materials.\n\n\"These actions echo a troubling history of voter suppression and intimidation that has long targeted both Black and Latino communities, particularly in states like Texas, where demographic changes have increasingly shifted the political landscape,\" the letter states. \"The right to vote is fundamental to our democracy, and LULAC stands firm in its commitment to defending that right for all Americans, regardless of race or ethnicity.\"\n\nThe Justice Department had received LULAC's letter, a spokesperson confirmed Friday but declined to comment further.\n\nIn their letter Friday, the Texas Senate Democratic caucus pointed to the raids targeting LULAC members and a series of other actions that, they wrote, raised \"serious concerns\" that Paxton and other state leaders might be violating federal civil rights and voting laws.\n\nThe group highlighted the opening of an investigation last week by Paxton's office into voter registration organizations following a debunked claim by a Fox News host that migrants were registering to vote outside a state drivers license office near Fort Worth.\n\nThe claim was disputed by the Department of Public Safety, a local Republican county chair and the local elections administrator - all who said no evidence supported it - but Paxton opened an investigation anyway, the lawmakers wrote.\n\nThey also said that DPS, which manages the state's drivers license offices, has since prohibited groups from registering people to vote outside their offices - ending a decades-old practice the agency had allowed \"without issue.\"\n\n\"Voter registration organizations seek to improve civic engagement in a state that has one of the lowest voter turnout rates in the country,\" the letter states. \"Many of them now are concerned they will be the next to be harassed and targeted.\"\n\nThe Democratic lawmakers also expressed concern that the removal of more than a million people from the state's voter rolls might have included legitimate voters and that Texas might be violating a federal law that prohibits states from conducting such routine voter roll maintenance during a 90-day period ahead of an election - echoing a coalition of watchdog and voting rights groups that this week shared the worry.\n\nThe Senators lastly pointed to ongoing state efforts targeting nonprofits and nongovernmental entities that work with migrants and immigrants along the U.S.-Mexico border and beyond.\n\nThose examinations began after Gov. Greg Abbott in 2022 directed Paxton's office to investigate the role of such groups \"in planning and facilitating the illegal transportation of illegal immigrants across our borders.\"\n\nThe reviews are one piece of Texas' response to record migration that Abbott and other state leaders say is the fault of the \"open border policies\" of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris , the Democratic nominee for president.\n\nThrough a border security initiative called Operation Lone Star , the state has deployed thousands of Texas National Guard troops and DPS troopers to patrol the border and arrest migrants on state charges. Meanwhile in courts, Paxton's office has repeatedly challenged the Biden administration's immigration policies.\n\n\"Although the burden to address the ongoing border crisis should not fall to Texas, the federal government has failed to take action to address this problem,\" Abbott wrote to Paxton in the letter, adding he \"appreciate[d]\" the suits. \"But as the facts on the ground continue to change,\" Abbott added, \"we must remain vigilant in our response to this crisis.\"\n\nIn response, Paxton's office has sought to depose the leaders of at least two organizations that provide humanitarian aid to migrants and tried to shut down two other groups.\n\nTexas state judges have mostly rejected these Paxton initiatives, which have accused the groups of violating human smuggling laws and in one instance accused a group of violating rules that govern nonprofit's political involvement .\n\nBut Paxton has continued fighting.\n\nIn perhaps the most high-profile case, Paxton's office tried to shutter a migrant shelter network, Annunciation House, that it accused of violating laws prohibiting human smuggling and operating a stash house.\n\nAfter an El Paso judge denied the effort , Paxton appealed directly to the all-Republican Texas Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case. On Friday, the state's highest civil court scheduled oral arguments for the appeal in mid-January."

      "text": "The parentification trap: How evangelical daughters like the Duggar girls become mothers in training\n\nBy the time she was 13 years old, Ruth's daily schedule was almost identical to that of her mother's.\n\nBoth would wake up at 5:30 a.m. and spend an hour picking away at the seemingly endless list of chores associated with running what would eventually become a 12-person household : laundering and mending the mountain of hand-me-down clothes that occupied a corner of the kitchen, loading up three slow cookers with ingredients for dinner, cleaning the bathrooms before they'd be in use, on-and-off, all day.\n\nIf Ruth's mom was pregnant - which is how Ruth, who asked that only her first name be used, primarily remembers her - then the bulk of the work would fall to Ruth. She would be the one to wake her younger siblings and prepare them breakfast before walking the ones who were old enough to a church-run elementary school nearby.\n\n\"I didn't really have the option to pursue school outside of homeschooling, though, because my mom needed me to help with the much younger kiddos,\" Ruth told me in a phone call.\n\n\"I remember complaining about it for the first time when I was probably 11 and I'll never forget what she told me,\" she continued. \"She said, 'Ruth, this is what God made you for.'\"\n\nRuth, who is now 31 and lives outside of Atlanta, describes her family's religion as a \"slippery slope that led to Quiverfull .\"\n\nHer father was raised in a sleepy independent Baptist church in rural Georgia in the 1970s.\n\n\"But he always had a flair for the dramatic,\" Ruth said. \"Dad liked the Bible stories about the 'big miracles.' Jesus feeding the thousands, Moses parting the Red Sea, that kind of thing. So, when he visited a Pentecostal tent revival, where they were handling snakes and speaking in tongues, I think that was it for him.\"\n\nHer father, she says, was deeply compelled by the idea of demonstrating one's faith in God through outsized public displays. He gravitated towards scripture that encouraged followers of Christ to \"be in the world, but not of the world.\" After traveling through the South for a few years as a self-made evangelist who did odd jobs on the side, he married and saw an opportunity to follow God to the extreme by having as many children as possible to serve Christ.\n\nWhen asked about his decision, Ruth remembers her father would recite a Psalm from the King James Version of the Old Testament: \"As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth. Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them.\"\n\nIt's the same verse that other adherents to Quiverfull ideology - as well as the scandal-ridden Duggar family of TLC's \"19 Kids and Counting,\" who have previously said they do not identify as part of the Quiverfull movement - point to as a theological backing for their movement. They interpret it as a command to reproduce often without any birth control or family planning.\n\n\"I grew up around at least a half dozen other Quiverfull families, maybe more,\" Ruth said. \"And the parents, the fathers mostly, would talk about what a blessing children are, but I'll tell you, they didn't care about the female arrows in their quiver.\"\n\nEven in many more mainstream evangelical congregations, girls are trained up to be wives and mothers.\n\nBefore I hit puberty, youth leaders at my parents' Baptist church would talk to us about the virtues inherent to \"Proverbs 31 wives,\" which was based on a description of the ideal Godly woman that was purportedly written by King Solomon - who, if you'll remember, also supposedly had 700 wives and 300 concubines. (The irony is overwhelming in retrospect).\n\nIt was made clear that we were to be pure and virtuous \"help meets\" for our future husbands, someone to assist them in their role as spiritual leader of the household.\n\nIn Quiverfull families, however, the eldest daughters often take on the role of \"little mothers,\" as the blog \"Quivering Daughters\" aptly put it, or as additional help meets.\n\nWhile it's inevitable in any family with multiple children that the older siblings will have some responsibilities that younger siblings do not, in families that reach the double-digits in size and where Biblical patriarchy is preached, the burden falls heavily to the girls, which can have long-lasting psychological effects.\n\nIn 2017, The Atlantic published an article titled \" When Kids Have to Act Like Parents, It Affects Them for Life ,\" which dove into the concept of \"destructive parentification,\" a form of emotional abuse or neglect where a child becomes the caregiver to their parent or sibling. Researchers are increasingly finding that in addition to upending a child's development, this role reversal can leave deep emotional scars well into adulthood.\n\nLisa M. Hooper, a University of Louisville professor who studies parentification, told the publication that many children who were made to parent their siblings now \"experience severe anxiety, depression, and psychological distress. Others report succumbing to eating disorders and substance abuse.\"\n\n\"The symptoms look similar to some extent, from cradle to grave,\" Hooper told the Atlantic.\n\nDonna Jackson Nakazawa, the author of \" Childhood Disrupted ,\" added: \"Chronic, unpredictable stress is toxic when there's no reliable adult.\"\n\nMuch of the research that has been done on destructive parentification focused primarily on children whose parents were neglectful or unavailable because of alcoholism or addiction. But a survey of writings from women who were raised as Quiverfull daughters shows similar evidence of feeling anxiously unmoored.\n\nHillary McFarland, the author of \" Quivering Daughters: Hope and Healing for the Daughters of Patriarchy ,\" shared an excerpt of an old diary entry on her blog in 2009 . She'd written it when she was 14.\n\n\"I'm having a bad day today,\" she wrote. \"I'm just so tired! I'm so tired of working-there is always something that needs to be done and dad is never satisfied. I'm tired of being overwhelmed with everything. I'm tired of washing dishes every night, I wish that the house would stay clean for 2-3 days-the kids are always cutting up paper, getting out toys, splashing water all over the bathroom sink, getting mud and sand all over the bathroom floor.\"\n\nShe continued: \"I'm tired of getting mad at my brothers and sisters, I wish I were perfect. I absolutely abhor the thought that every idle word will be judged . . . lately I have been doing some self-analyzing, or examining-I'm trash . . . I'm sick of disappointing God.\"\n\nThat concept of disappointing God runs heavily through Quiverfull families. In many cases, there aren't enough hours in a day or resources, emotional and financial, to go around and it's burdensome; but as Vyckie Garrison, a former Quiverfull wife told Salon in an interview last week , many mothers approach it as a spiritual challenge or a backyard mission field.\n\n\"The [fellow Quiverfull] women would tell me, 'Missionaries risk their lives every day and they do it because it's their calling,'\" she said. \"'When they get to heaven, they'll get their martyr's crown.' There's a huge martyr's mentality.\"\n\nOver the last decade, the concept of parentification has gained enough mainstream traction that former viewers of the now-cancelled TLC show \"19 Kids and Counting\" have started to question whether the network's framing of the family as an oversized \"Waltons\" was shielding something more sinister, especially as the family's eldest son, Josh, has fallen into scandal after scandal, and has now been arrested for the possession of child pornography .\n\nThroughout the years, there have been numerous web forums and subreddits dedicated to going back and watching old footage of the show while advocating for the \"freedom\" of some of the Duggar family's daughters. Former Quiverfull daughters are now speaking out as well while the family is under increased scrutiny.\n\n\"One time, my family attended a talk by the Duggar parents and my baby brother was crying, so I had to take him out to the hall where all the other older daughters were handling their parents' babies, including Jessa and we all shared this exhausted look that I remember to this day,\" one Twitter user wrote.\n\nShe continued: \"Looking back now, it's so f**king funny that you had all these families who worshipped the Duggars and their way of life and all these daughters were in the hall with their parents' babies just like... f**k this, I'm tired.\"\n\nRuth felt this acutely while growing up. Most nights, she would only get five hours of sleep - between staying up late to finish chores, waking throughout the night to feed or comfort one of the babies, and getting up early - and was always exhausted.\n\n\"Since I was so tired, I would lash out at my parents and siblings and then I would get reprimanded,\" she said. \"While I was being punished, I would angrily pray to God, 'Why are you doing this to me? I'm just trying to serve you.'\"\n\nRuth ended up running away when she was 17 after watching \"Now, Voyager,\" a 1942 film starring Bette Davis. Her parents were strict about what she and her siblings watched, but most \"black and white classics\" were deemed acceptable.\n\nThe film takes its name from the Walt Whitman poem \"The Untold Want,\" which says, \"The untold want, by life and land ne'er granted, Now, Voyager, sail thou forth, to seek and find.\"\n\n\"In it, Bette Davis' character lives with a controlling mother who always puts her down and then she has this mental break,\" Ruth said. \"She ends up moving away, getting healthy, becoming fashionable and then she comes back. I thought that I could do that, too. All I really wanted was a break.\"\n\nHer break was a little less glamorous than Davis'. She got a job at a local convenience store and split rent with an elderly coworker. At night, she studied for her GED and on weekends, she'd eat cereal in her pajamas and watch television - trashy reality shows and Animal Planet, mostly.\n\nIt was the first time in Ruth's life that she didn't have a schedule; it was also the first time that she really watched the Duggars on television. \"I watched this sanitized version of what Quiverfull life was like and I was hurt, I was disgusted,\" she said. \"I can't even look at them to this day without getting angry.\"\n\nRuth said she hopes that the Duggars' crumbling facade in the face of Josh's scandals will make the public question other aspects of the family life they modeled for years on TV.\n\n\"I think back to how my mom said, 'God made you for this,' and I finally had to say, 'No, God made me for more,'\" she said.\n\nOne of the most striking things about the new podcast \" The Turning: The Sisters Who Left \" is how some of the former nuns describe their experiences with life behind the walls of Mother Teresa's world-famous order, the Missionaries of Charity: in language reminiscent of the way we talk about cults .\n\nThey use terms like \"isolation\" and \"brainwashing.\" They were only permitted to write home once a month and visit home once every decade. They describe what it feels like to look at a single human: as having a direct line to holiness.\n\nOf course there were beautiful, spiritually affirming moments, too - times where these women felt achingly close to the God for whom they'd given up their normal lives - but for some, the suffering and separation were too much. \"The whole idea was to make you feel as alone as possible,\" Kelli Dunham, a self-described \"ex-nun ,\" said.\n\nIt was enough to make some fantasize about escaping - and some did. Through \"The Turning,\" a new 10-episode podcast by Rococo Punch and iHeartMedia, producer and host Erika Lantz tells their stories.\n\n\"I really am interested in stories that don't have a clear right and wrong,\" Lantz told Salon in an interview. \"I think there's a lot of gray in the story. There are different sets of facts and, depending on what perspective you're using to look at them, you might have a very different opinion of what they mean.\"\n\nUnderstanding their journeys starts with understanding the cultural power of Mother Teresa herself. Though she wasn' t canonized as a saint until 16 years after her death in 1997, she was recognized as saintly by many in the Catholic church and beyond long before then due to her charitable work, especially after she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979.\n\nThe order she founded in 1950, the Missionaries of Charity, ran soup kitchens and opened and staffed orphanages and schools for the underprivileged across the globe ( though not without some controversy ), and still manages homes for the terminally ill. Over the course of 71 years, thousands upon thousands of women took vows of chastity, poverty, obedience and \"wholehearted free service to the poorest of the poor.\"\n\nBecause of that, Lantz said, Mother Teresa's name has become a \"synonym for kindness.\"\n\n\"It's like the shorthand in our culture,\" she said. \"When I started working on this project, I noticed that people would drop her name as a metaphor. Even in ' Tiger King ,' and this isn't a direct quote, but you had someone introduce Carole Baskin as 'the Mother Teresa of Cats.'\"\n\nMany of the women with whom Lantz spoke, even if they had left the order, said that the reverence towards Mother Teresa was absolutely warranted. \"She was so close to God and you knew it when she was there,\" one said.\n\nBut life within the order Mother Teresa had created was hard.\n\nThe sisters kept a rigid schedule that began at 4:30 a.m. and only included 30 minutes of unstructured recreation time, which was most often spent catching up on work that hadn't gotten done. Though they were required to go everywhere in pairs, the nuns were never allowed to have private conversations and would instead recite prayers together.\n\nThis was to encourage chastity, a virtue that, as Lantz found out in her reporting, Mother Teresa was strict about maintaining, almost to the point of paranoia. After all, the Missionaries of Charity were spiritually wed to Jesus and were organized to \"satiate the thirst of Jesus Christ on the Cross for Love and Souls.\"\n\nIt's a telling detail that Mother Teresa was so intently focused on Christ's crucifixion. While, as Lantz put it in \"The Turning,\" one would anticipate that the scriptural passages that would have most impacted Mother Teresa would have centered on Jesus' interactions with the poor, sick and hungry, she was perhaps most moved by how his pain catalyzed his holiness.\n\nThis was reflected in how the sisters lived in their respective convents, the series reports. Why would you pray from a chair when you could kneel on the hard ground? Why would you open the windows or wear one less layer when you could simply swelter? Why, as in the case of one nun, would you rest in bed after sustaining major burns when you could go back to work in almost unspeakable pain?\n\nHowever, as Lantz found out, the emphasis on achieving holiness through suffering didn't stop there. As is revealed early in \"The Turning,\" the sisters would frequently engage in self-flagellation.\n\nMary Johnson, a former nun and author of \" An Unquenchable Thirst \" - who also spoke with Salon back in 2013 about her experiences in the order - joined the Missionaries of Charity when she was 19 after seeing Mother Teresa on the cover of TIME Magazine.\n\nShe detailed her first self-flagellation session to Lantz, remembering how the bundle of cords she was given left her upper thighs streaked with red and white lines. In the bathroom stall next to her, there was another, more experienced nun doing the same thing.\n\nThis shocked Lantz, who said that the effects of that kind of trauma, even if self-inflicted, are lasting for many of the former sisters.\n\n\"I don't think anyone pictures Mother Teresa and imagines that her sisters are whipping themselves daily,\" she said. \"I know Mary Johnson had told me, at one point, she asked her now-husband to beat her - he did not, I should say -because she craved a way to have relief from guilt.\"\n\nAs Johnson told Lantz, the extreme nature of the religious order is part of its appeal, but it also contributes to some of the \"cultishness.\"\n\n\"It did surprise me that multiple sisters started using words like 'cult' or 'mind-control' or being 'brainwashed,'\" Lantz said. \"It doesn't necessarily mean those women thought they were in a cult, but it often felt like the closest thing they could compare it to. And it's interesting - often we think of cults as being on the fringes of society, but here we have the Catholic Church and Mother Teresa, who is so admired around the world.\"\n\n\"I think it's important to look at any institution with power with a critical eye and examine what role that power plays,\" she added. \"When you have a strict vow of obedience, where the superior is a direct voice of God, you're creating a power dynamic.\"\n\nThroughout \"The Turning,\" Lantz examines how that power dynamic played out in other ways through abuses, betrayals and forbidden love. She also teases out, quite beautifully, a question that many will enter the series thinking: \"Why didn't these women leave sooner?\"\n\n\"It's hard because you believe that Jesus has been fervently calling you to this, it's what you must do,\" Lantz said. \"Once you take that vow of obedience, that includes obeying God's will for you. Then Mother Teresa is also telling you that you've been called. It's hard to leave that. For some it's impossible.\"\n\nThe first two episodes of \"The Turning: The Sisters Who Left\" are now available. New episodes will be released weekly, wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nFood Network star Guy Fieri claimed that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos did not contribute to an emergency relief fund that the honorary Flavortown mayor formed for out-of-work restaurant employees during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Fieri said he launched the relief fund soon after the pandemic began because he was angry at the way local restaurants were left out of the handling of the national health crisis and associated government relief efforts .\n\n\"I don't get pissed or lose my sh*t,\" he said. \"But I was pissed.\"\n\nMost of the small, local restaurants that would have appeared on his long-running Food Network series \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives\" likely only had enough money in the bank to last 10 days amid government-mandated shut-downs and reductions of services, Fieri told the Hollywood Reporter .\n\n\"[Fieri] decided to ask his business manager for contact info for CEOs of major corporations,\" the article said. \"He drafted personal emails to power brokers like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, soliciting donations for an emergency relief fund that would ultimately award more than 43,000 grants - of $500 each - to out-of-work line cooks, servers and other restaurant professionals.\"\n\nFood Network President Courtney White said there was no better salesman than Fieri.\n\n\"There's a power to his enthusiasm,\" she said. \"It gets people to rally around his vision, whether it's a pitch for a show or in raising all that money.\"\n\nFieri went on to receive large donations from PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble and Uber Eats.\n\n\"I'm not into shaming people and telling who didn't donate,\" he said. \"That's not my style.\"\n\nHowever, after a pause, Fieri revealed to the publication that neither Bezos nor Amazon had rallied around the cause.\n\n\"Jeff, by the way, didn't help us,\" he revealed.\n\nRegardless, Fieri has raised more than $25 million for food workers left unemployed by COVID-19 closures over the last year. He also co-directed \" Restaurant Hustle 2020: All on the Line, \" a documentary that premiered in December and highlighted four chefs trying to stay in business amid the pandemic. A sequel is planned for this summer.\n\nOver the weekend, First Lady Jill Biden's patterned tights went viral on conservative Twitter. It began when a photograph of her deplaning at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland - wearing a tailored black blazer, an A-line leather skirt, the aforementioned tights and black booties - was shared on the platform and a user likened them to \"fishnet stockings.\"\n\nIt started a really nasty pile-on, underscored by a lot of Republicans drawing comparisons to former first lady Melania Trump ; a couple of the tamer comments read, \"Jill Biden is too old to be wearing fishnets. It's gross. Melania, on the other hand, would rock them,\" and \"Madonna called and wants her trashy look back, Doc.\"\n\nBiden's supporters were quick to defend her. \"She is wonderful, you are jealous,\" one wrote, while another added: \"She looked very chic.\"\n\nFor what it's worth, Biden's tights weren't actually fishnets. They were sheer tights with a geometric pattern - not that it should matter, obviously. However, the immediate backlash to Biden's outfit echoes past pearl-clutching , especially from conservatives, about what type of clothing is \"appropriate\" for the first lady of the United States.\n\nIt's an exercise that often speaks to a certain societal discomfort with reconciling cultural understandings of what femininity and power look like, and has since extended to criticism of how other women politicians dress.\n\nAccording to Carl Sferrazza Anthony, the author of \" First Ladies: The Saga of Presidents' Wives and Their Power, \" first ladies of the United States have held a \"highly visible, yet undefined, position in the U.S. government.\"\n\n\"The role of the first lady, the U.S. president's spouse, has evolved from fashion trendsetter and hostess of White House dinners to a more substantive position,\" he wrote. \"While there have been diverging views on the roles of women in society, the first lady is still a role model for American women. One of the highest-profile jobs in the U.S. government comes with no official duties, no paycheck, and almost limitless possibilities.\"\n\nInherent to that concept of being a role model is an understanding that the first lady will be, well, \"ladylike.\" The meaning of that term has shifted some throughout time, though it denotes politeness and a certain demureness or docility. As such, it's no surprise that male politicians have weaponized the term against their female counterparts, like when Republican Todd Akin complained that his Democratic opponent, Claire McCaskill, was not sufficiently \"ladylike\" in 2012.\n\nThis expectation of demureness has long extended to FLOTUS fashion, which has ignited a number of fashion scandals throughout history. When Mary Todd Lincoln wore shoulderless, sleeveless dresses, she was criticized as \"showing off her bosom.\" Several years later, the Women's Christian Temperance Union started a petition over Florence Cleveland's sleeveless gowns, claiming they were an immoral influence on America's young women.\n\nWhile some first ladies have been criticized as being \"frumpy\" - Mamie Eisenhower with her pressed shirt dresses and Hillary Clinton in her pant suits , for instance - it seems that there's no bigger affront to being in a position of political power or prestige than being considered provocative. We've seen this reaffirmed over and over again as more and more women take office of their own.\n\nFor example, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been criticized for her signature red lip - which she wears as a nod to Latina culture - as being too frivolous or seductive, a sentiment that was echoed by some conservatives when a video of her dancing in college was released hours after she was sworn in.\n\nIt remains to be seen, however, how or if eventual first gentlemen (FGOTUS?) will be judged by their attire. The closest search result that comes up when you Google \"Doug Emhoff too sexy\" is a lighthearted piece by The Forward, \" Kamala Harris' husband Doug Emhoff is our hot Jewish dad crush ,\" and we all know that male politicians' style choices rarely cause a blip on the radar. I don't think I've ever seen a commentator decry an especially vibrant red tie as too much for the House floor, for instance.\n\nYet in more recent memory, Michelle Obama ignited controversy by wearing a pair of shorts while exiting Air Force One at Grand Canyon National Park Airport which caused the blogosphere, as Time reported in August 2009 , to explode with debates over whether they were \"hot pants? Cutoffs? Booty Shorts?\"\n\nObama's shorts were far from \"booty shorts.\" They were gray, loose and looked like they could have been pulled off the shelf at GAP or J. Crew. To me, this is reminiscent of the Jill Biden tights situation. Sure, fishnets - like hot pants - are culturally recognized as sexy, if a bit campy in certain contexts (in \" The Pleasures of the Text ,\" French essayist Roland Barthes posited that the appeal was found in \"intermittence, which is erotic: the intermittence of skin flashing between two articles of clothing\").\n\nBut in both situations you have commentators who seem intent on positioning certain items of clothing as more seductive than they actually are as a way to shame or discredit the women wearing them.\n\nThere is, of course, a certain amount of hypocrisy that comes from Trump supporters criticizing either Michelle Obama or Jill Biden over the appropriateness of their attire. Before marrying Donald Trump, Melania worked as a model and occasionally posed nude. Those photos ran on the cover of the the New York Post in 2016, during Trump's campaign.\n\nThe New Yorker's Adam Gopnik posited at the time that this was potentially done with Trump's knowledge, or even blessing, as the Post was resolutely pro-Trump. It could have been Trump's way, Gopnik wrote, of trying to lure his feminist opponents into \"revealing their hypocritical readiness to turn on a woman with the wrong politics.\" That didn't happen.\n\n\"The photographs were received almost entirely without scandal, because, well, because education does happen, and change does take place, and even the most benighted among us, Trump quite possibly aside, now understand that a woman's body is hers to pose and have photographed more or less as she chooses, and that it is for the rest of us to respect her choices and to look or not at the photographs as we choose,\" Gopnik wrote.\n\nIt seems that Jill Biden's detractors could take that advice, as well.\n\nNetflix's \"Murder Among the Mormons\" co-directors Jared Hess and Tyler Measom were both young - six and 14, respectively - when a series of Salt Lake City bombings killed several high-profile members of the Mormon church in 1985. The murders drew national attention to the church, which, after a century of being viewed as a sort of \" outsider religion \" plagued by 19th-century extermination orders and persecution campaigns, had become and remains one of the fastest-growing denominations in the United States.\n\nThe violent nature of the crimes was a juxtaposition against a religious group that is often caricatured for its unrelenting optimism (as David Foster Wallace once wrote , \"There's always a Mormon around when you don't want one, trying your patience with unsolicited kindness\"), and as such, the bombings captured tabloid attention, which quickly gave way to conspiracy theories.\n\n\"Nobody knew what was going on,\" Hess told Salon in an interview. \"Because of that, it was a really uncomfortable time for so many people. Everyone was trying to get to the bottom of this tragedy, the likes of which Salt Lake City had never really experienced before.\"\n\nSpeculation continued. Was the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints actually behind the bombings? Or was it tied to the impending collapse of an investment business with which two of the bombing victims were involved?\n\nThe real answer, which is comprehensively outlined over the gripping three-episode true crime docuseries, is stranger than fiction. And it's a story that many Americans either never knew or don't clearly remember.\n\nIt starts with Mark Hofmann, a master forger who had initially made a name for himself in the burgeoning Mormon antiquities market. He launched his career by selling \"found\" documents about the early LDS Church to collectors, or the Church itself, and was known by some at the time as the \"Indiana Jones\" or a \"rock star\" of Mormon documents.\n\nBut then, in 1984, he produced what was later termed the \"Salamander Letter.\"\n\nThe correspondence describes how Joseph Smith found golden plates, which later resulted in the Book of Mormon, with the help of what the letter described as \"a seer stone, a kind of magical looking-glass.\" The letter also said Smith was initially barred from gaining possession of the plates by an \"old spirit\" that \"transfigured himself from a white salamander.\"\n\nThis stood in opposition to the early church's claims that it was the angel Moroni who had appeared to Smith and told him about the buried ancient record that would later become the Book of Mormon, and the fear was that the \"Salamander Letter\" would call into question Smith's spiritual experience by associating it with folk magic.\n\n\"I think when a lot of these documents were 'discovered,' it was really disrupting for the church, because it called into question the basis of what the church was, its history and founding,\" said Hess. \"[The LDS Church leaders] had never dealt with anything like this before.\"\n\nThat revelation could potentially cause a huge rift in the denomination. Hofmann anticipated this fear and acted to suppress the letter, but then his life, finances and work came under increased scrutiny - and secrets began to emerge from his past, sparking violence.\n\n\"There's no other true crime saga out there like this,\" Hess said. \"There are the murders, the forgeries and the religious aspects of it. And it was important to tell it from the perspective of people who lived it.\"\n\nAccording to Hess, who is still a member of the Mormon church, and Measom, who left the faith years ago, the initial title of the series was \"The Salamander,\" and then later \"The Salamander Murders,\" but they were ultimately influenced by the streaming service to change it.\n\n\"I think clearer is better for Netflix true crime,\" Hess said. \"There was this question of 'Is it about killing lizards? What is it about?' But there was this clip of archival news from the time, I think it was a national news report about all the attention on Utah, that said, 'There's murder among the Mormons.' And that was it.\"\n\nMeasom continued with a laugh: \"Plus, we like alliteration.\"\n\nThe new title is more conspicuous, which Hess and Measom anticipate could turn off some potential viewers. \"But I think anytime you're doing a film about a particular group, people are going to be nervous,\" Measom said. \"You could say you're doing a film about a country club, and if someone is a member, they're going to be at least a little nervous about how it's portrayed.\"\n\nHowever, one of the ultimate goals of the series, Hess said, was to clarify the events surrounding the Salt Lake City bombings which, while becoming part of the church's collective mythology, are largely unremembered by the mainstream public.\n\nThat was what drew him to the project after nearly two decades of making offbeat comedies like \"Napoleon Dynamite,\" \"Nacho Libre\" and \"Don Verdean,\" a 2015 comedy lightly based on Hofmann's forgeries about an archeologist who, after being bankrolled by an evangelical pastor, searches for items that can prove that the stories from the Bible are true.\n\n\"We showed it to several people during production, including my brother and some other people who are also LDS, and they said that it was educational and that it helped 'clear the air' regarding some of the details of the bombings,\" Hess said. \"It's a true crime story that just has so many layers to it.\"\n\nBut the docuseries isn't just a reflection on the history of a crime. A major, contemporary theme woven throughout \"Murder Among the Mormons\" is how susceptible people are to disinformaion when they want to believe something simply because it supports an existing point of view, much like how Hofmann found eager buyers for his earlier forged documents.\n\n\"We are all surrounded by so much information, it's everywhere, and people could do so much research - and they just don't,\" Measom said. \"And what Mark found in his forgery victims were people who were willing buyers, people who were susceptible to that disinformation, because they were blinded by their own faith or beliefs or sometimes greed. He even says at one point, 'When somebody says something is real, it becomes real.'\"\n\nAnd, \"Murder Among the Mormons\" quietly asserts, we could all be similarly taken. Not that we'd necessarily rack up thousands of dollars of debt to purchase purported Mormon antiquities, but for all of us, there's likely a point that we would take an ill-advised leap of faith, without fact-checking, simply because doing so supports the beliefs we currently hold. With that in mind, the series overwhelmingly eschews salaciousness for compassion in its retelling of the Salt Lake City bombings.\n\nOne of the reasons the series is able to achieve that tone is because \"Murder Among the Mormons\" offers unprecedented access to people who were intimately familiar with Hofmann and the bombing victims, including Brent Metcalfe, a historian who did research for Hofmann; Dorie Olds, Hofmann's ex-wife; Randy Rigby, a close friend of one of the bombing victims; Richard E. Turley Jr., a Latter-day Saint historian; and Ken Sanders, a Salt Lake City-based expert in rare books and antiquities.\n\nMany of those interviewed for the series were still emotional about the tragedy, the filmmakers said, largely because it was underpinned by fundamental questions about faith, religion and skepticism, which are also often private topics in American culture. You see hints of this as soon as the documentary opens on a visibly upset Shannon Flynn, a rare documents dealer whose voice wavers when he's asked about Hofmann.\n\n\"Can I ask a favor?\" he says. \"Don't make me answer that. Don't make me answer that. Let someone else do it. I don't want to make a hero out of him. Because he was fantastic.\"\n\nHess and Measom said that getting people to open up was a process. It helped that they were both raised in the LDS church, currently lived in Salt Lake City and had been toying with the idea for a documentary project about the \"Salamander Letter\" for almost a decade.\n\nMeasom also has a track record of exceptionally thoughtful work about Mormonism, including the longform NPR radio documentary \"Wives Tale,\" a short documentary about a love story between a Mormon missionary and a communist in 1974 called \"Elder,\" and \" Sons of Perdition ,\" which \"follows three teenage boys after they escape from the secretive FLDS polygamist sect and must fend for themselves in mainstream America.\"\n\nBut according to Measom, in the case of \"Murder Among the Mormons,\" the biggest thing they had going for them was time. Living in Salt Lake City, they spent years going to lunch with the individuals whom they would eventually go on to interview.\n\n\"This wasn't a situation where we just spent an hour with someone to get a quote,\" he said. \"We would sit with them, just asking questions and really listening to their memories and feelings. Think about it - how often do people have the opportunity to tell their stories and have someone really listen?\"\n\nHess added: \"A lot of the people we spoke with hadn't had to talk about [the events surrounding the bombings] for years, so I think when they started reliving it, and we were listening, the emotions became very fresh again.\"\n\n\"Murder Among the Mormons\" is currently streaming on Netflix.\n\nFormer president Donald Trump resigned from the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists on Thursday, after the union's National Board voted \"overwhelmingly\" to convene a disciplinary process that could have resulted in expelling him in response to Trump's part in inciting the Jan. 6 attack on the United States Capitol.\n\nTrump released an open letter to SAG-AFTRA on what appears to be photocopied White House stationery addressed to union president Gabrielle Carteris ( of \"Beverly Hills 90210\" fame ) detailing his immediate resignation. \"I write to you today regarding the so-called Disciplinary Committee hearing aimed at revoking my union membership,\" Trump wrote. \"Who cares!\"\n\nTrump went on to write that while he was \"not very familiar\" with the union's work, he was proud of his work on movies and television shows like \"'Home Alone 2,' 'Zoolander' and 'Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps'; and television shows including 'The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,' 'Saturday Night Live,' and of course, one of the most successful shows in television history, 'The Apprentice' - to name just a few!\"\n\nHe also wrote that, due to his involvement in politics, he helped resurrect interest in television, which he characterized as a \"dying platform with not much time left.\"\n\n\"[I've] created thousands of jobs at networks such as MSDNC and Fake News CNN, among many others,\" Trump wrote.\n\nHe concluded the letter by saying that he no longer wished to be involved in the union and was tendering his immediate resignation.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, SAG-AFTRA offered a two-word statement , jointly attributed to Carteris and the union's National Executive Director David White, in response to Trump's resignation: \"Thank you.\"\n\nTrump's resignation letter was a response to a Jan. 19 release from SAG-AFTRA , which stated that the organization's National Board had ordered a disciplinary hearing regarding Trump's role in inciting the attack on the U.S. Capitol and \"in sustaining a reckless campaign of misinformation aimed at discrediting and ultimately threatening the safety of journalists, many of whom are SAG-AFTRA members.\"\n\n\"Donald Trump attacked the values that this union holds most sacred - democracy, truth, respect for our fellow Americans of all races and faiths, and the sanctity of the free press,\" Carteris said at the time. \"There's a straight line from his wanton disregard for the truth to the attacks on journalists perpetrated by his followers.\"\n\nThe release stated that if Trump was found guilty of violating SAG-AFTRA constitutional guidelines during the union's disciplinary committee hearing, there would be possible penalties including reprimand, censure, fines, suspension from the rights and privileges of membership, or expulsion from membership in SAG-AFTRA.\n\nAccording to the Hollywood Reporter , Trump had pensions at both the Screen Actors Guild and American Federation of Radio and Television Artists - dating back from before the two organizations merged in 2012 - and throughout his time in office continued to receive residuals from roles in projects such as \"The Apprentice,\" \"Home Alone 2\" and \"The Little Rascals.\"\n\nThe trailer for Louise Linton 's new movie \"Me You Madness\" dropped on Thursday, and well, it's a lot.\n\nI'm here to offer a description of a film that, while real, feels more like an insane game of GOP-adjacent \"Mad Libs.\" \"Me You Madness\" stars Linton, the wife of former Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin , as a sociopathic bisexual woman who, per IMDB , \"hunts down and kills men with crossbows, martini glasses, and kitchen knives in order to eat them.\"\n\nCatherine Black (Linton) is a 1980s Malibu hedge fund manager who is addicted to fashion, money and sex. \"You may think that I'm a materialistic, narcissistic, self-absorbed misanthrope,\" Black muses in a voiceover in the trailer below. \"I don't deny it.\"\n\nHer life is an endless parade of stacks of cash, spin classes and metallic boots - that is until Tyler, played by infamous \"Gossip Girl\" star Ed Westwick , answers her ad for a roommate. Tyler, a petty criminal, thinks he's struck gold when he rolls up to her beachside mansion; Catherine thinks she's found her next meal. It's a love story for the modern ages (made all the weirder by the recent allegations that actor Armie Hammer allegedly identifies as \"100% a cannibal\" ).\n\nLinton is not primarily known as an actress, though she's had several small roles in low-budget horror movies and on shows like \"CSI: NY\"; she did, however, write, direct and finance \"Me You Madness\" through her production company Stormchaser Films.\n\nRather, she rose to a certain level of infamy in 2017 when she Instagrammed a photo of herself and Mnuchin disembarking a military jet following a trip to Fort Knox . She added hashtags that nodded to her designer apparel #rolandmouret, #hermesscarf, #tomford and #valentino. A woman responded with the comment, \"Glad we could pay for your little getaway. #deplorable,\" which incensed Linton.\n\n\"Aw!!! Did you think this was a personal trip?! Adorable!\" Linton responded. \"Do you think the US govt paid for our honeymoon or personal travel?! Lololol. Have you given more to the economy than me and my husband? Either as an individual earner in taxes OR in self sacrifice to your country?\"\n\nMe You Madness - OFFICIAL TRAILER www.youtube.com\n\nThree months later, Linton accompanied her husband to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Washington. Someone took a photo of her holding up a sheet of freshly printed dollar bills while wearing elbow-length black leather gloves. The image went viral - as did the frequent comparisons to Cruella de Vil - and cemented her status as a real-life cartoon villain.\n\nWith that in mind, perhaps Linton's lines in the trailer that detail her obsession with \"the accumulation of money\" are a self-aware nod to the public's perception of her? Perhaps. In interviews , Linton has expressed that the movie is an attempt to subvert the femme fatale steretotype, with a little \"American Psycho\" thrown in for good measure.\n\nBut according to the New York Times , the weirdest parts of the camp-fest aren't revealed in the trailer.\n\n\"In one sequence that plays like an MTV video, Catherine caresses frozen, severed male body parts while dancing to 'Let's Hear It for the Boy' in stiletto-heeled boots.\" writes Brooke Barnes. \"There is a drug-fueled poolside orgy. Please, pretty please, stay around for the madly spinning nunchaku, thong leotard and choreographed 'tomayto-tomahto' conga.\"\n\n\"Me You Madness\" debuts on demand on Friday, Feb. 12.\n\nPresident Joe Biden had a busy first day in office. He halted construction on the border wall and re-established DACA protections . He rejoined the Paris Climate Accord and recommitted the United States to the World Health Organization. And, according to broadcast journalist Tom Newton Dunn, Biden removed Donald Trump's \"Diet Coke button,\" which the former president used to request cold sodas on-demand.\n\n\"When @ShippersUnbound [Tim Shipman] and I interviewed Donald Trump in 2019, we became fascinated by what the little red button did,\" Dunn tweeted . \"Eventually Trump pressed it, and a butler swiftly brought in a Diet Coke on a silver platter. It's gone now.\"\n\nThroughout Trump's presidency, his obsessive love of the beverage was well-documented. In 2017, the Washington Post published that he reportedly drank a dozen cans of Diet Coke per day and, while the majority of Americans are just finding out about the Diet Coke button, that same year, Demetri Sevastopulo wrote for The Financial Times about how he noticed the red button on Trump's desk. He jokingly asked if it was the nuclear button, to which Trump replied, \"No, no, everyone thinks it is. Everyone does get a little nervous when I press that button.\"\n\nAccording to the Associated Press , the button has been a fixture \"on the Resolute Desk that presidents have used for decades,\" though not for summoning diet soda. The fact that Trump appropriated for it for such use is, frankly, unsurprising. Its existence is a reminder for some of the most laughable parts of Trump's personality (and its removal seems to have been an almost a necessary exorcism).\n\nWhile assigning goodness or inherent value to a food item can turn into an uncomfortable pseudo-classist exercise (like when the New York Times hosted a quiz where readers could guess whether refrigerators belonged to Biden voters or Trump voters based on their contents), there's a certain \"Home Alone 2: Escape to New York\" childishness inherent to slapping a button 12 times a day as a way to demand a Diet Coke on a silver platter.\n\nIt's a warped idea of what fanciness or indulgence denotes, which is both a perfect encapsulation of Trump's public persona and, in part, what led to Diet Coke's heyday in the '90s.\n\nConsider the often-memed image of Trump and Melania standing, wax figure-like, in their $100 million New York penthouse . It's gaudy and gold-covered with columns, chandeliers and frescos reminiscent of a Cheesecake Factory dining room. That photograph is the visual definition of the adage, \"You can't buy taste.\"\n\nTrump's tastelessness was a glaring, omnipresent facet of his presidency. A photograph that feels strikingly similar was taken in 2019, when Trump invited the Clemson Tigers, that year's national college football champions, for a White House dinner, only to serve them a buffet of Filet-O-Fish sandwiches and slices of Domino's pizza , a choice that many criticized as racist and classist. He stands beneath a portrait of Abraham Lincoln with his arms outstretched over a mahogany table, stacked high with cardboard burger boxes and flimsy plastic packets of fast food sauces that were balanced inside pewter gravy boats.\n\n\"We went out and we ordered American fast food, paid for by me,\" he told reporters that night. \"Lots of hamburgers, lots of pizza. Three hundred hamburgers. Many, many French fries.\"\n\nIt may seem odd that a well-documented fast food devotee (and former McDonald's and Pizza Hut spokesperson) like Trump would opt for Diet Coke instead of the real thing, but it's important to consider what the beverage likely meant to him.\n\nIn his essay \"The Decline and Fall of Diet Coke and the Power Generation That Loved It,\" Nathan Heller asserts that while the Coca-Cola company tried to endear the beverage to \"hip, scrappy youths, it became, enduringly, the beverage of the power generation that emerged across the Clinton years and cheered tie-less, outside-the-box, rule-bending thought in business and in life.\"\n\n\"During the late eighties and nineties, Diet Coke seemed less fussy, less patrician, less 'Frasier' than second-wave coffee,\" Heller wrote.\"It helped define a novel archetype of masculinity - the bootstraps kid who'd made it big, who was cool and modern, in a suit.\"\n\nThis is, despite the fact, that diet soda was traditionally marketed to women as a way to control weight. Emily Contois, the author of \"Diners, Dudes and Diets: How Gender and Power Collide in Food Media and Culture,\" wrote that while Coca-Cola went after male and female customers with Diet Coke, unlike their previous diet product Tab, they were largely unsuccessful.\n\n\"Trump seemed to believe that rules, of any sort, don't apply to him,\" she wrote via email. \"That guided his food and beverage choices - from a dozen Diet Cokes a day to well-done steak with ketchup to copious fast food - and much of his presidency.\"\n\nWhile it's impossible to know what exactly Diet Coke meant to Trump (though we know it was something he would request during tense conversations, like when he cried out for one while discussing purchasing the rights to a story about an alleged affair he had with ex-Playboy model Karen Mcdougall ), the bizarre optics surrounding the revelation of the Diet Coke button is a fitting epilogue to his presidency. It's a reminder of a man who could have just used an office mini-fridge to satiate his cravings, but obviously liked the feeling of being able to summon a servant with a cold drink at the push of a button. While so many of his stump speeches were bolstered by ramblings about being a man of the people, his actions consistently contradicted that - even down to how he took his dozen daily sodas.\n\nBut the Trump era has concluded, and the Oval Office already looks different . Where a bust of Fred Trump used to preside over the office, there is now a statue of labor organizer Cesar Chavez; Trump's beige rug has been swapped out for a royal blue replacement, and a portrait of Andrew Jackson was taken down in favor of a painting of Benjamin Franklin. No word yet on whether the Resolute Desk button will be replaced - and if so, what pushing it will summon.\n\nWhen poet Amanda Gorman took center stage during President Joe Biden's inauguration to deliver her poem \"The Hill We Climb,\" it became immediately clear why she was chosen to precede him on the podium.\n\nOnly four presidents -John F. Kennedy, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and now, Biden - have had poets read at their inaugurations and Gorman captivated viewers across America as she spoke of a shaded past and a lighter future, not shying away from four years of grief and trauma, but nevertheless determined to offer an outlook for America's redemption.\n\nHer presence as a young Black woman artist on stage felt deeply historic, especially as deep political divisiveness and racist rhetoric from government leaders and law enforcement has continued to come into clearer view over the last four years. And everything about her reading - from the development of her work, to her chosen outfit, to the poem itself - is imbued with symbolism.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about Gorman and her performance:\n\nWho is Amanda Gorman?\n\nGorman is a 22-year-old poet from Los Angeles and is the youngest poet to ever perform on Inauguration Day. According to the New York Times , Gorman developed a love of poetry at a young age.\n\nAs Gorman told NPR's Steve Inskeep , she, like President Joe Biden, had a speech impediment as a child. She said that was one of the reasons that she was drawn to poetry. \"Having an arena in which I could express my thoughts freely was just so liberating that I fell head over heels, you know, when I was barely a toddler,\" she said.\n\nGorman was encouraged to really pursue her craft by her middle school teacher mother, Joan Wicks, and became the first person to hold the position of National Youth Poet Laureate at 16. Later, she attended Harvard to study sociology.\n\nHow was Gorman chosen to perform at the inauguration?\n\nAccording to Harper's Bazaar, several weeks before the inauguration, Dr. Jill Biden stumbled upon a video of Gorman reading her original poem \"In This Place: An American Lyric\" at the Library of Congress in 2017. A Zoom call was set up between Biden and Gorman, during which Gorman was invited to compose and read an original poem.\n\n\"They did not want to put up guardrails for me at all,\" Gorman told the New York Times . \"The theme for the inauguration in its entirety is 'America United,' so when I heard that was their vision, that made it very easy for me to say, great, that's also what I wanted to write about in my poem, about America united, about a new chapter in our country.\"\n\nWhat was Gorman's writing process like?\n\nGorman described to several publications how she initially struggled with the enormity of the project ahead of her. She told the Los Angeles Times that she listened to music that helped put her \"in a historic and epic mind-set,\" including soundtracks from \"The Crown,\" \"Lincoln,\" \"Darkest Hour\" and \"Hamilton.\"\n\nWhat enabled her to fully complete the poem, however, was observing the insurrection attempt at the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\n\"I wasn't trying to write something in which those events were painted as an irregularity or different from an America that I know,\" Gorman said. \"America is messy. It's still in its early development of all that we can become. And I have to recognize that in the poem\n\nWith this in mind, she wrote the lines: \"We've seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it / Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy / And this effort very nearly succeeded / But while democracy can be periodically delayed / It can never be permanently defeated.\"\n\nWhat poem did Gorman read and what did it mean?\n\nGorman recited her original poem \"The Hill We Climb,\" a poignant, self-aware piece that speaks boldly to the deep divides in this country, led by people who would rather topple democracy than accept defeat. And yet, she acknowledges how powerful it is that we are in \"a country and a time where a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president, only to find herself reciting for one.\"\n\nWhile \"The Hill We Climb\" describes the brokenness and hopelessness many in this country may feel following Trump's incitement of violence, the poem encourages listeners with the knowledge that they can \"step out of the shade.\" Gorman told NPR that she dug into the works of orators like Martin Luther King, Jr., Frederick Douglass, Abraham Lincoln and Winston Churchill, who all were tasked with calling for hope and unity in times of division.\n\nOne particular line that seemed to stand out to viewers was, \"Scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid. If we're to live up to her own time, then victory won't lie in the blade, but in all the bridges we've made.\"\n\n\"Under their own vine and fig tree\" is a phrase found in multiple places throughout the Hebrew Scriptures and is used to describe the simple life of a farmer who was independent of military oppression. It was later used by George Washington nearly 50 times in various correspondence , as a reference to the American Revolution. Then, in a 1787 issue of the New York Journal it was used by a writer to describe America as a place for oppressed immigrants to find independence.\n\nYou may also recognize the line from the \"Hamilton\" song \"One Last Time,\" where it's contextualized as, \"Everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree/And no one shall make them afraid/They'll be safe in the nation we've made.\"\n\nGorman's inclusion of that phrase speaks to America's founding as a place that had the potential to be free of oppression, and the ongoing dream that it could be true for all Americans, regardless of race or cultural background.\n\nHow did people respond to \"The Hill We Climb\"?\n\nGorman's recitation was met with rhapsodic praise from celebrities, artists, and political organizations alike, who took to Twitter to express their own thoughts on her sober, yet hopeful outlook.\n\n\"I have never been prouder to see another young woman rise! Brava Brava, @TheAmandaGorman !\" said celebrity entrepreneur Oprah Winfrey, \"Maya Angelou is cheering - and so am I.\"\n\nGorman also got nods from people in the news media, with CBS National Correspondent David Begnaud saying , \"Watch Amanda Gorman. It's a treat.\" Seth Abramason, a popular columnist from Newsweek, also boosted Gorman's poem on Twitter, urging others to do so.\n\nPulitzer-Prize-winning poet Jericho Brown posted on Twitter, \"Oh this is just lovely. Flow like water,\" later quoting one of Gorman's most poignant lines on Twitter: \"If only we're brave enough to see it, if only we're brave enough to be it.\" American legal scholar Lawrence Tribe also applauded the youth poet: \"Amanda Gorman's inspiring inaugural poem perfectly captured the challenge of the moment - and our hopes for the future.\n\nMeanwhile, many Democratic politicians joined the chorus. Senator Cory Booker, expressed on Twitter, \"Thank you, Amanda Gorman, for sharing such powerful and inspiring words today.\" Congresswoman Stacey Abrams said , \"Amanda Gorman's message serves as an inspiration to us all.\" Former First Lady Michelle Obama also added, \"With her strong and poignant words, @TheAmandaGorman reminds us of the power we each hold in upholding our democracy. Keep shining, Amanda! I can't wait to see what you do next.\"\n\nEven Republican political action committee The Lincoln Project chimed in, \"Amanda Gorman's poem on unity is one for the history books.\"\n\nDazzling as it was, however, reception to Gorman's poem was not without criticism. Editor-in-chief of The Dispatch Jonah Goldberg went against the grain, and admitted , \"Not loving this poem.\"\n\nWhat's the story behind Gorman's outfit?\n\nGorman accessorized with subtle symbolism in mind. She wore a ring bearing the emblem of a caged bird, a tribute to poet Maya Angelou, the author of \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,\" who performed at the 1993 presidential inauguration of Bill Clinton.\n\nThat ring was a gift from Oprah Winfrey. As Gayle King reported on CBS News on Wednesday morning , Oprah had actually gifted Angelou with the coat she wore that day and wanted to continue the tradition, but Gorman had already purchased the yellow coat seen on Biden's Inauguration Day, so Oprah gave her the earrings she is wearing, as well as the ring, as a nod to Angelou.\n\nOn Monday afternoon the White House released an executive order detailing the figures that Trump wants represented in his National Garden of American Heroes.\n\nTrump originally pitched the idea during a July 2020 speech at Mount Rushmore , amid nationwide protests that again brought questions of who should be memorialized through monuments into focus; across the country, statues of slave owners and Confederate officers were vandalized and removed.\n\nIn his speech, Trump said that these actions constituted a branch of \"cancel culture.\"\n\n\"This movement is openly attacking the legacies of every person on Mount Rushmore,\" he said .\"They defile the memory of Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and Roosevelt.\"\n\nHe continued: \"I am announcing the creation of a new monument to the giants of our past. I am signing an executive order to establish the National Garden of American Heroes, a vast outdoor park that will feature the statues of the greatest Americans to ever live.\"\n\nIn the seven months since, there has been no movement on creating the statue park. No Congressional funding was secured for the proposed project and, despite the executive order, it's unlikely to be picked up by the next administration. Regardless, two days before leaving office, Trump released the list of figures he'd like to see memorialized - and it is completely unhinged.\n\nThe list is a bizarro grab bag of 244 individuals , defined simultaneously by its randomness and tone-deafness. Logistics aside (How large would the park be? How close will the insane amount of statuary be to each other? Will it be like a Madame Tussauds cast in stone?), Trump's definition of \"hero\" is muddled.\n\nYou'd have Grover Cleveland, Walt Disney, Whitney Houston and Dolley Madison all next to each other, flanked by Kobe Bryant, Louis Armstrong, Neil Armstrong and Theodor Geisel aka \"Dr. Seuss.\" There are civil rights champions and abolitionists like Martin Luther King, Jr., Harriet Tubman and Harriet Beecher Stowe, alongside slave-owning presidents such as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. More members of Buffalo Bill's Wild West show are present on the list than Asian Americans.\n\nIn many ways, however, Trump's list of \"American Heroes\" - which can be viewed in its entirety here - is emblematic of his presidency. It's riddled with choices that will make readers pause due to their obvious lack of research, regard for the truth and sensitivity. Here are some of the most weirdest missteps on the list (there are many more), starting with the demographic breakdown:\n\nDemographic Breakdown\n\nWhile the list is overwhelmingly random, it's also overwhelmingly male. As Axios' Danielle Alberti reported , Trump's \"American Heroes\" are 73% men. Additionally, 86 of the nominees, nearly a third, were born between 1900 and 1950.\n\nWhen asked in that same article by Axios about his views on the list, historian Michael Beschloss, who specializes in the United States presidency, said, \"Any American who loves democracy should make sure there is never some official, totalitarian-sounding 'National Garden of American Heroes,' with names forced upon us by the federal government.\"\n\n\"The glory of American democracy is that every one of our citizens decides who his or her personal heroes are,\" Beschloss said. \"That is not the prerogative of any president, especially one rejected by American voters and who is on his way out the door. Many of the people on this list of 'heroes' would be embarrassed to be singled out by someone like Donald Trump.\"\n\nAdditionally, as the Associated Press reported , when Trump first proposed the list in 2020, there were no Native American, Hispanic or Asian American individuals. The list has been diversified some, but it's obviously an afterthought.\n\nChristopher Columbus\n\nOne of the most incendiary names on the list was Christopher Columbus - who was neither American, nor did he ever actually set foot in North America. He did, however, initiate the Atlantic slave trade and the genocide of thousands of indigenous people. His cruelties are difficult to fully quantify, ranging from allowing the settlers under him to sell 9- and 10-year-old girls into sexual slavery, to forcing indigenous people to collect gold for him.\n\nIn June 2020, three statues of Columbus were damaged or pulled down in as many days.\n\n\"In St. Paul, demonstrators toppled a ten-foot-tall statue that stood in front of the Minnesota state capitol,\" wrote Theresa Machemer for Smithsonian Magazine . \"In Richmond, protesters pulled down an eight-foot-tall statue in Byrd Park, carrying it about 200 yards before setting it on fire and throwing it into the nearby Fountain Lake. And, around 12:30 a.m. Wednesday, police in Boston received a report that a marble statue of the Italian explorer and colonizer had lost its head.\"\n\nAndrew Jackson\n\nThis choice is very much in the same vein as Columbus. Jackson, who was the seventh president of the United States, was one of the primary supporters of the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which authorized the government to extinguish any Indian title to land claims in the Southeast.\n\n\"The result was the Trail of Tears, in which Cherokee and other native peoples of the Southeast were forced at gunpoint to march 1,200 miles to 'Indian territory,'\" Billy J. Stratton wrote for Salon in 2017 . \"Thousands of Cherokee died during the passage, while many who survived the trek lost their homes and most of their property. Ironically, much of the land on which the Cherokee and other removed tribes were settled was opened to homesteading and became the state of Oklahoma some 60 years later.\"\n\nBecause of this, it seems deeply tone-deaf to include Jackson next to Native American icons like Chief Joseph, Sitting Bull and Tecumseh.\n\nMuhammad Ali\n\nSo, admittedly, this name stuck out to me because I live in Louisville, Kentucky, Ali's hometown, and have reported previously on why there are no full-body statues of the boxing legend. According to Jeannie Kahnke of the Muhammad Ali Center - whom I interviewed in 2018 - they receive a lot of requests to use Ali's likeness.\n\n\"Over the years, I cannot tell you how many times people have come to us, saying 'I want to do a Muhammad Ali statue ,'\" she said. \"It has probably been at least 15.\"\n\nHowever, Ali was a devout Muslim, and he felt his faith would prohibit full-body statues being erected of him - which, Kahnke said, would prevent Ali's family from giving their blessing for a life-size statue of him. Some sculptors have done so without his family's permission, but many have found other, more creative, ways to honor the boxer.\n\nIncluding his name on the list demonstrates either an obvious lack of research or a willingness to dishonor Ali's wishes and religious beliefs.\n\nIngrid Bergman\n\nIn Trump's executive order, he stated that the park's goal is to honor those believed to be \"historically significant,\" and \"individual[s] who made substantive contributions to America's public life or otherwise had a substantive effect on America's history.\"\n\nTo that end, one of the defining characteristics of Trump's list is the mishmash of political and pop culture, but Swedish actress Ingrid Bergan stands out because she . . . wasn't American. And unlike Alfred Hitchcock and Alex Trebek (who were born in the U.K. and Canada, respectively), she never became an American citizen.\n\nIt really raises the question of what qualifies as a \"substantive contribution to America's public life\" in Trump's mind. Was he just a big \"Casablanca\" fan? Perhaps, because Humphrey Bogart is on the list, too.\n\nWoody Guthrie and Hannah Arendt\n\nAs New York Daily News reporter Chris Sommerfield tweeted yesterday , there are several \"incredible self-owns\" found on Trump's list, like the inclusion of Woody Guthrie, \"who wrote 'Old Man Trump,' a blistering 1950s tune about the Trump family's racist housing practices in Brooklyn.\"\n\nAdditionally, Trump included the German-born American political theorist Hannah Arendt, who was perhaps best known for her book \"The Origins of Totalitarianism.\" Her writings on \"the banality of evil\" have been repeatedly invoked to describe Trump's apparent and growing desire for autocratic rule.\n\n\"I think she would be appalled,\" Roger Berkowitz, who directs the Hannah Arendt Center at Bard College - on whose campus Arendt is buried and where she taught for many years - told Jewish Insider on Monday evening. \"I think Arendt would find it ridiculous that Trump nominated her. I think she would find Trump ridiculous, and I think she'd find him dangerous insofar as he undermines the basic idea of truthfulness and truth in the country. His attack on the election she would have found abhorrent and dangerous.\"\n\nEdward R. Murrow\n\nFinally, Trump's disdain for legitimate, objective reporting is no secret. He has called the media the \"enemy of the people,\" and as such, it was no surprise to see the phrase \"Murder the media\" scrawled on a door of the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nThat's why it was kind of a shock to see Edward R. Murrow, the broadcaster and war correspondent who had a deep impact on journalistic ethics, included on Trump's list. If Murrow were still alive and writing, I have no doubt that he would have reported truthfully on Trump - just as he reported critically on Senator Joseph McCarthy - and been decried as another \"enemy of the people.\"\n\nFor what it's worth, Trump's executive order directed the secretary of the interior to identify a site and provide funding and said a taskforce would \"publish an annual public report describing progress on establishing the National Garden and on building statues.\"\n\nJoe Biden has nominated Deb Haaland for the position , and neither she nor Biden's transition team have issued a comment on the garden, making it unlikely that it will ever actually take root.\n\nMany people first became aware of the Heaven's Gate cult in 1997, when - after an anonymous tip was called into the San Diego Police Department - the bodies of 39 men and women were found in a rented seven bedroom mansion. Each of the bodies were dressed in androgynous outfits with matching haircuts and Nike sneakers. On their arms were \"Star Trek\"-inspired bands that read \"Heaven's Gate Away Team,\" and in their pockets were $5.75.\n\nThe discovery caused an inevitable media frenzy, especially after law enforcement authorities reported it as the largest mass suicide on American soil ( The \"Jonestown Massacre,\" during which more than 900 Americans died, took place in Guyana in 1978). The group believed that once they shedded their physical \"vehicles,\" they would ascend to heaven in a spaceship where they would reach the \"Next Level. There, they would be transformed from their human shell into an alien form.\n\nAccording to group documents, members had taken phenobarbital mixed with applesauce or pudding, followed by vodka, then asphyxiated themselves with plastic bags. The suicides occurred in shifts over three days, with cult founder Marshall Applewhite - known as \"Do\" - being among the final shift.\n\nThe scene was horrifying, but had enough of an aura of oddity to eventually become fodder for late-night television shows and comedy sketches. For example, in its first live show following the discovery of the bodies, \"Saturday Night Live\" aired a sketch in which the Heaven's Gate members actually make it to space, followed by a fake advertisement for Keds, with the tagline, \"Worn by level-headed Christians.\"\n\nInherent to all jokes was a question that tends to underlie many mainstream discussions of cults: \"How could someone be so easily taken?\" The more fringe the group, the more blunt the question - but one that HBO Max's new docuseries \"Heaven's Gate: The Cult of Cults,\" spearheaded by documentarian Clay Tweel, carefully attempts to dismantle and subvert over four hour-long episodes. It's a thoughtfully paced series, rich in original source material and striking watercolor animations in place of reenactments.\n\nThe first two episodes aren't the most salacious (if that's what you're looking for, skip ahead to the last two episodes), but they are the most illuminating when it comes to identifying where the tenets of Heaven's Gate fall in the orbit of culturally accepted religious and spiritual teachings.\n\nIf - like me - you grew up in or around a Christian church that was heavy on themes of sanctification and purification, some of the cult's ideologies won't sound, well, too alien; just replace the hellfire and brimstone with spacecraft and stargazing.\n\nAs this docuseries asserts early in the first episode, a key teaching of both mainstream Christianity and Heaven's Gate was that growing in one's spirituality hinges on shedding one's worldliness. As the Apostle Peter wrote to his followers, \"Dear friends, I warn you as 'temporary residents and foreigners' to keep away from worldly desires that wage war against your very souls.\"\n\nMeanwhile, archived footage of Heaven's Gate members - gleaned by Tweel from early videos of recruiting sessions, public access television appearances, and the now-infamous \"farewell messages\" from group followers - features them espousing similar sentiments.\n\n\"I don't think people know how deep their humanness goes,\" said Dick Joselyn, a one-time Air Force pilot trainee, who was a member of the Heaven's Gate cult for over a decade, but as another member, Margaret Ella Richter, said, \"It's possible to overcome humanness.\"\n\n\"Heaven's Gate: Cult of Cults\" is built on the insight of various sociologists and religious scholars - most notably author and researcher Reza Aslan - who thoughtly weave together this connection, before landing on one of the things that makes a cult a cult. The leaders \"break you down and create a new you.\"\n\nAgain, this has a Biblical parallel. Ephesians teaches, \"Put off your old self, which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful desires, and be renewed in the spirit of your minds.\"\n\nMany of the teachings of Heaven's Gate have a spiritual, though not always Christian, analogue - ideas of ascension (like in the Biblical book of Revelation), a state of enlightenment reminiscent of nirvana, an afterlife. This gospel, if you will, was deeply influenced by New Age concepts, including the idea of \"walk-ins,\" a person whose original soul has departed his or her body and has been replaced with a modified soul. These teachings were also eventually recorded by Applewhite in a series of videos that are deeply evocative of televangelism.\n\nHow could people be naive enough to join Heaven's Gate? Well, as one of the featured religious scholars posits, the group was something akin to an errant branch of Christianity (a point that host Glynn Washington made in his popular \"Heaven's Gate\" podcast, wherein he details his own upbringing in a Doomsday Christian cult.)\n\nIt appealed to members for the same reasons churches continue to fill their pews. People want to find connection, they want to feel like they are destined for something greater and that there is evidence of life beyond our immediate and perceptible surroundings. Some former members - who, like the members who eventually died by suicide, were largely educated with strong family ties - still describe their Heaven's Gate years as the best time of their lives. For a brief moment in time, they felt like they belonged.\n\nThat said, Heaven's Gates teachings were ultimately dictated by its leaders. Applegate's \"spiritual partner,\" Bonnie Nettles - known as Ti - is presented as the mastermind behind the original recruitment. She was raised Baptist, but her beliefs ultimately became a kind of spiritual grab bag, influenced by New Age teachings, astrology, divination and science fiction.\n\nAnd once she eventually died, and Applegate was on his own (and absolutely bereft, it should be noted) those teachings became flexible in order to cope with the cognitive dissonance that her \"leaving her vehicle early\" sparked. That's when, Tweel asserts, Heaven's Gate became more about the messenger than the message, and Applegate transitions from kooky, fringey New Age leader to the leader of the, as he puts it, \"cult of cults.\"\n\nThat's when things dip into the salacious - and into more familiar territory for those who already know the story.\n\nWhere \"Heaven's Gate: Cult of Cults\" falls a little short is in its explanation or exploration of Applegate and Nettles' appeal. As leaders, they lack any kind of discernable charisma. While their teachings may have initially been palatable - even appealing - there's a disconnect when it comes to why their followers stayed, especially when they were asked to forsake their families, mainstream society and any source of income.\n\nThis wasn't just popping into a church service once a week - it was a full-time commitment, so I was left wondering when things became uncomfortable, what it was about their leadership that compelled their flock to persevere?\n\nThat said, \"Heaven's Gate: Cult of Cults\" is a thoughtful assessment of the mechanisms of how otherwise smart, savvy people are attracted to fringe beliefs.It takes a story that is larger than life and brings it solidly back to earth.\n\nAll four episodes of \"Heaven's Gate: Cult of Cults\" are now available to stream on HBO Max.\n\nDays before Thanksgiving 2018, two turkeys - Peas and Carrots - were vying for the presidential pardon, an oddball tradition formalized by George H.W. Bush in 1989. Leading up to the event, the White House had set up online and social media polls to determine the fowls' fates.\n\nWhen the votes were finally tallied, President Donald Trump revealed that Peas had won in \" a fair and open election .\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, Carrots refused to concede and demanded a recount, and we're still fighting with Carrots,\" Trump said at the time. \"And I will tell you, we've come to a conclusion - Carrots, I'm sorry to tell you, the results did not change. Too bad for Carrots!\"\n\nToo bad for Carrots, indeed.\n\nDuring this year's turkey pardon, held Tuesday in The White House Rose Garden, Trump didn't mention his own refusal to officially concede the 2020 presidential election , nor did he reference the numerous, baseless allegations of voter fraud he and his oddball legal team lobbed into courts across the country (despite the fact, as Salon's Roger Sollenberger has reported, no state election officials have reported evidence of such fraud).\n\nThe president did, however, open the event by talking about the stock market, and even managed to squeeze in a racist reference to the \"China virus\" between pardoning one of the \"two magnificent gobblers\" in attendance.\n\n\"Thank you very much, please,\" Trump said as he stepped in front of the microphone. \"I just want to congratulate everybody. The Dow Jones Industrial Average just broke, for the first time in history, 30,000. That's good, that's great for jobs and good for everything.\"\n\nThe president had already held a surprise, one-minute press conference earlier in the day, The Hill reported .\n\n\"His appearance on Tuesday may have been an attempt to grab credit for the historic rise on the Dow, and to siphon some attention away from Biden, who was scheduled to speak at 1 p.m. about his Cabinet picks,\" The Hill's Brett Samuels wrote .\n\nIt's also worth pointing out that the Dow surpassed 30,000 shortly after several of Biden's Cabinet picks were announced, along with updates on the development of several effective COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe turkey pardoning was a short event as well, lasting less than ten minutes, much of which Trump spent talking about the novel coronavirus.\n\n\"During this Thanksgiving we extend our eternal gratitude to the doctors, nurses, healthcare workers and scientists who have waged the battle against the China virus,\" Trump said. \"We give thanks for the vaccines and therapies that will soon end the pandemic. It's just such a tremendous feeling knowing they are coming, and they are coming likely next week or shortly thereafter.\"\n\nThe president then proceeded to officially pardon Corn - whose compatriot was named Cob - a 42-pound turkey who will retire to Virginia Tech's \"Gobblers Rest,\" at the university's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.\n\nAs Trump turned to walk back into the White House, a reporter called after him, asking what most Americans are probably thinking as the president's days in office draw to a close: \"Will you be issuing a pardon for yourself?\"\n\nIn late July, a group of Kentucky gardeners and farmers marched through downtown Louisville, pushing wheelbarrows and demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, the 26-year-old unarmed Black woman who was fatally shot by Louisville Metro Police Officers in March.\n\nThey started at a local farmer's market and moved 1-1/2 miles westward, towards Jefferson Square Park - now called Injustice Square, after serving as the nightly gathering place for protesters - where they had planted Breonna's Roots, an edible garden that was bursting with summer produce like ruby red tomatoes and peppers, deep purple eggplants and bunches of kale, dill, rosemary and parsley.\n\nAccording to volunteer Jody Dahmer, the vegetables were harvested and transported a few miles further west to be distributed in Russell, one of Louisville's historically Black neighborhoods that is also one of the city's most barren food deserts. There are only two accessible major supermarkets to serve nearly 60,000 residents (and there's a longstanding rumor among food access advocates in the community that the nearest Kroger will eventually close permanently, after it shuttered sporadically amid protests, leaving only one option).\n\nBut now, the weather is snapping cold. Temperatures dip into the low 30s overnight, and soon, Injustice Square will be blanketed with morning frost, so the garden volunteers are having to pivot.\n\n\"With frost dates approaching, we are focusing on cole crops,\" Dahmer said, referring to a designation of cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and brussels sprouts that grow better in cooler temperatures. \"But [we] also have garlic and onions planted between.\"\n\nThis isn't a unique conversation - all across the country, community garden leaders are having to adapt their plots for the winter or, in some cases, simply latch the garden gates behind them until early spring. But in food insecure neighborhoods, those decisions can have a community-wide impact on produce access, a sad reality that is particularly evident during the colder months.\n\n\"It becomes a real scarcity over winter,\" said Cordia Pugh, the founder of Hermitage Community Gardens in Chicago. \"A real scarcity as we race through the winter, waiting for spring to come when we can get back in the gardens to get fresh produce.\"\n\nPugh spoke with Salon earlier this year about her community gardens , which are located in Englewood, where, according to municipal data , nearly 95% of the neighborhood's residents are non-Hispanic Black, and nearly 80% of that population lives with low or volatile access to fresh produce.\n\n\"This is not hobby gardening, this is food security for us,\" Pugh said at the time. \"This is food insurance in the epicenter of a food desert. If we did not grow this fresh produce, we would not have fresh produce accessible to us. There is no accessible big box store in this community - or if we bought it through those venues, it would be from vendors that would quadruple the price.\"\n\nTypically, Pugh works with garden volunteers over the spring and summer to preserve fresh produce for the colder months, but the pandemic lockdowns and social distancing recommendations drastically impacted that initiative. There is very little produce stockpiled, as a result, and Pugh said that she's currently in the midst of attempting to get fresh produce boxes to her garden members.\n\n\"I'm speaking out of my own desperation this year, because I'm really scrambling now to get the resources in place for fresh produce food distribution over the course of November through April of next year,\" Pugh said. \"Especially because some of our members don't have access - financially or otherwise - to those big box stores.\"\n\nAnd even if they can get to the store, Pugh said, there's no guarantee that the quality of the produce available will be the same as in stores in more affluent or mixed-race areas.\n\nThis is a well-documented phenomenon. In 2010, The Food Trust, a Philadelphia-based food access nonprofit, and the Oakland-based PolicyLink published \"The Grocery Gap,\" a comprehensive paper that detailed how, in hundreds of lower-income communities of color, access to healthier foods like high-quality produce, high-fiber bread and low-fat milk was compromised.\n\nIn Louisville, Shauntrice Martin has taken the last several months to examine these disparities, focusing specifically on the city's food deserts, like Russell. Martin is the founder and director of #FeedTheWest , a community food justice initiative that advocates for a Black-owned, fresh food source for residents.\n\nShe published her findings under the title, \"The Bok Choy Project,\" wherein she compared five Krogers across five different zip codes, assessing four characteristics: the number of organic produce options available, the presence of police officers, the Black population of said zip code, and the availability of bok choy.\n\nAccording to Martin, she chose bok choy as a stand-in for \"premium produce\" because it was an item that she only saw on shelves once she moved out of West Louisville to Maryland when she was in her 20s. Now that she's back, she definitely sees discrepancies in selection and quality between the supermarkets in the zip code with 11% Black population - 11 organic produce options - compared to the one with 92%, which had only three organic options.\n\n\"When you walk into that store, there is an 'organic section,'\" Martin said. \"But it usually only has pears and apples. The rest of it is conventional produce. It's wilted, some of it is rotten or expired on the shelf.\"\n\nThese are the options that are available, Martin and Pugh said, for food insecure communities, which statistically tend to be lower-income communities of color. And while community gardens like Hermitage Community Gardens and Breonna's Roots serve as a stopgap in warmer months, they aren't a replacement for equitable food access and distribution systems.\n\nIn Toronto, the food access nonprofit FoodShare spends a lot of time thinking about what food security actually means and what food sovereignty would look like in Northern climates that experience winter. According to Natalie Boustead, the organization's community gardens leader, a lot of our current eating habits are reliant on expensive greenhouse production and imported items to maintain a level of consistency in our diets throughout the year.\n\n\"Which, if we were actually eating locally, seasonally [and] within a framework of true self-reliance here in Northern climates, would not be possible,\" Boustead said. \"If we were to shift our cultural expectations around eating seasonally to involve only eating dried fruits, and fermented, salted and sugared foods from summer harvest . . . we may have a shot at actual food sovereignty and self-sufficiency.\"\n\nNot to mention, she said, there would need to be a complete overhaul of North America's racist food distribution system.\n\n\"Until all of that begins to shift, there are very few deeply meaningful ways that those experiencing food insecurity in an urban setting can do to lessen their systematically entrenched relationship to an unfair food system, especially in winter months,\" she said.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Pennsylvania politician Dean Browning - a white, heterosexual , self-described \"proud pro-life & pro-2A Christian conservative\" - tweeted, \"I'm a black gay guy and I can personally say that Obama did nothing for me, my life only changed a little bit and it was for the worse.\"\n\nThe tweet continued: \"Everything is so much better under Trump though. I feel respected - which I never do when democrats are involved.\"\n\nBrowning, who is a former commissioner in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, sent this tweet in response to one of his earlier posts, in which he said, \"What Trump built in 4 years , Biden will destroy in 4 months.\"\n\nTwitter users leapt on Browning's bizarre response, many speculating that it was obvious that he had forgotten to log into his \"sock puppet\" account. A sock puppet account is an online identity used for purposes of deception by concealing its owner's real identity. In this case, it seemed Browning had exposed an account on which he masquerades as a gay Black Trump supporter.\n\nOr had he?\n\nIf this situation already seems bizarre to you, just buckle up. Things are about to get much weirder.\n\nAfter several hours had passed, Browning posted an explanation by way of an additional tweet.\n\n\"Regarding the tweet that is going viral from my account - I was quoting a message that I received earlier this week from a follower,\" he wrote. \"Sorry if context was not clear. Trump received record minority votes & record LGBTQ votes. Many people won't say it vocally, but do in private.\"\n\nBut then, in a now-deleted tweet, the Washington Post's Philip Bump found a contender for Browning's sock puppet account. \"You know who replies to Dean Browning a lot? 'Dan Purdy,' a gay black Trump supporter who joined Twitter in October,\" wrote Bump.\n\nBut then, in a now-deleted tweet, the Washington Post's Philip Bump found a contender for Browning's sock puppet account. \"You know who replies to Dean Browning a lot? 'Dan Purdy,' a gay black Trump supporter who joined Twitter in October,\" wrote Bump.\n\nWhen Salon reached out to Browning, he responded via email that his failure to make it clear that his viral tweet was a follower's quote was \"an oversight on [his] part\" and that \"there will be a video up shortly that will clear things up.\"\n\nSure enough, just after 5pm, the Dan Purdy account posted a video - the first to be posted from the account - that featured a middle-aged Black man claiming, \"I sent that message to Dean, Dean accidentally posted it somehow, that's the end of the story. No, he's not a sock puppet. No, I'm not a bot.\"\n\nAt this point, the entire saga had gone bananas on social media, and a horde of Twitter sleuths began dissecting the video. Some theorized that Purdy was merely an actor hired by Browning to help cover his gaffe. \"Fiverr will get you any Dan Purdy you want,\" one tweeted in response, referring to online platform fiverr.com, in which anyone can quickly hire freelance talent.\n\nThen there was a break in the case.\n\nSome internet sleuths noticed the avatar used on the Dan Purdy account was identical to one used as a profile picture on the Facebook account of a Philadelphia man named Byl Holte - and that the man tagged in photos as Holte bore a shocking resemblance to the man who appeared in Purdy's Twitter video (purported to be Purdy).\n\nA dive into Holte's background reveals several interesting things: He's written several articles on Medium, where he identifies himself as an \"Anti-feminist TV Critic\" and complains about anti-racism and feminism in the film industry; he is listed on LinkedIn as a \"boutique landscape designer\" in Pennsylvania; And, in the weirdest twist yet, he is music legend Patti LaBelle's adopted son.\n\nLaBelle adopted the two children of her sister, Jackie Holte, after her death in 1989. They are named Stayce and William, or \"Byl.\" Byl Holte's Facebook account features public photos of him with LaBelle at family gatherings.\n\nThe Dan Purdy account has since been deactivated, and Browning's last tweet reads: \"I see I'm trending with Patti LaBelle tonight. I guess we've not gone only viral - but over the rainbow.\"\n\nRegardless, some questions still remain unanswered: What is the relationship between Holte and Browning? Is the \"Dan Purdy\" account actually Holte's? Was Browning ignorant of the racist and sexist comments on the fake Dan Purdy account - and if not, why choose to quote that specific follower? And, most importantly, what does Patti LaBelle think about all this?\n\nWhile the unprecedented (and seemingly never-ending) presidential election took up much of the spotlight last week - as did the welcome news that Kamala Harris will be first woman and woman of color as Vice President - history was made in a lot of smaller state and local races, too.\n\nFrom politicians of color reaching new heights in the legislature, to big shifts in local government leadership, here are some of the wins that should be on your radar.\n\nA record number of Native American women were elected to Congress\n\nThree Native American women have been elected to the House of Representatives: Democrat Deb Halaand, a Laguna Pueblo member representing New Mexico, Democrat Sharice Davids, a Ho-Chunk Nation member representing Kansas, and Republican Yvette Herrell, who is Cherokee and will represent New Mexico.\n\nHalaand and Davids, the Guardian reports, both retained their seats after becoming the first Native American women elected to Congress in 2018. Additionally, the Center for American Women and Politics reports that 18 indigenous women ran for congressional seats this year, which is also a record in a single year.\n\nCori Bush becomes the first Black congresswoman in Missouri\n\nBush, a registered nurse and Black Lives Matter activist, will become the first Black congresswoman in the state's first congressional district, which includes Ferguson, where, as the New Yorker reports , she led protests against the police killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown.\n\nAll four members of the \"Squad\" were comfortably re-elected\n\nShortly after the 2018 midterm election, Representatives Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley - all Democratic, first-term congresswomen of color- gained nationwide attention and promptly dubbed themselves \"The Squad.\"\n\nThe four freshmen congresswomen have vocally supported progressive proposals like raising the minimum wage, advocating for the Green New Deal and calls to impeach Trump - who had previously attacked the women, who are all obviously American citizens, in a series of 2019 tweets, telling them they should \"go back\" to their countries of origin.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press , Pressley defeated Roy Owens in Massachusetts, Omar defeated Lacy Johnson in Minnesota, Ocasio-Cortez defeated John Cummings in New York, Tlaib defeated David Dudenhoefer in Michigan\n\nLGBTQ+ politicians had several monumental victories\n\nSarah McBride, a former spokesperson for the Human Rights Campaign, will become the nation's first person who publicly identifies as transgender to serve as a state senator after winnng last week's election in Deleware; this makes her the highest-tanking trans official in U.S. history.\n\nIn Vermont, Taylor Small - the 26-year-old director of the health and wellness program at Pride Center of Vermont - was elected to the Vermont House of Representatives, where she will be the first openly transgender member of the state's Legislature.\n\nRitchie Torres, a New York City Council member, won his U.S. House race to represent the South Bronx, becoming the first Afro-Latino Congress member who identifies as gay, reports CNN.\n\nKim Jackson became Georgia's first openly LGBTQ state senator; Torrey Harris and Eddie Mannis became the first LGBTQ  legislators elected in Tennessee and Shevrin Jones and Michele Rayner-Goolsby became the first in Florida.\n\n\"Hong, a second-generation Wisconsinite, mother, community organizer, and service industry worker, easily defeated Republican candidate and real estate intern Patrick Hull, 88 percent to 12 percent,\" David Dahmer wrote for the publication.\n\nLocal government leadership is changing, too\n\nAccording to WUSA9 , a local television station in Washington, D.C., a majority of the city's Council will be women for the first time in more than 20 years, and a majority of members will be Black for the first time since 2013.\n\nThe cities of Asheville, N.C. and El Monte, Calif. , both elected their first all-women city councils.\n\nBruce Goldstein, the president of the Washington, D.C.-based organization Farmworkers Justice, said that after the novel coronavirus was declared a global pandemic in March , he saw many people become worried about their access to food for the first time. Not necessarily because of cost, but because the farmworkers who grow, harvest and manufacture it - the majority of whom are undocumented immigrants - may have been forced to stop working.\n\n\"They became aware, or more aware than in the past, of who exactly is producing food for them ,\" Goldstein said.\n\nBut then states across the country quickly began classifying those farmworkers as \"essential employees,\" people who - even if they didn't have legal protections against deportation or access to healthcare in the country - were needed to keep food on American tables.\n\nThe pandemic spotlighted exactly how integral the labor of undocumented and migrant workers is to our country's food system. However, as election results continue to trickle in, it's clear that many Americans still voted for Trump, whose platform has consistently included vocal anti-immigrant and anti-refugee rhetoric.\n\nA large part of that is due to America's eroding sense of empathy, which only seems to have further disintegrated over the last four years.\n\nDr. Sarah Konrath is an associate professor of philanthropic studies at Indiana University and director of the Interdisciplinary Program on Empathy and Altruism Research . She studies the decline of empathy and rise of narcissistic behavior, and published a study in 2011 about North American college students' self-reported scores on a widely used empathy scale.\n\n\"In that paper, we tracked those scores from 1979, when the scale was first developed, to 2009, which was the latest year,\" Konrath said. \"We found out that the college students in the late 1970s and early '80s scored higher in empathy than college students over time, especially in the post-2000 period.\"\n\nEmpathy can be defined in several ways, but many researchers agree that it can be summarized as the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. According to Konrath, who is in the middle of producing an update to the study, there are a number of potential contributing factors, including shifts in family, community and government structures. One of the most perceptible is the relative isolation in which many Americans now live.\n\nDr. Jamil Zaki, a Stanford neuroscientist and author of \"The War for Kindness: Building empathy in a fractured world,\" said that people empathize most easily \"when they can see others' suffering with their own eyes, or when their actions are visible to others.\"\n\n\"But the modern world has stripped them away,\" Zaki told the Washington Post in 2019 . \"Humans increasingly live in cities and live alone. We see more people than ever but know fewer of them. Rituals that used to bring us into regular contact, ranging from bowling leagues to grocery shopping, have been replaced by more solitary pursuits, often carried out online. The result is our interactions with each other are often thinned out, anonymous and tribal - barren soil for empathy.\"\n\nIn the age of Instacart orders and Whole Foods check-outs lined with Amazon Prime lockers , it's easy to see how many Americans have become increasingly disconnected from the reality of who harvests their food, and that kind of anonymity could certainly breed the idea that whomever is doing that work isn't a member of your community, but a faceless stranger. Add in potential differences in racial background and immigration status, and - as Zaki asserts, our interactions have grown increasingly tribal - that only accentuates a certain sense of \"otherness.\"\n\nIt also contributes to ignorance about some of the main issues that impact migrant and undocumented farmworkers.\n\n\"Many employers in this country benefit from the vulnerability that undocumented immigrants have, which causes them to be reluctant to ask for better wages and working conditions,\" Goldstein said. \"They're often ineligible for basic services and benefits, like federally funded legal aid programs, so if they are ripped off by their employer, they often can't afford a lawyer and are not eligible for free legal services. Employers can also pay a poverty-level wage, but the workers can't get public benefits like food stamps.\"\n\nSo how do we as a country bridge the empathy gap between many American consumers and the (to them) invisible masses who put food on their tables? Thankfully, empathy is a cultivatable skill.\n\nBut Mel Schwartz, a therapist and author of \"The Possibility Principle: How Quantum Physics Can Improve the Way You Think, Live, and Love,\" says creating a more empathetic country will require a seismic shift in how we think about otherness.\n\n\"Our worldviews, the way we see reality, particularly in our country, is so overly individualistic and self-interested,\" Schwartz said. \"It's oriented toward greed - and not just financial greed. It's narcissism, it's 'all about me,' social media, how many 'likes' you have. When we live in a culture that is too focused on individualism, we lose the capacity to think about and feel the realities of others.\"\n\nTo change that would require individuals to start valuing caring for other people and tending to their communities above the individual self. In his book, Schwartz posits that quantum physics has \"actually told us that all reality is actually inseparable.\"\n\n\"It's all as one,\" he said. \"Everything is connected to everything else. And my point is that, from that vantage point, if everything's connected to everything else, then we should be caring for each other, because in my caring for you, I recognize that you're not separate from me. We need to introduce this new paradigm of oneness.\"\n\nWhile that concept may sound spiritual or intangible, the pandemic and the subsequent disruptions of the food supply chain in the states - from COVID-19 outbreaks at meatpacking plants largely staffed by immigrant workers , to agricultural counties across the U.S. facing higher rates of infection - drive the point of oneness or connectedness home. The issues impacting a farmworker thousands of miles away can determine what's on your plate tomorrow night.\n\nFor some, that may still be too abstract a reason to care deeply about the working conditions with which vulnerable farmworkers are faced, and that makes sense. Researchers have found that trying to imagine how someone feels is often not enough to elicit true empathy - you need to actually ask them.\n\n\"For me, the core of empathy is curiosity,\" Jodi Halpern, a psychiatrist and bioethics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told the New York Times. \"It's what is another person's life actually like in its particulars?\" Exchanging stories with other people, especially people whose realities look very different from your own, is a way to vicariously \"try on\" someone else's life.\n\nOrganizations that work with undocumented individuals and workers know this, and many are poised to pair personal storytelling with political messaging as a way to better serve their organizations' missions.\n\nGreisa Martinez, the executive director of the immigrant youth-led network United We Dream which advocated for DACA, says that the organization's \"secret sauce\" is in members having the capacity to share their own stories.\n\n\"There are people out there that know what it's like to have your electricity cut off, they're likely the same people out there that know exactly what it feels like to not have access to food,\" Martinez said. \"So there's this feeling of moving people from isolation into community.\"\n\nOnce they've found community with people like them, they feel more empowered to share their personal experiences on a wider stage.\n\n\"We found one another and we shared our stories, we shared our pain, we celebrated the things about our culture that made us resilient,\" Martinez said. \"We then said, 'Why don't we do something together?' and we went after the DREAM Act in 2010, and failed, but because we found community we didn't let go. We came up with a strategy to win DACA and eventually persuaded the most powerful man in the world to use his executive power to grant protection for us and for our people.\"\n\nSince then, United We Dream has launched a community-driven research initiative leading on topics of importance to the immigrant community. These publications help tell the story of the communities they represent in their own words - and hope that it's enough to spark some people to action, which is an important key to systemic change.\n\n\"It isn't enough to just feel what other people are feeling,\" said therapist and writer Dr. Mary Lamia, \"Empathy can show up in a lot of different ways, it's what you do with it that matters.\"\n\nSo, actively seek out the stories of farmworkers to listen to and read. If you live in or nearby an agricultural community, see what worker-led organizations exist close to you and get involved. Spend time elevating the voices of farmworkers sharing their concerns.\n\nFor advocates like Bruce Goldstein from Farmworkers Justice, they're hoping to capitalize on how the pandemic highlighted the conditions of farmworkers because their stories were told more frequently in these ways.\n\n\"We think that there's a greater awareness of the difficulties that farmworkers are experiencing, and the need to take action,\" Goldstein said. \"So, I'm hopeful the empathy quotient went up. Then over the next couple of years, farmworker advocates can take advantage of that and motivate people to take action that results in the change in policy and in business practices.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., won his bid for re-election, reports the Associated Press . He defeated Democratic challenger Amy McGrath in the closely-watched Senate race.\n\nShortly after 8 p.m., McConnell was ahead of McGrath 61% to 35% statewide.\n\nMcConnell, who first took office in 1985, was unanimously elected as Senate majority leader by Republicans following the 2014 elections. Before that, he served as Senate minority leader from 2007 to 2015.\n\nIf the Senate flips to Democratic control, an outcome that is being predicted by polling websites like FiveThirtyEight , the 78-year-old McConnell has already vowed to serve as minority leader, Politico reported in June.\n\nMcConnell's obstructionist tactics have long been criticized by Democrats , with his enthusiastic shepherding of the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court following the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg in September prompting outcries of hypocrisy.\n\nIn 2016, McConnell refused to hold confirmation proceedings for Obama's Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland, saying in a Washington Post opinion piece at the time that \"given that we are in the midst of the presidential election process, we believe that the American people should seize the opportunity to weigh in on whom they trust to nominate the next person for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court.\"\n\nWhile other red states like Georgia, Texas and Arizona have been slotted into the purple column this year, due in part to college-educated suburban voters swinging to Democratic candidates, reliable and recent Kentucky polls showed McConnell with a handy lead over McGrath in the home stretch of this election season, even as they predicted Trump's lead in Kentucky, while still secure, might shrink. The AP called Kentucky, with its eight electoral votes, for Trump earlier this evening.\n\nDespite national Democratic enthusiasm for McGrath's campaign, which helped bring in millions of dollars in campaign contributions, hers would be an uphill fight from the start. In 2014, McConnell, who embraces his reputation as \" the Darth Vader of Capitol Hill ,\" defeated Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes by 16 percentage points; two years later, Trump won Kentucky by a nearly 30-point margin. McGrath's previous run in Kentucky ended in a loss; in 2018, she challenged incumbent Republican Andy Barr for Kentucky's sixth Congressional district seat, but the blue wave that flipped the House to Democratic control failed to carry her home .\n\nMcGrath's campaign also hit some noticeable snags early on. The former Marine fighter pilot publicly wavered on whether she would have voted to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh , and in July 2019 she publicly said McConnell had prevented Trump from accomplishing much of his agenda during his first two years in office.\n\n\"If you think about why Kentuckians voted for Trump, they wanted to drain the swamp, and Trump said that he was going to do that,\" McGrath said during the announcement of her candidacy on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\" \"Trump promised to bring back jobs. He promised to lower drug prices for so many Kentuckians. And that is very important.\"\n\nThis led to questions from the left over whether McGrath had decided to run as a pro-Trump Democrat. Republicans, as the Louisville Courier Journal reported, mocked McGrath's TV appearance as pandering. As a result, her progressive views struck critics on the left as anemic, especially when compared to those of State Rep. Charles Booker, her challenger in the Democratic primary who was the youngest Black state lawmaker elected in Kentucky in nearly a century.\n\nMcGrath later established stronger anti-Trump messaging. In February she said that she would have voted to impeach and convict Trump, and she was an early supporter of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.\n\nMcGrath also managed a strong fundraising campaign . She raised $88 million, spent $73.3 million, and reported $14.7 million in cash on hand as of Oct. 14, campaign finance filings show , while McConnell raised $55 million, spent $43.9 million, and reported $11.8 million in cash on hand.\n\nBut in the end McGrath's impressive fundraising wasn't enough to beat McConnell.\n\nAs soon as Donald Trump was elected to the presidency in 2016 , it seemed that all eyes turned to rural America for answers. I was working at a public radio station in Louisville, Kentucky on election night - a typically blue dot in a state that has a complex voting history, voting for Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, as well as Reagan, both Bushes and Trump - when the results began to roll in. As it became clear that Trump was pulling ahead, my phone began to light up with texts from friends and other journalists who lived in larger cities, most asking the same question: \"How could this happen?\"\n\nAlmost immediately, media members, policymakers, and academics set about trying to contextualize the beliefs of portions of the country that had seemed to fade below notice or were dismissed as \"flyover country.\" America at large sought to understand \"rural America,\" a term that quickly became shorthand for the white, non-college-educated voters that aided in Trump's victory.\n\nA growing handful of thoughtful, regionally focused media outlets - \"The Bitter Southerner,\" \"Scalawag,\" \"Southerly\" - emerged to tell true, nuanced stories of the communities they represented, but stereotypes and oversimplifications persisted.\n\nThe Washington Post's Christopher Ingraham, who has resided in a northwest Minnesota farming community since 2016, said that the \" near-singular focus on Donald Trump has yielded a body of discourse that views rural Americans primarily through a white, conservative Republican lens.\"\n\n\"This is somewhat understandable as a matter of raw numbers - its residents do tend to be whiter and more conservative than people living in more densely populated areas,\" Ingraham said. \"But that focus also has perpetuated a number of myths, blurring out much of the messiness and complexity of rural life.\"\n\nThe tendency to paint rural communities with a broad brush isn't just restricted to the political sphere. From \"Hee Haw\" to \"Here Comes Honey Boo Boo,\" pop culture has borrowed from, celebrated, and in some ways, immortalized stereotypes and depictions that have come to represent rurality. But now, in an election year where eyes are again locked on the same states that helped determine 2016, there's a distinct need for cultural representations that don't oversimplify those same communities, or portray them as a social and cultural monolith.\n\nWill that happen? Well, in the last month there have been two big pieces of news related to this topic: the trailer for the film adaptation of J.D. Vance's memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy\" was released, and then it was announced that Reba McEntire was slated to star in a \"Fried Green Tomatoes\" television series, which will be directed by Norman Lear.\n\nI've been disappointed by \"Hillbilly Elegy\" since I read Vance's book in 2016. The memoir about his family became a bestseller in large part because it not-so-subtly promised readers, who were perplexed and enraged by Trump's ascendency, the background needed to understand what the \"white, working-class Trump voter\" was thinking.\n\nAs Salon's Erin Keane wrote in her 2019 piece \"Amy Adams probably will win her Oscar for 'Hillbilly Elegy' and that's a damn shame,\" Vance's framing of the story tells people who don't know much about Eastern Kentucky or Appalachia what they think they already know.\n\n\"That the addiction and abuse and poverty that shaped his family are part of a stubbornly ingrained cultural lineage passed down through generations, and that's what keeps the people of Appalachia (a very large geographical area, mind you) poor and under-educated, even lawless and violent,\" Keane wrote. \"And what's more, largely content to stay that way despite their anger, though exceptional individuals can overcome these innate cultural deficits. His overarching themes point to an attitude adjustment as the solution: poor people wouldn't have to stay poor, with all the social problems that can accompany poverty, if they could decide they didn't want to act like poor people anymore.\"\n\nForget nuance. \"Hillbilly Elegy\" frames the hardships faced by many in Appalachia - opioid addiction, lack of access to professional and educational resources, poverty - as the consequences of individual shortcomings and an overwhelming lack of gumption, rather than the result of systemic ills and oppression that have emerged from predatory pharmaceutical companies, a gaping digital divide and a long history of extractive economies that decimate communities' resources.\n\n\"Narratives like this sell not only because a 140-minute redemption arc can be written around them but also because they absolve their creators and viewers of any complicity in systemic issues,\" Keane said.\n\nEven with a stellar cast - led by Amy Adams and Glenn Close, directed by Ron Howard - it's unlikely that \"Hillbilly Elegy\" will challenge that formula once it hits Netflix on Nov. 24. I'd love to be proven wrong, though.\n\n\"Fried Green Tomatoes,\" however, has an opportunity to insert additional nuance into a story that was flattened for the big screen in 1991.\n\nBased on Fannie Flagg's 1987 novel \"Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe,\" the film adaptation is set in two distinct time periods. Jessica Tandy plays Ninny Threadgoode, a vibrant octogenarian, who entertains Evelyn Couch (Kathy Bates), a depressed housewife, with her tales of Depression-era Whistlestop, Alabama.\n\nThe main characters in her story are Idgie Threadgoode (Mary Stuart Masterson), her free-spirited sister-in-law, and Ruth Jamison (Mary-Louise Parker), who was Idgie's closest friend and eventual...well, the film kind of skirts around this part.\n\nIn the book, Idgie and Ruth's relationship is never explicitly sexual, but definitely is more grounded as a straightforward love story; at one point in the novel, Flagg writes, \"When Idgie had grinned at her and tried to hand her that jar of honey, all these feelings that [Ruth] had been trying to hold back came flooding through her, and it was in that second in time that she knew she loved Idgie with all her heart.\"\n\nThis wasn't just BFF love, but the movie was certainly billed that way, perhaps, as Buzzfeed's Kate Aurthur suggests, in order to piggy-back off the success of \"Thelma and Louise.\"\n\nAurthur also states in her essay, \"Why 'Fried Green Tomatoes' Is A Lesbian Classic - Yes, Lesbian!,\" that Masterson once told her that, compared to the book, the movie was \"redacted.\"\n\n\"We were talking at the Sundance Film Festival in 2016, when she played the mom of a queer teenage son in an indie movie called 'As You Are,'\" Aurthur wrote. \"When I brought up 'Fried Green Tomatoes' as a mainstream movie with a lesbian love story, she said some things had been cut that would have made the relationship more obvious. 'It wasn't a love scene, but there were, like - clearly a love relationship type of a fight, of jealousy,' she said. 'There was some more sensual kind of stuff in there. We were clearly playing that.'\"\n\nAs I wrote in 2019 , LGBTQ visibility and celebration in country music has come a long way since Chely Wright had received death threats and an industry-wide cold shoulder after coming out in 2010. Often, country music veers into a \"trucks and beer\" monolith that feels like it's solely made for white, straight consumption - an extension of those simplified stories told by and about rural communities.\n\nOver the last decade, artists like Brandi Carlile, Lil Nas X, Kacey Musgraves, and Ty Herndon have stepped forward to complicate that narrative with songs that challenge the idea that rural communities are somehow devoid of queer love stories. The \"Fried Green Tomatoes\" reboot has the opportunity to do the same.\n\nWill it? McEntire has long been a vocal propoent for LGBTQ rights , but there aren't many details available yet about the series. According to Variety, the hour-long drama project is \"described as a modernization of the novel and movie that explores the lives of descendants from the original work. When present-day Idgie Threadgoode (McEntire) returns to Whistle Stop after a decade away, she must wrestle with a changed town, estranged daughter, faltering cafe and life-changing secret.\"\n\nAnd while one hour-long special isn't going to undo decades of oversimplifying rural life, pop culture representation is important. It's a powerful lens through which viewers can both recognize themselves and come to better know people who exist outside their immediate orbit. People with lives and desires that, granted, can't be wholly encapsulated in a single film - but that doesn't mean the industry shouldn't strive for more careful, considered depictions.\n\nDuring the opening night of the Democratic National Convention, former first lady Michelle Obama characterized Donald Trump's administration as being marred by \"chaos, division, and a total and utter lack of empathy,\" which, she said, are just some of the major reasons he is unfit to serve.\n\nThe last year has found former Liberty University president Jerry Falwell Jr. tumbling into one scandal after another, before finally officially plummeting from grace this week .  It began last year when, as Politico reported , former Trump attorney Michael Cohen helped \"clean up racy 'personal' photographs\" of Falwell's wife, Becki, including one of her in a French maid costume, which he had allegedly sent to a number of employees at his evangelical university.\n\nThe visceral reaction such revelations inspire made for a compelling dramatic backbone for \"The Righteous Gemstones,\" a Danny McBride-led HBO satire series that debuted in August 2019. It's also what makes  Liberty University President Jerry Fallwell Jr.'s current tumble from grace feel more worthy of notice  -and, honestly, more salacious - than your typical ousting of a university leader.\n\nAs 80's babies, we dreamt of 2020 being \"Jetsons\"-like -- with flying cars, cheap robot butlers and maids, and fully established societies on multiple planets. None of those things really happened, but still, the year 2020 felt like it would gift us this unimaginable jolt of positive energy.\n\nWhether you're trapped inside due to inclement weather, taking an extended sick day at home, rent week is upon you, or it's just finally time to clear out your kitchen of unused items, here are five flavorful dishes that make the most of pantry and freezer essentials.\n\nIn the \"Slumlord Millionaire\" episode of Netflix's second season of \"Dirty Money\" - a series of \"untold stories of scandal, financial malfeasance, and corruption\" from executive producer Alex Gibney - Jared Kushner's shady business dealings are brought to light.\n\nIn early January, the Academy of Motion Pictures announced that plant-based food would be on the menu at this year's Academy Awards Ceremony on Feb. 9th. This announcement came after the Golden Globes and Screen Actors Guild awards dinners both switched to vegan menus (prompted, at least in part, by vegan \"Joker\" star Joaquin Phoenix's suggestion they do so), but before Google searches for \"vegan Super Bowl snacks\" increased by nearly 133% compared to last year.\n\nTwo summers ago, as I sat in a stuffy hotel conference room in Indianapolis, I began to consider the generosity of Star Trek enthusiasts . I was attending the Qep'a', the Klingon Language Institute's annual conference, falling desperately behind in the session meant to introduce newcomers to the language of the bumpy-headed warriors of the Star Trek universe.\n\n\"Any imbecile might decide on a certain Monday to become a captain, and by Tuesday, with no qualifications whatsoever, that imbecile could take charge of a 300,000-ton vessel and the thousands of lives contained within.\" This statement, one that is so reflective of this time in American history, is made in the opening pages of \"The Captain and the Glory,\" a new book by author Dave Eggers.\n\nWith just one person of color nominated across four acting categories, the Academy came incredibly close to bringing back the buzzy #OscarsSoWhite when then 2020 Oscar nominations were announced Monday morning.\n\nThe new year brings so many tantalizing possibilities, including a resolution to read more - whether it's to fulfill a shiny new book challenge for 2020 or just fill your brain with something more nourishing than the noise from the depressing news cycle and social media. This is a chance to make a new author discovery, enjoy the next bestseller, or even possibly change your life. It's a new decade; bring on the books!\n\nThere is an unquestioned tenet that's integral to spending time on the internet, a sort of \"rule zero\" - don't f**k with cats. This is the rule that sparks the enthralling, twisted investigation that is the center of Netflix's new limited docuseries, aptly titled \"Don't F**k With Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer.\"\n\nThen, while Baughn was in this incredibly vulnerable position, Choudhury pushed his hips into her, continuing to whisper into her ear about how they would navigate their relationship."

(Win McNamee/Pool Photo via AP)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - The country has a new president and a new literary star. In one of the inauguration's most talked about moments, poet Amanda Gorman summoned images dire and triumphant Wednesday as she called out to the world \"even as we grieved, we grew.\"\n\nThe 22-year-old Gorman referenced everything from Biblical scripture to \"Hamilton,\" and at times echoed the oratory of John F. Kennedy and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. With urgency and assertion she began by asking \"Where can we find light/In this never-ending shade?\" and used her own poetry and life story as an answer. The poem's very title, \"The Hill We Climb,\" suggested both labor and transcendence.\n\n\"We did not feel prepared to be the heirs\n\nOf such a terrifying hour.\n\nBut within it we've found the power\n\nTo author a new chapter,\n\nTo offer hope and laughter to ourselves.\"\n\nIt was an extraordinary task for Gorman, who soon after finishing her poem helped inspire - along with Vice President Kamala Harris - the Twitter hashtag \"#BlackGirlMagic and was being praised by former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama among others. Gorman is the youngest by far of the poets who have read at presidential inaugurations since Kennedy invited Robert Frost in 1961, with other predecessors including Maya Angelou and Elizabeth Alexander. Mindful of the past, Gorman wore earrings and a caged bird ring - a tribute to Angelou's classic memoir \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\" - given to her by Oprah Winfrey, a close friend of the late writer.\n\n\"I have never been prouder to see another young woman rise! Brava Brava, @TheAmandaGorman! Maya Angelou is cheering-and so am I,\" Winfrey tweeted. Gorman was also praised by \"Hamilton\" playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda, who tweeted \"YES @TheAmandaGorman!!!\" Gorman, soon responded : \"Thx @Lin_Manuel! Did you catch the 2 @HamiltonMusical references in the inaugural poem? I couldn't help myself!\"\n\nAmong the \"Hamilton\" inspirations in her poem: \"History has its eyes on us,\" a variation of the \"Hamilton\" song \"History Has Its Eyes On You.\"\n\nGorman, a native and resident of Los Angeles and the country's first National Youth Poet Laureate, told The Associated Press last week that she planned to combine a message of hope for President Joseph Biden's inaugural without ignoring \"the evidence of discord and division.\" She had completed a little more than half of \"The Hill We Climb\" before Jan. 6 and the siege of the U.S. Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump.\n\n\"That day gave me a second wave of energy to finish the poem,\" Gorman told the AP. She had said that she would not mention Jan. 6 specifically, but her reference was unmistakable:\n\n\"We've seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it,\n\nWould destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy.\n\nAnd this effort very nearly succeeded.\n\nBut while democracy can be periodically delayed,\n\nIt can never be permanently defeated.\"\n\nFrost's appearance at the Kennedy inaugural was a kind of valedictory - he was 86 and died two years later. Gorman's career is just beginning. Penguin Young Readers announced Wednesday that \"The Hill We Climb\" will be published in a special edition this spring. Two other books come out in September - the illustrated \"Change Sings\" and a volume of her inaugural poem and other works. Ceremonial odes often are quickly forgotten, but Angelou's \"On the Pulse Of the Morning,\" which she read at the 1993 inaugural of President Clinton, went on to sell more than 1 million copies as a book.\n\nBy late Wednesday afternoon, \"Change Sings\" was No. 1 on Amazon.com's bestseller list, and her September poetry collection was No. 2. She had 206K Instagram followers and 121.3K Twitter followers at the end of the inauguration. Hours later, she had 1.3 million followers on Instagram and 738,000 on Twitter.\n\nInvited to the inaugural late last month by first lady Jill Biden, Gorman has read at official occasions before - including a July 4 celebration when she was backed by the Boston Pops Orchestra - and has previously met Michelle Obama and former first lady Hillary Clinton among others. She has also made clear her desire to appear at a future inaugural, in a much greater capacity, an ambition she stated firmly in her poem.\n\n\"We, the successors of a country and a time,\n\nWhere a skinny black girl,\n\nDescended from slaves and raised by a single mother,\n\nCan dream of becoming president,\n\nOnly to find herself reciting for one.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Ashley Landis)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Amanda Gorman, the 22-year-old poet who stirred America at the inauguration of President Joe Biden last month, again commanded the spotlight on one of the country's biggest stages, the Super Bowl.\n\nGorman read an original poem Sunday during the pregame festivities in Tampa, Florida. The poem, titled \"Chorus of the Captains,\" was a tribute to three people for their contributions during the pandemic: educator Trimaine Davis, nurse manager Suzie Dorner and Marine veteran James Martin.\n\nGorman didn't perform on the field but appeared in a taped video message that combined Gorman's reading with images of Davis, Dorner and Martin. Recited Gorman:\n\n\"Let us walk with these warriors,\n\nCharge on with these champions,\n\nAnd carry forth the call of our captains.\n\nWe celebrate them by acting,\n\nWith courage and compassion,\n\nBy doing what is right and just.\n\nFor while we honor them today,\n\nIt is they who every day honor us.\"\n\nThat Gorman brought poetry to the Super Bowl was an almost unthinkable collision of grace and glitz. But if the Super Bowl, an annual rite of excess, was an unlikely platform for a poet, it showed just how much Gorman has seized the nation's spotlight since the inauguration.\n\nGorman, previously the country's first National Youth Poet Laureate, was the youngest person to ever recite a poem at the U.S. presidential inauguration. Her reading of \"The Hill We Climb\" at the Capitol immediately became a sensation. An illustrated book of her poem quickly zoomed to the top of bestseller lists. Shortly after the inauguration, she signed with IMG Models, an agency that represents supermodels, tennis star Naomi Osaka and playwright Jeremy O. Harris. This week, she covers Time Magazine, in an interview conducted by Michelle Obama.\n\nGorman's Super Bowl appearance had been planned before the inauguration. She seemed to grasp the unlikeliness of her pre-game reading, the first in Super Bowl history. And with potentially 100 million viewers on the CBS telecast, it made for one very well-attended poetry recital.\n\n\"Poetry at the Super Bowl is a feat for art and our country, because it means we're thinking imaginatively about human connection even when we feel siloed,\" Gorman said Sunday on Twitter . \"I'll honor three heroes who exemplify the best of this effort. Here's to them, to poetry and to a Super Bowl like no other.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) - When Amanda Gorman was invited to read a newly developed poem at the U.N. General Assembly , the young sensation took a deep look at how several societal issues - such as hunger and poverty - have impacted Earth's preservation.\n\nJust like her stirring inauguration poem last year, Gorman felt compelled to express the impact of unity through her poetic words on the opening day of the 77th session Monday in New York. The 24-year-old poet created \"An Ode We Owe\" in hopes of bringing all nations together to tackle various issues of disparity along with preserving the planet.\n\nGorman once again graced center stage in front of world leaders. Her fame exploded after she recited her poem \"The Hill We Climb\" at President Joe Biden's inauguration, which made her the youngest inaugural poet in U.S. history. Her poem quickly topped bestsellers lists and made her one of the most in-demand poets, putting her on other big stages like the Super Bowl and in an interview with Oprah Winfrey .\n\nIn an exclusive interview with The Associated Press on Sunday, Gorman talked about her hopes for the U.N. poem, her future presidency plans, resentment she's gotten toward her commercial success and wanting to someday write a novel.\n\nRemarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nAP: What do you want listeners to take away from your poem?\n\nGORMAN: What I hope people can garner from the poem is that while issues of hunger and poverty and illiteracy can feel Goliath and are so huge, it's not necessarily that these issues are too large to be conquered. But they're too large to be stepped away from.\n\n\"To anyone out there: I only ask that you care before it's too late, That you live aware and awake, That you lead with love in hours of hate.\" Listen as Amanda Gorman reads her new poem, \"An Ode We Owe,\" before the U.N. General Assembly on Monday. https://t.co/k9s3o6BGSD pic.twitter.com/JF2cSQAbLl\n\nAP: How important is having a young voice like yourself to speak at the General Assembly?\n\nGORMAN: When I was writing this poem, I kept getting flashbacks of several years ago when I came to New York for the first time. I was 16 and I was coming as the United Nations delegate for the Commission on the Status of Women. That was the first time I'd really ever engaged the U.N. as a space in any way. I just remember not seeing people who looked as young as me. I also looked like I was 11 at the time. I started marinating on this idea of \"I want to come back someday in the future. I don't just want to be a delegate. I want to be a presenter.\" I'm not here to speak on behalf of young people, but to speak alongside and with them.\n\nAP: Why did you touch on Sustainable Development Goals in your poem?\n\nGORMAN: I actually think that there's swaths of the population which has yet to be engaged or kind of told or activated around the Sustainable Development Goals. So much of what I like to do in the poem is making sure that we raise awareness around these issues and show that these goals do exist.\n\nAP: How have you managed the transition to being a high-level celebrity?\n\nGORMAN: I'm still learning and growing so much. I think one of the things that changed so much for me was just privacy. All of a sudden I became someone - which I never really necessarily expected - who gets recognized on the street. If I go to a restaurant, even if I'm wearing a mask, people are very good at spotting my face and or my voice. I'm very grateful for that type of visibility, even though sometimes I do miss individual privacy because it means that I have a platform that I can use for good.\n\nAP: How have people approached you while in public?\n\nGORMAN: I had an experience (Saturday) night. I was eating at a restaurant and a woman just came up to me and started crying and saying how much my poetry meant to her. It's flabbergasting to me. That's not a rare occurrence in my life anymore. My friends started crying around me seeing this woman's emotion. I had a great conversation with that woman before she moved on, and me having to take a moment, sit with the fact that there were so many people around the world who probably have this person's same response that haven't gotten to me. I want to do justice by them when I write. I want to honor them when I write. That's a really hefty ask. But I also think it's a deep seated privilege of mine. I think that's the thing that I wrestle with and draw power from when I write.\n\nAP: Has the fame changed your writing?\n\nGORMAN: I think it hasn't changed my writing in the sense that my voice and style is still the same because the roots of where I come from are still there. But I do think it makes me think more creatively and imaginatively about ways in which I can get those poems in the world.\n\nAP: Is it much harder to write these days?\n\nGORMAN: I think the main difficulty in writing poetry for me nowadays is, yes, that there's a lot going on. But even if I'm able to carve out time and space to write, I think the biggest challenge that I can face sometimes is just my own self-sabotage in the sense that I feel so much pressure and so many eyes on me.\n\nAP: How do you keep out the distractions?\n\nGORMAN: I'm like a 70-year-old in an 11-year-old body. I have muscles from that of pulling away from technology and pretending like it's not there. Like it doesn't exist. When I write, I tend to put all my devices on \"Do Not Disturb.\"\n\nAP: Have you had to deal with any resentment from the poetry community, who sometimes don't look kindly upon commercial success?\n\nGORMAN: The only type of trolling that I experience is actually not from other poets. It's from people who don't write poetry. I hear those kind of like \"What Amanda Gorman does isn't that difficult. I don't understand why she's famous.\" I have no ill will towards those people. I actually, in a sense, feel bad for them because more often than not, these are people who haven't been exposed to a lot of poetry in their lives, who haven't been either encouraged or challenged to write poetry in their lifetimes.\n\nAP: What are your thoughts toward those skeptics?\n\nGORMAN: I think the one thing I have to say to those people would be if you're reading my work and you're saying, \"Amanda Gorman's writing is so easy for me to do and I can do better.\" Oh, my God. We need you. We need you to pick up a pen and write. That means you're going to be the next great voice of literature. I would love for you to find a way to, for lack of a better term, dethrone me.\n\nAP: Do you still plan to run for president someday?\n\nGORMAN: Yes, that's still the case. I obviously have a long way to go - not just in terms of years, but in terms of learning.\n\nAP: Is there a timetable?\n\nGORMAN: No, I'm just living and enriching my life with the understanding of \"Wow, girl you are a weapon of cultural and poetic power. Here's where you decide what to do with it.\" Whether that follows a specific table that's explicit for the presidency or whether it's one that's a bit more unorthodox and nontraditional than we've seen, I think remains to be seen.\n\nAP: Do you aspire to write something besides poetry?\n\nGORMAN: I love poetry, but I love all forms of writing. When I was younger, I actually wanted to be a novel writer. But novels just take - for me - a longer amount of time than a single poem. That's just how my brain and writing works. But I would love to get out some more prose, some more essay writing. You'll definitely get more than just a verse for me.\n\nAP: What kind of novels?\n\nGORMAN: I really like to draw from what I consider to be my literary ancestors Zora Neale Hurston or Toni Morrison, who wrote this beautiful prose, which I think came out a culture of language that they drew from the African American community. I think about the titans of writing whose footsteps I would love to dance in.\n\n___\n\nText of Amanda Gorman's poem, \"An Ode We Owe,\" first read to the U.N. General Assembly on Monday:\n\nHow can I ask you to do good,\n\nWhen we've barely withstood\n\nOur greatest threats yet:\n\nThe depths of death, despair and disparity,\n\nAtrocities across cities, towns & countries,\n\nLives lost, climactic costs.\n\nExhausted, angered, we are endangered,\n\nNot because of our numbers,\n\nBut because of our numbness. We're strangers\n\nTo one another's perils and pain,\n\nUnaware that the welfare of the public\n\nAnd the planet share a name-\n\n-Equality\n\nDoesn't mean being the exact same,\n\nBut enacting a vast aim:\n\nThe good of the world to its highest capability.\n\nThe wise believe that our people without power\n\nLeaves our planet without possibility.\n\nTherefore, though poverty is a poor existence,\n\nComplicity is a poorer excuse.\n\nWe must go the distance,\n\nThough this battle is hard and huge,\n\nThough this fight we did not choose,\n\nFor preserving the earth isn't a battle too large\n\nTo win, but a blessing too large to lose.\n\nThis is the most pressing truth:\n\nThat Our people have only one planet to call home\n\nAnd our planet has only one people to call its own.\n\nWe can either divide and be conquered by the few,\n\nOr we can decide to conquer the future,\n\nAnd say that today a new dawn we wrote,\n\nSay that as long as we have humanity,\n\nWe will forever have hope.\n\nTogether, we won't just be the generation\n\nThat tries but the generation that triumphs;\n\nLet us see a legacy\n\nWhere tomorrow is not driven\n\nBy the human condition,\n\nBut by our human conviction.\n\nAnd while hope alone can't save us now,\n\nWith it we can brave the now,\n\nBecause our hardest change hinges\n\nOn our darkest challenges.\n\nThus may our crisis be our cry, our crossroad,\n\nThe oldest ode we owe each other.\n\nWe chime it, for the climate,\n\nFor our communities.\n\nWe shall respect and protect\n\nEvery part of this planet,\n\nHand it to every heart on this earth,\n\nUntil no one's worth is rendered\n\nBy the race, gender, class, or identity\n\nThey were born. This morn let it be sworn\n\nThat we are one one human kin,\n\nGrounded not just by the griefs\n\nWe bear, but by the good we begin.\n\nTo anyone out there:\n\nI only ask that you care before it's too late,\n\nThat you live aware and awake,\n\nThat you lead with love in hours of hate.\n\nI challenge you to heed this call,\n\nI dare you to shape our fate.\n\nAbove all, I dare you to do good\n\nSo that the world might be great\n\n___\n\nFor more on the U.N.

The country's next inaugural poet is an old pro at ceremonial occasions - and she's only 22. Amanda Gorman has written for everything from a July 4 celebration featuring the Boston Pops Orchestra to the inauguration at Harvard University for school president Larry Bacon. (Kelia Anne/Sun Literary Arts via AP)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - At age 22, poet Amanda Gorman, chosen to read at the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden , already has a history of writing for official occasions.\n\n\"I have kind of stumbled upon this genre. It's been something I find a lot of emotional reward in, writing something I can make people feel touched by, even if it's just for a night,\" says Gorman. The Los Angeles resident has written for everything from a July 4 celebration featuring the Boston Pops Orchestra to the inauguration at Harvard University, her alma mater, of school president Larry Bacow.\n\nWhen she reads next Wednesday , she will be continuing a tradition - for Democratic presidents - that includes such celebrated poets as Robert Frost and Maya Angelou. The latter's \"On the Pulse of Morning,\" written for the 1993 inauguration of President Bill Clinton, went on to sell more than 1 million copies when published in book form. Recent readers include poets Elizabeth Alexander and Richard Blanco, both of whom Gorman has been in touch with.\n\n\"The three of us are together in mind, body and spirit,\" she says.\n\nGorman is the youngest inaugural poet in memory, and she has made news before. In 2014, she was named the first Youth Poet Laureate of Los Angeles, and three years later she became the country's first National Youth Poet Laureate. She has appeared on MTV; written a tribute to Black athletes for Nike; and has a two-book deal with Viking Children's Books. The first work, the picture book \"Change Sings,\" comes out later this year.\n\nGorman says she was contacted late last month by the Biden inaugural committee. She has known numerous public figures, including former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and former first lady Michelle Obama, but says she will be meeting the Bidens for the first time. The Bidens, apparently, have been aware of her: Gorman says the inaugural officials told her she had been recommended by the incoming first lady, Jill Biden.\n\nShe is calling her inaugural poem \"The Hill We Climb\" while otherwise declining to preview any lines. Gorman says she was not given specific instructions on what to write, but was encouraged to emphasize unity and hope over \"denigrating anyone\" or declaring \"ding, dong, the witch is dead\" over the departure of President Donald Trump.\n\nThe siege last week of the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters seeking to overturn the election was a challenge for keeping a positive tone, but also an inspiration. Gorman says she has been given 5 minutes to read, and before what she described during an interview as \"the Confederate insurrection\" of Jan. 6 she had only written about 3 1-2 minutes worth.\n\nThe final length runs to about 6 minutes.\n\n\"That day gave me a second wave of energy to finish the poem,\" says Gorman, adding that she will not refer directly to Jan. 6, but will \"touch\" upon it. She said last week's events did not upend the poem she had been working on because they didn't surprise her.\n\n\"The poem isn't blind,\" she says. \"It isn't turning your back to the evidence of discord and division.\"\n\nIn other writings, Gorman has honored her Black ancestors, acknowledged and reveled in her own vulnerability (\"Glorious in my fragmentation,\" she has written) and confronted social issues. Her poem \"In This Place (An American Lyric),\" written for the 2017 inaugural reading of U.S. Poet Laureate Tracy K. Smith, condemns the racist march in Charlottesville, Virginia ( \"tiki torches string a ring of flame\") and holds up her art form as a force for democracy:\n\n____\n\nTyrants fear the poet.\n\nNow that we know it\n\nwe can't blow it.\n\nWe owe it\n\nto show it\n\nnot slow it\n\n_____\n\nGorman has rare status as a poet, and has dreams of other ceremonies. She would love to read at the 2028 Olympics, scheduled to be held in Los Angeles, and in 2037 wouldn't mind finding herself in an even more special position at the presidential inauguration - as the new chief executive.\n\n\"I'm going to tell Biden that I'll be back,\" she said with a laugh.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(Alejandra Molina/RNS via AP)\n\nLOS ANGELES (RNS) - At St. Brigid Catholic Church, the Rev. Kenneth Keke preaches that the gospel of Jesus Christ is not only about eternity, but about \"having a human face, loving one another.\" Keke's message stresses unity and that a \"common humanity is what we need for us to live in peace.\"\n\n\"That is liberation theology and that is what we preach here,\" said Keke, the St. Brigid priest from Nigeria.\n\nThis is the South Central Los Angeles church where 22-year-old Amanda Gorman, the youngest inaugural poet in U.S. history, grew up singing in the youth choir, taking her sacraments and reciting her poetry.\n\nGorman, who graduated from Harvard University last year, captivated Americans with the recent recitation of her poem on national unity at President Joe Biden's inauguration. Since that day, she has signed on with IMG modeling agency and has been invited to recite a poem at the Super Bowl on Feb. 7.\n\n\"She would always get standing ovations,\" said Floy Hawkins, a parishioner and former director of religious education at St. Brigid. \"We were in just as much awe of her then, as we were when we all witnessed her at the inauguration.\"\n\n___\n\nThis content is written and produced by Religion News Service and distributed by The Associated Press. RNS and AP partner on some religion news content. RNS is solely responsible for this story.\n\n___\n\nSt. Brigid, which established in a small rented house in 1920, has a rich history in Los Angeles.\n\n\"St. Brigid was one of the first parishes in the Archdiocese of Los Angeles that encompassed the entirety of Black Catholicism,\" said Anderson Shaw, director of the African American Catholic Center for Evangelization.\n\nWhat used to be an Irish parish is now a predominantly Black and Latino congregation where, Keke told Religion News Service, parishioners take pride in their community and often \"push me to do something ... to fight more.\"\n\n\"We need to liberate our people more,\" Keke said they tell him. \"It's like everybody here is a freedom fighter.\"\n\nSt. Brigid is an Afrocentric Catholic church in the Archdiocese of Los Angeles that's overseen by the Josephites- a religious community of Catholic priests and brothers that centers its ministry in African American communities. The Josephites formed in 1871 to meet the needs of newly freed people after the Civil War.\n\nThe Josephites arrived at the South Central LA parish in the late 1970s and early 1980s, after African Americans had migrated to the city from Louisiana and Southeast Texas in search of jobs at aircraft construction companies, said the Rev. Thomas Frank, vicar general of the Josephites, who served as pastor at St. Brigid from 2007 to 2011.\n\nFrank said the Josephites took over the parish at the written request of African American Catholics in the area. The church, which could accommodate about 800 people, was struggling with dwindling attendance and was down to about 150 core parishioners, who were mostly Black but also included a significant number of Latinos.\n\nWith the Josephites' arrival, the parish received its first African American priest, the Rev. William Norvell, as well as an Afro-Latino Jesuit priest, the Rev. Fernando Arizti, to connect with the Latino community, Frank said.\n\nHawkins came to St. Brigid around 1980 after her sister encouraged her to visit. She heard St. Brigid incorporated a gospel choir during Mass, and she thought, \"A gospel choir at a Catholic church?\" She decided to give St. Brigid a visit and has remained there ever since.\n\n\"The relevancy, the comfort of connecting in the community and the nuances of the actual Mass, it's very culturally relatable,\" Hawkins said.\n\nDuring a typical pre-pandemic Mass, an ensemble wearing dashikis and headdresses would sound African drums to call parishioners to gather for worship. A gospel choir would follow, sending congregants to their feet as they danced and waved their arms, giving God praise, glory and honor.\n\nInside the church, a Black crucifix is suspended above the altar. Oil paintings of a Black Joseph holding his son, a Black Jesus, and of Martin Luther King Jr. hang on the walls of the parish.\n\nSt. Brigid has become known as a pillar in the community.\n\nIt's a member of OneLA, an organization made up of Jewish temples, schools and other nonprofit groups that work to improve housing insecurity, public transportation and criminal justice reform. The church also turns into a voting center during elections and during the coronavirus pandemic has served as a COVID-19 testing site. St. Brigid also has a food distribution ministry.\n\nTo Hawkins, the church community was an ideal and welcoming worship space for her four children.\n\nShe recalled how Arizti opened up the church space to a Muslim mosque whose building had been damaged after an earthquake.\n\n\"That was amazing,\" Hawkins said. \"The church was a light to the surrounding community.\"\n\nSeeing Gorman in the national spotlight now, Hawkins remembers how the poet's mother went to the church with her twin daughters, Amanda and Gabrielle, with the hope of exposing her children to a Catholic faith \"that was relevant to their identity as African American.\"\n\nThe Gorman sisters were in middle school, became part of the religious education program and stayed throughout their preparation for baptism, first Communion and confirmation, Hawkins said. Amanda Gorman would participate in the church's Black history programs through her poetry.\n\n\"Her mother was very intentional about her girls,\" Hawkins said. \"That was very clear, and as a result, her girls were very responsive to the African American worship experience.\"\n\n\"This is a very humble family,\" Hawkins added. \"They're a family that loves to share, but they are not imposing people.\"\n\nGabrielle Gorman has made her own strides, in the filmmaking industry. Last year, she edited and directed a voting public service announcement, #Vote4theFuture, in collaboration with her sister, featuring self-taped clips from celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey, Cara Delevingne and Mahershala Ali. Her work, focusing on social change, has been featured in Essence, Bustle and NPR.\n\nIn a video created by Gabrielle Gorman, a graduate of UCLA's School of Film and Television, the sisters deliver a message of solidarity with images of diverse people and protesters across the city of LA. The video shows Amanda Gorman reciting a poem in the bus and in the middle of protesters:\n\n\"This is my country\n\nCatholic grandmother on bus\n\ndefending hijab-wearing girl\n\nimmigrant learning a new language\n\nNative remembers an old one\n\nrarely spoken in this world\n\nThis is who we are ...\"\n\nIn the days leading up to Jan. 20, Keke said parishioners were calling him to let him know \"their very own Amanda Gorman\" would be the one reciting a poem at the momentous ceremony. Enthusiasm was high.\n\n\"Everybody was excited for the opportunity Amanda received,\" Keke said. \"There was no doubt that she would do well. She grew to become very articulate and bold.\"\n\nReflecting back on Gorman's inaugural poem, \"The Hill We Climb,\" Keke said it was about \"democracy and unity,\" and the importance of \"living in the country as one people, recognizing one another and respecting one another.\"\n\n\"That is the spirit of St. Brigid,\" Keke said.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP) - A poem written for President Joe Biden's inauguration has been placed on a restricted list at a South Florida elementary school after one parent's complaint.\n\nIn a Facebook post on Tuesday, poet Amanda Gorman vowed to fight back. Her poem, \"The Hill We Climb\" was challenged by the parent of two students at Bob Graham Education Center in Miami Lakes, along with several books.\n\n\"I'm gutted,\" she wrote. \"Robbing children of the chance to find their voices in literature is a violation of their right to free thought and free speech.\"\n\nGorman, who at 17 became the country's National Youth Poet Laureate, said she wrote the poem \"The Hill We Climb,\" so \"all young people could see themselves in a historical moment,\" and that she's received countless letters and videos from children who were inspired to write their own poems.\n\nShe became an international sensation at Biden's inauguration, where she was the youngest poet to read at the ceremony since Robert Frost was invited to John F. Kennedy's in 1961.\n\nIn \"The Hill We Climb,\" Gorman references everything from Biblical scripture to \"Hamilton,\" and at times echoes the oratory of Kennedy and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. With urgency and assertion she begins by asking, \"Where can we find light/In this never-ending shade?\" and used her own poetry and life story as an answer.\n\nShe said she planned to share a message of hope for Biden's inauguration without ignoring \"the evidence of discord and division.\" She had completed a little more than half of the poem before Jan. 6 and the siege of the U.S. Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump.\n\nThe poem and books are still available in the media center for middle school-aged children, Ana Rhodes, a spokesperson for the Miami-Dade school district, said in a statement.\n\nWhile book bans are not new, they are happening much more frequently, especially in Florida - where Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has championed policies that allow the censorship of books some have deemed inappropriate for children in schools, causing national uproar.\n\nDeSantis, who entered the 2024 presidential race Wednesday, has leaned heavily into cultural divides on race, sexual orientation and gender as he gains support from conservative voters who decide Republican primary elections.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre condemned the decision to ban Gorman's poem, saying Biden and his administration stands with her.\n\n\"The President was proud to have Ms. Gorman, the youngest inaugural poet, speak at his inauguration,\" she said.\n\n\"Banning books is censorship, period,\" she added. \"It limits American freedom - Americans' freedom - and we should all stand against that type of act.\"\n\nYecenia Martinez, principal of the K-8 school, which is part of the Miami-Dade public school system, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment about the poem's ban. The school is named after Bob Graham, a former Democratic governor and U.S. senator from Florida.\n\nDaily Salinas, the parent who objected to the poem and books, told the Miami Herald she's not \"for eliminating or censoring any books.\" Salinas said she wants materials to be appropriate. It was not immediately clear what she objected to in Gorman's poem.\n\nAfter her complaint, a materials review committee made up of three teachers, a library media specialist, a guidance counselor and the principal, determined one of the books in question was balanced and age appropriate, and would remain available for all students, the newspaper reported.\n\nThe other four were deemed \"better suited\" or \"more appropriate\" for middle school students. The books were to remain in the middle school section of the media center, the review concluded.\n\n\"And let's be clear: most of the forbidden works are by authors who have struggled for generations to get on the bookshelves,\" Gorman's post said. \"The majority of these censored works are by queer and non-white voices.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "'I Always Think of Poetry as Home for Me'\n\nThe poet Amanda Gorman discusses her new collection, Call Us What We Carry, and how the last year has brought new urgency to her writing.\n\nUpdated at 7:34 p.m. ET on December 19, 2021.\n\nSeven years ago, I did a poetry reading at New Roads School, in Santa Monica, California. The students were incredible. They were funny, they were incredibly smart, and they asked the sorts of questions I had not been asked before. But one student stood out in particular. She was ebullient and curious and thoughtful. One of her teachers shared with me that she had recently been named the Los Angeles youth poet laureate. Her name was Amanda Gorman.\n\nLast year, like millions of others, I watched Gorman step behind a lectern on the steps of the U.S. Capitol-where just weeks before a violent mob of insurrectionists had attempted to overturn the results of the presidential election-and deliver an inaugural poem that transfixed the world and transformed her life.\n\nShe has since published her inaugural poem, \"The Hill We Climb,\" as well as a children's book, Change Sings , both of which were instant No. 1 New York Times best sellers. She has been on the cover of Vogue , Variety , and Time . She has read a poem for the Super Bowl. She has Oprah's phone number. In her new book, Call Us What We Carry , her first full-length poetry collection, Gorman grapples with how the coronavirus pandemic has reshaped our lives and further exacerbated America's already deep inequality, how the racial reckoning of the past year is in conversation with history that preceded it, and what it means to live in a world where the climate crisis hangs like a dark cloud over everything we do.\n\nI recently spoke with Gorman about her new book, her new life, and whether she could have ever imagined that she would be in the place she finds herself. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nClint Smith: What has this year been like for you? You became perhaps the most well-known poet in the world in a matter of minutes. Also, like all of us, you've been living through a pandemic. How is your spirit?\n\nAmanda Gorman: Thank you so much for checking in. Looking back at the year, I think I am existing in this liminal phase when everything that I knew about my life and how I was living is changing. Not only due to the pandemic, but also to the visibility that I received after the inauguration.\n\nI try to approach that as a gift or an opportunity in my writing. That is to say, if I am experiencing something such as the pandemic alongside millions of other people, I think that's a real opening for poetry to do the work that we need to connect us, to push us forward.\n\nThe moments where I was feeling most alone and separated from my fellow human beings- perhaps due to fame-I [would remember] that I was not alone, because I was experiencing so much of the loss, of the grief that comes with this pandemic, alongside other people, even if I didn't know them, even if we never met. I was part of a larger contingency, and my work and writing could serve that.\n\nSo the year has been wild and crazy and overwhelming, but I always think of poetry as home for me. It really brings me back down to earth, which I'm grateful for.\n\nSmith: Did you write most of this book during COVID, or is this work that you had started beforehand?\n\nGorman: Nearly every single poem in this new collection, save for maybe three, was written in 2021, in a three- or four-month span.\n\nIt was a really prolific period of creation for me. Not because it's easy. I'm sure you've heard from so many interviewers and things asking you if writing during COVID was \"easier\" because you're maybe at home more, you're not doing everything, you're kind of isolated. I was like, \"COVID is not a writer's residency.\"\n\nIf anything, I found that as I was writing, I had more writer's block, because I was bringing more grief and concerns and questions and baggage into the writing room. And so I wrote a lot. COVID just made writing feel all the more urgent for me, and all the more necessary. So, yeah, most of these poems are new and born out of the experience of the pandemic, but I think also just the larger racial reckoning that I think we're having, not only in the United States but around the world-the sociopolitical crisis that we find ourselves in.\n\nClint Smith: 800,000 deaths\n\nSmith: One of the things that's interesting about the collection, as I was making my way through it, was, like, the heterogeneity of the pieces. You play with form a lot in this book in ways that were new and unexpected and exciting for me. There are text messages and checklists and poems in the form of flags and poems that require you to turn the book on its side to read them. Tell me about this experimentation.\n\nGorman: One thing I set out for myself when I was writing the book is-I think to have fun is not necessarily the most precise word, because it was a kind of grievous, arduous process, but more so to have freedom, to have boundlessness in the book, to really be able to give myself a full range in which I could engage with the written word.\n\nSo many people's first interaction with my writing has been through the oral tradition. But as someone who grew up with a speech impediment, I spent so much more of my foundational training and writing on the page, because that was where I felt safe, that was where I felt heard, because it was a space where you wouldn't necessarily know that I had this disability.\n\nSo trying to figure out how I want to approach the written word through different shapes, different forms, was more of a homegoing to me, back to where I started my language journey.\n\nI also just wanted to disrupt my readers' perception of what qualifies as poetry, what poetry looks like. I wanted them to literally look at the pandemic experience anew, and that means turning the page on its side or upside down, that means playing with shade or having you fill in the blanks in a hangman poem. Hopefully, one of those moments will be a kind of aha or eye-opening moment for my reader by which they see things in a new light.\n\nSmith: For many people who pick up your first book, or for many people who will pick up this collection, it may very well be the first poetry book that they've ever purchased and read. Do you think about that as you're writing? If so, how does it shape the process?\n\nGorman: It's a deep privilege and it's also frightening at times. I want to do justice to the art and I want to welcome people into the tradition while also remaining authentic to who I am. The way that I approached that in writing is, I didn't change my topic-what I wanted to say, or what I wanted to address-but I tried to, at least at some point, in the words of Adele, go easy on my reader [ laughs ], even if I wasn't going easy on myself.\n\nThat doesn't mean I was sanitizing my writing, but that I was coming at the book with the assumption that everyone who was reading this was going to be an intelligent human being but they might not know the full depth and details of whatever I was talking about. Like, if I was writing about, let's say, the Chinese Exclusion Act, I'd do so without the presumption that every single person had learned about this in their educational experience.\n\nI was at a book reading once-I was in the audience-and I remember that one of the people asking a question told the author, \"I feel like you care about me when I'm reading the book.\" And that type of tenderness, that type of love, was something that I wanted to come through when I was writing the book. It was something that I reminded myself of every day, because I knew so many people would be coming to poetry for the first time via me.\n\nFrom the September 2018 issue: How poetry came to matter again\n\nSmith: How do you think of your relationship to a sort of poetic lineage? And how do you fit into a larger both Black intellectual and literary tradition but also a sort of larger American literary tradition, and a larger tradition of American letters and poetics?\n\nGorman: I find my poetic lineage so important. I'm always thinking of, particularly, a Black feminist tradition of the Toni Morrisons , the Maya Angelous, the Phillis Wheatleys, the Rita Doves, the Lucille Cliftons, the Gwendolyn Brookses. I feel like I am just trying to do them proud.\n\nI also think the class of poets that I exist in currently is just as important to me. This might sound weird but the yous, the Clint Smiths of the world, the Elizabeth Acevedos , the Jacqueline Woodsons, the Tracy K. Smiths -I consider you to be cousins, if not sisters and brothers. And we haven't always met or been in the same state or writing program, but I still feel a type of camaraderie.\n\nI definitely don't consider myself as someone who sets out to \"do something we've never seen before, completely different.\" If anything, I try to echo really old, ancient sentiments, just in the now, and I think that in itself is something that is different and unique.\n\nSmith: I think we're definitely cousins.\n\nGorman: Poets from another mother!\n\nSmith: How old were you when you started writing? And how did your speech impediment shape the way you approached and thought about your writing?\n\nGorman: I want to say I was like 5 or 6 when I started writing. At the time, I was writing little children's books for myself to read, which were horrible [ l a ughs ], but that's when I started. I didn't know writing was a profession until I was 8 or 9, and I was like, \"That's awesome.\"\n\nAnd my first kind of memory of the speech impediment? I had it ever since I can remember, I'd say ever since I started speaking. For most of my young years, I didn't know there was \"something wrong\" or \"different\" about me, because I have a twin sister and she also had the same speech impediment. For me, it was the world I knew. It was the language I was surrounded by.\n\nIt wasn't until, I want to say, I was like 6 or 7, where kids get a little bit meaner, when their barbs or insults become a little bit sharper, that I realized, Oh, the way that people see and hear me is different from the way I view and hear myself . What that did for me, I think, is it rerouted my experience of poetry. Although I wasn't on the poetry stage, I fell in love with the sound of words through speech pathology. I was in and out of speech therapy for most of my life. And what that did for me was force me to look at language, sounds, cadence, pronunciation actually as an access point of healing and recovery, because I was doing the work of learning English time and time again. I was completely fluent and eloquent in it, but it was really breaking down every single sound and how it's made, how is it different, how does the mouth work?\n\nAnd so I think my personal style as a poet sees poetry as an instrument of pathology. I think that's why you see a lot of alliteration and rhyme in my spoken-word poems, because it was me being in 11th grade with my speech therapist doing road , road , road over and over again. Red , red , red. Rat , rat. Building up in complexity to blend words such as president , brave , Harvard , et cetera. And so I carry that with me in everything that I write.\n\nSmith: Pivoting to your new collection specifically, where does the title Call Us What We Carry come from?\n\nGorman: When the book was first announced, I think it was something like 'The Hill We Climb' and Other Poems .\n\nSmith: I remember that. And what was the journey from that title to the title you have now?\n\nGorman: I was writing the collection, which at the time I had really no poems for, when the book was announced, and I was just trying to see if maybe there was a universe in which there was another title that worked. I was kind of just in bed writing scraps of thoughts and poems and I was thinking about something I learned in biology in high school, which is about how the human body was not only the cells that carry my DNA, but how so many types of microorganisms exist on me as well. I remember my teacher was saying, \"You are not you. You are we.\" I was really confused at the time, and it wasn't until I was writing this collection, and how as an individual I feel part of a multitude that is experiencing these past two years, that I landed on this idea of, Oh, this book that I'm writing as me is also me writing to and with and from a we. So I changed the title and then I also changed the voice for a lot of the book.\n\nIt wasn't a huge shift, because most of the poems or the thoughts or the verses, they had what I call multiple personalities. They would begin with an I , and then there would be a we and an I , and then a you , and then a they , and then all of these kind of exist in the we . They're all part of it. I changed the singular voice of some of the poems to a more collective voice, and then I changed the title as well.\n\nSmith: One of the most compelling sections of the book is the series of poems about climate change. I'm curious, how does the natural world shape you and shape your writing, and how has the ongoing destruction of it done so?\n\nGorman: The idea that public health, society, and the planet are interconnected isn't a new one, but I also don't think it's an idea that we talk about enough. When I was writing the book, I really wanted to utilize the natural world in my poems, which is something that I've done ever since I was little. I think there's a lot of metaphors about trees and water and the ocean and the sky in the poems. I think I was doing that not just because it's important to my own voice, but I think it's so important that we put-especially as poets-language and rhetoric around nature in conversation with the very status of that nature that we're talking about. If I'm talking about trees or the sky, I have to talk about pollution in the air; I have to talk about climate change.\n\nIt's something that I think is so important-and at times frustrating-to me, because when we think about \"nature poetry,\" I think traditionally it's a very kind of white, male, hegemonic tradition of old white men on benches thinking about existentialism, and it's completely removed and isolated from any kind of real profound question about race, equality ... life. So I wanted to honor those intersections, which I think are a lot of times whitened or erased when we look at nature poetry, because we're not looking at it from the perception of the marginalized, who typically are the people who are tending the earth, who are [planting] the crops, who are being removed from the land.\n\nSmith: As you know, I am really interested in place. How physical place and, specifically, physical place that is tied to a historical moment or a phenomenon shape the way that we experience a place and, subsequently, understand history.\n\nYou have this poem \"War: What, Is It Good?\" and you have a series of lines that say \"There is no such thing as a gentle war / There is no peace / That can't be flung aside . \" For me, I read those lines and I just kept thinking about the precarity and fragility of our current moment, and more directly, I kept thinking about you standing on the Capitol, delivering the inaugural poem just weeks after the violent uprising at the Capitol .\n\nIn my own book project, I had so many moments where I was standing on a plantation or standing inside of where slave auctions happened or standing on a Confederate cemetery or standing in a prison that was once a plantation and standing in these places that have this very acute relationship to a historical trauma. You did that but for a historical trauma that wasn't centuries before, but one that had happened a few weeks before. As we learn more and more about that day and what happened, we learn more and more about what could have happened and what many of those people wanted to happen and how even more violent it could have gotten. That's a long way of asking: What was that like for you? Just in your spirit and in your body to be in that place in that moment after. And how did your presence there fit into the story of that moment in some ways?\n\nRead: The surprising thing about Biden's inauguration\n\nGorman: Oh God. How much more time do we have? You could have written a book about it. It's interesting that you say the importance of being in this place, because, ironically, the poem that made me the inaugural poet was my poem \"In This Place (An American Lyric)\" that I wrote several years ago, which Dr. Jill Biden saw online and which made her want me to be the inaugural poet.\n\nSo what gave me entry into that space was a poem that I had written about holding space. Looking back at the inauguration, it can be kind of bronzed over because it went well. I got a lot of visibility and notice and positivity. But at that moment, I will say that I was very terrified about stepping into a place that had been desecrated by forces that would like to destroy me, that would like to ruin everything that I am and stand for.\n\nOne thing I don't talk about a lot is that when I was going to the inauguration with my mom, we actually had a plan in place if there had been a shooting or anything. Now, D.C. was very safe and locked down and everything like that, but based off of what we had just seen happen in the very same location where I would be standing and reciting, we weren't [assuming] that Black, brown bodies were always going to be safe.\n\nSo I, as a corporeal, physical person, was really scared to go to D.C., to go to the Capitol building, and to hold space in that location. I ended up doing it and I ended up still being safe. But one thing I had to do in going into that location was recognize that I was terrified and use that fear as a source of power and hope in my poem. I had to say to myself, I am so scared of what could happen. I'm also so scared of failing and not doing well for my people, my race, my gender, my art. But I also recognize that there's something so much greater on the other side of that terror. If there wasn't, I wouldn't be called to do this. If there wasn't, I wouldn't be on this plane. If there wasn't, I wouldn't be going up to this podium while a few days ago I had been questioning if I needed a bulletproof vest to show up.\n\nI think sometimes our terror is a great kind of flag to symbolize a type of love or greatness. The fact that I was so afraid, that I knew there was a reason that I was tapping into every well of courage that I had to show up into that space. Because the space needed to be revisited; that space needed to be revamped and it needed to be reconciled with. And I thought one of the few and also most fervent ways we have to do that is with poems.\n\nThis article originally misstated the amount of time that passed between the January 6 insurrection and President Joe Biden's inauguration."

      "text": "'I Always Think of Poetry as Home for Me'\n\nThe poet Amanda Gorman discusses her new collection, Call Us What We Carry, and how the last year has brought new urgency to her writing.\n\nUpdated at 7:34 p.m. ET on December 19, 2021.\n\nSeven years ago, I did a poetry reading at New Roads School, in Santa Monica, California. The students were incredible. They were funny, they were incredibly smart, and they asked the sorts of questions I had not been asked before. But one student stood out in particular. She was ebullient and curious and thoughtful. One of her teachers shared with me that she had recently been named the Los Angeles youth poet laureate. Her name was Amanda Gorman.\n\nLast year, like millions of others, I watched Gorman step behind a lectern on the steps of the U.S. Capitol-where just weeks before a violent mob of insurrectionists had attempted to overturn the results of the presidential election-and deliver an inaugural poem that transfixed the world and transformed her life.\n\nShe has since published her inaugural poem, \"The Hill We Climb,\" as well as a children's book, Change Sings , both of which were instant No. 1 New York Times best sellers. She has been on the cover of Vogue , Variety , and Time . She has read a poem for the Super Bowl. She has Oprah's phone number. In her new book, Call Us What We Carry , her first full-length poetry collection, Gorman grapples with how the coronavirus pandemic has reshaped our lives and further exacerbated America's already deep inequality, how the racial reckoning of the past year is in conversation with history that preceded it, and what it means to live in a world where the climate crisis hangs like a dark cloud over everything we do.\n\nI recently spoke with Gorman about her new book, her new life, and whether she could have ever imagined that she would be in the place she finds herself. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nClint Smith: What has this year been like for you? You became perhaps the most well-known poet in the world in a matter of minutes. Also, like all of us, you've been living through a pandemic. How is your spirit?\n\nAmanda Gorman: Thank you so much for checking in. Looking back at the year, I think I am existing in this liminal phase when everything that I knew about my life and how I was living is changing. Not only due to the pandemic, but also to the visibility that I received after the inauguration.\n\nI try to approach that as a gift or an opportunity in my writing. That is to say, if I am experiencing something such as the pandemic alongside millions of other people, I think that's a real opening for poetry to do the work that we need to connect us, to push us forward.\n\nThe moments where I was feeling most alone and separated from my fellow human beings- perhaps due to fame-I [would remember] that I was not alone, because I was experiencing so much of the loss, of the grief that comes with this pandemic, alongside other people, even if I didn't know them, even if we never met. I was part of a larger contingency, and my work and writing could serve that.\n\nSo the year has been wild and crazy and overwhelming, but I always think of poetry as home for me. It really brings me back down to earth, which I'm grateful for.\n\nSmith: Did you write most of this book during COVID, or is this work that you had started beforehand?\n\nGorman: Nearly every single poem in this new collection, save for maybe three, was written in 2021, in a three- or four-month span.\n\nIt was a really prolific period of creation for me. Not because it's easy. I'm sure you've heard from so many interviewers and things asking you if writing during COVID was \"easier\" because you're maybe at home more, you're not doing everything, you're kind of isolated. I was like, \"COVID is not a writer's residency.\"\n\nIf anything, I found that as I was writing, I had more writer's block, because I was bringing more grief and concerns and questions and baggage into the writing room. And so I wrote a lot. COVID just made writing feel all the more urgent for me, and all the more necessary. So, yeah, most of these poems are new and born out of the experience of the pandemic, but I think also just the larger racial reckoning that I think we're having, not only in the United States but around the world-the sociopolitical crisis that we find ourselves in.\n\nClint Smith: 800,000 deaths\n\nSmith: One of the things that's interesting about the collection, as I was making my way through it, was, like, the heterogeneity of the pieces. You play with form a lot in this book in ways that were new and unexpected and exciting for me. There are text messages and checklists and poems in the form of flags and poems that require you to turn the book on its side to read them. Tell me about this experimentation.\n\nGorman: One thing I set out for myself when I was writing the book is-I think to have fun is not necessarily the most precise word, because it was a kind of grievous, arduous process, but more so to have freedom, to have boundlessness in the book, to really be able to give myself a full range in which I could engage with the written word.\n\nSo many people's first interaction with my writing has been through the oral tradition. But as someone who grew up with a speech impediment, I spent so much more of my foundational training and writing on the page, because that was where I felt safe, that was where I felt heard, because it was a space where you wouldn't necessarily know that I had this disability.\n\nSo trying to figure out how I want to approach the written word through different shapes, different forms, was more of a homegoing to me, back to where I started my language journey.\n\nI also just wanted to disrupt my readers' perception of what qualifies as poetry, what poetry looks like. I wanted them to literally look at the pandemic experience anew, and that means turning the page on its side or upside down, that means playing with shade or having you fill in the blanks in a hangman poem. Hopefully, one of those moments will be a kind of aha or eye-opening moment for my reader by which they see things in a new light.\n\nSmith: For many people who pick up your first book, or for many people who will pick up this collection, it may very well be the first poetry book that they've ever purchased and read. Do you think about that as you're writing? If so, how does it shape the process?\n\nGorman: It's a deep privilege and it's also frightening at times. I want to do justice to the art and I want to welcome people into the tradition while also remaining authentic to who I am. The way that I approached that in writing is, I didn't change my topic-what I wanted to say, or what I wanted to address-but I tried to, at least at some point, in the words of Adele, go easy on my reader [ laughs ], even if I wasn't going easy on myself.\n\nThat doesn't mean I was sanitizing my writing, but that I was coming at the book with the assumption that everyone who was reading this was going to be an intelligent human being but they might not know the full depth and details of whatever I was talking about. Like, if I was writing about, let's say, the Chinese Exclusion Act, I'd do so without the presumption that every single person had learned about this in their educational experience.\n\nI was at a book reading once-I was in the audience-and I remember that one of the people asking a question told the author, \"I feel like you care about me when I'm reading the book.\" And that type of tenderness, that type of love, was something that I wanted to come through when I was writing the book. It was something that I reminded myself of every day, because I knew so many people would be coming to poetry for the first time via me.\n\nFrom the September 2018 issue: How poetry came to matter again\n\nSmith: How do you think of your relationship to a sort of poetic lineage? And how do you fit into a larger both Black intellectual and literary tradition but also a sort of larger American literary tradition, and a larger tradition of American letters and poetics?\n\nGorman: I find my poetic lineage so important. I'm always thinking of, particularly, a Black feminist tradition of the Toni Morrisons , the Maya Angelous, the Phillis Wheatleys, the Rita Doves, the Lucille Cliftons, the Gwendolyn Brookses. I feel like I am just trying to do them proud.\n\nI also think the class of poets that I exist in currently is just as important to me. This might sound weird but the yous, the Clint Smiths of the world, the Elizabeth Acevedos , the Jacqueline Woodsons, the Tracy K. Smiths -I consider you to be cousins, if not sisters and brothers. And we haven't always met or been in the same state or writing program, but I still feel a type of camaraderie.\n\nI definitely don't consider myself as someone who sets out to \"do something we've never seen before, completely different.\" If anything, I try to echo really old, ancient sentiments, just in the now, and I think that in itself is something that is different and unique.\n\nSmith: I think we're definitely cousins.\n\nGorman: Poets from another mother!\n\nSmith: How old were you when you started writing? And how did your speech impediment shape the way you approached and thought about your writing?\n\nGorman: I want to say I was like 5 or 6 when I started writing. At the time, I was writing little children's books for myself to read, which were horrible [ l a ughs ], but that's when I started. I didn't know writing was a profession until I was 8 or 9, and I was like, \"That's awesome.\"\n\nAnd my first kind of memory of the speech impediment? I had it ever since I can remember, I'd say ever since I started speaking. For most of my young years, I didn't know there was \"something wrong\" or \"different\" about me, because I have a twin sister and she also had the same speech impediment. For me, it was the world I knew. It was the language I was surrounded by.\n\nIt wasn't until, I want to say, I was like 6 or 7, where kids get a little bit meaner, when their barbs or insults become a little bit sharper, that I realized, Oh, the way that people see and hear me is different from the way I view and hear myself . What that did for me, I think, is it rerouted my experience of poetry. Although I wasn't on the poetry stage, I fell in love with the sound of words through speech pathology. I was in and out of speech therapy for most of my life. And what that did for me was force me to look at language, sounds, cadence, pronunciation actually as an access point of healing and recovery, because I was doing the work of learning English time and time again. I was completely fluent and eloquent in it, but it was really breaking down every single sound and how it's made, how is it different, how does the mouth work?\n\nAnd so I think my personal style as a poet sees poetry as an instrument of pathology. I think that's why you see a lot of alliteration and rhyme in my spoken-word poems, because it was me being in 11th grade with my speech therapist doing road , road , road over and over again. Red , red , red. Rat , rat. Building up in complexity to blend words such as president , brave , Harvard , et cetera. And so I carry that with me in everything that I write.\n\nSmith: Pivoting to your new collection specifically, where does the title Call Us What We Carry come from?\n\nGorman: When the book was first announced, I think it was something like 'The Hill We Climb' and Other Poems .\n\nSmith: I remember that.

      "text": "The Surprising Thing About Biden's Inauguration\n\nThe colorful and joyful ceremony didn't feel like a crisis-era bureaucratic procedure.\n\nEveryone knows that Joe Biden's presidential aesthetic is purposefully boring : He's promising a national nap time after Donald Trump's violent four-year kegger . \"Politics doesn't have to be a raging fire,\" the new president said during his inauguration address today, speaking where insurrectionists had recently carried Molotov cocktails . It was natural to expect that Biden's induction ceremony would make for a few hours as healthfully bland as a Zoom yoga session. (That is, unless you were one of the QAnon followers giddily awaiting the Space Force to intervene in the proceedings.)\n\nYet the first twist of the Biden era is that the 46th president's inauguration was rather lit. It felt more like a trippy, tony masquerade than a crisis-era bureaucratic procedure. By the time of the scorching closing prayer by Reverend Silvester Beaman, late-in-a-Marvel-movie sensory overload had set in. Maybe that was because the pandemic added a dose of surreality via mandatory face wear and a flag-peppered National Mall. Maybe the ceremony hinted at a roaring-2020s cultural shift percolating after the grueling, catastrophic 2010s. In any case, the inauguration offered a reminder that the political dream of \"normalcy\" is a dream not of dullness, but of joy. Skepticism from the right and the left toward Biden's gauzy rhetoric won't and shouldn't go away. But Wednesday was the moment to revel in the mass psychic unburdening that happens when the guy with the nuclear codes doesn't openly stoke civil war.\n\nRead: A sermon in America's civic religion\n\nAfter all, despite Trump's gilded decorative tastes, the last inauguration was a bleak nightmare defined by the word carnage and the groans of 3 Doors Down . By contrast, the 2021 inauguration might persist in the public memory as a whirl of fun fashions: the regal purple of the coat swishing around Kamala Harris; the dusk-hour burgundy of Michelle Obama's pantsuit; the kitschy zigzags of Bernie Sanders's mittens; the craftwork sparkles on Ella Emhoff's shoulders; the glimpse of Dior sneakers behind Amy Klobuchar as she speechified. The event was a musical extravaganza too. Americans know the songs of their patriotic canon plenty well, but they haven't often heard those songs performed quite like they were performed today. The arts-and-culture establishment-which largely sat out Trump-era ceremonies in protest-was back to flaunt its repressed ridiculousness.\n\nCertainly, any expectations that Lady Gaga would forgo gonzo excess for this sacred gig vanished as soon as she toddled out to sing \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" Gaga wanted to give America a feast: She'd braided her hair in the manner of a black-and-white challah; she wore a pouf dress that recalled a red-velvet cupcake; she sported a dove-shaped brooch as enormous as a Chipotle tortilla. (The dove itself snacked on an olive branch.) She then rendered the national anthem in the style of Richard Wagner's Valkyries, which is really to say in Gaga's own \"Bad Romance\" style: guttural, glamorous, serious, silly. When she got to the lyric \"our flag was still there,\" she turned around and belted to the American flag itself. One might call that maneuver preposterous in any other year, but was it not true that this particular flag persisted through a recent battle to tear it down ? For Gaga to bellow any less ferociously, without such tearful commitment, would have been an abdication of duty.\n\nJennifer Lopez's performance was, by contrast, a feat of musical restraint-at least for a bit. Singing with a delicate tone, she reworked the cadence of Woody Guthrie's \"This Land Is Your Land\"-a collectivist anthem written by an ancestral foil to the Trump family -to give it an adult-contemporary, democracy-is-fragile smoothness. But the military band's arrangement and Lopez's voice gathered fervor as the song went on. Then Lopez pulled off a series of sharp escalations: into the bombast of \"America the Beautiful,\" into a Spanish-language rendition of the Pledge of Allegiance, and into a mantra from Lopez's own catalog-\"Let's get loud!\" Stately reverence had given way to inclusive chutzpah. \"That was great,\" Klobuchar said, flatly and correctly, when she took the mic after Lopez.\n\nPhotos: The inauguration of President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\nThe third headlining slot of the show went to Garth Brooks, the slyly kooky country legend. He'd previously joked about being the only Republican at the inauguration, and his participation was advertised as a small sign that Biden's calls for unity would not go entirely unheeded. Singing \"Amazing Grace\" a cappella, with his hat in his hand, Brooks's almost-angelic affect emphasized the meaning of the lyrics \"how sweet the sound.\" When he asked listeners-in person and at home-to sing along with him for the final verse, the silence that continued to swaddle him felt psychedelically intense. Maybe the senators in attendance were shy about their voices; maybe they were muffled by their masks. But in any case, this was the moment when the absence of in-person inaugural crowds came into focus. If Biden succeeds in his task to free America from pandemics and seditionists, we'll be able to sing en masse again.\n\nGaga, J.Lo, Garth-these are long-established superstars, and their performances made a strong case for why we have normcore, big-tent entertainers (and, maybe, political leaders) in the first place. But the signature art-statement of the day came from a newcomer. Arrestingly decked in canary yellow and cherry red, the 22-year-old poet Amanda Gorman debuted her new work, \"The Hill We Climb,\" in a flawless five-minute recitation . The poem itself is a hyper-alliterative string of reassuring aphorisms; the most moving passage, about \"a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it,\" was written after the attack on the Capitol. Really it was Gorman's delivery-flowing with tidal grace, accentuated by symphony-conductor hand motions-that cast a spell in the manner of great music. \"We've learned that quiet isn't always peace,\" went one line of her poem. The garish hues and the go-for-broke singing of this inauguration suggested a correlated truth: If we achieve true peace, it might get loud."

We're rereading her poem, and some other timely works.\n\nEvery weekday evening, our editors guide you through the biggest stories of the day, help you discover new ideas, and surprise you with moments of delight. Subscribe to get this delivered to your inbox .\n\nAmanda Gorman stole the show.\n\nIn his piece on the performances at this week's presidential inauguration , our Culture staff writer Spencer Kornhaber maintained that \"the signature art-statement of the day came from a newcomer.\"\n\n\"It was Gorman's delivery-flowing with tidal grace, accentuated by symphony-conductor hand motions-that cast a spell in the manner of great music,\" he writes.\n\nHer recitation of \"The Hill We Climb\" is worth rewatching this weekend.\n\nIf you're feeling inspired-and looking for more poems to help you make sense of this moment in American history-keep reading. Below, eight writers and editors from around our newsroom share the poems they've been turning to at this juncture.\n\n\" PRAISE SONG FOR THE DAY \" BY ELIZABETH ALEXANDER\n\nThe stitching of hems, the patching of tires, the making of music-\"the day\" as a banality and \"the Day\" as an exultation. \"Praise Song,\" written for Barack Obama's first inauguration, thrillingly convenes the American quotidian and the American sublime. Notes of the poems I've loved sometimes whisper back to me, as I'm going about the business of my own little life: Audre Lorde's ancient and familiar sorrows , William Butler Yeats's ceremony of innocence , and, as of Wednesday, Gorman's a nation that isn't broken / but simply unfinished . It's one of Alexander's lines that has been echoing most loudly, though, in this moment of horror and hope: What if the mightiest word is love?\n\n- Megan Garber , staff writer covering culture\n\n\" A NEW NATIONAL ANTHEM \" BY ADA LIMÓN\n\nWhile I listened to Amanda Gorman on Wednesday, I was struck by how gracefully she captured the country's dual states of celebration and mourning, anxiety and hope. I was reminded of Ada Limón's \"A New National Anthem,\" which also reflects on America's contradictions, exploring how our flag and anthem can be sources of both shame and pride: a weapon and a match being lit / in an endless cave . As we enter a new chapter in our history, I find Gorman's and Limón's words uplifting, not only because they gesture toward healing, but also because they invite the reader to actively be a part of that process.\n\n- Morgan Ome , assistant editor\n\n\" A BIRTH \" BY MURIEL RUKEYSER\n\nWith the coming of a new era, it may be tempting to want a blank slate. The urge to forget unwelcome memories-or, at the very least, to hope they are finally a thing of the past-is a familiar one. Yet, as Muriel Rukeyser reminds us, not by evasion but by coming through can we celebrate what may be true beginning . I have found in her words the best counsel one could ask for in a moment of change.\n\n- Ena Alvarado , assistant editor\n\n\" POEM WHERE NO ONE IS DEPORTED \" BY JOSÉ OLIVAREZ\n\nI think often about a Percy Bysshe Shelley quote that the poet Natasha Trethewey mentioned when we spoke about her memoir last year: \"Poetry is the mirror that makes beautiful that which is distorted.\" More than any other form, poetry can rewrite painful truths or accepted parts of life by giving voice to different possibilities-to alternate futures, even. This poem by José Olivarez is a beautiful example of that remarkable power.\n\n- Hannah Giorgis , staff writer covering culture\n\n\" BOOT THEORY \" BY RICHARD SIKEN\n\nSometimes, when things feel bleak, I seek out art that makes me hopeful. Other times, I just want to see my own despair reflected back. For those times, Richard Siken's \"Boot Theory\" is perfect, full of nightmarish visions of everything spiraling, nothing making sense. He captures the way that mundane life-the simple but incessant accumulation of days-can be absurd and exhausting. And then the second boot falls. / And then a third, a fourth, a fifth.\n\n- Faith Hill , assistant editor who helps select our Atlantic weekly poem\n\n\" COMMENCEMENT SPEECH, DELIVERED TO A HERD OF WALRUS CALVES \" BY MATTHEW OLZMANN\n\nMy children, like all toddlers, are utterly fascinated by animals. Every day they wake up with a new favorite. Lion. Tiger. Zebra. Iguana. Penguin. But one that has particularly captured their attention is the walrus. We have read books about walruses, watched videos of walruses, and annoyed our neighbors by making too many walrus noises. So when I came across Matthew Olzmann's \"Commencement Speech, Delivered to a Herd of Walrus Calves,\" I found it particularly resonant. Olzmann's poem is equal parts profound and hilarious, speaking to the precarity of navigating a world fraught with danger while writing in a voice that centers levity rather than fear.\n\n- Clint Smith , staff writer and author of the poetry collection Counting Descent\n\n\" OUR BIAS \" BY W. H. AUDEN\n\nI went on a little W. H. Auden kick this week, and found myself returning to his poems about the nature of time. There are many of them, but one of my favorites is \"Our Bias,\" which points out the peculiarity of the human obsession with the past and the future. Auden sets forth the idea that the natural world is glorious because it does not suffer over time's passage; and yet the human world is beautiful precisely because of this unique suffering.\n\n- Adrienne LaFrance , executive editor\n\n\" THE END AND THE BEGINNING \" BY WISŁAWA SZYMBORSKA\n\nSomeone has to clean up. After a life's worth of turmoil in her native Poland, Wisława Szymborska wrote of the unexpectedly precious dullness of peace, and the unglamorous work of restoring a functional society. Following years of daily outrage, Americans must roll up their sleeves to duty. Szymborska also flags the need to keep a clear memory of how we arrived here, to avoid the end rhyme of repeating history. Things won't / straighten themselves up, after all.\n\n- Jennifer Adams , associate director of production\n\nSign up for The Atlantic Daily here."

      "text": "'I Always Think of Poetry as Home for Me'\n\nThe poet Amanda Gorman discusses her new collection, Call Us What We Carry, and how the last year has brought new urgency to her writing.\n\nUpdated at 7:34 p.m. ET on December 19, 2021.\n\nSeven years ago, I did a poetry reading at New Roads School, in Santa Monica, California. The students were incredible. They were funny, they were incredibly smart, and they asked the sorts of questions I had not been asked before. But one student stood out in particular. She was ebullient and curious and thoughtful. One of her teachers shared with me that she had recently been named the Los Angeles youth poet laureate. Her name was Amanda Gorman.\n\nLast year, like millions of others, I watched Gorman step behind a lectern on the steps of the U.S. Capitol-where just weeks before a violent mob of insurrectionists had attempted to overturn the results of the presidential election-and deliver an inaugural poem that transfixed the world and transformed her life.\n\nShe has since published her inaugural poem, \"The Hill We Climb,\" as well as a children's book, Change Sings , both of which were instant No. 1 New York Times best sellers. She has been on the cover of Vogue , Variety , and Time . She has read a poem for the Super Bowl. She has Oprah's phone number. In her new book, Call Us What We Carry , her first full-length poetry collection, Gorman grapples with how the coronavirus pandemic has reshaped our lives and further exacerbated America's already deep inequality, how the racial reckoning of the past year is in conversation with history that preceded it, and what it means to live in a world where the climate crisis hangs like a dark cloud over everything we do.\n\nI recently spoke with Gorman about her new book, her new life, and whether she could have ever imagined that she would be in the place she finds herself. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nClint Smith: What has this year been like for you? You became perhaps the most well-known poet in the world in a matter of minutes. Also, like all of us, you've been living through a pandemic. How is your spirit?\n\nAmanda Gorman: Thank you so much for checking in. Looking back at the year, I think I am existing in this liminal phase when everything that I knew about my life and how I was living is changing. Not only due to the pandemic, but also to the visibility that I received after the inauguration.\n\nI try to approach that as a gift or an opportunity in my writing. That is to say, if I am experiencing something such as the pandemic alongside millions of other people, I think that's a real opening for poetry to do the work that we need to connect us, to push us forward.\n\nThe moments where I was feeling most alone and separated from my fellow human beings- perhaps due to fame-I [would remember] that I was not alone, because I was experiencing so much of the loss, of the grief that comes with this pandemic, alongside other people, even if I didn't know them, even if we never met. I was part of a larger contingency, and my work and writing could serve that.\n\nSo the year has been wild and crazy and overwhelming, but I always think of poetry as home for me. It really brings me back down to earth, which I'm grateful for.\n\nSmith: Did you write most of this book during COVID, or is this work that you had started beforehand?\n\nGorman: Nearly every single poem in this new collection, save for maybe three, was written in 2021, in a three- or four-month span.\n\nIt was a really prolific period of creation for me. Not because it's easy. I'm sure you've heard from so many interviewers and things asking you if writing during COVID was \"easier\" because you're maybe at home more, you're not doing everything, you're kind of isolated. I was like, \"COVID is not a writer's residency.\"\n\nIf anything, I found that as I was writing, I had more writer's block, because I was bringing more grief and concerns and questions and baggage into the writing room. And so I wrote a lot. COVID just made writing feel all the more urgent for me, and all the more necessary. So, yeah, most of these poems are new and born out of the experience of the pandemic, but I think also just the larger racial reckoning that I think we're having, not only in the United States but around the world-the sociopolitical crisis that we find ourselves in.\n\nClint Smith: 800,000 deaths\n\nSmith: One of the things that's interesting about the collection, as I was making my way through it, was, like, the heterogeneity of the pieces. You play with form a lot in this book in ways that were new and unexpected and exciting for me. There are text messages and checklists and poems in the form of flags and poems that require you to turn the book on its side to read them. Tell me about this experimentation.\n\nGorman: One thing I set out for myself when I was writing the book is-I think to have fun is not necessarily the most precise word, because it was a kind of grievous, arduous process, but more so to have freedom, to have boundlessness in the book, to really be able to give myself a full range in which I could engage with the written word.\n\nSo many people's first interaction with my writing has been through the oral tradition. But as someone who grew up with a speech impediment, I spent so much more of my foundational training and writing on the page, because that was where I felt safe, that was where I felt heard, because it was a space where you wouldn't necessarily know that I had this disability.\n\nSo trying to figure out how I want to approach the written word through different shapes, different forms, was more of a homegoing to me, back to where I started my language journey.\n\nI also just wanted to disrupt my readers' perception of what qualifies as poetry, what poetry looks like. I wanted them to literally look at the pandemic experience anew, and that means turning the page on its side or upside down, that means playing with shade or having you fill in the blanks in a hangman poem. Hopefully, one of those moments will be a kind of aha or eye-opening moment for my reader by which they see things in a new light.\n\nSmith: For many people who pick up your first book, or for many people who will pick up this collection, it may very well be the first poetry book that they've ever purchased and read. Do you think about that as you're writing? If so, how does it shape the process?\n\nGorman: It's a deep privilege and it's also frightening at times. I want to do justice to the art and I want to welcome people into the tradition while also remaining authentic to who I am. The way that I approached that in writing is, I didn't change my topic-what I wanted to say, or what I wanted to address-but I tried to, at least at some point, in the words of Adele, go easy on my reader [ laughs ], even if I wasn't going easy on myself.\n\nThat doesn't mean I was sanitizing my writing, but that I was coming at the book with the assumption that everyone who was reading this was going to be an intelligent human being but they might not know the full depth and details of whatever I was talking about. Like, if I was writing about, let's say, the Chinese Exclusion Act, I'd do so without the presumption that every single person had learned about this in their educational experience.\n\nI was at a book reading once-I was in the audience-and I remember that one of the people asking a question told the author, \"I feel like you care about me when I'm reading the book.\" And that type of tenderness, that type of love, was something that I wanted to come through when I was writing the book. It was something that I reminded myself of every day, because I knew so many people would be coming to poetry for the first time via me.\n\nFrom the September 2018 issue: How poetry came to matter again\n\nSmith: How do you think of your relationship to a sort of poetic lineage? And how do you fit into a larger both Black intellectual and literary tradition but also a sort of larger American literary tradition, and a larger tradition of American letters and poetics?\n\nGorman: I find my poetic lineage so important. I'm always thinking of, particularly, a Black feminist tradition of the Toni Morrisons , the Maya Angelous, the Phillis Wheatleys, the Rita Doves, the Lucille Cliftons, the Gwendolyn Brookses. I feel like I am just trying to do them proud.\n\nI also think the class of poets that I exist in currently is just as important to me. This might sound weird but the yous, the Clint Smiths of the world, the Elizabeth Acevedos , the Jacqueline Woodsons, the Tracy K. Smiths -I consider you to be cousins, if not sisters and brothers. And we haven't always met or been in the same state or writing program, but I still feel a type of camaraderie.\n\nI definitely don't consider myself as someone who sets out to \"do something we've never seen before, completely different.\" If anything, I try to echo really old, ancient sentiments, just in the now, and I think that in itself is something that is different and unique.\n\nSmith: I think we're definitely cousins.\n\nGorman: Poets from another mother!\n\nSmith: How old were you when you started writing? And how did your speech impediment shape the way you approached and thought about your writing?\n\nGorman: I want to say I was like 5 or 6 when I started writing. At the time, I was writing little children's books for myself to read, which were horrible [ l a ughs ], but that's when I started. I didn't know writing was a profession until I was 8 or 9, and I was like, \"That's awesome.\"\n\nAnd my first kind of memory of the speech impediment? I had it ever since I can remember, I'd say ever since I started speaking. For most of my young years, I didn't know there was \"something wrong\" or \"different\" about me, because I have a twin sister and she also had the same speech impediment. For me, it was the world I knew. It was the language I was surrounded by.\n\nIt wasn't until, I want to say, I was like 6 or 7, where kids get a little bit meaner, when their barbs or insults become a little bit sharper, that I realized, Oh, the way that people see and hear me is different from the way I view and hear myself . What that did for me, I think, is it rerouted my experience of poetry. Although I wasn't on the poetry stage, I fell in love with the sound of words through speech pathology. I was in and out of speech therapy for most of my life. And what that did for me was force me to look at language, sounds, cadence, pronunciation actually as an access point of healing and recovery, because I was doing the work of learning English time and time again. I was completely fluent and eloquent in it, but it was really breaking down every single sound and how it's made, how is it different, how does the mouth work?\n\nAnd so I think my personal style as a poet sees poetry as an instrument of pathology. I think that's why you see a lot of alliteration and rhyme in my spoken-word poems, because it was me being in 11th grade with my speech therapist doing road , road , road over and over again. Red , red , red. Rat , rat. Building up in complexity to blend words such as president , brave , Harvard , et cetera. And so I carry that with me in everything that I write.\n\nSmith: Pivoting to your new collection specifically, where does the title Call Us What We Carry come from?\n\nGorman: When the book was first announced, I think it was something like 'The Hill We Climb' and Other Poems .\n\nSmith: I remember that. And what was the journey from that title to the title you have now?\n\nGorman: I was writing the collection, which at the time I had really no poems for, when the book was announced, and I was just trying to see if maybe there was a universe in which there was another title that worked. I was kind of just in bed writing scraps of thoughts and poems and I was thinking about something I learned in biology in high school, which is about how the human body was not only the cells that carry my DNA, but how so many types of microorganisms exist on me as well. I remember my teacher was saying, \"You are not you. You are we.\" I was really confused at the time, and it wasn't until I was writing this collection, and how as an individual I feel part of a multitude that is experiencing these past two years, that I landed on this idea of, Oh, this book that I'm writing as me is also me writing to and with and from a we. So I changed the title and then I also changed the voice for a lot of the book.\n\nIt wasn't a huge shift, because most of the poems or the thoughts or the verses, they had what I call multiple personalities. They would begin with an I , and then there would be a we and an I , and then a you , and then a they , and then all of these kind of exist in the we . They're all part of it. I changed the singular voice of some of the poems to a more collective voice, and then I changed the title as well.\n\nSmith: One of the most compelling sections of the book is the series of poems about climate change. I'm curious, how does the natural world shape you and shape your writing, and how has the ongoing destruction of it done so?\n\nGorman: The idea that public health, society, and the planet are interconnected isn't a new one, but I also don't think it's an idea that we talk about enough. When I was writing the book, I really wanted to utilize the natural world in my poems, which is something that I've done ever since I was little. I think there's a lot of metaphors about trees and water and the ocean and the sky in the poems. I think I was doing that not just because it's important to my own voice, but I think it's so important that we put-especially as poets-language and rhetoric around nature in conversation with the very status of that nature that we're talking about. If I'm talking about trees or the sky, I have to talk about pollution in the air; I have to talk about climate change.\n\nIt's something that I think is so important-and at times frustrating-to me, because when we think about \"nature poetry,\" I think traditionally it's a very kind of white, male, hegemonic tradition of old white men on benches thinking about existentialism, and it's completely removed and isolated from any kind of real profound question about race, equality ... life. So I wanted to honor those intersections, which I think are a lot of times whitened or erased when we look at nature poetry, because we're not looking at it from the perception of the marginalized, who typically are the people who are tending the earth, who are [planting] the crops, who are being removed from the land.\n\nSmith: As you know, I am really interested in place. How physical place and, specifically, physical place that is tied to a historical moment or a phenomenon shape the way that we experience a place and, subsequently, understand history.\n\nYou have this poem \"War: What, Is It Good?\" and you have a series of lines that say \"There is no such thing as a gentle war / There is no peace / That can't be flung aside . \" For me, I read those lines and I just kept thinking about the precarity and fragility of our current moment, and more directly, I kept thinking about you standing on the Capitol, delivering the inaugural poem just weeks after the violent uprising at the Capitol .\n\nIn my own book project, I had so many moments where I was standing on a plantation or standing inside of where slave auctions happened or standing on a Confederate cemetery or standing in a prison that was once a plantation and standing in these places that have this very acute relationship to a historical trauma. You did that but for a historical trauma that wasn't centuries before, but one that had happened a few weeks before. As we learn more and more about that day and what happened, we learn more and more about what could have happened and what many of those people wanted to happen and how even more violent it could have gotten. That's a long way of asking: What was that like for you? Just in your spirit and in your body to be in that place in that moment after. And how did your presence there fit into the story of that moment in some ways?\n\nRead: The surprising thing about Biden's inauguration\n\nGorman: Oh God. How much more time do we have? You could have written a book about it. It's interesting that you say the importance of being in this place, because, ironically, the poem that made me the inaugural poet was my poem \"In This Place (An American Lyric)\" that I wrote several years ago, which Dr. Jill Biden saw online and which made her want me to be the inaugural poet.\n\nSo what gave me entry into that space was a poem that I had written about holding space. Looking back at the inauguration, it can be kind of bronzed over because it went well. I got a lot of visibility and notice and positivity. But at that moment, I will say that I was very terrified about stepping into a place that had been desecrated by forces that would like to destroy me, that would like to ruin everything that I am and stand for.\n\nOne thing I don't talk about a lot is that when I was going to the inauguration with my mom, we actually had a plan in place if there had been a shooting or anything. Now, D.C. was very safe and locked down and everything like that, but based off of what we had just seen happen in the very same location where I would be standing and reciting, we weren't [assuming] that Black, brown bodies were always going to be safe.\n\nSo I, as a corporeal, physical person, was really scared to go to D.C., to go to the Capitol building, and to hold space in that location. I ended up doing it and I ended up still being safe. But one thing I had to do in going into that location was recognize that I was terrified and use that fear as a source of power and hope in my poem. I had to say to myself, I am so scared of what could happen. I'm also so scared of failing and not doing well for my people, my race, my gender, my art. But I also recognize that there's something so much greater on the other side of that terror. If there wasn't, I wouldn't be called to do this. If there wasn't, I wouldn't be on this plane. If there wasn't, I wouldn't be going up to this podium while a few days ago I had been questioning if I needed a bulletproof vest to show up.\n\nI think sometimes our terror is a great kind of flag to symbolize a type of love or greatness. The fact that I was so afraid, that I knew there was a reason that I was tapping into every well of courage that I had to show up into that space. Because the space needed to be revisited; that space needed to be revamped and it needed to be reconciled with. And I thought one of the few and also most fervent ways we have to do that is with poems.\n\nThis article originally misstated the amount of time that passed between the January 6 insurrection and President Joe Biden's inauguration."

      "text": "Poetry Lets Us Remember-And Move On\n\nWhere to turn when your emotions call for something other than straightforward prose: Your weekly guide to the best in books\n\nAfter her second miscarriage, the poet Lindsay Turner found herself longing for some way to commemorate her loss. Friends assured her the experience was common; meanwhile, life continued as if nothing had happened at all. She wasn't sure what, exactly, she was now missing-she didn't believe it was a person-but she still felt grief. \"Was it possible,\" she wondered, \"that I had had nothing, and therefore that I had lost nothing?\" It certainly felt like something.\n\nSo, being a poet, Turner did what she knew how to-she read poems. Two by Sharon Olds stood out: In \"To Our Miscarried One, Age Thirty Now\" and \"To Our Miscarried One, Age Fifty Now,\" Olds reaches for the person she could have created and now will never meet. And in \"Parliament Hill Fields,\" Sylvia Plath speaks to the miscarried one she herself lost in between her two children: \"Your absence is inconspicuous; / Nobody can tell what I lack.\" Turner realized she could address her loss directly, even if the \"you\" she spoke to was ambiguous. \"To say 'you' to a lost thing in a poem,\" she wrote, \"is to acknowledge the thing ... and to bid it goodbye when you're ready-even if you have no idea what that thing is, or whether it has ever existed at all.\"\n\nSometimes, our pain calls for something other than straightforward prose. Poems can offer new ways to understand our experiences-especially those that are confusing, distressing, or just hard to put our finger on. For poets like Natasha Trethewey , poetry is an \"act of remembering\"; she used it to process memories of her mother's death and her stepfather's abuse. For Carolyn Forché , it's a means of witness, a way to mark injustice and convey its urgency to the world. And for Tracy K. Smith , poetry is a way to grapple with the long history of violence against Black Americans-it can even resurrect those erased from the record, if only on the page.\n\nBy allowing us to work through what hurts or scares us, poetry helps us move forward. It lets us do so with more courage and compassion, better able to pull others along with us. When Amanda Gorman delivered her inaugural poem just weeks after January 6, 2021, she was afraid to be at the Capitol. But \"that space needed to be revamped and it needed to be reconciled with,\" she told staff writer Clint Smith. \"And I thought one of the few and also most fervent ways we have to do that is with poems.\"\n\n Every Friday in the Books Briefing , we thread together Atlantic stories on books that share similar ideas.

And in doing so, I-like the miscarriage-poem writers before me-could feel this loss as real and significant.\"\n\nNatasha Trethewey / Katie Martin / The Atlantic\n\nHow poetry can guide us through trauma \"Whether by conveying the scale of national grief during a pandemic, or exposing the relentlessness of racism, poetry has already created new ways of experiencing, and surviving, life's darkest chapters. And in composing their words, and themselves, through this interminable gloom, Trethewey and other poets working now compose the rest of us, too.\"\n\nPenguin Press\n\nHow to write poetry about conflict \"Forché has confronted historical and present crises in each of her five poetry collections, writing not only about her experiences in Lebanon and El Salvador, but also about the Holocaust, the atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and most recently, the refugee crisis in the Aegean. She has devoted herself equally to poetry and to witness.\"\n\nMary Hudetz / AP / Arsh Raziuddin / The Atlantic\n\nWhat Tracy K. Smith sees in America \"Like the best poets, Smith shows her readers that they share a common foundation, and also questions how that foundation was laid.

      "text": "The Surprising Thing About Biden's Inauguration\n\nThe colorful and joyful ceremony didn't feel like a crisis-era bureaucratic procedure.\n\nEveryone knows that Joe Biden's presidential aesthetic is purposefully boring : He's promising a national nap time after Donald Trump's violent four-year kegger . \"Politics doesn't have to be a raging fire,\" the new president said during his inauguration address today, speaking where insurrectionists had recently carried Molotov cocktails . It was natural to expect that Biden's induction ceremony would make for a few hours as healthfully bland as a Zoom yoga session. (That is, unless you were one of the QAnon followers giddily awaiting the Space Force to intervene in the proceedings.)\n\nYet the first twist of the Biden era is that the 46th president's inauguration was rather lit. It felt more like a trippy, tony masquerade than a crisis-era bureaucratic procedure. By the time of the scorching closing prayer by Reverend Silvester Beaman, late-in-a-Marvel-movie sensory overload had set in. Maybe that was because the pandemic added a dose of surreality via mandatory face wear and a flag-peppered National Mall. Maybe the ceremony hinted at a roaring-2020s cultural shift percolating after the grueling, catastrophic 2010s. In any case, the inauguration offered a reminder that the political dream of \"normalcy\" is a dream not of dullness, but of joy. Skepticism from the right and the left toward Biden's gauzy rhetoric won't and shouldn't go away. But Wednesday was the moment to revel in the mass psychic unburdening that happens when the guy with the nuclear codes doesn't openly stoke civil war.\n\nRead: A sermon in America's civic religion\n\nAfter all, despite Trump's gilded decorative tastes, the last inauguration was a bleak nightmare defined by the word carnage and the groans of 3 Doors Down . By contrast, the 2021 inauguration might persist in the public memory as a whirl of fun fashions: the regal purple of the coat swishing around Kamala Harris; the dusk-hour burgundy of Michelle Obama's pantsuit; the kitschy zigzags of Bernie Sanders's mittens; the craftwork sparkles on Ella Emhoff's shoulders; the glimpse of Dior sneakers behind Amy Klobuchar as she speechified. The event was a musical extravaganza too. Americans know the songs of their patriotic canon plenty well, but they haven't often heard those songs performed quite like they were performed today. The arts-and-culture establishment-which largely sat out Trump-era ceremonies in protest-was back to flaunt its repressed ridiculousness.\n\nCertainly, any expectations that Lady Gaga would forgo gonzo excess for this sacred gig vanished as soon as she toddled out to sing \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" Gaga wanted to give America a feast: She'd braided her hair in the manner of a black-and-white challah; she wore a pouf dress that recalled a red-velvet cupcake; she sported a dove-shaped brooch as enormous as a Chipotle tortilla. (The dove itself snacked on an olive branch.) She then rendered the national anthem in the style of Richard Wagner's Valkyries, which is really to say in Gaga's own \"Bad Romance\" style: guttural, glamorous, serious, silly. When she got to the lyric \"our flag was still there,\" she turned around and belted to the American flag itself. One might call that maneuver preposterous in any other year, but was it not true that this particular flag persisted through a recent battle to tear it down ? For Gaga to bellow any less ferociously, without such tearful commitment, would have been an abdication of duty.\n\nJennifer Lopez's performance was, by contrast, a feat of musical restraint-at least for a bit. Singing with a delicate tone, she reworked the cadence of Woody Guthrie's \"This Land Is Your Land\"-a collectivist anthem written by an ancestral foil to the Trump family -to give it an adult-contemporary, democracy-is-fragile smoothness. But the military band's arrangement and Lopez's voice gathered fervor as the song went on. Then Lopez pulled off a series of sharp escalations: into the bombast of \"America the Beautiful,\" into a Spanish-language rendition of the Pledge of Allegiance, and into a mantra from Lopez's own catalog-\"Let's get loud!\" Stately reverence had given way to inclusive chutzpah. \"That was great,\" Klobuchar said, flatly and correctly, when she took the mic after Lopez.\n\nPhotos: The inauguration of President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\nThe third headlining slot of the show went to Garth Brooks, the slyly kooky country legend. He'd previously joked about being the only Republican at the inauguration, and his participation was advertised as a small sign that Biden's calls for unity would not go entirely unheeded. Singing \"Amazing Grace\" a cappella, with his hat in his hand, Brooks's almost-angelic affect emphasized the meaning of the lyrics \"how sweet the sound.\" When he asked listeners-in person and at home-to sing along with him for the final verse, the silence that continued to swaddle him felt psychedelically intense. Maybe the senators in attendance were shy about their voices; maybe they were muffled by their masks. But in any case, this was the moment when the absence of in-person inaugural crowds came into focus. If Biden succeeds in his task to free America from pandemics and seditionists, we'll be able to sing en masse again.\n\nGaga, J.Lo, Garth-these are long-established superstars, and their performances made a strong case for why we have normcore, big-tent entertainers (and, maybe, political leaders) in the first place. But the signature art-statement of the day came from a newcomer. Arrestingly decked in canary yellow and cherry red, the 22-year-old poet Amanda Gorman debuted her new work, \"The Hill We Climb,\" in a flawless five-minute recitation . The poem itself is a hyper-alliterative string of reassuring aphorisms; the most moving passage, about \"a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it,\" was written after the attack on the Capitol. Really it was Gorman's delivery-flowing with tidal grace, accentuated by symphony-conductor hand motions-that cast a spell in the manner of great music. \"We've learned that quiet isn't always peace,\" went one line of her poem. The garish hues and the go-for-broke singing of this inauguration suggested a correlated truth: If we achieve true peace, it might get loud."

      "text": "The Atlantic Daily : Biden Gives a Strikingly Normal Speech\n\nToday's presidential inauguration was mostly remarkable for how unremarkable it was.\n\nEvery weekday evening, our editors guide you through the biggest stories of the day, help you discover new ideas, and surprise you with moments of delight. Subscribe to get this delivered to your inbox .\n\nToday's presidential inauguration was mostly remarkable for how unremarkable it was. My colleague Annie Lowrey described today's scene at the Capitol as \"patriotic normcore.\"\n\nAfter four years of assaults on democracy and endless uncertainty, President Biden steered the national mood, however incrementally, back toward normalcy.\n\nBiden's speech invoked the familiar-and made it newly fresh.\n\nThe president's address \"was well wrought, but it offered nothing unusual, nothing surprising, nothing especially memorable,\" our Ideas staff writer David A. Graham notes. \"Paradoxically, that was the source of its power.\"\n\nToday, Kamala Harris did it.\n\n\"Her vice presidency is worth celebrating because-however painful the process-she made it to the other side of the barrier,\" the contributing writer Jemele Hill wrote back in November.\n\nThe administration begins amid tragedy.\n\nOn the eve of Biden's swearing in, the U.S. pandemic death toll reached 400,000. And it could hit 500,000 by the end of February, Biden's incoming chief of staff, Ron Klain, warns.\n\nAnd the country will still need to heal from the assaults of the Trump era.\n\n\"If there is to be a recovery, it will be long and arduous, and require sustained intensive care,\" Adam Serwer warns. \"Even old wounds can ultimately prove fatal.\"\n\nFurther reading:\n\nBiden should go big, fast, and simple , Derek Thompson argues.\n\nOur White House correspondent Peter Nicholas reflects on what he saw in the building on Trump's last day .\n\nBrowse photos of the inauguration festivities.\n\nOne question, answered: A reader named Nancy writes in from New Hampshire.\n\nI'm still confused about what our lives will be like after we are vaccinated. ... Do you foresee us still wearing masks for the next year or two? I hate to even type this question.\n\nJames Hamblin responds in his latest \"Ask Dr. Hamblin\" column:\n\nTo be blunt, [President Biden's 100 day goal] is not a realistic end point. On our current trajectory of illness and infection, masks will be part of most Americans' lives for at least the rest of the year, and possibly longer. My hope is that it will soon be possible to say, as a general rule, that once you've been vaccinated, you don't have to wear a mask. But that depends on two key variables.\n\nRead the rest.

In an interview with the Herald , Salinas said she \"is not for eliminating or censoring any books,\" but wants materials to be appropriate and for students \"to know the truth\" about Cuba.\n\nSalinas' complaints led a Florida school to restrict access to The Hill We Climb , a book adaptation of the poem Gorman recited at President Joe Biden's inauguration.

One of the pages Salinas complained about reads: \"Somehow, we've weathered and witnessed / A nation that isn't broken, but simply unfinished.\"\n\nA committee at the school decided to reshelve the books in the library's middle school section, according to meeting minutes viewed by The Daily Beast, despite the books being recommended for younger readers.\n\nSalinas, who filed complaints against five books, appears to be connected to multiple far-right organizations, attending events with Moms for Liberty and the Proud Boys.\n\nSalinas did not return requests for comment. The Miami-Dade Moms for Liberty chapter did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nSalinas was removed by security from a Miami-Dade school board meeting in July 2022, according to video of the event, during an intervention by Moms For Liberty. The group disrupted the meeting to protest two sex education textbooks that had been previously approved by the board. Following petitions from parents, the board voted 5-4 to remove the books, effectively leaving the district without instruction materials for sex education.\n\nTwo women who spoke against the sex ed textbooks began yelling over school board members as they were deliberating. The two women were escorted out of the building by police, as was a man who was sitting elsewhere in the auditorium. pic.twitter.com/VrFyHdzklr\n\nAn avid supporter of Ron DeSantis , Salinas worked as a volunteer on his \"Education Agenda Tour\" in August 2022, according to social media posts reviewed by The Daily Beast. That summer, DeSantis traveled the state boosting conservative candidates in school board elections and lambasting schools \"indoctrinating\" children.\n\nHowever, Salinas' politics appear to have gone beyond the right wing of the Republican party, veering into extremism and antisemitism.\n\nIn March of this year, Salinas shared a Facebook post entitled \"The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion,\" which included a series of anti-Semitic tropes about an alleged Jewish conspiracy to control the world. Salinas appears to have deleted the post on Wednesday, after it was flagged by the group Miami Against Fascism on Twitter. After the deletion, she posted a picture of an armed Israeli Defense Force soldier in front of a tank, with the words, \"People never seen this.I love my Jewish people.\"\n\nSalinas, a registered Republican, appeared to become more politically active during the COVID pandemic, according to a review of her social media. In October 2020, Salinas was interviewed briefly on a segment by PBS Newshour about Florida voters.\n\n\"My biggest fear is, they talk about the Democratic Party. They talk about socialism, socialism and communism going in the same way,\" Salinas said. She told PBS she had fled Cuba for the United States when she was 21 years old.\n\nLos mejores. My Proud boys. 🇺🇸💞💪🙏\n\n\"The reason why we came here, I remember, I was little, and I say I need to live. It's too much oppression and the dictator. So I don't want this for my kids. I want my kids [to] keep their freedom,\" she told the program.\n\nIn August 2021 , Salinas attended a protest against masks in Miami-Dade schools, where she was photographed standing next to Enrique Tarrio, the former leader of the Proud Boys. Tarrio had already been implicated in the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, for which he was later convicted of seditious conspiracy. (Salinas has shared posts indicating she believes Jan. 6 defendants are political prisoners.)\n\nJust over a year later, Salinas attended another rally organized by the Proud Boys in support of Christoper Morzon, a far-right extremist nicknamed the \"Cuban Confederate.\" At the protest in November, 2022, Salinas can be seen wearing a Ron DeSantis T-shirt and hat.\n\nA month earlier, Morzon was physically assaulted in Hialeah, Florida, ending up in hospital. Immediately afterwards, Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted that the attack was politically motivated and that Morzon had been out canvassing for Rubio's campaign. However, an incident report from the Hialeah Police Department made no mention of a political motive.\n\nNonetheless, right-wing groups rallied around Morzon, despite his history of racist and white supremacist beliefs. Morzon took part in the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, which ended in the death of an anti-fascist protester. He was previously a member of the League of the South, a designated hate group, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center . (Morzon claimed to have resigned from the group in 2021 and disavowed his former views.) Salinas was also part of a select group of right-wing activists pictured with Morzon shortly after his release from hospital.\n\nNot only did Daily Salinas attend the Proud Boy organized rally in support of Rubio canvasser Christopher Monzon, previously arrested for attacking protesters with a confederate flag, she was also captured alongside his close supporters when he was released from the hospital. 5/ https://t.co/q0bqd713WB\n\nA review of Salinas' social media posts reveal her involvement in other right-wing campaigns. In October 2022, she took part in a rally outside the Miami-Dade School Board offices with Citizens Defending Freedom (CCDF), a conservative advocacy group described by its critics as \"Christian nationalist\". CCDF is linked to the Turning Point USA and Alliance Defending Freedom, the right-wing group beyond numerous anti-LGBT bills across the U.S.\n\nSalinas attended the protest wearing a black t-shirt with the words \"American Patriot' emblazoned across it.\n\nSalinas' complaints against Gorman's book are characteristic of a wave of attempted book bans across the country, spearheaded by conservative groups and a cohort of hyper-zealous activists; a May analysis by the Washington Post of 1,000 book challenges found that 11 people were responsible for most of the complaints.\n\nDespite her disdain for Gorman and Langston Hughes' poetry, there is one book for children that Salinas promotes on her social media: The Kid's Guide to Ron DeSantis by Mike Huckabee-available for just $1.\n\nkelly.weill@thedailybeast.com\n\nReporter-Researcher\n\nDecca.Muldowney@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

One of the pages Salinas complained about reads: \"Somehow, we've weathered and witnessed / A nation that isn't broken, but simply unfinished.\"\n\nA committee at the school decided to reshelve the books in the library's middle school section, according to meeting minutes viewed by The Daily Beast, despite the books being recommended for younger readers.\n\nSalinas, who filed complaints against five books, appears to be connected to multiple far-right organizations, attending events with Moms for Liberty and the Proud Boys.\n\nSalinas did not return requests for comment. The Miami-Dade Moms for Liberty chapter did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nSalinas was removed by security from a Miami-Dade school board meeting in July 2022, according to video of the event, during an intervention by Moms For Liberty. The group disrupted the meeting to protest two sex education textbooks that had been previously approved by the board. Following petitions from parents, the board voted 5-4 to remove the books, effectively leaving the district without instruction materials for sex education.\n\nTwo women who spoke against the sex ed textbooks began yelling over school board members as they were deliberating. The two women were escorted out of the building by police, as was a man who was sitting elsewhere in the auditorium. pic.twitter.com/VrFyHdzklr\n\nAn avid supporter of Ron DeSantis , Salinas worked as a volunteer on his \"Education Agenda Tour\" in August 2022, according to social media posts reviewed by The Daily Beast. That summer, DeSantis traveled the state boosting conservative candidates in school board elections and lambasting schools \"indoctrinating\" children.\n\nHowever, Salinas' politics appear to have gone beyond the right wing of the Republican party, veering into extremism and antisemitism.\n\nIn March of this year, Salinas shared a Facebook post entitled \"The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion,\" which included a series of anti-Semitic tropes about an alleged Jewish conspiracy to control the world. Salinas appears to have deleted the post on Wednesday, after it was flagged by the group Miami Against Fascism on Twitter. After the deletion, she posted a picture of an armed Israeli Defense Force soldier in front of a tank, with the words, \"People never seen this.I love my Jewish people.\"\n\nSalinas, a registered Republican, appeared to become more politically active during the COVID pandemic, according to a review of her social media. In October 2020, Salinas was interviewed briefly on a segment by PBS Newshour about Florida voters.\n\n\"My biggest fear is, they talk about the Democratic Party. They talk about socialism, socialism and communism going in the same way,\" Salinas said. She told PBS she had fled Cuba for the United States when she was 21 years old.\n\nLos mejores. My Proud boys. 🇺🇸💞💪🙏\n\n\"The reason why we came here, I remember, I was little, and I say I need to live. It's too much oppression and the dictator. So I don't want this for my kids. I want my kids [to] keep their freedom,\" she told the program.\n\nIn August 2021 , Salinas attended a protest against masks in Miami-Dade schools, where she was photographed standing next to Enrique Tarrio, the former leader of the Proud Boys. Tarrio had already been implicated in the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, for which he was later convicted of seditious conspiracy. (Salinas has shared posts indicating she believes Jan. 6 defendants are political prisoners.)\n\nJust over a year later, Salinas attended another rally organized by the Proud Boys in support of Christoper Morzon, a far-right extremist nicknamed the \"Cuban Confederate.\" At the protest in November, 2022, Salinas can be seen wearing a Ron DeSantis T-shirt and hat.\n\nA month earlier, Morzon was physically assaulted in Hialeah, Florida, ending up in hospital. Immediately afterwards, Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted that the attack was politically motivated and that Morzon had been out canvassing for Rubio's campaign. However, an incident report from the Hialeah Police Department made no mention of a political motive.\n\nNonetheless, right-wing groups rallied around Morzon, despite his history of racist and white supremacist beliefs. Morzon took part in the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, which ended in the death of an anti-fascist protester. He was previously a member of the League of the South, a designated hate group, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center . (Morzon claimed to have resigned from the group in 2021 and disavowed his former views.) Salinas was also part of a select group of right-wing activists pictured with Morzon shortly after his release from hospital.\n\nNot only did Daily Salinas attend the Proud Boy organized rally in support of Rubio canvasser Christopher Monzon, previously arrested for attacking protesters with a confederate flag, she was also captured alongside his close supporters when he was released from the hospital. 5/ https://t.co/q0bqd713WB\n\nA review of Salinas' social media posts reveal her involvement in other right-wing campaigns. In October 2022, she took part in a rally outside the Miami-Dade School Board offices with Citizens Defending Freedom (CCDF), a conservative advocacy group described by its critics as \"Christian nationalist\". CCDF is linked to the Turning Point USA and Alliance Defending Freedom, the right-wing group beyond numerous anti-LGBT bills across the U.S.\n\nSalinas attended the protest wearing a black t-shirt with the words \"American Patriot' emblazoned across it.\n\nSalinas' complaints against Gorman's book are characteristic of a wave of attempted book bans across the country, spearheaded by conservative groups and a cohort of hyper-zealous activists; a May analysis by the Washington Post of 1,000 book challenges found that 11 people were responsible for most of the complaints.\n\nDespite her disdain for Gorman and Langston Hughes' poetry, there is one book for children that Salinas promotes on her social media: The Kid's Guide to Ron DeSantis by Mike Huckabee-available for just $1.\n\nkelly.weill@thedailybeast.com\n\nReporter-Researcher\n\nDecca.Muldowney@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

The loss we carry, a sea we must wade.\n\nWe've braved the belly of the beast. We've learned that quiet isn't always peace, And the norms and notions of what \"just is\" Isn't always justice.\n\nAnd yet the dawn is ours before we knew it. Somehow, we do it. Somehow we've weathered and witnessed A nation that isn't broken, but simply unfinished.\n\nWe, the successors of a country and a time Where a skinny Black girl, Descended from slaves and raised by a single mother, Can dream of becoming president, Only to find herself reciting for one.\n\nAnd yes, we are far from polished, far from pristine. But that doesn't mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect. We are striving to forge our union with purpose,\n\nTo compose a country committed To all cultures, colors, characters, And conditions of man. And so we lift our gazes not To what stands between us, But what stands before us. We close the divide, Because we know to put Our future first, we must first Put our differences aside.\n\nWe lay down our arms So we can reach out our arms to one another. We seek harm to none, and harmony for all.\n\nLet the globe, if nothing else, say this is true: That even as we grieved, we grew, That even as we hurt, we hoped, That even as we tired, we tried. That we'll forever be tied together. Victorious, Not because we will never again know defeat, But because we will never again sow division.\n\nScripture tells us to envision that: \"Everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree, And no one shall make them afraid.\" If we're to live up to our own time, then victory Won't lie in the blade, but in all the bridges we've made. That is the promised glade, The hill we climb, if only we dare it: Because being American is more than a pride we inherit- It's the past we step into, and how we repair it.\n\nWe've seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it, Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy. And this effort very nearly succeeded. But while democracy can be periodically delayed, It can never be permanently defeated.\n\nIn this truth, in this faith, we trust. For while we have our eyes on the future, History has its eyes on us.\n\nThis is the era of just redemption. We feared at its inception. We did not feel prepared to be the heirs Of such a terrifying hour. But within it we've found the power To author a new chapter, To offer hope and laughter to ourselves.\n\nSo while once we asked: How could we possibly prevail over catastrophe? Now we assert: How could catastrophe possibly prevail over us?\n\nWe will not march back to what was, But move to what shall be: A country that is bruised but whole, Benevolent but bold, Fierce and free.\n\nWe will not be turned around, Or interrupted by intimidation, Because we know our inaction and inertia Will be the inheritance of the next generation. Our blunders become their burdens. But one thing is certain: If we merge mercy with might, and might with right, Then love becomes our legacy, And change, our children's birthright.\n\nSo let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left. With every breath from my bronze- pounded chest, We will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one.\n\nWe will rise from the gold-limned hills of the West! We will rise from the windswept Northeast, where our forefathers first realized revolution! We will rise from the lake-rimmed cities of the Midwestern states! We will rise from the sunbaked South!\n\nWe will rebuild, reconcile, and recover, In every known nook of our nation, In every corner called our country, Our people, diverse and dutiful. We'll emerge, battered and beautiful.\n\nWhen day comes, we step out of the shade, Aflame and unafraid. The new dawn blooms as we free it, For there is always light, If only we're brave enough to see it, If only we're brave enough to be it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Poet Amanda Gorman, reading her poem \"The Hill We Climb\" at President Biden's inauguration in January 2021.

We are striving to forge our union with purpose,\n\nTo compose a country committed To all cultures, colors, characters, And conditions of man. And so we lift our gazes not To what stands between us, But what stands before us. We close the divide, Because we know to put Our future first, we must first Put our differences aside.\n\nWe lay down our arms So we can reach out our arms to one another. We seek harm to none, and harmony for all.\n\nLet the globe, if nothing else, say this is true: That even as we grieved, we grew, That even as we hurt, we hoped, That even as we tired, we tried. That we'll forever be tied together. Victorious, Not because we will never again know defeat, But because we will never again sow division.\n\nScripture tells us to envision that: \"Everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree, And no one shall make them afraid.\" If we're to live up to our own time, then victory Won't lie in the blade, but in all the bridges we've made. That is the promised glade, The hill we climb, if only we dare it: Because being American is more than a pride we inherit- It's the past we step into, and how we repair it.\n\nWe've seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it, Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy. And this effort very nearly succeeded. But while democracy can be periodically delayed, It can never be permanently defeated.\n\nIn this truth, in this faith, we trust. For while we have our eyes on the future, History has its eyes on us.\n\nThis is the era of just redemption. We feared at its inception. We did not feel prepared to be the heirs Of such a terrifying hour. But within it we've found the power To author a new chapter, To offer hope and laughter to ourselves.\n\nSo while once we asked: How could we possibly prevail over catastrophe? Now we assert: How could catastrophe possibly prevail over us?\n\nWe will not march back to what was, But move to what shall be: A country that is bruised but whole, Benevolent but bold, Fierce and free.\n\nWe will not be turned around, Or interrupted by intimidation, Because we know our inaction and inertia Will be the inheritance of the next generation. Our blunders become their burdens. But one thing is certain: If we merge mercy with might, and might with right, Then love becomes our legacy, And change, our children's birthright.\n\nSo let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left. With every breath from my bronze- pounded chest, We will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one.\n\nWe will rise from the gold-limned hills of the West! We will rise from the windswept Northeast, where our forefathers first realized revolution! We will rise from the lake-rimmed cities of the Midwestern states! We will rise from the sunbaked South!\n\nWe will rebuild, reconcile, and recover, In every known nook of our nation, In every corner called our country, Our people, diverse and dutiful. We'll emerge, battered and beautiful.\n\nWhen day comes, we step out of the shade, Aflame and unafraid. The new dawn blooms as we free it, For there is always light, If only we're brave enough to see it, If only we're brave enough to be it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Twenty-two-year-old Amanda Gorman, the youngest inaugural poet in U.S. history.\n\nThis is Democracy Now! , as we end our conversation with Dr. Cornel West, professor of the practice of public philosophy at Harvard University, and award-winning journalist Maria Hinojosa. In the last few minutes we have, Professor West, you were in Charlottesville, Virginia, when the Klan marched, when the white supremacists marched. Amanda was writing her poem through the riot, the white supremacist attack on the Capitol. Your final thoughts?\n\nCORNEL WEST : Just that we say to Brother Biden, you know, when he stood on the floor the Senate, November 18, 1993, and said, \"These young Black folk are predators on the street beyond the pale, to be taken out of society,\" if you're going to talk about empathy, you ought to extend your empathy to the cousins of the brilliant, visionary poet Amanda on that street. They're human beings, even when they're incarcerated. Extend your sympathy to the immigrants trying to make their way, often coming into a country that used to be theirs, our Mexican brothers. Extend your sympathy to poor, no matter what color, working-class, no matter what color - yes, Jewish folk hated in France, Palestinians hated on the West Bank. Where is your concrete empathy and compassion and acknowledging common humanity?\n\nThat's the kind of pressure that he's going have to expect from love warriors, freedom fighters,, like both myself and the Amanda Gormans, with memories of Sojourner Truth and Harriet Tubman and Toni Morrison, and John Coltrane's Love Supreme .\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : And, Maria, your final thoughts?\n\nMARIA HINOJOSA : Wow! Just also Frederick Douglass and Ida B. Wells, my founding fathers and founding mothers, right? That's why we do this.\n\nLook, the only thing that I - and I'm trying to stay inspired. I really am. Because, otherwise, what happens? So, we just have to realize that those of us who have this understanding of what democracy looks like got to deepen it. OK, sometimes you can chill. You've got to take a - you know, relax, whatever. I understand. But we deepen it. That's why I love being on with both you, Amy, who I've known for years, and Brother West, is because there's such a humanity here. And I think that if Joe Biden and Kamala can do something, it would be to actually try to humanize, as Cornel was saying, the brothers and sisters of our dear poet, of Amanda, of so many - right? - to humanize those who were not born here, like myself.\n\nSo, this is our challenge. As I tell my students - I'm about to start teaching any minute now at Barnard, and I'll tell my students: There are some days when you cannot, in fact, be that unifier. So don't try it on those days. On the days when you can have dialogue, yes. But you know what? At the same time now, maybe this isn't a time for that right now. Give ourselves a little bit of a break also to take critical pause for what we're seeing and to understand, finally, we are much stronger than we think. We never thought we could make it this far. But also, we did not all make it. We did not all make it. And so, for that, I'm very sorry.\n\nBut I'm looking at the sun, and I'm incredibly hopeful. Nature is what grounds me, and I hope it grounds the both of you, too - the three of you. It's been such a pleasure to be with all of you.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We thank you so much for being here on this post-inauguration broadcast, Maria Hinojosa, award-winning journalist, author and professor, and Dr. Cornel West, professor of the practice of public philosophy at Harvard University.\n\nDemocracy Now! is produced with Renée Feltz, Mike Burke, Deena Guzder, Libby Rainey, Nermeen Shaikh, María Taracena, Carla Wills, Tami Woronoff, Charina Nadura, Sam Alcoff, Tey-Marie Astudillo, John Hamilton, Robby Karran, Hany Massoud and Adriano Contreras.

La joven de 22 años leyó \"The Hill We Climb\" (La colina que escalamos), poema que terminó de escribir justo después de los disturbios en el edificio del Congreso a principios de este mes.\n\nPara ampliar esta información, vea el momento en que Amanda Gorman recita su poema y escuche los comentarios del profesor Cornel West y la reconocida periodista Maria Hinojosa.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Esto es Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, el informe de cuarentena. Soy Amy Goodman, con Nermeen Shaikh.\n\nUno de los momentos más notables de la ceremonia de investidura presidencial del miércoles 21 de enero fue el poema inaugural recitado por Amanda Gorman, de Los Ángeles, la poeta más joven que haya participado en una asunción presidencial  en la historia de Estados Unidos.  En 2014 fue elegida como la poeta joven laureada de Los Ángeles, a la edad de 16 años, y luego fue la primera persona en ser elegida como poeta joven laureada nacional. La joven de 22 años leyó el poema \"The Hill We Climb\" (La colina que escalamos),  el cual que terminó de escribir  justo después de los disturbios en el edificio del Congreso a principios de este mes. Sus palabras capturaron a la nación. Esta es Amanda Gorman.\n\nAMANDA GORMAN : Señor presidente, Dra. Biden, señora vicepresidenta, señor Emhoff, estadounidenses y el mundo.\n\nAl llegar el día nos preguntamos: \"¿Dónde hallar luz en esta oscuridad sin fin?\". La pérdida que llevamos, un océano por embestir.\n\nYa desafiamos el vientre de la bestia. Aprendimos que la calma no está siempre al borde de la paz, y que las normas y nociones de lo que es justicia no son siempre justas.\n\nPero aun antes de enterarnos, ya era nuestro el amanecer, y de alguna forma lo logramos. De alguna forma resistimos, presenciamos, una nación que no está rota, sino simplemente inacabada.\n\nNosotros, sucesores de un país y de una era en que una flaca joven negra, descendiente de esclavos y a quien criara una madre soltera, puede soñar con ser presidenta, solo para encontrarse recitando para uno.\n\nY sí, estamos lejos de ser pulidos e impolutos, pero eso no significa que nuestros esfuerzos busquen formar una unión perfecta. Mas sí luchamos para forjar un país con determinación, crear un país comprometido con todas las culturas, colores, características y condiciones del ser humano.\n\nY así levantamos la mirada, no para ver lo que nos separa, sino lo que está frente a nosotros. Cerramos esa brecha porque sabemos que si el futuro ha de ser prioridad, debemos dejar nuestras diferencias a un lado en primer lugar. Bajamos las armas para extender los brazos al otro. No buscamos daño para nadie, sí la armonía para todos.\n\nQue el mundo al menos diga que esto es cierto: que aún mientras lloramos, crecimos. Que aún en el dolor, hubo esperanza. Que aún en la fatiga, nos esforzamos. Que estaremos para siempre unidos y victoriosos, no porque nunca más conoceremos la derrota, sino porque nunca más sembraremos división.\n\nLa Escritura nos pide vislumbrar que \"cada uno se sentará bajo su propia vid, bajo su propia higuera, sin que nadie más le cause temor\". Si queremos estar a la altura de nuestro propio tiempo, entonces la victoria no provendrá de la espada sino de los puentes que construimos.\n\nEse es el claro prometido, la colina que escalamos  si nos atrevemos, porque ser estadounidense es más que un orgullo que heredamos. Es el pasado en el que irrumpimos y cómo lo reparamos.\n\nHemos visto una fuerza que destrozaría nuestra nación en lugar de compartirla; que destruiría nuestro país si ello retrasara la democracia. Este esfuerzo estuvo a punto de ser exitoso. Mas aunque puedan periódicamente retrasar la democracia, nunca podrán derrotarla de manera permanente. En esta verdad y fe confiamos, porque mientras nuestros ojos están puestos en el futuro, la historia tiene los suyos apuntando hacia nosotros.\n\nEsta es la era de la redención que temimos en sus inicios. No creímos estar listos para ser los herederos de tan aterrorizante hora, pero en ella encontramos el poder de escribir un capítulo nuevo, de ofrecernos esperanza y regocijo. Y mientras una vez nos preguntamos cómo podríamos siquiera prevalecer sobre la catástrofe, la pregunta ahora debe ser: \"¿Cómo podría la catástrofe prevalecer siquiera sobre nosotros?\n\nNo marcharemos hacia lo que fue, sino en dirección a lo que ha de ser: un país magullado pero entero, benevolente pero audaz, férreo y en libertad.\n\nNo vamos a retroceder ni nos dejaremos intimidar porque sabemos que nuestra inacción y nuestra inercia serán la herencia de las próximas generaciones. Nuestros errores serán sus cargas.\n\nPero una cosa es segura: si combinamos misericordia con poder, y el poder con lo correcto, entonces el amor será nuestro legado y el cambio, el derecho innato de nuestros hijos.\n\nAsí que entreguemos al futuro un país mejor que el que nos dejaron. Con cada aliento de mi pecho, martillado por el bronce, levantaremos el mundo herido hasta convertirlo en uno sublime. Nos levantaremos desde las colinas doradas del oeste. Desde el noreste jaspeado por el viento, donde nuestros antepasados lograron por primera vez la revolución. Nos levantaremos desde las ciudades bordeadas de lagos de los estados del medio oeste. Desde el sur bañado por el sol. Nos reconstruiremos, reconciliaremos y recuperaremos.\n\nEn cada rincón conocido de nuestra nación, en cada esquina de lo que llamamos país, nuestro pueblo, diverso y bello, emergerá ya magullado, ya hermoso. Al llegar el día, emergemos de la sombra llameantes y valerosos. El nuevo amanecer florece a medida que lo liberamos, pues la luz siempre existirá si tan solo nos arriesgamos a verla. Si tan solo nos arriesgamos a serla.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Amanda Gorman de veintidós años, la poeta más joven en participar en una investidura presidencial en la historia de Estados Unidos.\n\nEsto es Democracy Now! Vamos a concluir nuestra conversación con el Dr. Cornel West, profesor de Práctica de la Filosofía Pública en la Universidad de Harvard, y la galardonada periodista María Hinojosa. Profesor West, nos quedan un par de minutos. Usted estaba en Charlottesville, Virginia, cuando el Ku Klux Klan se manifestó, cuando se realizó la marcha de los supremacistas blancos. Amanda estaba escribiendo su poema durante los disturbios en el Capitolio, cuando los supremacistas blancos atacaron el edificio del Congreso. ¿Qué nos puede decir para finalizar?\n\nCORNEL WEST : Solo recordarle al hermano Biden que fue él quien dijo en el Senado, el 18 de noviembre de 1993: \"Estos jóvenes negros en las calles son depredadores sin límites y hay que removerlos de la sociedad\". Si va a hablar sobre la empatía, debería extenderla a los hermanos y hermanas de la brillante y visionaria poeta Amanda en esas mismas calles. Son seres humanos, incluso si están encarcelados. Extienda su simpatía a los inmigrantes que tratan de abrirse camino, muchos llegando a un país que en algún momento fue suyo, como nuestros hermanos mexicanos. Extienda su simpatía a los pobres sin importar su color, a la clase obrera, sí, no importa su color, el pueblo judío odiado en Francia, los palestinos odiados en Cisjordania. ¿Donde está su empatía y compasión concreta y el reconocer nuestra humanidad común?\n\nEse es el tipo de presión que va a tener que esperar de los guerreros del amor, luchadores por la libertad, como yo mismo y como Amanda Gorman, con la memoria de Sojourner Truth y Harriet Tubman y Toni Morrison, y el \"Love Supreme\" de John Coltrane.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Y, María, ¿su opinión para finalizar?\n\nMARIA HINOJOSA : ¡Oh! También Frederick Douglass e Ida B. Wells, mis padres fundadores y madres fundadoras. Por eso hacemos todo esto.\n\nLo único que yo diría... Estoy tratando de mantenerme inspirada, de verdad, porque, ¿qué pasa si no lo hago? Tenemos que darnos cuenta de que aquellos de nosotros que entendemos  lo que significa la democracia debemos profundizar en ella. Está bien poder relajarse a veces. Hay que tomar un momento para descansar, eso lo entiendo. Pero hay que ir más allá. Por eso me encanta estar en el programa con usted, Amy, a quien conozco desde hace años, y con el hermano West, porque hay tal humanidad aquí. Y creo que si Joe Biden y Kamala pueden hacer algo, sería realmente tratar de humanizar, como decía Cornel, a los hermanos y hermanas de nuestra querida poeta, de Amanda, de tantos otros, ¿verdad? Humanizar a quienes no nacieron aquí, como yo.\n\nEste es nuestro desafío. Como les digo a mis alumnos... Estoy a punto de empezar a enseñar en la Universidad de Barnard, y les diré a mis alumnos: Hay algunos días en que, de hecho, no podrán ser esa fuerza unificadora. Así que no lo intenten en esos días. En los dias en que el diáogo sea posible, sí. ¿Pero saben qué? De igual forma, ahora, tal vez no sea el momento adecuado para eso. Tomémonos un pequeño descanso para también hacer una pausa crítica por lo que estamos viendo y para entender, finalmente, que somos mucho más fuertes de lo que pensamos. Nunca pensamos que podríamos llegar tan lejos. Pero además, no todos lo logramos. No todos lo logramos. Y lo siento mucho por eso.\n\nPero veo que el sol sale y me llena de gran esperanza. La naturaleza me mantiene sensata, Y espero que a ustedes dos también. A los tres. Ha sido uno un placer enorme estar aquí con ustedes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Muchas gracias por estar en el programa de hoy, luego de la investidura presidencial.

She was 22 years old when she read \"The Hill We Climb,\" a poem she finished right after the insurrection at the Capitol on January 6. We continue our July Fourth special broadcast with Gorman's remarkable address.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We turn now to poet Amanda Gorman. She became the youngest inaugural poet in U.S. history when she spoke at the inauguration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. She was 22 years old when she read \"The Hill We Climb,\" a poem she finished right after the January 6th insurrection. This is Amanda Gorman.\n\nAMANDA GORMAN : Mr. President, Dr. Biden, Madam Vice President, Mr. Emhoff, Americans, and the World:\n\nWhen day comes, we ask ourselves: Where can we find light In this never-ending shade? The loss we carry, a sea we must wade.\n\nWe've braved the belly of the beast. We've learned that quiet isn't always peace, And the norms and notions of what \"just is\" Isn't always justice.\n\nAnd yet the dawn is ours before we knew it. Somehow, we do it. Somehow we've weathered and witnessed A nation that isn't broken, but simply unfinished.\n\nWe, the successors of a country and a time Where a skinny Black girl, Descended from slaves and raised by a single mother, Can dream of becoming president, Only to find herself reciting for one.\n\nAnd yes, we are far from polished, far from pristine. But that doesn't mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect. We are striving to forge our union with purpose,\n\nTo compose a country committed To all cultures, colors, characters, And conditions of man. And so we lift our gazes not To what stands between us, But what stands before us. We close the divide, Because we know to put Our future first, we must first Put our differences aside.\n\nWe lay down our arms So we can reach out our arms to one another. We seek harm to none, and harmony for all.\n\nLet the globe, if nothing else, say this is true: That even as we grieved, we grew, That even as we hurt, we hoped, That even as we tired, we tried. That we'll forever be tied together. Victorious, Not because we will never again know defeat, But because we will never again sow division.\n\nScripture tells us to envision that: \"Everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree, And no one shall make them afraid.\" If we're to live up to our own time, then victory Won't lie in the blade, but in all the bridges we've made. That is the promised glade, The hill we climb, if only we dare it: Because being American is more than a pride we inherit- It's the past we step into, and how we repair it.\n\nWe've seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it, Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy. And this effort very nearly succeeded. But while democracy can be periodically delayed, It can never be permanently defeated.\n\nIn this truth, in this faith, we trust. For while we have our eyes on the future, History has its eyes on us.\n\nThis is the era of just redemption. We feared at its inception. We did not feel prepared to be the heirs Of such a terrifying hour. But within it we've found the power To author a new chapter, To offer hope and laughter to ourselves.\n\nSo while once we asked: How could we possibly prevail over catastrophe? Now we assert: How could catastrophe possibly prevail over us?\n\nWe will not march back to what was, But move to what shall be: A country that is bruised but whole, Benevolent but bold, Fierce and free.\n\nWe will not be turned around, Or interrupted by intimidation, Because we know our inaction and inertia Will be the inheritance of the next generation. Our blunders become their burdens. But one thing is certain: If we merge mercy with might, and might with right, Then love becomes our legacy, And change, our children's birthright.\n\nSo let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left. With every breath from my bronze- pounded chest, We will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one.\n\nWe will rise from the gold-limned hills of the West! We will rise from the windswept Northeast, where our forefathers first realized revolution! We will rise from the lake-rimmed cities of the Midwestern states! We will rise from the sunbaked South!\n\nWe will rebuild, reconcile, and recover, In every known nook of our nation, In every corner called our country, Our people, diverse and dutiful. We'll emerge, battered and beautiful.\n\nWhen day comes, we step out of the shade, Aflame and unafraid. The new dawn blooms as we free it, For there is always light, If only we're brave enough to see it, If only we're brave enough to be it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Poet Amanda Gorman, reading her poem \"The Hill We Climb\" at President Biden's inauguration in January 2021. At 22, Amanda Gorman became the youngest inaugural poet.\n\nWhen we come back, we'll look at the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade .

      "text": "How Amanda Gorman became the voice of a new American era\n\nHer recital at Joe Biden's inauguration electrified viewers and sent the hitherto little known poet's work to the top of the charts\n\nO n Wednesday in Washington DC, a striking young woman stood at a podium on the steps of the US Capitol, surrounded by the country's leaders, who were masked against the pandemic. She was unmasked, at a safe distance, so she could speak with resonance and force, spreading her enthusiastic vision without danger. She radiated joy, conviction and purpose as she declaimed the poem she had written to mark the inauguration of Joe Biden as 46th president of the US: The Hill We Climb . Tears sprang from the eyes of many listeners, those weary and wary from four years of domestic discord, whether they sat on folding chairs at the Capitol, or on easy chairs in their homes. Hearing her words, they felt hope for the future.\n\nThat woman's name is Amanda Gorman . She is America's first national youth poet laureate and, at 22, she also is the youngest poet accorded the honour of delivering the presidential inaugural poem. But despite her youth, Gorman's assurance and bearing made her seem to stand outside time. Erect as a statue, her skin gleaming as if burnished, her hair cornrowed, banded with gold and drawn tightly back into a red satin Prada headband, worn high like a tiara, she evoked what poet Kae Tempest calls the \"Brand New Ancients\": the divinity that walks among us in the present day. According to Greek mythology, nine muses, daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne, inspire creative endeavour, with five devoted to different kinds of poetry - epic, romantic, lyric, comic or pastoral and sacred. Gorman suggested a new poetic muse - one to inspire the poetry of democracy.\n\nGorman told the New York Times that she had not wanted to dwell on the rancour, racism and division of America's four years under the Trump administration: she wanted to \"use my words to envision a way in which our country can still come together and can still heal\". That way would require action, her poem declares: \"We lift our gazes not to what stands between us, but what stands before us. We close the divide because we know to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside. We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another, we seek harm to none and harmony for all.\"\n\nGorman knows the importance of taking action to make the change you want to see. Raised in Los Angeles by a single mother, Joan Wicks, a middle-school English teacher, Gorman overcame daunting obstacles to forge her path. Amanda and her twin sister Gabrielle, an activist and filmmaker, were born prematurely. In kindergarten, the future poet was diagnosed with an auditory disorder that gave her a speech impediment. When she was in third grade, a teacher introduced her to poetry, and it was through writing and reciting poetry that she found her voice. She found a role model in the poet Maya Angelou, whose autobiography I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings reminded her of her own life, she remarked in one interview: \"[Angelou] overcame years of not speaking up for herself, all for the love of poetry.\"\n\nAs Gorman struggled to improve her spoken fluency, she also strove for social justice. For her, it was clear from the start that expression was to be both poetic and political. In 2014, at the age of 16, she founded a non-profit organisation to support poetry workshops and youth advocacy leadership skills, called One Pen One Page. The following year, she published her first poetry book, The One for Whom Food Is Not Enough, and went to Harvard to study sociology. (She graduated in 2020.) Her clarity of expression received a turbo boost from musical theatre while she was in college, with the arrival of Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical Hamilton, whose lyrics she memorised and recited (the song Aaron Burr, Sir helped her pronounce her \"R\"s, she has said).\n\nIn the spring of her sophomore year in 2017, she was named America's first national youth poet laureate, an honour that took her and her poetry to public events across the country. At one of these, held at the Library of Congress, Dr Jill Biden heard her read a poem she had written in the wake of the white supremacist \"Unite the Right\" march in Charlottesville, titled In This Place (An American Lyric). Three years later, Biden, as first lady-elect, suggested the young poet for the inaugural honour .\n\nIn the first week of January, Gorman was halfway through writing The Hill We Climb when a mob of angry Trump supporters invaded the US Capitol in an attempt to violently overturn the election result. She finished the poem in the hours after the melee, undeterred, with that jarring tumult as backdrop.\n\nOn inauguration day, Gorman wore a ring depicting a caged bird, a gift from Oprah Winfrey that attests to the link the young poet represents between the past and the future. It not only summoned thoughts of the poet's first inspiration, Angelou; it reminded anyone looking for portents that Angelou, as the US poet laureate , had also recited a poem to a new president on the Capitol steps: Bill Clinton, in 1993. One day, Gorman may be the audience, not the author, of such a poem: she has presidential plans. \"I am working on hashtags,\" she told the Harvard Gazette. \"Save the 2036 date on your iPhone calendar.\"\n\nThe last lines of The Hill We Climb, containing an intended echo of Miranda's Hamilton, constitute a poetic battle cry: \"We will rebuild, reconcile, and recover in every known nook of our nation in every corner called our country our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful, when the day comes we step out of the shade aflame and unafraid, the new dawn blooms as we free it, for there is always light if only we're brave enough to see it, if only we're brave enough to be it.\"\n\nHer words not only electrified Washington, they have prompted a surge of admiration in the public at large. That same day, her two forthcoming books were Amazon's top two bestsellers. Instagram feeds flash continuously with images of her triumphal stand at the Capitol; op-eds across the country have called for poetry education programmes in schools, and television news broadcast highlights of her performance hour after hour - lyric adrenaline bursts to reanimate democracy.\n\nGorman has appeared on many of these news programmes. On one, Good Morning America on ABC, Miranda made a surprise appearance to congratulate her. \"The right words in the right order can change the world; and you proved that yesterday,\" he told her. \"Keep changing the world, one word at a time.\"\n\nAs if anyone could stop her. As she writes in her forthcoming book, Change Sings:\n\nI can hear change humming In its loudest, proudest song. I don't fear change coming, And so I sing along."

      "text": "Amanda Gorman: 'I wanted my words to re-sanctify the steps of the Capitol'\n\nThe youngest presidential inaugural poet in US history on Toni Morrison, the power of language and her debut children's book\n\nMy earliest reading memory My mom bought me a Hooked on Phonics reading kit when I was in early elementary school. I quite literally got hooked on reading and raced through as much material as I could.\n\nThe book that influenced me growing up In third grade my teacher read us Dandelion Wine by Ray Bradbury. It was the first time I'd heard a metaphor in such a way, and my mind was blown. It was a watershed moment for the way I viewed the power of language.\n\nThe author who made me want to write In eighth grade, I read Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye . It's not a poem, but it informed my thinking on how poetic language can infuse itself into a novel. It was also the first time I had seen a dark-skinned girl on the cover of a book and that absolutely enthralled me. Reading Morrison taught me how to write unapologetically with a Black feminist voice that was my own.\n\nA moment that changed me It was such an honour to be chosen to perform at the inauguration of President Biden . Following in the footsteps of such legendary poets as Maya Angelou, Elizabeth Alexander and Richard Blanco was an amazing opportunity, but one that became even more critical after the Capitol insurrection . After that day, the vision of the poem I was crafting required a new level of depth. I wanted my words to re-sanctify the steps of the Capitol.\n\nThe poets who inspire me Poets and storytellers throughout history have often been the visionaries of change. Language makers are the ones who create a new dialect in which people can communicate shared dreams that challenge the status quo. Poets such as Maya Angelou, Tracy K Smith , and Eve Ewing have been a constant source of inspiration to me.\n\nMy favourite book as a child I loved Corduroy when I was little. It's such a sweet, classic tale of friendship, I couldn't help but want to be a better person.\n\nOn my debut picture book and what I hope it captures I started writing my own children's book Change Sings four years ago, while I was still a student. My hope was to craft a poem that would take young readers on a journey of self-discovery and ultimately empower them to see how they could become change-makers. Illustrator Loren Long took my abstract vision and gave it texture and light. I'm so proud of the mosaic of language and images that we made together.\n\nThe book that changed my mind Citizen by Claudia Rankine reshaped what I had assumed a lyric to mean. It expertly destabilised my preconceived notions of what a poem can look like, as well as how a sociological instinct can be so beautifully integrated into a work of art.\n\nThe book I reread I reread the Iliad this past year, which really hit differently this time. It's an epic tale about a plague that blights an army for their leader's chauvinism and short-sightedness. It felt close to home.\n\nThis article comes from Saturday, the new print magazine from the Guardian which combines the best features, culture, lifestyle and travel writing in one beautiful package. Available now in the UK and ROI.\n\nWhat I'm reading now I'm always reading and rereading books. Newer books I've been reading are Four Hundred Souls, edited by Ibram X Kendi and Keisha N Blain, What Happened To You by Bruce Perry and Oprah Winfrey, and Postcolonial Love Poem by Natalie Diaz.\n\nMy comfort read Shakespeare. There's nothing like a cup of hot cocoa and a copy of Othello or Hamlet while sitting by the fireplace.\n\nChange Sings: A Children's Anthem by Amanda Gorman, illustrated by Loren Long, will be published on 30 September by Puffin. Call Us What We Carry is published on 7 December by Chatto & Windus. To support the Guardian and the Observer, buy a copy at guardianbookshop.com . Delivery charges may apply."

We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another. We seek harm to none and harmony for all. Let the globe, if nothing else, say this is true: That even as we grieved, we grew. That even as we hurt, we hoped. That even as we tired, we tried. That we'll forever be tied together, victorious. Not because we will never again know defeat, but because we will never again sow division.\n\nScripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid. If we're to live up to our own time, then victory won't lie in the blade, but in all the bridges we've made. That is the promise to glade, the hill we climb, if only we dare. It's because being American is more than a pride we inherit. It's the past we step into and how we repair it. We've seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it. Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy. This effort very nearly succeeded. But while democracy can be periodically delayed, it can never be permanently defeated. In this truth, in this faith, we trust, for while we have our eyes on the future, history has its eyes on us. This is the era of just redemption. We feared it at its inception. We did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour, but within it, we found the power to author a new chapter, to offer hope and laughter to ourselves. So while once we asked, 'How could we possibly prevail over catastrophe?' now we assert, 'How could catastrophe possibly prevail over us?'\n\nWe will not march back to what was, but move to what shall be: A country that is bruised but whole, benevolent but bold, fierce and free. We will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation. Our blunders become their burdens. But one thing is certain: If we merge mercy with might, and might with right, then love becomes our legacy and change, our children's birthright.\n\nSo let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left. With every breath from my bronze-pounded chest, we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one. We will rise from the golden hills of the west. We will rise from the wind-swept north-east where our forefathers first realized revolution. We will rise from the lake-rimmed cities of the midwestern states. We will rise from the sun-baked south. We will rebuild, reconcile, and recover. In every known nook of our nation, in every corner called our country, our people, diverse and beautiful, will emerge, battered and beautiful. When day comes, we step out of the shade, aflame and unafraid. The new dawn blooms as we free it. For there is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it. If only we're brave enough to be it."

The red satin Prada headband she wore during the inauguration ceremony led to the item selling out, while her yellow coat (also Prada) caused searches for \"yellow coats\" to increase 1,328% (according to fashion search engine Lyst ) in the wake of her appearance.\n\n\"I'm a black woman with a powerful pen and a big heart, and I like my look to reflect that pride,\" Gorman told Harper's Bazaar, speaking about her love of style. She told the magazine she loves \"loud, regal-looking dresses embroidered with flowers - a nod, I think, to my Afro-flower-child upbringing in Los Angeles. I'm also a fan of Victor Glemaud's super stylish and comfy knitwear.\"\n\nThe signing of Gorman is seen as a shrewd one by fashion insiders. As labels struggle to adapt to the changes in the fashion industry as a result of the pandemic, Generation Z shoppers are disengaging with fashion labels who do not reflect their own social, political and environmental concerns.\n\nGorman, who founded the charity One Pen, One Page , which supports underprivileged young people through writing, is perfectly poised to be the face of a fashion label that would want to do more than sell a piece of clothing, but to connect on a deeper level with its customers.\n\nEarlier this month tennis player Naomi Osaka, who publicly made a stand against police brutality and racial injustice through her choice of face masks during tennis matches, became the face of Louis Vuitton. \"[She] represents her generation and is also a role model for everyone. Her career and convictions are inspiring,\" said Vuitton's creative director, Nicolas Ghesquière, in a statement .\n\nAt IMG Models , which also represents Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne and Ashley Graham, Gorman will \"be represented by the modelling agency for brand endorsements and other fashion-adjacent opportunities\", according to the industry publication The Business of Fashion . The appointment was praised by Gigi Hadid, who wrote in Instagram stories: \"Werk @amandasgorman @imgmodels faaaaam! Major.\""

      "text": "Amanda Gorman will be youngest poet to recite at a presidential inauguration\n\nThe 22-year-old will recite The Hill We Climb at Joe Biden's swearing-in on Wednesday, following in the footsteps of Robert Frost and Maya Angelou\n\nAmanda Gorman is set to become the sixth poet to perform at a presidential inauguration. At just 22, following in the footsteps of names including Robert Frost and Maya Angelou, she will also be the youngest.\n\nGorman, who was born and raised in Los Angeles and studied sociology at Harvard, became America's first-ever national youth poet laureate in 2017. According to US reports, it was president-elect Joe Biden's wife, Jill Biden, who recommended her as his inaugural poet. Gorman will be performing on Wednesday alongside Lady Gaga, who will be singing the American national anthem, and Jennifer Lopez.\n\nGorman's poem, The Hill We Climb, will touch on, although not reference directly, last week's riots in the US Capitol. She shared a short extract with the New York Times : \"We've seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it, / Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy. / And this effort very nearly succeeded. / But while democracy can be periodically delayed, / It can never be permanently defeated,\" she has written.\n\n\"I wasn't trying to write something in which those events were painted as an irregularity or different from an America that I know,\" she told the Los Angeles Times . \"America is messy. It's still in its early development of all that we can become. And I have to recognise that in the poem. I can't ignore that or erase it. And so, I crafted an inaugural poem that recognises these scars and these wounds. Hopefully, it will move us toward healing them.\"\n\nThe theme of Biden's inauguration is America United, and Gorman told the Associated Press that while she hadn't been told what to write by organisers, she'd been encouraged to emphasise unity as opposed to \"denigrating anyone\" or declaring \"ding, dong, the witch is dead\" over the departure of Donald Trump.\n\nGorman might be the youngest writer to grace a presidential inauguration, but she is not a stranger to grand ceremonies. In 2017, she read her poem In This Place (An American Lyric) at the inauguration of the 22nd US poet laureate, Tracy K Smith. The poem condemns the events in Charlottesville (\"tiki torches string a ring of flame / tight round the wrist of night\"), going on to speak of the importance of poetry as a form of resistance. \"Tyrants fear the poet. / Now that we know it / we can't blow it. / We owe it / to show it / not slow it / although it / hurts to sew it / when the world / skirts below it.\" She has also performed for luminaries including Al Gore, Hillary Clinton, Malala Yousafzai and Lin-Manuel Miranda.\n\nThe poet told the LA Times that she has struggled with since she was a child with a speech impediment that makes it hard for her to say certain sounds correctly. \"I don't look at my disability as a weakness,\" she said. \"It's made me the performer that I am and the storyteller that I strive to be. When you have to teach yourself how to say sounds, when you have to be highly concerned about pronunciation, it gives you a certain awareness of sonics, of the auditory experience.\"\n\nWith a children's book out later this year, Change Sings, illustrated by Loren Long and depicting a young girl on a musical journey to show that we all have the power to make changes in the world, Gorman has even bigger plans for her future. She told the New York Times in 2017 that she was planning to run for president in 2036, and this remains the plan. \"I'm going to tell Biden that I'll be back,\" she told the AP."

      "text": "Amanda Gorman at Biden's inauguration reminded me: politics needs poetry\n\nThe 22-year-old's poem was fervent and crafted. Now let's pay attention to young black voices on less glamorous stages\n\nO bama-endorsed and wearing gold-clipped braids and Oprah-gifted earrings, 22-year old poet Amanada Gorman and her poem The Hill We Climb have been the talking point of Biden's inauguration. Her five-minute poem, which started with the question \"When day comes we ask ourselves, where can we find light in this never-ending shade?\", explored grief, redemption and recovery, and wowed the world. Imperfect but fervent, it reminded us of something important: politics needs poetry.\n\nGorman, born in 1998 in Los Angeles and raised by a mother who works as a teacher, graduated from Harvard university in 2020. She was the first US national youth poet laureate and its youngest ever inaugural poet. Owing to a speech impediment, she couldn't pronounce the letter R until two years ago. She has described spoken word as \"my own type of pathology\". Praise has overflowed for the young poet and many have celebrated her passion, beauty and poise in this historic moment that closes the door on Trump. \"I honor you, @TheAmandaGorman. Thank you,\" wrote the daughter of Dr Martin Luther King Junior, Bernice King on Twitter.\n\nThe clips circulating on the internet of Gorman, glowing and optimistic, stand in utter contrast to scenes of Trump supporters storming the Capitol, grotesque and desperate. She wrote the remainder of the piece after the events of 6 January , staying up late to watch the storming the Capitol . The line: \"We've seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it\" speaks directly to the attempted derailment of democracy.\n\nOn Instagram, Gorman describes herself as a dreamer, and the line: \"Our people diverse and beautiful will emerge, battered and beautiful\" shows her faith - a young woman dreaming aloud before millions of people in the form of spoken word. The moment has gone viral. Spoken word is a craft and a powerful art form, from the cadence to the delivery, to the subtle choreography.\n\nThe moment, as internationally syndicated as it was, belongs to America. I don't necessarily desire to see a version of it reproduced should Keir Starmer ever be elected prime minister (nor for the poet to find inspiration in Winston Churchill speeches).\n\nAmerican politics' relationship to poetry has a deep legacy in its fight for justice. In 1861, Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, a poet and lecturer, wrote To the Union Savers of Cleveland, a poem about Sara Lucy Bagby, a woman who had escaped enslavement and was arrested and returned to her \"owner\" under the Fugitive Slave Act. Harper published the poem in abolitionist newspaper The Anti-Slavery Bugle , and addressed it fervently to the white people of Ohio, writing \"And your guilty, sin-cursed Union/ Shall be shaken to its base/ Till ye learn that simple justice/ Is the right of every race.\" Poetry has long been the platform for opposing the current condition. As Matt Sandler writes in The Black Romantic Revolution : \"Harper and her contemporaries borrowed and transformed the techniques and theories of Romanticism in an effort to bring about the end of slavery.\"\n\nPoets are vendors of aspiration and are always fashioning together depictions of a better tomorrow, but it's fair to ask if they are ever truly listened to in political spaces.\n\nMaya Angelou read her poem On the Pulse of Morning in 1993, at the inauguration of Bill Clinton. She says: \"Lift up your hearts/ Each new hour holds new chances/ For a new beginning./ Do not be wedded forever/ To fear, yoked eternally/ To brutishness./ The horizon leans forward,/ Offering you space to place new steps of change.\" Clinton would later go on to instigate the war on drugs and enact the 1994 Crime Bill that would destroy many lives and accelerate the incarceration of African Americans.\n\nI have wished many times to see more poets in positions of power, though writing poetry hasn't made presidents any less barbaric or kinder - as one might think a writer of similes would be. Obama published poems at 19 in a literary review, published in 1982 by Occidental College. Jimmy Carter was the first US president to write a book of poetry, Always a Reckoning, and Other Poems, in 1995. Neither of these men has clean hands.\n\nFor now, it's paramount that young poets be given the space, funding and opportunities to be the voices of their communities. They are often spokespeople for those who look and live like them. Don't wait until a black poet is on the world stage to be inspired by them - often they are not invited, and often they don't want to endorse state activities by engaging in such ceremonies.\n\nThose poems, performed on neighbourhood stages, sitting in anthologies and self-published books, showcased at slams and open mics, have the answers too. There are many young poets like Gorman, who have glistening ideas for tomorrow and deserve to be recognised and propelled into superstardom, or at least just read. Buy their books too.\n\nGorman was an alumnus of empowering youth projects such as Youth Speaks and Urban Word. If you fell in love with Gorman's inaugural poem, support your local equivalent too.\n\nThis is the archive of The Observer up until 21/04/2025.

There is something unifying in us being young and fresh-faced but, at the same time, we have become somewhat emblematic of our industries. We are the new generation - and you'd better watch out.\"\n\nGorman said that she hoped her Met Gala appearance would strengthen the bonds between fashion and literature. \"I think this is really groundbreaking. I'm even more enthusiastic to see all the other writers and poets who may grace that red carpet in the future.\"\n\nFollowing January's inauguration ceremony, Gorman became an influential figure in fashion. The red satin Prada headband she wore at the ceremony sold out and the yellow Prada coat saw searches for \"yellow coats\" increase by 1,328% according to fashion search engine Lyst . After signing with IMG Models , the same agency as Gigi and Bella Hadid, Gorman appeared on the cover of US Vogue's May issue, in a Ghanaian dress styled by Louis Vuitton designer Virgil Abloh. Writing on Instagram , the designer said Gorman's dress was inspired by a photograph of his Ghanaian grandmother, Madem Hellen Dei Ashie.\n\n\"I love playing with ways in which I can celebrate my Black heritage through fashion,\" Gorman said about her new fashion status. \"I made the intentional choice to wear my hair natural, to wear braids, to wear a headband as a point of pride.\"\n\nAfter being cancelled last year due to the pandemic, the Costume Institute's Met Gala returns this year in two parts. America: A Lexicon of Fashion, opens on 18 September and the second part, In America: An Anthology of Fashion, opens on 5 May next year. The New York Post reported that the rumoured guest list includes Beyoncé, Kim Kardashian, Jennifer Lopez and Venus Williams."

      "text": "Inaugural Poet Amanda Gorman Delivers Ode To America's Future\n\nReporter, HuffPost\n\nNational Youth Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman - at 22, the youngest inaugural poet in United States history - awed the crowd on Inauguration Day with a poem that emphasized unity in a wounded America and urged the nation to march onwards toward a new era.\n\nHer poem, an original work entitled \"The Hill We Climb,\" joins the compositions of other poets who have presided over presidential inaugurations, including Robert Frost - at John F. Kennedy's inauguration - and Maya Angelou - at the inauguration of Bill Clinton.\n\nSpeaking with The New York Times , Gorman called the poem \"probably one of the most important things I'll ever do in my career,\" and said that she had been halfway through writing it when pro-Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\n\"In my poem, I'm not going to in any way gloss over what we've seen over the past few weeks and, dare I say, the past few years,\" Gorman told the Times. \"But what I really aspire to do in the poem is to be able to use my words to envision a way in which our country can still come together and can still heal. It's doing that in a way that is not erasing or neglecting the harsh truths I think America needs to reconcile with.\"\n\nA partial transcription of Gorman's poem reads:\n\nWe will not march back to what was, but move to what shall be. A country that is bruised but whole, benevolent but bold, fierce and free. We will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation, because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation. Our blunders become their burdens, but one thing is certain. If we merge mercy with might, and might with right, then love becomes our legacy, and change our children's birthright. So let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left with.\n\nGorman, who hails from Los Angeles and was named the city's Youth Poet Laureate at age 16 and the country's first National Youth Poet Laureate three years later, had a speech impediment at a young age where she had difficulty pronouncing certain letters . She told NPR that helped fuel her love of poetry, since it gave her an \"arena in which I could express my thoughts freely.\"\n\nShe was contacted by the inaugural committee of President Joe Biden in December after Dr. Jill Biden watched a video of her delivering another original poem, \" In This Place: An American Lyric ,\" at the Library of Congress.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Abortion Activists Need to Win Back the Culture Before We Can Win Back the Court\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nMake abortion normal again.\n\nAn abortion rights activist holds a sign reading \"Compulsory pregnancy is abuse\" during a rally in Washington, D.C., on May 14, 2022.\n\nLet's face it: The legal strategy for saving abortion anywhere outside the bright blue states is over for now. Red-state legislatures are dominated by Republicans, and their districts are gerrymandered to keep it that way. Their attacks on Roe v. Wade have escalated from sniping to carpet-bombing. According to the Guttmacher Institute , of over 1,300 state restrictions since 1973, 44 percent were enacted in the last decade. More than 100 are from 2021, the most of any single year . In the first two months of 2022 alone, over 230 bills were filed in 39 legislatures.\n\nAn increasing number of state anti-abortion laws contain no exceptions for rape or incest. Utah may prohibit abortion even to save the mother's life . Fetal homicide laws in 38 states could make abortion murder. If the 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court endures, which it is likely to do, we cannot expect it to defend reproductive rights for the next 40 years.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThis does not mean that the reproductive justice movement should wave the white flag and abandon the 33.6 million women of reproductive age, plus all those who will be born with uteruses, in the 26 states poised to ban abortion. It does not mean that we should quit passing laws to protect it - and let the other side waste its money challenging them.\n\nIt means we must rejoin the culture wars. We'll know we have won when abortion is normal again.\n\nLegislation is a major weapon of the anti-abortion movement - of any movement. Still, the opponents of abortion have long recognized what feminists once knew: Legislation follows cultural change. Laws encode the zeitgeist, but they don't create it, and they're enforced only so long as the culture endorses them. Justice Samuel Alito's draft opinion overturning Roe v. Wade includes an appendix listing 51 abortion criminalization statutes, all but four dating to the mid-to-late 19th century and the latest passed in 1952 - approximately the end of history, as Alito sees it. But history - cultural change wrought by feminism - buried them all, even if they remained on the books. If they can now be disinterred and revivified, it is because the ground has been softened.\n\n\"If propaganda is as central to politics as I think, the opponents of legal abortion have been winning a psychological victory as important as their tangible goals,\" wrote Ellen Willis in 1979, six years after the Roe v. Wade ruling. \"Two years ago, abortion was almost always discussed in feminist terms-as a political issue affecting the condition of women,\" she continued. Since then, increasingly, \"the right-to-life movement has succeeded in getting the public and the media to see abortion as an abstract moral issue having solely to do with the rights of fetuses.\"\n\nIn fact, Willis's timeline starts a bit late. The National Right to Life Committee - then called the Right to Life League - was founded in 1967. By 1969 the movement had begun circulating its blood-and-gore pictures. One showed the product of a late-term abortion: a fetus at the bottom of a bucket, \"curled against the metal as though in nasty parody of a newborn tucked inside its cradle,\" writes Cynthia Gorney in \" Articles of Faith: A Frontline History of the Abortion Wars .\" Others were of the taut-skinned \"candy-apple babies\" of saline abortions or the severed fetal body parts extracted in suction procedures. In this first period of activism, the aim was to arouse disgust and pity - disgust at abortion doctors and their patients, pity for the fetuses they destroyed. \"Nobody could look directly at these pictures and launch into a speech about the right of women to do what they wished with their bodies,\" Gorney comments on the strategy.\n\nThe idea that fetuses were babies with a right to life also preceded Roe. In the 1971 case Rodgers v. Danforth, one of several legal actions challenging criminalization that would vie for Supreme Court review, the Missouri attorney general appointed a Catholic doctor as guardian ad litem for a class of infants the legal papers called \"children presently in existence but unborn.\" The group was rolled into one fictitious individual, Intervenor Defendant Infant Doe; the doctor's role, when mentioned in the press, was to \"defend the fetus.\"\n\nThe images of butchery repelled at least as many people as they moved toward anti-abortion activism. But the adorable Infant Doe, endowed with a sensate body and a sensitive consciousness, would carry the movement to where it is today. In 1970, an Oregon urologist photographed a formaldehyde-preserved 10-week-old fetus, with only its minuscule feet poking out between seemingly gargantuan fingers. The \"precious feet\" became an international pro-life symbol in 1979; today the search term produces nearly 4,000 results on Etsy for gold and silver lapel pins, necklaces, and charms. \"The Silent Scream,\" a 1984 Right to Life film , claimed to document the fetus's physical and emotional distress during abortion - at a stage long before it has a nervous system. \"Partial-birth abortion,\" coined in 1995, confounds a method of dilation and extraction used in second-trimester abortions with childbirth. Congress banned this medically approved procedure in 2003, and the Supreme Court upheld the law in 2007.\n\nThe \"fetal heartbeat\" - whose detection by ultrasound at around six weeks' gestation marks the end of legal abortion in many states - performs a similar rhetorical function. Renaming an embryo a fetus and describing as a \"heartbeat\" what Dr. Saima Aftab, medical director of fetal care at Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami, calls a \"flutter in the area that will become the future heart of the baby,\" the term turns a barely developed potential life into a recognizably babylike being. Whereas the \"precious feet\" signify something utterly dependent, \"fetal heartbeat\" conflates a sign of life with autonomous personhood. Since the leak of the draft Supreme Court opinion, abortion opponents have calmly entertained killing a mother to save a \"baby\" the size of a pomegranate seed. When they call this \"pro-life,\" they have hijacked the meanings of babies, killing, and human life itself.\n\nFor anyone not vigilantly resisting it, this language persuades. For instance, in a Pew poll released May 6, almost two-thirds of respondents said the statement \"Human life begins at conception, so a fetus is a person with rights\" described their views \"not too well or not well at all.\" In other words, Americans do not broadly believe that a fetus's interests are equal to or exceed those of its mother. Yet only 4 in 10 agreed that \"the decision to have an abortion should belong solely to the pregnant woman.\"\n\nTo whom should the decision belong? The doctor? The father? Marjorie Taylor Greene? Pew did not ask. But this tepid support for women's autonomy signals sympathy for the rising star of the drama: the fetus. Sympathetic or not, even Pew's researchers were affected by the religious right's disinformation. One question in the survey identifies six weeks' gestation as \"about when cardiac activity (sometimes called a fetal heartbeat) can be detected.\"\n\nCultural change is always contested. But once established, a zeitgeist is not only what we feel or think consciously. It's what we don't notice: what is normal, what does not alert the skepticism of a fact-checker. One of the arguments against the abortion bans is that they are out of step with the mainstream. But as the stream is diverted, the left drifts to the center, the center to the right, and the right off the edge of the Earth. The radical becomes unremarkable.\n\nThis drift can be observed in Louisiana. After the Alito leak, a bill was introduced in the Legislature to amend the state criminal code to define abortion as homicide, punishable by execution. \"No compromises,\" declared the Baptist pastor who co-authored the bill with Republican Rep. Danny McCormick. But some in Louisiana's anti-abortion community, while on board with the end, were queasy about the means. \"Our longstanding policy,\" read a press release from Right to Life Louisiana, \"is that abortion-vulnerable women should not be treated as criminals.\"\n\nAdvocates of choice found this hesitation encouraging. \"I am relieved that Louisiana Right to Life and the Louisiana Family Forum think the criminalization of pregnancy is one step too far,\" said Melissa Flournoy, board chair of the Coalition for Louisiana Progress and co-founder of 10,000 Women Louisiana. Only one step?\n\nIn fact, when it became clear that his bill would not survive floor debate intact, McCormick withdrew it. But no one had forfeited the prize. Louisiana's trigger law, in place since 2006, bans abortion if Roe is overturned. And speaking of drift, that prohibition has only one exception: to save the mother's life. The law was authored and signed by Democrats .\n\nIn 1973, with feminism in full flower, it felt as if the abortion wars were approaching an end, or at least a truce. But the religious right was mustering for more intense and wider combat, and when Ronald Reagan became president in 1981, it set about reshaping the culture in the image of the white, fundamentalist Christian, patriarchal family. At the same time, influential voices in the male left were denigrating the culture wars as a right-wing ruse to distract the working classes from the \"real\" economic issues. Everyday life - sexuality, reproduction, the family - was a boutique, \"women's\" issue.\n\nParadoxically, the political struggle to claw back abortion rights and advance reproductive justice means extracting pregnancy from politics and returning it to everyday life. Abortion is a normal part of the sexual lives of both people with uteruses and those without (May 14 rally sign: \"Men are responsible for 100% of unplanned pregnancies\"). Pregnant mothers experience the fetuses inside them variously - as part of their bodies, beloved children, parasitic invaders, or all three - but it is their experience. For many centuries, these facts were self-evident. Pregnancy was women's own business.\n\nA sign reads \"Vasectomy prevents abortions\" during a nationwide rally in support of abortion rights in Fort Worth, Texas, on May 14, 2022.\n\nRecapturing the reasonable does not entail speaking from the middle, however. Our propaganda, as as the poet Amanda Gorman puts it , must \"fight fire with feminism.\" It must be as emotionally powerful as the words and images that have brought us to where we are. Already there are good examples. We will need many more. The Democratic Socialists of America have adopted the no-bullshit second-wave slogan \"Free abortion on demand without apology.\" Sean Tipton of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine calls the anti-abortion movement \"the forced-birth movement.\" Rise Up 4 Abortion Rights, which organized a big rally in New York City, is promoting the slogan \"Forced Pregnancy is Female Enslavement.\"\n\nThe first slogan demands what we want, not what we think we can get. The second calls out the hard, corporeal tyranny of abortion criminalization. And the third? When I've seen placards with similar messages at recent marches, the effect was simultaneously thrilling and discomfiting. In 1982, No More Nice Girls, a street theater group of which I was a member, padded our bellies, draped ourselves in black cloth and chains, and unfurled a banner reading \"Forced pregnancy = Slavery.\" Some feminists of color objected. They felt the words trivialized chattel slavery. We stopped using it.\n\nShould we use it now? The more radical the religious right becomes, I think the more necessary it is to name what it is up to. The antis' post-Roe dystopia is one in which women happily surrender self-determination to the cause of making and caring for babies. No one will choose to be childless. The ultimate goal, says Jeanne Mancini , president of the March for Life Education and Defense Fund, is \"to make abortion unthinkable. To change hearts and minds so that women don't want the right of an abortion - the so-called right of abortion.\" This fantasy is oxymoronic: voluntary slavery. Let us call it what it is.\n\nThe late Pamela D. Bridgewater, an African American legal scholar and reproductive justice activist, suggests \"slavery\" is an apt description. In \" Breeding a Nation: Reproductive Slavery, the Thirteenth Amendment, and the Pursuit of Freedom ,\" published in 2014, she argued that compelling people to carry and birth babies they don't want constitutes \"involuntary servitude.\" Moreover, she claimed, in abolishing slavery, the 13th Amendment also abolished reproductive coercion, so fundamental was the practice of slave-breeding to the economy and human oppression of the institution. Under the 13th, therefore, state control over pregnancy and parenthood, including the criminalization of abortion, is unconstitutional. That contemporary reproductive abuses and injustices - substandard health care, disproportionate rates of maternal and infant morbidity and death, involuntary sterilization, criminalization of miscarriage, abortion bans - disproportionately afflict Black and brown people strengthens Bridgewater's argument.\n\nThe anti-abortion movement has made the normal perverse and the perverse normal. To restore to public thought and emotion the once self-evident understanding that pregnancy belongs to the pregnant, and only to them, feminists must do the radical work and use the radical language that will make abortion unremarkable again.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Scholastic Makes It Easy to Ban Black and LGBTQ+ Books\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nCaving to the far right, the children's book giant lets school book fairs exclude diverse titles en masse.\n\nPeople rally to protest state education policies outside City Hall on April 21, 2023, in Orlando, Fla.\n\nThe sweeping Republican effort to ban books from schools could not succeed solely on the backs of fervid state lawmakers and extremist school board members. Reactionary demands to censor books on topics ranging from Black history to LGBTQ+ existence have been abetted by the timid acquiescence of school districts, superintendents, and others in educational leadership. Now, Scholastic, the world's largest children's book publisher, has joined the constellation of parties tacitly aiding the GOP's suppressive agenda.\n\nFor its thousands of book fairs in elementary schools this year, the company has segregated books focusing on a huge array of topics and stories - fiction and nonfiction - that share little in common aside from not centering white, heterosexual experience. Books on Black identity, picture books with LGBTQ+ characters, stories of Indigenous history and migration, among others, have been grouped together in a collection under the cloying title \"Share Every Story, Celebrate Every Voice.\" School officials can then opt to exclude the entire section from their schools' book fairs in one fell swoop. As Judd Legum reported , one librarian called the option a \"bigot button.\"\n\nThe policy design bends toward censorship: Librarians are offered the choice to include the collection, but exclusion is the baseline. Book Riot, an independent book industry website, noted that Scholastic is \"the de facto school book fair provider\": a billion-dollar multinational corporation that hosts 120,000 book fairs in the United States each year. The scales of power do not weigh heavily on the publisher to bend so readily to far-right pressure.\n\nThe company has hardly been restrained in its selections: Titles up for en masse exclusion include nothing so radical as a biography of Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, a picture book about the late Rep. John Lewis , a collection of poems by National Youth Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman, and numerous kids' books that dare to show that LGBTQ+, Black, Indigenous, and disabled people exist. In previous years, such titles would have simply been mixed in with other offerings.\n\nBook bans have been a major front in the Republicans' Christo-nationalist refashioning of the education system. According to a report from PEN America, in the 2022 to 2023 school year there were 3,362 recorded instances of book bans in U.S. public school classrooms and libraries. \"Authors whose books are targeted are most frequently female, people of color, and/or LGBTQ+ individuals,\" the report noted. In the last two years, 15 states have passed legislation to ban books in all school grades that relate to some mangled notion of critical race theory or anything that challenges racism and introduces gender nonconformity. Similar bills have been proposed in more than a dozen states.\n\n\"Because Scholastic Book Fairs are invited into schools, where books can be purchased by kids on their own, these laws create an almost impossible dilemma,\" the company said in a statement published in response to criticism. \"[B]ack away from these titles or risk making teachers, librarians, and volunteers vulnerable to being fired, sued, or prosecuted.\"\n\nThe deflection to issues of teacher liability is a cheap abdication. As a powerful corporate enterprise, the publisher could throw its weight behind challenging book bans and defending imperiled teachers who fight for anti-racist education. Instead, it is making the enactment of reactionary laws easier. That a billion-dollar firm has not taken the righteous path comes as no shock.\n\nThe Scholastic Book Fair is promoted with signs in a hall at a public school in New York City on March 7, 2022 in New York City.\n\nScholastic's decision is all the more feeble given the weaknesses of the book ban laws and removal policies in question. The language of the laws themselves is extremely vague. For instance, Arizona bans \"instruction that presents any form of blame or judgment on the basis of race, ethnicity or sex.\" Florida is particularly expansive but no more specific, barring \"any training or instruction that 'espouses, promotes, advances, inculcates, or compels' belief in certain ideas about race, sex, color, or national origin.\" Arkansas legislation simply states that public institutions are barred from the \"teaching or training of divisive concepts.\"\n\nThe laws' ambiguity gives the state expansive leverage to reprimand and punish schools, librarians, and individual teachers should a prosecutor choose to apply the law aggressively. The imprecision, however, also gives educators and school officials more ground to push back - especially as fights against these laws continue in federal court.\n\nInstead, school districts have mostly responded with vigor in removing books from shelves. Teachers and librarians should not, of course, have to risk their livelihoods, and schools should not have to risk losing funding, in order to keep diverse books on shelves. But school districts (those not already under the yoke of extremists) and educational companies like Scholastic need not jump so readily through right-wing hoops. The progressive-lite ring of \"Share Every Story, Celebrate Every Voice\" does not drown out the fact that the billion-dollar company is offering up censorship on a platter.\n\nThe answer to the GOP's ideological warfare has never been to put our faith in private corporations like Scholastic to maintain kids' access to diverse reading material, just as Bud Light and Target will not carve the path for trans liberation by market-testing LGBTQ+ inclusivity.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nScholastic Book Fairs are themselves a reflection of an underfunded, unequal public school system, in which a private company sets up shop inside schools to sell to the parents and libraries that can afford to spend the money. \"School book fairs are a public display of disposable income,\" wrote Book Riot's Danika Ellis, \"it is school-sponsored consumption.\"\n\nBut for the sheer fact of offering books that tell stories beyond whiteness and gender conformity, Scholastic has - like Disney - drawn the ire of far-right zealots. Legum noted, \"In recent months, Scholastic has faced sustained criticism from Brave Books, a publisher created to counter 'the progressive agenda in so many of today's children's books.'\" The group plans to offer alternative book fairs to meet more reactionary tastes. Their titles include such dross as \"Elephants Are Not Birds,\" which teaches children that \"boys are not girls,\" by failing to understand how the constructs of gender, sex, and, indeed, language and meaning work.\n\nBrave Books are hardly a threat to Scholastic's near monopoly on school book fairs, but like every corporation erroneously branded \"woke,\" the publishers' commitment to social justice, even in its most tepid form, goes as far as it serves profit margins and no further. The \"Share Every Story\" bundle is a dodge, aiding book bans while keeping the market share for sales of texts celebrating diversity. If the company wants to protect teachers, librarians, and schools from the consequences of rightfully defying book bans, it can throw its money behind getting Christo-fascists out of office, or supporting lawsuits and legislation to stop book bans and protect educators who won't be coerced out of teaching inclusive titles.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

It's been a three-day blue-hued bender with influencers sipping \"Walz on the Beach\" cocktails at \"Hotties for Harris\" events while political speakers alternate between sassy oh-no-he-didn't jokes about Donald Trump and J. D. Vance and sappy odes to vague virtues (especially \"joy,\" the word of the moment).\n\nBut is barely nudging past Donald Trump in the polls in August really worth getting this crunk?\n\nLil Jon makes a surprise appearance at the #DNC for Georgia's roll call pic.twitter.com/okirJaGfqY\n\n- philip lewis (@Phil_Lewis_) August 21, 2024\n\nDemocrats have some cause for good cheer. Despite Joe Biden's hefty list of policy achievements early in his presidency, our octogenarian commander-in-chief resembled a mummified version of himself at the first presidential debate, and the party could no longer hide him away in a vault until he needed to make a speech. It's easy to forget that Wednesday marked only a month since Biden succumbed to pressure, withdrew from the presidential campaign via tweet, and then perfunctorily endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris, to take his place on the ticket. Ever since this bloodless coup, Democratic partisans have been riding an emotional high.\n\nIn some ways, it's like a honeymoon period, a burst of new relationship energy. But in other ways, it's more like the rekindling of an old flame. The vibe of Wednesday night's programming, to use the parlance of the times, was that the Democrats are still deeply in love with the Obamas. The fantasy on offer is that the Harris administration could be a reboot of sorts, with a wacky Minnesota dad as a beloved new supporting character.\n\nLast month's Republican National Convention was a mash-up of nostalgia for the mythical flag-faith-and-family days of yore and the testosterone-fueled mass spectacle of the '80s and '90s. But the DNC is on its own nostalgia tour: it's attempting to Make America 2008 Again.\n\nThere are even new posters by artist Shepard Fairey everywhere outside the convention, with Barack Obama's colorful \"Hope\" portrait palate swapped with Harris's and the word \"Forward.\"\n\n\"I have that 2008 feeling,\" North Carolina governor Roy Cooper told a crowd at a recent Harris event. \"I haven't seen anything like this since Obama was our nominee,\" Illinois governor J. B. Pritzker said. Brat summer is cooling. Get ready for Obama autumn.\n\nOn Tuesday, both Barack and Michelle returned to prime time to deliver rousing speeches that were heavy on emotion and calls for party and national unity but light on substance. Wednesday's programming resembled a trailer for one of the Obamas' many high-profile media projects. Their favorite celebrity pals made cameos, from John Legend performing Prince to Mindy Kaling and Oprah's happy reflections on good hangs with Harris and the Obamas.\n\nAmanda Gorman unironically quoted the title of Obama's memoir, The Audacity of Hope , in a line of a new poem she delivered onstage. Meanwhile, many featured speakers - Pete Buttigieg, Wes Moore, and Josh Shapiro - felt like younger men offering karaoke versions of Barack's soaring rhetorical style. That's especially true for Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro, who gives the impression of having endlessly rehearsed the ex-president's iconic past DNC speeches in the mirror.\n\nEven Bill Clinton's folksy-but-flimsy address doubled as an attempt to pass the Democratic Party elder statesman baton on to Obama.\n\nThe breaks and programmatic lulls were a time to sober up and realize that the Democrats in Chicago have few big policy goals to offer over the next four years.\n\nWhat is the Harris Doctrine exactly? Remember Medicare for All? In 2019, as Democrats scrambled to adjust around Bernie Sanders's presence in the primary field, Harris herself proclaimed that it was a \"human and civil right,\" but now it's all but off the table.\n\nA Green New Deal? Yeah, right. A cease-fire in Gaza? We'll see, but only if you stop raising a ruckus. But, hey, aren't you psyched about our subsidy program to incentivize corporate developers to build a small number of slightly-below-market-rate units? Let's hear it for removing medical debt from credit scores! No, we will not do anything drastic to eliminate the medical debt itself. Or the student debt, for that matter.\n\nThus far, the Harris campaign has hinted that it won't stray far from Biden's agenda, which was a surprising departure from Obamaism, focused on large public investments of the type Obama showed little interest in. Still, as Harris has brought back more Obama people into the fold, including his 2008 campaign manager, David Plouffe, it's hard not to imagine a halfway revival of the twilight of the neoliberal era.\n\nAt least Walz's record of progressive lawmaking in Minnesota is impressive, hinting at what could be achieved if Democrats had more gumption and a sense of urgency beyond defeating Trump. But on Wednesday, talk of Walz's record of good governance took a back seat to a kind of pep rally portraying him as Minnesota's real-life Ted Lasso. \"We love a dad in plaid,\" exclaimed Amy Klobuchar during her Walz warm-up act.\n\nIt was great to see Bernie Sanders as the Left's lion in winter, dusting off his truisms about the need to get big money out of politics, health care as a human right, strengthening unions, and raising the minimum wage. But then the DNC followed Bernie's speech up with J. B. Pritzker, who bragged on stage about being an actual billionaire, unlike Trump. Feel the Bern, indeed.\n\nDNC members held up a \"Stop Arming Israel\" banner while DNC delegates worked to block it with \"We Love Joe\" and \"USA\" signs.\n\nWild scene: pic.twitter.com/HEkgqiHQ4E\n\n- Ryan Grim (@ryangrim) August 20, 2024\n\nOne deeply telling DNC moment happened on Wednesday, broadcast only on social media. After Walz's concluding remarks, a group of protesters demanding a cease-fire in Gaza confronted conference-goers. They were angry that the DNC had refused the antiwar \"Uncommitted\" delegates' request for a Palestinian representative to speak this week. The protesters plead with conventioneers leaving the United Center, urgently making their case for allowing a Palestinian to speak.\n\nBut most of the Democratic Party faithful simply held their hands over their ears and walked away.

She follows in the footsteps of such luminaries as Maya Angelou , who spoke at former President Bill Clinton's inauguration, and Robert Frost who appeared at President Kennedy's.\n\nGorman had to overcome a speech impairment as a child just as President Joe Biden did. She recited a piece of work she concluded after the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. \"There is space for grief and horror and hope and unity, and I also hope that there is a breath for joy in the poem, because I do think we have a lot to celebrate at this inauguration,\" the Los Angeles native told The New York Times .\n\nThe poem is entitled \"The Hill We Climb\" and sends a powerful message of hope and unity in times of unprecedented division and \"a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it .\"\n\nThe poem begins simply, \"When day comes, we ask ourselves: Where can we find light in this never ending shade?\" Gorman recited. \"The loss we carry, a sea we must wade. We braved the belly of the beast.\" Referring to her own experience, she described the experience of \" when a skinny Black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president, only to find herself reciting for one.\"\n\nHer poem recounts the demands a country and a people have faced and yet,  \"Somehow we've weathered and witnessed/ A nation that isn't broken but simply unfinished.\" And she closed with: \"There is always light/if only we're brave enough to see it/ if only we're brave enough to be it.\"\n\nYou can read the whole poem here .\n\nI have never been prouder to see another young woman rise!

      "text": "A Look Back at 2021 in Photos, if You Can Bear It\n\nMark Murrmann December 28, 2021\n\nNate Gowdy\n\nWhatta year! Wooooo boy. Phew. Is it over yet?\n\nHere in the (very small, one-person) Mother Jones photo department, we naturally tend to think visually. As such, we rounded up a few dozen photos that stuck with us over the course of the year.\n\nSome events, like the January 6 Capitol riot and the California wildfires, are inherently visual and could easily fill an entire \"Best Photos\" post. Conversely, some incredibly important moments over the past year, like the Texas abortion law or the insanity that has erupted in school board meetings, just aren't quite as visual. So with that said, what follows isn't as much a selection of the best photos made over the year, but a selection of striking, if not surreal visual moments from 2021-from across politics, climate chaos, migration, racial justice, COVID, and more-made by a few of the many incredible photographers who are out there busting their asses.\n\nFor a number of reasons, this selection also focuses on domestic stories. There are so many important international stories-and exceptional photos that tell them. When we started pulling photos from Russia, Australia, Ethiopia, Chile, Myanmar, Brazil, Ukraine, Greece...well, it got to be a lot. We had to focus.\n\nWith all that in mind, here's to another year of amazing photos of sometimes awful things, and awesome photos of triumphant moments, too.\n\nBefore rioters stormed the Capitol building on January 6, they rallied on the Ellipse in support of Donald Trump at the Save America March.\n\nMark Peterson/Redux\n\nNearly a week after the pro-Trump insurrectionist mob breached the Capitol, members of the National Guard were sleeping in its halls, as the House of Representatives convened to impeach Trump for a second time.\n\nKent Nishimura/Los Angeles Times/Getty\n\nOne of the most memorable speakers at Joe Biden's inauguration on January 20 was Youth Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman, who delivered her now-famous poem \"The Hill We Climb.\"\n\nAlex Wong/Getty\n\nCOVID continued to disrupt tradition and routine, with Biden conducting a virtual swearing in ceremony of political appointees from the State Dining Room of the White House.\n\nEvan Vucci/AP\n\nRep.

She follows in the footsteps of such luminaries as Maya Angelou , who spoke at former President Bill Clinton's inauguration, and Robert Frost who appeared at President Kennedy's.\n\nGorman had to overcome a speech impairment as a child just as President Joe Biden did. She recited a piece of work she concluded after the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. \"There is space for grief and horror and hope and unity, and I also hope that there is a breath for joy in the poem, because I do think we have a lot to celebrate at this inauguration,\" the Los Angeles native told The New York Times .\n\nThe poem is entitled \"The Hill We Climb\" and sends a powerful message of hope and unity in times of unprecedented division and \"a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it .\"\n\nThe poem begins simply, \"When day comes, we ask ourselves: Where can we find light in this never ending shade?\" Gorman recited. \"The loss we carry, a sea we must wade. We braved the belly of the beast.\" Referring to her own experience, she described the experience of \" when a skinny Black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president, only to find herself reciting for one.\"\n\nHer poem recounts the demands a country and a people have faced and yet,  \"Somehow we've weathered and witnessed/ A nation that isn't broken but simply unfinished.\" And she closed with: \"There is always light/if only we're brave enough to see it/ if only we're brave enough to be it.\"\n\nYou can read the whole poem here .\n\nI have never been prouder to see another young woman rise!

      "text": "A Look Back at 2021 in Photos, if You Can Bear It\n\nMark Murrmann December 28, 2021\n\nNate Gowdy\n\nWhatta year! Wooooo boy. Phew. Is it over yet?\n\nHere in the (very small, one-person) Mother Jones photo department, we naturally tend to think visually. As such, we rounded up a few dozen photos that stuck with us over the course of the year.\n\nSome events, like the January 6 Capitol riot and the California wildfires, are inherently visual and could easily fill an entire \"Best Photos\" post. Conversely, some incredibly important moments over the past year, like the Texas abortion law or the insanity that has erupted in school board meetings, just aren't quite as visual. So with that said, what follows isn't as much a selection of the best photos made over the year, but a selection of striking, if not surreal visual moments from 2021-from across politics, climate chaos, migration, racial justice, COVID, and more-made by a few of the many incredible photographers who are out there busting their asses.\n\nFor a number of reasons, this selection also focuses on domestic stories. There are so many important international stories-and exceptional photos that tell them. When we started pulling photos from Russia, Australia, Ethiopia, Chile, Myanmar, Brazil, Ukraine, Greece...well, it got to be a lot. We had to focus.\n\nWith all that in mind, here's to another year of amazing photos of sometimes awful things, and awesome photos of triumphant moments, too.\n\nBefore rioters stormed the Capitol building on January 6, they rallied on the Ellipse in support of Donald Trump at the Save America March.\n\nMark Peterson/Redux\n\nNearly a week after the pro-Trump insurrectionist mob breached the Capitol, members of the National Guard were sleeping in its halls, as the House of Representatives convened to impeach Trump for a second time.\n\nKent Nishimura/Los Angeles Times/Getty\n\nOne of the most memorable speakers at Joe Biden's inauguration on January 20 was Youth Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman, who delivered her now-famous poem \"The Hill We Climb.\"\n\nAlex Wong/Getty\n\nCOVID continued to disrupt tradition and routine, with Biden conducting a virtual swearing in ceremony of political appointees from the State Dining Room of the White House.\n\nEvan Vucci/AP\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) set the tone for her year of dangerous antics by showing up to take her oath of office wearing a \"Trump Won\" face mask.\n\nErin Scott/Pool/AP\n\nSen. Joe Manchin, (D-W.Va.) was the center of the congressional universe this year, wielding immense power in the evenly divided Senate, and, of course, over Biden's sweeping agenda. Most recently, \" President Manchin \" torpedoed the massive Build Back Better bill. He's pictured here back in January, arriving for the Senate Armed Services Committee confirmation hearing for Lloyd Austin, now the defense secretary.\n\nTom Williams/CQ Roll Call/AP\n\nTexas suffered from a massive winter storm in February, covering the Alamo in snow and creating catastrophic conditions across the state, where millions of customers lost power and more than 200 people died .\n\nWilliam Luther/San Antonio Express-News/Zuma\n\nPatients wait in the observation area after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at the Lumen Field Event Center in Seattle in April.\n\nPaul Christian Gordon/Zuma\n\nMotorists wind their way through the parking lot at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles to get a coronavirus vaccine.

Lee is removed from Monument Avenue in Richmond, Virginia, on September 8. This followed the removal of hundreds of confederate monuments over the past few years, including in June of Charlottesville's Lee statue , which was the focal point of 2017's Unite the Right rally.\n\nRyan M. Kelly/AFP/Getty\n\nA man walks near a \"General Lee car\" that was damaged by Hurricane Ida, which made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane in early September in Louisiana and brought flooding, wind damage, and power outages along the Gulf Coast.\n\nSean Rayford/Getty\n\nA home near Chauvin, Louisiana, was blown off its foundation and submerged in water after Hurricane Ida in September.\n\nMark Felix/Bloomberg/Getty\n\nLake Oroville, California's second largest water reservoir (2,359,720 acre-feet), was at historically low levels-just 23 percent capacity-as of September 1. Lake Oroville is a key source for collecting and delivering large amounts of water through the Central Valley and into the Sacramento River Delta, where the California State Water Project (aka., California Aqueduct) begins, moving water to Southern California and all regions in between.\n\nGeorge Rose/Getty\n\nHaitian immigrants cross the Rio Grande from Del Rio, Texas, back into Mexico on September 20.

Sunisa Lee is the first Hmong American and first Asian woman to win the Olympic gymnastics all-around title.\n\nElizabeth Flores/Star Tribune/AP\n\nNaomi Osaka plays during the US Open Tennis tournament. She would later withdraw from the competition, saying , \"When I win I don't feel happy, I feel more like a relief. And then when I lose I feel very sad. And I don't think that's normal.\" Earlier in the year, Osaka withdrew from the French Open, citing mental health concerns.\n\nEd Jones/AFP/Getty\n\nWashington Metropolitan Police Department officer Michael Fanone listens to testimony during the House select committee hearing on the January 6 attack on Capitol Hill.\n\n\"I was at risk of being stripped of and killed with my own firearm as I heard chants of 'Kill him with his own gun.' I can still hear those words in my head,\" Fanone told the committee in his haunting testimony. Fanone retired from the police force in December. Andrew Harnik/Pool/AP\n\nSupporters of pop star Britney Spears participate in a #FreeBritney rally at DC's Lincoln Memorial in July.

Students and teachers were required to wear masks in the classroom but not outside.\n\nPaul Bersebach/MediaNews Group/Orange County Register/Getty\n\nContainers are stacked up on Terminal Island in the Port of Long Beach in Long Beach, California.

      "text": "Poet Amanda Gorman Won the Inauguration\n\nTwenty-two-year-old Amanda Gorman just made history as the sixth and the youngest poet to perform at a presidential inauguration in the history of the United States. She follows in the footsteps of such luminaries as Maya Angelou , who spoke at former President Bill Clinton's inauguration, and Robert Frost who appeared at President Kennedy's.\n\nGorman had to overcome a speech impairment as a child just as President Joe Biden did. She recited a piece of work she concluded after the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. \"There is space for grief and horror and hope and unity, and I also hope that there is a breath for joy in the poem, because I do think we have a lot to celebrate at this inauguration,\" the Los Angeles native told The New York Times .\n\nThe poem is entitled \"The Hill We Climb\" and sends a powerful message of hope and unity in times of unprecedented division and \"a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it .\"\n\nThe poem begins simply, \"When day comes, we ask ourselves: Where can we find light in this never ending shade?\" Gorman recited. \"The loss we carry, a sea we must wade. We braved the belly of the beast.\" Referring to her own experience, she described the experience of \" when a skinny Black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president, only to find herself reciting for one.\"\n\nHer poem recounts the demands a country and a people have faced and yet,  \"Somehow we've weathered and witnessed/ A nation that isn't broken but simply unfinished.\" And she closed with: \"There is always light/if only we're brave enough to see it/ if only we're brave enough to be it.\"\n\nYou can read the whole poem here .\n\nI have never been prouder to see another young woman rise!

The stakes are higher this year, given the novel coronavirus pandemic and all the struggles that accompanied the crisis. The United Nations set this year's International Women's Day theme as, \" Women in leadership: Achieving an equal future in a Covid-19 world .\"\n\n\"Women stand at the front lines of the Covid-19 crisis, as health care workers, caregivers, innovators, community organizers and as some of the most exemplary and effective national leaders in combating the pandemic,\" according to the UN . \"The crisis has highlighted both the centrality of their contributions and the disproportionate burdens that women carry.\"\n\nRELATED: On International Women's Day, let's remember 'as much as women are succeeding, they are struggling'\n\nThe day also raises a call to accelerate gender parity. Today, nearly 60 percent of women around the world work in the informal economy, earning less, saving less and at risk of falling into poverty, according to the UN. Furthermore, the organization notes women earn 23 percent less than men globally and occupy only about a quarter of parliamentary seats worldwide.\n\nThere are countless women around the world who are fighting to make change and lay the groundwork for a brighter future. Here are just a few of worth celebrating on International Women's Day.\n\nJust recently, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala made history by becoming the World Trade Organization's first African and female leader. Okonjo-Iweala told NPR that she looks forward to \"working with members to shape and implement the policy responses we need to get the global economy going again.\" Previously, Okonjo-Iweala spent 25 years with the World Bank and two terms as Nigerian Finance Minister.\n\nAt the young age of 25, Avesta Rastan, who lives in California and is of Iranian and Canadian heritage, used her talents in creating infographics to show the world exactly how Covid-19 affects the body. As a member of the Association of Medical Illustrators, she used her training in pathological illustration, or the drawing of disease, to create an infographic that quickly went viral . The infographic is now available to download in 18 languages on her website .\n\nBy now, everyone is all too familiar with COVID-19, but do you understand how it actually affects your body? I made this poster to try to summarize the main events that occur following infection. I hope you learn something! #sciart #scicomm #coronavirus #covid19 pic.twitter.com/j3Kr47pNY1\n\n\"Science communication is so key to society,\" Rastan told BBC . \"When you understand something, you're empowered to try to change it or to mitigate the risk.\"\n\nJacinda Ardern, Prime Minister of New Zealand, has been praised for her response and swift steps to minimize the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. \"Ardern, 40, stands almost alone as having all but eradicated community transmission of Covid-19,\" reported NBC News . \"While the coronavirus rages elsewhere, New Zealand has become something of a parallel universe where lockdowns, masks and social distancing are no longer necessary.\" Ardern has taken many positive steps to help make strides in New Zealand, from implementing environmental measures to combat climate change to providing New Zealand schools with free sanitary products to overcome period poverty .\n\nAmanda Gorman, a 22-year-old Harvard graduate, became the youngest inaugural poet in U.S. history during President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris' inauguration. She delivered an original poem, \"The Hill We Climb,\" that stated the need for unity and healing in the nation. In her poem, she shared profound statements , such as, \"It's because being American is more than a pride we inherit. It's the past we step into and how we repair it.\"\n\nBibi La Luz Gonzalez, founder of Eat Better Wa'ik , a not-for-profit in Guatemala, is on a mission to fight malnutrition through education and economics. She focuses on middle to low-income urban families in Guatemala by helping parents make informed decisions about the food and nutrients they consume and feed to their children.\n\nLast year, she was named a pandemic hero for providing healthy and nutritious food baskets to rural and urban communities. She has reached more than 8,000 students in Central and North America through healthy meals while advocating for food security, climate sustainability and human rights.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

At this point - days after 19 children were killed at an elementary school and nearly two weeks after 10 Black shoppers were gunned down at a grocery store - we all have. At times the grief is so thick that it's palpable, hopelessness reigns and it's difficult to make sense of another tragedy as predictable and preventable as the one we're facing. Yet, as Toni Morrison wrote in a canonical piece for \" The Nation ,\" moments such as these are \"precisely the time when artists go to work-not when everything is fine, but in times of dread.\"\n\nAmanda Gorman, America's inaugural National Youth Poet Laureate, has lived through an endless onslaught of mass shootings. We all have.\n\nGorman knows full well what her art summons her to do: to use words as a salve, as a rallying cry, to pull us out of a grief-induced slumber and paint for us a picture of a future without gun violence. On Wednesday, she tweeted a poem she'd written in response to our latest national shame:\n\n\"Schools scared to death\n\nThe truth is, one education under desks,\n\nStooped low from bullets;\n\nThat plunge when we ask\n\nWhere our children\n\nShall live\n\n& how\n\n& if\"\n\nIn a subsequent tweet , she asked a question that should shake our collective conscience, if we have one in this country teetering on authoritarianism and minority rule : \"What might we be if only we tried? What might we become if only we'd listen?\"\n\nWhat might we be if only we tried. What might we become if only we'd listen.\n\nIn her simple, graceful way, Gorman - alongside others who are ringing the alarm about our national gun violence crisis - is calling us to action at a time when inaction seems likely. There aren't words for the carnage and trauma facing Uvalde, Texas , a small town of about 16,000 people near the U.S.-Mexico border. Today, there are 21 fewer people among them - 19 of them children, two of them educators - after a mass shooter, whom I will not name , opened fire at Robb Elementary School. While the shooter's motivations remain unclear - and will likely remain so given that he was fatally shot on the scene - Uvalde joins a long, tragic sequence of mass killings that have a single feature in common: guns.\n\nListing those mass tragedies threatens to desensitize us: Buffalo, 10 dead ; Pulse Nightclub, 49 dead ; Las Vegas, 58 dead ; Stoneman Douglas High School, 17 dead ; Columbine High School, 13 dead ; Aurora, 12 dead ; and, of course, Sandy Hook , 27 dead - 20 of them first graders. It should always shock us that a gunman opened fire on first graders, their mouths still full of baby teeth, their fingers still being held up to assist their counting, their little bodies still desperate for naps after school. But Sandy Hook didn't shock us enough, and now, we have Uvalde, where 19 children didn't return home.\n\nMass shooters have different motivations, different backgrounds and different traumas, but they're connected through a shared, uniquely American, ability to acquire enough firepower to achieve their murderous aim. And once again, as Gorman highlights in her powerful poem, we're watching children - the most vulnerable among us - being treated as collateral damage in a death cult that prioritizes unchecked power above our collective safety. It's bad enough that adults aren't safe in movie theaters, grocery stores, concerts and nightclubs, but children being targeted in schools, the very place where they're supposed to be the safest, should rattle us all to our cores. They've been taught to huddle under desks, but so have the shooters targeting them, so what shall we do? Accept this as an unmovable reality? Gorman would argue otherwise. Morrison would, too.\n\nA different world requires imagination. It requires treating hope as a discipline, a phrase that prison abolitionist Mariame Kaba has brought into our consciousness. It requires faith. It requires community investment. It requires much more than voting, though, of course, casting a ballot can be a tool in the arsenal of community engagement. It requires bravery in the face of rampant cowardice. We know instinctively that we don't have to live in a world where mass shootings are as routine as parents packing lunches every morning, but we also know the roadblock that prevents action proven to curtail most mass shootings : conservative politicians, most of whom don't act as if democracy is a viable form of government.\n\nConservatives are unwilling to name as the culprit our nearly unfettered access to firearms without universal background checks.\n\nBecause conservatives are unwilling to name as the culprit our nearly unfettered access to firearms without universal background checks, we're doomed to repeat this nightmare until there's enough political momentum to change the reality. In the few days since the shooter killed 21 people, we've heard calls for better mental health services coming from the same Texas officials who nixed $211 million from the Texas agency overseeing mental health programs. Then they say, \"Let's arm teachers!\" The same teachers who aren't even given the authority to dictate their own curriculum . \"Let's put armed guards in schools!\" doesn't hold up to scrutiny , as we've seen in the wake of Uvalde. Neither of those proposals would be effective. And speaking of ineffective, on the other side of the aisle, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has signaled that there isn't much to be done except hope that Democrats turn out big in the midterm elections in November.\n\nPoliticians will not save us, not when they're more committed to holding onto power than telling the truth, but that doesn't mean we can't continue to organize, to hold those politicians accountable and to believe that a different future is possible. Our children aren't expendable. They should get the opportunity to reach adulthood, whatever it takes to get them there. Amid this endless sea of grief, we should step away to care for ourselves and then return to continue the fight, lest we, our grandparents or our children face a similar fate. We must keep putting one foot in front of the other until we see the scales tip in the direction of justice - not just enacting gun-control measures, but decriminalizing abortion , forgiving student loans and creating a more humane immigration process , all policies that most Americans support.\n\nThat same hope fueled abolitionists when ending slavery seemed impossible. That same hope fueled suffragists, civil rights movement activists, labor organizers, members of the Black Freedom Movement - and it will carry us through now. It's not an individual effort; it's a collective one, and artists like Gorman are essential to capturing that vision and spreading it to the masses. Or, as Morrison said so poignantly, so beautifully, \"I know the world is bruised and bleeding, and though it is important not to ignore its pain, it is also critical to refuse to succumb to its malevolence. Like failure, chaos contains information that can lead to knowledge-even wisdom. Like art.\"\n\nEvette Dionne is a culture journalist, critic and editor who writes extensively about pop culture as it relates to race, gender and size. \"Lifting as We Climb: Black Women's Battle for the Ballot Box,\" her middle-grade nonfiction book, was nominated for a National Book Award and won a Coretta Scott King Honor award.

      "text": "We must emancipate U.S. kids from groups like Moms for Liberty\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nBy Ja'han Jones\n\nBacklash toward yet another report of educational censorship in Florida is helping shine light on the far-right group Moms for Liberty.\n\nThe Florida-based organization 's members often portray themselves as fierce \"mama bear\" types whose love for children is expressed through efforts to ban books and topics from school curricula . Often, news outlets will cover the group without mentioning its extremist DNA.\n\nBut fortunately, progressive watchdog Media Matters has reported on the organization's financial backing , its platforming of conservative extremists and conspiracy theorists , its members being a ccused of harassment and threats , and the group's rapid rise into a prominent organization touted by right-wing media, i ncluding Steve Bannon .\n\nTaken together, the reports offer strong evidence that raises questions about Moms for Liberty's origins and seem to expose the organization's extremist ties.\n\nI've been skeptical from the jump, particularly after Bannon claimed in 2021 (around when Moms for Liberty was founded) that protests against school curricula - which Moms for Liberty helped le a d - weren't being driven by right-wing conspiracy theorists, but rather by \"mainstream suburban moms.\"\n\nI t end not to believe Steve Bannon .\n\nOn Tuesday, Amanda Gorman added to my suspicion. In a righteous flurry of social media posts, the country's first National Youth Poet Laureate reacted to the news that a Miami-area parent had successfully pressured a school to restrict several books, in addition to the poem that Gorman famously delivered at Joe Biden's presidential inauguration.\n\nThe Miami Herald reported Monday that after the parent, Daily Salinas, complained about written works at her children's K-8 school in Miami-Dade County, a school committee determined that Gorman's poem, \"The Hill We Climb,\" and three other titles were \"better suited\" or \"more appropriate\" for older students and would be shelved in the middle school section of the school's media center. The other titles are \"The ABCs of Black History,\" \"Cuban Kids\" and \"Love to Langston.\"\n\nSalinas' attempt to have Gorman's poem banned complains it's \"not educational\" and that it \"indirectly\" contains \"hate messages.\" Specifically, the form cites these two pages:\n\nIn her response, Gorman highlighted a Twitter thread chock-full of photos appearing to show Salinas both working with Moms for Liberty and protesting alongside extremists linked to white nationalism - such as the Proud Boys' Enrique Tarrio, who this month was convicted of seditious conspiracy for his role in the violent Jan. 6 siege of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nIn a tweet Tuesday night, the Miami-Dade school system issued a response we've come to expect from book-banning districts these days, claiming Gorman's poem hadn't technically been banned since it's still available to middle school students. Of course, this ignores that the poem is still banned for many students at the school for no morally justifiable reason.\n\nGorman vowed to push back .\n\n\"Together, this is a hill we won't just climb, but a hill we will conquer,\" she tweeted .\n\nI agree. And part of the way we conquer this hill is by exposing groups like Moms for Liberty, whose true objectives Republicans try to shroud with talk of maternalism.\n\nAmerica's children deserve to be fully emancipated from such groups. And these self-proclaimed moms could use a timeout.\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger. He previously wrote The ReidOut Blog.

(Patrick Semansky / Getty Images)\n\nThis article is published as part of Covering Climate Now , a global consortium of news outlets strengthening coverage of the climate story. For there is always light If only we're brave enough to see it If only we're brave enough to be it. T hose are the closing words of \"The Hill We Climb,\" the stunning poem Amanda Gorman, the first youth poet laureate of the United States, delivered yesterday at the inauguration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. For those worried about climate change, the ever-shining light referenced in Gorman's poem was perhaps difficult to make out during Donald Trump's presidency. Now, a new day has dawned that brings great possibilities and equally great challenges. Biden ran on the strongest climate platform of any major presidential candidate in US history. He was pushed to that stance by his erstwhile rival Senator Bernie Sanders and pressure from a younger generation of activists who insist on centering economic, racial, and gender justice in climate policy. And to Biden's credit, he agreed to be pushed. Now, Biden has named a team of cabinet officials and aides who are experienced, diverse, and more committed to climate progress than their counterparts in any previous administration. Covering Climate Now A Silent Climate Majority Mark Hertsgaard and Kyle Pope The Game-Changing Truth That Could Save the Planet Damian Carrington Telemundo's Climate Commitment Mark Hertsgaard Biden and Harris have repeatedly described climate change as one of four intertwined crises-along with the Covid pandemic, the collapsed economy, and racial justice-that will be addressed by every part of the federal government. For example, Janet Yellen, Biden's nominee for treasury secretary-who has supported taxing carbon polluters and returning the proceeds to all Americans-said during her Senate confirmation hearing Tuesday that climate change is \"an existential threat\" to the US economy, and she pledged to appoint a \"very senior\" official to oversee her department's handling of the problem. The 180-degree reversal in US climate policy was also clear from the executive orders President Biden signed on the afternoon of his inauguration. The United States will rejoin the Paris Agreement. The Keystone XL pipeline, a landmark climate battle during the Obama years, will be canceled once and for all. And the Trump administration's weakening of regulations covering vehicle fuel efficiency, emissions of methane and other greenhouse gases, and other climate-related policies will be reviewed and likely overturned. (The day before Biden's inauguration, a federal court separately struck down Trump's attempt to weaken Obama's Clean Power Plan that will slashed emissions from electricity generation.)

Conventional wisdom inside the Beltway says there is little chance of passing transformative climate legislation. After all, Democrats have only a one-vote majority in the Senate, with Vice President Harris casting tie-breaking votes, while Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia has long been hostile to restricting coal and other fossil fuels. Nor do Republicans give any sign of abandoning their lockstep resistance to serious climate action. Current Issue View our current issue Politics is too full of surprises, though, to treat such predictions as prophecy. Upwards of 70 percent of US voters, including majorities among both Democrats and Republicans, now favor increased government spending on solar, wind, and other forms of renewable energy. If forced to take an up-or-down vote, how many members of Congress will oppose such broadly popular policies, especially if such clean energy provisions are included in a larger infrastructure bill, as Biden's \"Build Back Better\" strategy envisions? If Republicans do remain united behind a fossil fuel agenda, the possibilities for passing meaningful climate legislation-even significant portions of a Green New Deal-still might be greater than commonly assumed, as Geoff Dembicki reported in a must-read Vice article . Experts Dembicki interviewed said that \"many Green New Deal-style actions are still possible-making low carbon industries a key part of the pandemic stimulus, creating millions of green jobs, employing vast numbers of laid-off oil and gas workers, and moving much faster than before to clean electricity.\" These reforms will not come in \"single, sweeping piece of legislation\" the way some Green New Deal advocates imagine, said one expert. But sufficient bipartisan support is plausible for an array of measures that \"when you add them up are really big,\" said another. Overseas, Biden has a freer hand. Returning to the Paris Agreement is an essential first step, and Biden's commitment to climate action at home can dissolve some of the international skepticism fostered by previous US administrations. One often overlooked issue to watch: Will the Biden administration discourage international development banks and its own lending agencies, such as the US Export-Import Bank, from financing fossil fuel projects in developing economies in Asia, Africa, and South America? Another looming question: Will the United States under Biden join the European Union, Japan, Great Britain, Canada, and other leading greenhouse-gas emitters in formally declaring that humanity faces a \"climate emergency\"? For journalists, one thing is clear: Climate change will be a major story in Biden's first year as president. Biden and his aides have ambitious plans that will provide news peg after news peg. The need for well-informed and high-visibility coverage, told as often as possible through a human lens, could not be plainer. And there's nothing partisan in news outlets' meeting that need; it's about human survival.

Upwards of 70 percent of US voters, including majorities among both Democrats and Republicans, now favor increased government spending on solar, wind, and other forms of renewable energy. If forced to take an up-or-down vote, how many members of Congress will oppose such broadly popular policies, especially if such clean energy provisions are included in a larger infrastructure bill, as Biden's \"Build Back Better\" strategy envisions? If Republicans do remain united behind a fossil fuel agenda, the possibilities for passing meaningful climate legislation-even significant portions of a Green New Deal-still might be greater than commonly assumed, as Geoff Dembicki reported in a must-read Vice article . Experts Dembicki interviewed said that \"many Green New Deal-style actions are still possible-making low carbon industries a key part of the pandemic stimulus, creating millions of green jobs, employing vast numbers of laid-off oil and gas workers, and moving much faster than before to clean electricity.\" These reforms will not come in \"single, sweeping piece of legislation\" the way some Green New Deal advocates imagine, said one expert. But sufficient bipartisan support is plausible for an array of measures that \"when you add them up are really big,\" said another. Overseas, Biden has a freer hand. Returning to the Paris Agreement is an essential first step, and Biden's commitment to climate action at home can dissolve some of the international skepticism fostered by previous US administrations. One often overlooked issue to watch: Will the Biden administration discourage international development banks and its own lending agencies, such as the US Export-Import Bank, from financing fossil fuel projects in developing economies in Asia, Africa, and South America? Another looming question: Will the United States under Biden join the European Union, Japan, Great Britain, Canada, and other leading greenhouse-gas emitters in formally declaring that humanity faces a \"climate emergency\"? For journalists, one thing is clear: Climate change will be a major story in Biden's first year as president. Biden and his aides have ambitious plans that will provide news peg after news peg.

And the Trump administration's weakening of regulations covering vehicle fuel efficiency, emissions of methane and other greenhouse gases, and other climate-related policies will be reviewed and likely overturned. (The day before Biden's inauguration, a federal court separately struck down Trump's attempt to weaken Obama's Clean Power Plan that will slashed emissions from electricity generation.)

National Youth Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman described the day's significance: \"We've seen a force,\" she said , \"that would shatter our nation rather than share it, would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy. But while democracy can be periodically delayed, it can never be permanently defeated.\" Yet it would be a mistake to think the fight to preserve and revive our flawed democracy concluded on Inauguration Day. In fact, it has only begun. The Capitol siege was just the latest and most brazen instance of politicians' leading efforts to delay democracy when it threatens their power-by suppressing the votes of political opponents, giving corporate funding undue influence over the people's representatives, and structuring Congress so that favored factions can hold on to outsize power. This trend is growing even more dangerous now that the coronavirus pandemic has made voting even more difficult, and toxic lies about election fraud have fueled further voting restrictions. In the words of Representative John Sarbanes (D-Md.), \"this moment might be our last opportunity to shore up American democracy and prevent it from sliding further into a state of chaos, dysfunction, and billionaire-fueled minority rule.\" Fortunately, the new Congress is already fighting to restore democracy. One of the first bills before the new Senate-submitted as S. 1 to reflect its importance-will be Senator Jeff Merkley's (D-Ore.) For the People Act. The act is the Senate counterpart to the House's For the People Act, a sweeping piece of legislation spearheaded by Sarbanes and passed in 2019. Both versions of the legislation would implement automatic voter registration, expand same-day voter registration and institute early voting nationwide. Also awaiting a vote in the Senate is the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act , which would restore parts of the Voting Rights Act the Supreme Court struck down in 2013. Together, these bills would do more to protect and expand the right to vote than any legislation passed since the Great Society .

(Patrick Semansky / Getty Images)\n\nThis article is published as part of Covering Climate Now , a global consortium of news outlets strengthening coverage of the climate story. For there is always light If only we're brave enough to see it If only we're brave enough to be it. T hose are the closing words of \"The Hill We Climb,\" the stunning poem Amanda Gorman, the first youth poet laureate of the United States, delivered yesterday at the inauguration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. For those worried about climate change, the ever-shining light referenced in Gorman's poem was perhaps difficult to make out during Donald Trump's presidency. Now, a new day has dawned that brings great possibilities and equally great challenges. Biden ran on the strongest climate platform of any major presidential candidate in US history. He was pushed to that stance by his erstwhile rival Senator Bernie Sanders and pressure from a younger generation of activists who insist on centering economic, racial, and gender justice in climate policy. And to Biden's credit, he agreed to be pushed. Now, Biden has named a team of cabinet officials and aides who are experienced, diverse, and more committed to climate progress than their counterparts in any previous administration. Covering Climate Now A Silent Climate Majority Mark Hertsgaard and Kyle Pope The Game-Changing Truth That Could Save the Planet Damian Carrington Telemundo's Climate Commitment Mark Hertsgaard Biden and Harris have repeatedly described climate change as one of four intertwined crises-along with the Covid pandemic, the collapsed economy, and racial justice-that will be addressed by every part of the federal government. For example, Janet Yellen, Biden's nominee for treasury secretary-who has supported taxing carbon polluters and returning the proceeds to all Americans-said during her Senate confirmation hearing Tuesday that climate change is \"an existential threat\" to the US economy, and she pledged to appoint a \"very senior\" official to oversee her department's handling of the problem. The 180-degree reversal in US climate policy was also clear from the executive orders President Biden signed on the afternoon of his inauguration. The United States will rejoin the Paris Agreement. The Keystone XL pipeline, a landmark climate battle during the Obama years, will be canceled once and for all. And the Trump administration's weakening of regulations covering vehicle fuel efficiency, emissions of methane and other greenhouse gases, and other climate-related policies will be reviewed and likely overturned. (The day before Biden's inauguration, a federal court separately struck down Trump's attempt to weaken Obama's Clean Power Plan that will slashed emissions from electricity generation.)

Nor do Republicans give any sign of abandoning their lockstep resistance to serious climate action. Current Issue View our current issue Politics is too full of surprises, though, to treat such predictions as prophecy. Upwards of 70 percent of US voters, including majorities among both Democrats and Republicans, now favor increased government spending on solar, wind, and other forms of renewable energy.

If Republicans do remain united behind a fossil fuel agenda, the possibilities for passing meaningful climate legislation-even significant portions of a Green New Deal-still might be greater than commonly assumed, as Geoff Dembicki reported in a must-read Vice article . Experts Dembicki interviewed said that \"many Green New Deal-style actions are still possible-making low carbon industries a key part of the pandemic stimulus, creating millions of green jobs, employing vast numbers of laid-off oil and gas workers, and moving much faster than before to clean electricity.\" These reforms will not come in \"single, sweeping piece of legislation\" the way some Green New Deal advocates imagine, said one expert.

Returning to the Paris Agreement is an essential first step, and Biden's commitment to climate action at home can dissolve some of the international skepticism fostered by previous US administrations. One often overlooked issue to watch: Will the Biden administration discourage international development banks and its own lending agencies, such as the US Export-Import Bank, from financing fossil fuel projects in developing economies in Asia, Africa, and South America? Another looming question: Will the United States under Biden join the European Union, Japan, Great Britain, Canada, and other leading greenhouse-gas emitters in formally declaring that humanity faces a \"climate emergency\"? For journalists, one thing is clear: Climate change will be a major story in Biden's first year as president. Biden and his aides have ambitious plans that will provide news peg after news peg. The need for well-informed and high-visibility coverage, told as often as possible through a human lens, could not be plainer. And there's nothing partisan in news outlets' meeting that need; it's about human survival.

T hose are the closing words of \"The Hill We Climb,\" the stunning poem Amanda Gorman, the first youth poet laureate of the United States, delivered yesterday at the inauguration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. For those worried about climate change, the ever-shining light referenced in Gorman's poem was perhaps difficult to make out during Donald Trump's presidency. Now, a new day has dawned that brings great possibilities and equally great challenges. Biden ran on the strongest climate platform of any major presidential candidate in US history. He was pushed to that stance by his erstwhile rival Senator Bernie Sanders and pressure from a younger generation of activists who insist on centering economic, racial, and gender justice in climate policy. And to Biden's credit, he agreed to be pushed. Now, Biden has named a team of cabinet officials and aides who are experienced, diverse, and more committed to climate progress than their counterparts in any previous administration. Covering Climate Now A Silent Climate Majority Mark Hertsgaard and Kyle Pope The Game-Changing Truth That Could Save the Planet Damian Carrington Telemundo's Climate Commitment Mark Hertsgaard Biden and Harris have repeatedly described climate change as one of four intertwined crises-along with the Covid pandemic, the collapsed economy, and racial justice-that will be addressed by every part of the federal government. For example, Janet Yellen, Biden's nominee for treasury secretary-who has supported taxing carbon polluters and returning the proceeds to all Americans-said during her Senate confirmation hearing Tuesday that climate change is \"an existential threat\" to the US economy, and she pledged to appoint a \"very senior\" official to oversee her department's handling of the problem. The 180-degree reversal in US climate policy was also clear from the executive orders President Biden signed on the afternoon of his inauguration. The United States will rejoin the Paris Agreement. The Keystone XL pipeline, a landmark climate battle during the Obama years, will be canceled once and for all. And the Trump administration's weakening of regulations covering vehicle fuel efficiency, emissions of methane and other greenhouse gases, and other climate-related policies will be reviewed and likely overturned. (The day before Biden's inauguration, a federal court separately struck down Trump's attempt to weaken Obama's Clean Power Plan that will slashed emissions from electricity generation.)

Experts Dembicki interviewed said that \"many Green New Deal-style actions are still possible-making low carbon industries a key part of the pandemic stimulus, creating millions of green jobs, employing vast numbers of laid-off oil and gas workers, and moving much faster than before to clean electricity.\" These reforms will not come in \"single, sweeping piece of legislation\" the way some Green New Deal advocates imagine, said one expert. But sufficient bipartisan support is plausible for an array of measures that \"when you add them up are really big,\" said another. Overseas, Biden has a freer hand. Returning to the Paris Agreement is an essential first step, and Biden's commitment to climate action at home can dissolve some of the international skepticism fostered by previous US administrations. One often overlooked issue to watch: Will the Biden administration discourage international development banks and its own lending agencies, such as the US Export-Import Bank, from financing fossil fuel projects in developing economies in Asia, Africa, and South America? Another looming question: Will the United States under Biden join the European Union, Japan, Great Britain, Canada, and other leading greenhouse-gas emitters in formally declaring that humanity faces a \"climate emergency\"? For journalists, one thing is clear: Climate change will be a major story in Biden's first year as president. Biden and his aides have ambitious plans that will provide news peg after news peg. The need for well-informed and high-visibility coverage, told as often as possible through a human lens, could not be plainer.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

When day comes, we ask ourselves, where can we find light in this never-ending shade the loss? The loss we carry asea we must wade. We've braved the belly of the beast. We've learned that quiet isn't always peace. In the norms and notions of what just is, isn't always justice. And yet the dawn is hours before we knew it. Somehow we do it. Somehow we've weathered and witnessed a nation that isn't broken, but simply unfinished. We, the successors of a country and a time, where a skinny black girl, descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president, only to find herself reciting for one. And yes, we are far from polished, far from pristine. But that doesn't mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect. We are striving to forge our union with purpose, to compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, characters and conditions of man. And so we lift our gaze, not to what stands between us, but what stands before us. We close the divide because we know to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside. We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another. We seek harm to none, and harmony for all. Let the globe, if nothing else, say this is true. That even as we grieved, we grew. That even as we hurt, we hoped, that even as we tired. we tried, that will forever be tied together victorious. Not because we will never again know defeat, but because we will never again sow division. Scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree, and no one shall make them afraid. If we're to live up to our own time, then victory won't lie in the blade. But in all the bridges we've made. That is the promise promise to glade, the hill we climb. If only we dare it. Because being American is more than a pride we inherit. It's the past we step into, and how we repair it. We've seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it. Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy. And this effort very nearly succeeded. But while democracy can be periodically delayed, it can never be permanently defeated. In this truth, in this faith, we trust. For while we have our eyes on the future, our history has its eyes on us. This is the era of just redemption. We feared it at its inception. We did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour. But within it, we found the power to author a new chapter, to offer hope and laughter to ourselves. So while once we asked, how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe, now we assert how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us? We will not march back to what was, but move to what shall be, a country that is bruised but whole. Benevolent but bold, fierce and free. We will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation. Our blunders become their burdens. But one thing is certain. If we merge mercy with might, and might with rights, then love becomes our legacy and change our children's birthright. So let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left with. Every breath, my bronze-pounded chest. We will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one. We will rise from the gold-limned hills of the West. We will rise from the windswept Northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution. We will rise from the lake-rimmed cities of the Midwestern states. We will rise from the sun-baked South. We will rebuild, reconcile and recover in every known nook of our nation, in every corner called our country. Our people, diverse and beautiful, will emerge battered and beautiful. When day comes, we step out of the shade of flame and unafraid. The new dawn blooms as we free it. For there was always light. If only we're brave enough to see it. If only we're brave enough to be it.\n\nBy Alexandra Alter\n\nWhen Amanda Gorman was writing her inaugural poem, \"The Hill We Climb,\" she faced a challenge unlike any of her predecessors.\n\nGorman set out to craft a poem that was both hopeful and realistic, one that reflected the political divisions that have fractured the country, but also the promise of greater unity. She finished writing the poem just after rioters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\n\"I'm not going to in any way gloss over what we've seen over the past few weeks and, dare I say, the past few years. But what I really aspire to do in the poem is to be able to use my words to envision a way in which our country can still come together and can still heal,\" she said in an interview with The New York Times . \"It's doing that in a way that is not erasing or neglecting the harsh truths I think America needs to reconcile with.\"\n\nAt 22, Gorman, who lives in Los Angeles, is the youngest inaugural poet in U.S. history. She was brought to the Inaugural Committee's attention by first lady Jill Biden , who saw her recite a poem at the Library of Congress, and was struck by her performance and her bold yellow dress (Gorman wore a bright yellow blazer at the inauguration).\n\nTo prepare for her appearance, Gorman, who has a speech impediment, read the poem aloud over and over, \"practicing it and trying to let it be known in my mouth, but not feel robotic,\" she said in an interview. Early reviews of her performance were glowing: on CNN, she was praised for summing \"up with emotion and beautiful eloquence the idea of what this country came close to losing.\"\n\nAs she recited \"The Hill We Climb,\" in the bright sunlight, her voice animated and full of emotion, Gorman described her background as a \"skinny Black girl, descended from slaves and raised by a single mother,\" who can dream of being president one day, \"only to find herself reciting for one.\"\n\nWhen day comes, we ask ourselves:\n\nWhere can we find light\n\nIn this never-ending shade?\n\nThe loss we carry, a sea we must wade.\n\nWith verses that echoed the theme of the inauguration, \"America United,\" she spoke of the possibility of unity, redemption and reconciliation.\n\nAnd yet the dawn is ours before we knew it.\n\nSomehow, we do it.\n\nSomehow, we've weathered and witnessed\n\nA nation that isn't broken, but simply unfinished.\n\nAlexandra Alter writes about publishing and the literary world. Before joining The Times in 2014, she covered books and culture for The Wall Street Journal. Prior to that, she reported on religion, and the occasional hurricane, for The Miami Herald.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Amanda Gorman: Why I Almost Didn't Read My Poem at the Inauguration\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nGuest Essay\n\nBy Amanda Gorman\n\nAmanda Gorman is a poet and the author of \"The Hill We Climb\" and \"Call Us What We Carry.\"\n\nIt's told like this: Amanda Gorman performed at the inauguration, and the rest is history.\n\nThe truth is I almost declined to be the inaugural poet. Why?\n\nI was terrified.\n\nI was scared of failing my people, my poetry. But I was also terrified on a physical level. Covid was still raging, and my age group couldn't get vaccinated yet. Just a few weeks before, domestic terrorists assaulted the U.S. Capitol, the very steps where I would recite. I didn't know then that I'd become famous, but I did know at the inauguration I was going to become highly visible - which is a very dangerous thing to be in America, especially if you're Black and outspoken and have no Secret Service.\n\nIt didn't help that I was getting DMs from friends telling me not so jokingly to buy a bulletproof vest. My mom had us crouch in our living room so that she could practice shielding my body from bullets. A loved one warned me to \"be ready to die\" if I went to the Capitol, telling me, \"It's just not worth it.\" I had insomnia and nightmares, barely ate or drank for days. I finally wrote to some close friends and family, telling them that I was most likely going to pull out of the ceremony.\n\nI got some texts praising the Lord. I got called pathologically insane. But I knew only I could answer the question for myself: Was this poem worth it?\n\nThe night before I was to give the Inaugural Committee my final decision felt like the longest of my life. My neighborhood was eerily quiet in that early morning dark, though I strained my ears for noise to distract me from the choice that lay ahead. It felt like my little world stood still. And then it struck me: Maybe being brave enough doesn't mean lessening my fear, but listening to it. I closed my eyes in bed and let myself utter all the leviathans that scared me, both monstrous and minuscule. What stood out most of all was the worry that I'd spend the rest of my life wondering what this poem could have achieved. There was only one way to find out.\n\nBy the time the sun rose, I knew one thing for sure: I was going to be the 2021 inaugural poet. I can't say I was completely confident in my choice, but I was completely committed to it.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Biden Jr.'s inauguration in Washington on Wednesday, but Amanda Gorman was her own source of illumination. With her canary-yellow Prada coat, her regal red headband , her thrice-scrubbed innocence and her exacting delivery, she was a one-person reminder that if winter is here, then spring cannot be far behind.\n\nThe 22-year-old Gorman read her poem \"The Hill We Climb\" after performances by Lady Gaga, Jennifer Lopez and Garth Brooks - the great, the good and the well-intentioned. More notably, she appeared in the wake of poets who've read at previous presidential transitions, among them Robert Frost, Maya Angelou, Miller Williams, Elizabeth Alexander and Richard Blanco.\n\nIt hardly matters that \"The Hill We Climb\" is not an eternal work of art: neither were the poems by Gorman's predecessors. In cadences that fell somewhere between those of Lauryn Hill and Angelou herself, Gorman rose to meet a moment. She made the firm of Frost, Angelou, Williams, Alexander and Blanco seem mildly pretentious by comparison.\n\nHer poem blended the political and the personal. She imagined, she wrote, a country and a time\n\nWhere a skinny Black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one.\n\nAfter four years during which language was debased - when it meant anything at all - Gorman offered a fortifying tablespoon of American plain-spokenness. She offered lucidity and euphony. Her hand motions were expressive, as if she were conducting an orchestra of one.\n\nIf her performance made you vaguely feel that you'd had a blood transfusion, it was perhaps because you could sense the beginning of a remade connection in America between cultural and political life. A sleeping limb was tingling back into action.\n\nIf the poet seemed like a character from Lin-Manuel Miranda's \"Hamilton\" sprung to life, well, Gorman, who studied sociology at Harvard, is a member of Generation Hamilton. She has said she listened to the soundtrack while preparing to write her poem, and she specifically referenced the musical in it.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Celebrated by such prominent women as Hillary Clinton (Ms. Gorman helped introduce Ms. Clinton at the 2017 Vital Voices Global Leadership Awards in March) and Cynthia Erivo , her poetry is a cleareyed mix of autobiography, social issues like Islamophobia, and historical motifs picked up from her college's library. \"I want to create poems that stand the test of time and counter the fragmented news culture of today,\" she said.\n\nBig Break Inspired by a speech that Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani activist and Nobel Prize laureate, gave in 2013, Ms. Gorman became a youth delegate for the United Nations at the age of 16. \"It really opened my eyes to the possibilities of what I could accomplish,\" she said.

The spokeswoman for that one? Would she marry her image and fame to a big brand?\n\nA mere month or so later, she told Vogue for a May cover story, she had turned down about $17 million in various promotional opportunities.\n\nThis week, however, she finally pledged her troth. And the winner is ... Estée Lauder.\n\nAlthough to be fair the winner is also Ms. Gorman, who signed what may be one of the most multidimensional representation agreements in beauty history. As well as a swath of unexpected beneficiaries.\n\nHere's what it involves: Ms. Gorman will become the first Estée Lauder \"Global Changemaker\" - as opposed to, say, spokeswoman or ambassador or \"face,\" though she will also be all of the above.\n\nThat's not just a semantic shift, but one that reflects a different balance of power in the current consumer reality, in which the influence of real people can carry more weight than the purely transactional nature of the celebrity model relationship, and where substance is particularly prized, as for-profit companies feel an imperative to prove they stand for something more than simply - well, profit.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "'The Writing Hasn't Changed': Amanda Gorman on Life Post-Inauguration\n\nWhat to Read\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nInside the List\n\nBy Lauren Christensen\n\nA STAR IS BORN So far this year, Amanda Gorman has read her poetry aloud before two of the biggest audiences in the country: the presidential inauguration and the Super Bowl . Now her words are reaching readers in a more private format, too: A 32-page commemorative edition of her inaugural poem, \"The Hill We Climb\" - featuring a foreword by Oprah Winfrey - enters the fiction list this week at No. 1.\n\n\"I was really excited when 'The Hill We Climb' became a book, because I knew it would be able to be integrated into people's lives in new ways,\" she said in a phone interview.\n\nShe's seen Instagram photos of people gifting it to one another, stuffing copies into Easter baskets: \"That's something you can't do with a video, you can't do with a performance, but once it's physicalized, all of a sudden it can be interwoven into the ways people celebrate and cherish each other.\"\n\n\"When I'm performing a poem live, what I'm really thinking about is how it sounds,\" Gorman said. When writing for the page, absent her voice, her cadences and intonations, she's asking herself something quite different. \"They might not be with me on the lawn of the Capitol, they might not be with me on the stage,\" she said. \"How does this feel as an experience for the reader on their own terms?\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, Gorman's publishing career is only just beginning. She's \"knee-deep\" in the process of writing her first collection - \"I think it'll be its own sort of poetic reckoning with the past months that we've lived through\" - scheduled to come out in September.\n\n\"There are going to be pieces that not even my family has seen before,\" she said, \"so I think it'll be a new side of me that even people who have known of my work for a while will be introduced to.\" When asked if the new work is similarly political in its inspiration, she said: \"I think all art is political.\"\n\nNot many poets can say their verses have reached as many people as hers have in the few short months since Jan. 20. But despite the fame, Gorman, who is 23, says she's as committed to her craft as ever. \"Even as all these other aspects of my life have changed - be it the visibility, the recognizability - the writing hasn't.\" She still wakes up every morning to write for hours, and that work turns into poetry.\n\n\"I'm still flying by the seat of my pants - or skirt, as it were,\" she said, but \"I can still find my old home in picking up a pen.\"\n\nLauren Christensen is an editor at the Book Review.\n\nFollow New York Times Books on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram , s ign up for our newsletter or our literary calendar .

      "text": "At the Inauguration, Amanda Gorman Wove History and the Future Into a Stirring Melody\n\nTrump Administration\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nCritic's Notebook\n\nBy Dwight Garner\n\nThe sun came out intermittently at President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s inauguration in Washington on Wednesday, but Amanda Gorman was her own source of illumination. With her canary-yellow Prada coat, her regal red headband , her thrice-scrubbed innocence and her exacting delivery, she was a one-person reminder that if winter is here, then spring cannot be far behind.\n\nThe 22-year-old Gorman read her poem \"The Hill We Climb\" after performances by Lady Gaga, Jennifer Lopez and Garth Brooks - the great, the good and the well-intentioned. More notably, she appeared in the wake of poets who've read at previous presidential transitions, among them Robert Frost, Maya Angelou, Miller Williams, Elizabeth Alexander and Richard Blanco.\n\nIt hardly matters that \"The Hill We Climb\" is not an eternal work of art: neither were the poems by Gorman's predecessors. In cadences that fell somewhere between those of Lauryn Hill and Angelou herself, Gorman rose to meet a moment. She made the firm of Frost, Angelou, Williams, Alexander and Blanco seem mildly pretentious by comparison.\n\nHer poem blended the political and the personal. She imagined, she wrote, a country and a time\n\nWhere a skinny Black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one.\n\nAfter four years during which language was debased - when it meant anything at all - Gorman offered a fortifying tablespoon of American plain-spokenness. She offered lucidity and euphony. Her hand motions were expressive, as if she were conducting an orchestra of one.\n\nIf her performance made you vaguely feel that you'd had a blood transfusion, it was perhaps because you could sense the beginning of a remade connection in America between cultural and political life. A sleeping limb was tingling back into action.\n\nIf the poet seemed like a character from Lin-Manuel Miranda's \"Hamilton\" sprung to life, well, Gorman, who studied sociology at Harvard, is a member of Generation Hamilton. She has said she listened to the soundtrack while preparing to write her poem, and she specifically referenced the musical in it.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Amanda Gorman: Why I Almost Didn't Read My Poem at the Inauguration\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nGuest Essay\n\nBy Amanda Gorman\n\nAmanda Gorman is a poet and the author of \"The Hill We Climb\" and \"Call Us What We Carry.\"\n\nIt's told like this: Amanda Gorman performed at the inauguration, and the rest is history.\n\nThe truth is I almost declined to be the inaugural poet. Why?\n\nI was terrified.\n\nI was scared of failing my people, my poetry. But I was also terrified on a physical level. Covid was still raging, and my age group couldn't get vaccinated yet. Just a few weeks before, domestic terrorists assaulted the U.S. Capitol, the very steps where I would recite. I didn't know then that I'd become famous, but I did know at the inauguration I was going to become highly visible - which is a very dangerous thing to be in America, especially if you're Black and outspoken and have no Secret Service.\n\nIt didn't help that I was getting DMs from friends telling me not so jokingly to buy a bulletproof vest. My mom had us crouch in our living room so that she could practice shielding my body from bullets. A loved one warned me to \"be ready to die\" if I went to the Capitol, telling me, \"It's just not worth it.\" I had insomnia and nightmares, barely ate or drank for days. I finally wrote to some close friends and family, telling them that I was most likely going to pull out of the ceremony.\n\nI got some texts praising the Lord. I got called pathologically insane. But I knew only I could answer the question for myself: Was this poem worth it?\n\nThe night before I was to give the Inaugural Committee my final decision felt like the longest of my life. My neighborhood was eerily quiet in that early morning dark, though I strained my ears for noise to distract me from the choice that lay ahead. It felt like my little world stood still. And then it struck me: Maybe being brave enough doesn't mean lessening my fear, but listening to it. I closed my eyes in bed and let myself utter all the leviathans that scared me, both monstrous and minuscule. What stood out most of all was the worry that I'd spend the rest of my life wondering what this poem could have achieved. There was only one way to find out.\n\nBy the time the sun rose, I knew one thing for sure: I was going to be the 2021 inaugural poet. I can't say I was completely confident in my choice, but I was completely committed to it.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Amanda Gorman's Inaugural Poem Is a Stunning Vision of Democracy\n\nAmong the firsts in Amanda Gorman's inaugural poem, \"The Hill We Climb,\" is the concept of democracy that it assumed. Democracy, according to the twenty-two-year-old poet, is an aspiration-a thing of the future.\n\nThe word \"democracy\" first appears in the same verse in which Gorman refers to \"a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it.\" The insurrection at the Capitol on January 6th took place while Gorman was working on the poem, although the \"force,\" one may assume, is bigger than the insurrection-it is the Trump Presidency that made the insurrection possible, and the forces of white supremacy and inequality that enabled that Presidency itself-\"it / Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy / And this effort very nearly succeeded\" the poem continues. \"But while democracy can be periodically delayed / it can never be permanently defeated.\"\n\nBoth times the poem raises \"democracy,\" Gorman pairs the word with \"delay,\" which tells us that democracy is a thing expected, anticipated-not a thing that we have built, or possessed, but a dream. This is not the way that politicians or even political theorists usually use the word \"democracy,\" but it is one way that philosophers have used it. Jacques Derrida , the French deconstructionist, used the term \"democracy to come.\" Democracy, he wrote, was always forged and threatened by contradictory forces and thus is always \"deferred,\" always out of reach even in societies that adopt democracy as their governing principle.\n\nGorman's poem is, explicitly, a text about the future. She exhorts Americans to look not at \"what stands between us / But what stands before us.\" She says, at the beginning, that \"we know, to put our future first,\" and she ends with a verse of promises and challenges as rousing as any ever written:\n\nSo let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left with Every breath from my bronze-pounded chest, we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one We will rise from the gold-limbed hills of the west, we will rise from the windswept northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution We will rise from the lake-rimmed cities of the midwestern states, we will rise from the sunbaked south We will rebuild, reconcile and recover and every known nook of our nation and every corner called our country, our people diverse and beautiful will emerge, battered and beautiful When day comes we step out of the shade, aflame and unafraid The new dawn blooms as we free it For there is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it If only we're brave enough to be it\n\nThe focus on the future is a direct response to the rhetoric of the outgoing President, who called on his mob to transport the country back to an imaginary past and forced Americans to live in a present without end. To write about the future, Gorman also has to write about the past. \"Being American is more than a pride we inherit, / it's the past we step into / And how we repair it,\" she says, in an elegant rebuke to the rhetoric of return-to-normalcy: \"We will not march back to what was / But move to what shall be.\" Again, she stresses that the promise of American democracy is still there, still yet to arrive.\n\nIn everyday speech, Americans usually refer to democracy as a thing that we have, or used to have before Trump came along. In the tradition of American political speeches, democracy often figures as a work in progress. This, too, suggests that democracy is something we inhabit but continue to work on, an endless fixer-upper with good bones . Gorman's explicit assumption is more radical and challenging.\n\nIt's not only philosophy where the idea of a democracy-to-come can be found. \"The Hill We Climb\" evokes another great American poem, Langston Hughes's \" Let America Be America Again .\" Hughes wrote, \"America never was America to me, / And yet I swear this oath- / America will be!\"-an immortal distillation of the tension between American aspirations and American reality, and a stubborn insistence that the country continue to reach for its dream. There is no better place to start for an inaugural poem, or for a Presidency.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "From \"Call Us What We Carry\"\n\nWhat we call occasional poetry-verse written for or about an event, often ceremonial-reminds us that all poems have occasions, or should. Good poems capture a moment and sustain it. In an era as urgent as ours, many poems strive for timelessness precisely by being timely. Poetry can preserve the fleeting present, encircle the past, and help envision alternative futures.\n\nWhen Amanda Gorman read her poem \"The Hill We Climb\" at the 2021 U.S. Presidential Inauguration, she became both the inheritor of a long tradition and a herald of something new. Her verse, as vibrant and elegant as her yellow coat against the cold, illuminated the imagination as well as the occasion, confirming her as a worthy successor to several other Black women inaugural poets writing to and for an American ideal-a lineage traceable all the way back to Phillis Wheatley , who, at the dawn of the Republic, addressed a poem to then General George Washington. As Gorman acknowledged this country's contested history, and its contemporary tumult, her invocation of the plural pronoun \"we\" reminded us that, for good or literal ill, our lives are connected. Hers was an invitation to move forward together.\n\nGorman continues to explore the \"we\" further in her new collection, \" Call Us What We Carry ,\" which she calls an \"occasional book\"-one framed by our many mutating yet seemingly immutable pandemics, from COVID -19 and racism to climate catastrophes and a general malaise. In \"penning a letter to the world as a daughter of it,\" Gorman doesn't merely transcribe a diary of a plague year; her bold, oracular pronouncements bear witness to collective experience, with an uncanny confidence and a prescient tone that are all the poet's own. By turns devotional and pushing the limits of the page, many poems in the book play with form-appearing as questionnaires and text-message conversations, or taking on the shapes of an urn, a whale, a flag-in ways reminiscent of George Herbert or the concrete poets of the nineteen-sixties, another tempestuous time in search of fixity. Gorman insists that \"We are not me- / We are we,\" and her poetry is unafraid to name all that we carry. \"Our scars,\" she writes, \"are the brightest / Parts of us.\"\n\n-Kevin Young\n\nRead by the author.\n\nAllegedly the worst is behind us. Still, we crouch before the lip of tomorrow, Halting like a headless hant in our own house, Waiting to remember exactly What it is we're supposed to be doing.\n\n& what exactly are we supposed to be doing? Penning a letter to the world as a daughter of it. We are writing with vanishing meaning, Our words water dragging down a windshield. The poet's diagnosis is that what we have lived Has already warped itself into a fever dream, The contours of its shape stripped from the murky mind.\n\nTo be accountable we must render an account: Not what was said, but what was meant. Not the fact, but what was felt. What was known, even while unnamed. Our greatest test will be Our testimony. This book is a message in a bottle. This book is a letter. This book does not let up. This book is awake. This book is a wake. For what is a record but a reckoning? The capsule captured? A repository. An ark articulated? & the poet, the preserver Of ghosts & gains, Our demons & dreams, Our haunts & hopes. Here's to the preservation Of a light so terrible.\n\nRead by the author.\n\nWe are Arborescent- What goes Unseen Is at the very Root of ourselves. Distance can Distort our deepest Sense Of who We are, Leave us Warped & wasted As winter's Wind. We will Not walk From what We've borne. We would Keep it For a while.

      "text": "The Met Gala Searches for America\n\nThe oldest piece on display in the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute's new show, \"In America: A Lexicon of Fashion,\" is not an item of clothing but a nineteenth-century quilt borrowed from the museum's American Wing collection. It was made by a wealthy nineteenth-century woman named Adeline Harris Sears, whose father was a successful textile mill owner in Rhode Island. Beginning in 1856, when she was seventeen, she sent scraps of silk to notable politicians, writers, abolitionists, artists, and clergymen, asking that they sign their names to the fabric and send them back so that she could sew them into one gigantic tapestry. \"Autographomania,\" or fishing for signatures through the postal service, was a hip pastime for privileged teens at the time, but Sears's undertaking was remarkably ambitious. In the course of the following two decades, she gathered scraps from the likes of Charles Dickens, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Washington Irving, Alexander von Humboldt, Julia Ward Howe, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and seven Presidents, including \"Yr. Friend & Servant Abraham Lincoln.\" The editor Sarah Josepha Hale, who ran \"Godey's Lady's Book,\" the era's leading women's publication, rhapsodized about Sears's quilt in one of her editor's letters. \"Who knows but in future ages, her work may be looked at like the Bayeux Tapestry,\" Hale wrote. \"Not only as a marvel of woman's ingenious and intellectual industry; but as affording an idea of the civilization of our times.\"\n\nThe quilt is included in the Met show-the first of a two-part, year-long exploration of American design-ostensibly as a nod to the heterogeneity of American fashion. Andrew Bolton, the curator of the Institute, began his remarks at the show's preview on Monday by quoting Jesse Jackson's assertion, at the 1984 Democratic National Convention, that America is not like a cohesive blanket but more like \"a quilt-many patches, many pieces, many colors, many sizes, all woven and held together by a common thread.\" Of course, an even more obvious thread connects Sears's blanket to the Met Gala , the party held each year to inaugurate the Costume Institute show: a shared obsession with celebrity. The Gala, which usually happens in May but was delayed by the pandemic for more than a year, is, like Sears's quilt, both a zazzy vanity project and an industrious feat of star-wrangling, featuring plenty of cuts of silk.\n\nThe sartorial theme this year was \"American independence,\" but it became clear early on in the evening that most attendees treated that brief as a carte blanche. The familiar European labels dominated-Gucci, Versace, Dior, Vuitton, Prada, Valentino. Channing Tatum wore a simple Versace tux that, as he told the actress Keke Palmer (one of the hosts of Vogue's event livestream), vaguely reminded him of a photograph of John F. Kennedy, Jr. The actress Yara Shahidi wore a strapless beige Dior number as a tribute to the Jazz Age entertainer Josephine Baker, an American who decamped to Paris to reinvent herself. Rihanna arrived fashionably late wearing a custom, billowing black gown from Balenciaga that had whiffs of Rei Kawakubo and the Folies Bergère. Her boyfriend, A$AP Rocky, however, was cocooned in a California-based brand's voluminous quilted coat, the closest nod to American folk-art traditions that we saw all night.\n\nThere were fewer archival, iconic American pieces than I'd expected-where was the Halston ? Nineteen-eighties-era Donna Karan? Vintage Marc Jacobs? Stephen Burrows?-but some guests understood that the assignment was an opportunity to showcase American designers. Jennifer Lopez veered into the yeehaw side of Americana in a saddle-brown Ralph Lauren gown topped with fur pelts and a weathered cowboy hat. The playwright and screenwriter Jeremy O. Harris wore a cyber-yellow Tommy Hilfiger ensemble inspired by the style of the late singer Aaliyah. The getup of the pop singer Kim Petras-another nod to the West, by the New York label Collina Strada, adorned with a garish rubber horse head-would not have been out of place at the Met's previous, camp-themed gala.\n\nIf there was anything consistently \"American\" about the occasion, it was the gala's breathless emphasis on youth. The four chairpeople of this year's event-the tennis star Naomi Osaka , the singer Billie Eilish , the actor Timothée Chalamet, and the poet Amanda Gorman -spanned in age from their late teens to mid-twenties. Osaka, who is a brand ambassador for Louis Vuitton (what's more American than corporate sponsorships?), wore a Vuitton piece co-designed by her sister Mari Osaka as an homage to their mixed Japanese and Haitian heritage, complete with a cherry-red obi belt. Eilish went classic Hollywood blonde in Oscar de la Renta. Chalamet, often an impish fashion figure, wore a slouchy Haider Ackermann suit, a silhouette we've seen him in before, while Gorman chose a frothy blue Vera Wang gown that placed her somewhere between Statue of Liberty and professional figure skater. Internet influencers such as Emma Chamberlain and Addison Rae stomped the red carpet, their presence-surely anathema to some high-fashion snobs-a calculated nod to social media's role in birthing and disseminating trends.\n\nOne hardly expects an opulent charity ball to be a revolutionary event, but it was surprising, given our current national maelstrom, how few people chose to interpret the American theme as a prompt for political statements. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, an exception, wore a custom white gown from the Brooklyn-based Black designer and activist Aurora James of Brother Vellies with the words \"Tax the Rich\" splashed across the back in red. But nothing on the red carpet felt as galvanizing as what I encountered at the press preview of the Costume Institute show, earlier in the day. The exhibition features a hundred pieces from American designers, many of them well-established brands-Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, Diane von Furstenberg, Michael Kors. Each outfit in the show is accompanied by a headpiece that features a corresponding term, such as esprit , vitality, and self-determination. (What could be more American than parroting the language of self-help?) The show offered real delights, though, in its commitment to designers who are still very early in their careers-some of whom barely had any warning that their pieces were making it to the Met.\n\nAaron Potts, of the label A. Potts, said he only guessed that a wooly yellow blanket coat from his Fall 2021 collection would be in the show because the museum requested the garment and didn't send it back. \"I'm a young designer who is Black, and it's about damn time, actually,\" he said of his inclusion. Not far from Sears's quilt, the young L.A.-based designer Claude Kameni was live-streaming next to her piece in the show, a stunning gown in an African wax print that reflected her roots in Cameroon. \"I cannot deeeeeal!\" she told her phone camera, flapping her hands in excitement. In another hall, the designer Susan Cianciolo, whose simple 1999 black dress is in the show, was kvelling because two of her former Pratt students-Sophie Andes Gascon and Claire McKinney, who together have a brand called SC103-had made it into the show with an avant-garde woven piece.\n\nThis emphasis on new talent gave the entire Costume Institute show an uncharacteristically relaxed, gregarious quality. Becca McCharen-Tran, who makes provocative swimwear and bodysuits for her line, Chromat, was wearing combat boots and smears of green eyeshadow that matched her neon ponytail. She told me that the curators had requested a size fourteen of her stretchy black lycra swimsuit, which comes with anti-chafing leg bands. \"It's for people whose thighs touch,\" she said. Then she reached into the glass exhibit case to pull down the swimsuit's zipper a bit. \"Hey, no alarm went off, so I guess I'm allowed to do that,\" she said. Call it a small act of American independence.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "From \"Call Us What We Carry\"\n\nWhat we call occasional poetry-verse written for or about an event, often ceremonial-reminds us that all poems have occasions, or should. Good poems capture a moment and sustain it. In an era as urgent as ours, many poems strive for timelessness precisely by being timely. Poetry can preserve the fleeting present, encircle the past, and help envision alternative futures.\n\nWhen Amanda Gorman read her poem \"The Hill We Climb\" at the 2021 U.S. Presidential Inauguration, she became both the inheritor of a long tradition and a herald of something new. Her verse, as vibrant and elegant as her yellow coat against the cold, illuminated the imagination as well as the occasion, confirming her as a worthy successor to several other Black women inaugural poets writing to and for an American ideal-a lineage traceable all the way back to Phillis Wheatley , who, at the dawn of the Republic, addressed a poem to then General George Washington. As Gorman acknowledged this country's contested history, and its contemporary tumult, her invocation of the plural pronoun \"we\" reminded us that, for good or literal ill, our lives are connected. Hers was an invitation to move forward together.\n\nGorman continues to explore the \"we\" further in her new collection, \" Call Us What We Carry ,\" which she calls an \"occasional book\"-one framed by our many mutating yet seemingly immutable pandemics, from COVID -19 and racism to climate catastrophes and a general malaise. In \"penning a letter to the world as a daughter of it,\" Gorman doesn't merely transcribe a diary of a plague year; her bold, oracular pronouncements bear witness to collective experience, with an uncanny confidence and a prescient tone that are all the poet's own. By turns devotional and pushing the limits of the page, many poems in the book play with form-appearing as questionnaires and text-message conversations, or taking on the shapes of an urn, a whale, a flag-in ways reminiscent of George Herbert or the concrete poets of the nineteen-sixties, another tempestuous time in search of fixity. Gorman insists that \"We are not me- / We are we,\" and her poetry is unafraid to name all that we carry. \"Our scars,\" she writes, \"are the brightest / Parts of us.\"\n\n-Kevin Young\n\nRead by the author.\n\nAllegedly the worst is behind us. Still, we crouch before the lip of tomorrow, Halting like a headless hant in our own house, Waiting to remember exactly What it is we're supposed to be doing.\n\n& what exactly are we supposed to be doing? Penning a letter to the world as a daughter of it. We are writing with vanishing meaning, Our words water dragging down a windshield. The poet's diagnosis is that what we have lived Has already warped itself into a fever dream, The contours of its shape stripped from the murky mind.\n\nTo be accountable we must render an account: Not what was said, but what was meant. Not the fact, but what was felt. What was known, even while unnamed. Our greatest test will be Our testimony. This book is a message in a bottle. This book is a letter. This book does not let up. This book is awake. This book is a wake. For what is a record but a reckoning? The capsule captured? A repository. An ark articulated? & the poet, the preserver Of ghosts & gains, Our demons & dreams, Our haunts & hopes. Here's to the preservation Of a light so terrible.\n\nRead by the author.\n\nWe are Arborescent- What goes Unseen Is at the very Root of ourselves. Distance can Distort our deepest Sense Of who We are, Leave us Warped & wasted As winter's Wind. We will Not walk From what We've borne. We would Keep it For a while. Sit silent & Swinging on its branches Like a child Refusing to come Home. We would Keep, We would Weep, Knowing how We would Again Give up Our world For this one.\n\nRead by the author.\n\nGrant us this day Bruising the make of us.\n\nAt times over half of our bodies Are not our own,\n\nOur persons made vessel For nonhuman cells.\n\nTo them we are A boat of a being,\n\nEssential. A country,\n\nA continent, A planet.\n\nA human Microbiome is all the writhing forms on\n\n& inside this body Drafted under our life.\n\nWe are not me- We are we.\n\nCall us What we carry.\n\nRead by the author.\n\nWhat would we seem, stripped down Like a wintered tree. Glossy scabs, tight-raised skin, These can look silver in certain moonlights. In other words, Our scars are the brightest Parts of us. * * * The crescent moon, The night's lucent lesion. We are felled oaks beneath it, Branches full of empty. Look closer. What we share is more Than what we've shed. * * * & what we share is the bark, the bones. Paleontologists, from one fossilized femur, Can dream up a species, Make-believe a body Where there was none. Our remnants are revelation, Our requiem as raptus. When we bend into dirt We're truth preserved Without our skin. * * * Lumen means both the cavity Of an organ, literally an opening, & a unit of luminous flux, Literally, a measurement of how lit The source is. Illuminate us. That is, we, too, Are this bodied unit of flare, The gap for lux to breach. * * * Sorry, must've been the light Playing tricks on us , we say, Knuckling our eyelids. But perhaps it is we who make Falsities of luminescence- Our shadows playing tricks on stars. Every time their gazes tug down, They think us monsters, then men, Predators, then persons again, Beasts, then beings, Horrors, & then humans. Of all the stars the most beautiful Is nothing more than a monster, Just as starved & stranded as we are.\n\nRead by the author.\n\nAt times even blessings will bleed us.\n\nThere are some who lost their lives & those who were lost from ours,\n\nWho we might now reënter, All our someones summoned softly.\n\nThe closest we get to time travel Is our fears softening,\n\nOur hurts unclenching, As we become more akin\n\nTo kin, as we return To who we were\n\nBefore we actually were Anything or anyone-\n\nThat is, when we were born unhating & unhindered, howling wetly\n\nWith everything we could yet become. To travel back in time is to remember\n\nWhen all we knew of ourselves was love.\n\nThis excerpt is drawn from \" Call Us What We Carry ,\" by Amanda Gorman, and her readings from the audiobook edition , out in December from Penguin Random House.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "Inaugural Poet Amanda Gorman Says Security Guard Confronted Her for Being \"Suspicious\"\n\nAmanda Gorman, who became a national figure after she delivered a stirring poem at President Joe Biden's inauguration, said she was followed by a security guard who questioned whether she lived in her own building. Gorman, 22, wrote on Twitter that a security guard \"tailed\" her while she was walking home Friday night. \"He demanded if I lived there because 'you look suspicious.' I showed my keys & buzzed myself into my building,\" Gorman wrote . \"He left, no apology. This is the reality of black girls: One day you're called an icon, the next day, a threat.\"\n\nGorman wrote the Friday night tweet quoting another message she wrote in February linking to a Washington Post profile about her newly found stardom after the inauguration. \"We live in a contradictory society that can celebrate a black girl poet & also pepper spray a 9 yr old,\" Gorman wrote . \"Yes see me, but also see all other black girls who've been made invisible. I can not, will not, rise alone.\"\n\nIn a subsequent tweet, Gorman said that \"in a sense\" the security guard was right. \"I AM A THREAT: a threat to injustice, to inequality, to ignorance,\" she wrote . \"Anyone who speaks the truth and walks with hope is an obvious and fatal danger to the powers that be.\"\n\nGorman, who is from Los Angeles, was named the first national youth poet laureate in 2017 while she was a student at Harvard University. Three years earlier, when she was just 16, Gorman was named the first youth poet laureate of Los Angeles. This year, Gorman became the youngest poet to speak at a presidential inauguration and she recited the poem \" The Hill We Climb .\" She was widely celebrated for the poem , which she recited mere days after rioters stormed the Capitol while lawmakers certified the results of the presidential election.\n\n\"Somehow we weathered and witnessed a nation that isn't broken, but simply unfinished,\" Gorman read in part of the poem. \"We, the successors of a country and a time where a skinny Black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president, only to find herself reciting for one.\" A month later, Gorman performed at the Super Bowl preshow.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Why Is It Always the Weird Animals That Are Named After Celebrities?\n\nOn Jan. 20, 2021, Fay-Wei Li was working on a manuscript about a new kind of algae that his lab had accidentally discovered while doing fieldwork in New York state. The team had already done the work of ensuring that this particular alga was indeed a never-before identified plant, now it just needed a name. At the time, Li's attention was divided between the journal submission and another important milestone, President Joe Biden's inauguration.\n\n\"I had my separate screen playing the inauguration events,\" says Li, an assistant professor at the Boyce Thompson Institute. A highlight of the program was poet Amanda Gorman, he recalls, as he and graduate student Tanner Robison were inspired by her speech and poem, \"The Hill We Climb.\" It was from this that they decided to name the new algae in Gorman's honor, Gormaniella terricola .\n\nThe green goo, found in hornwort plants , joins a host of other species honoring famous people. There are wasps named after Ellen DeGeneres, Jimmy Fallon, Lady Gaga, Shakira, Jon Stewart, Brad Pitt, and Idris Elba. Two of the three Spider-Man actors ( Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield ) have-you guessed it-spiders named in their honor. Greta Thunberg has an entire menagerie: a mayfly, a spider, a snail, a beetle, a leafhopper, a horsehair worm, and a sea slug are all named after her (they have different full scientific names from one another, as each belongs to a different genus). There's even a creature, whose most defining characteristics are its blindness and tendency to bury its head in the sand, named aptly after Donald Trump.\n\nThere's clearly a trend here: scrolling through the Wikipedia page of critters and plants with famous namesakes, it's rare that you find an animal that's not, well, a little weird.\n\nScientists can't go around just naming things willy-nilly. Species are named according to \"binomial nomenclature,\" in that they are gifted a two-part name that is specific to that organism. The first part is the genus the species belongs to and the second part of the name is the specific name or species of the organism. As long as these conventions are followed, the researchers have full reign to decide on the specific species name, usually adding a Latin flourish at the end. For example, spiders named after Barack and Michelle Obama are Aptostichus barackobamai and Spintharus michelleobamaae , respectively. The beetle named after Kate Winslet is the Agra katewinsletae . A dwarf gecko whose agility was \" reminiscent of the stunts of Jackie Chan \" is called the Cnemaspis jackieii. I think you get the point.\n\nAs to why there are no monkey species or koala bear cousins sporting celebrities' names, it's likely due to sheer statistics. \"To put it into perspective, as far as animals go, there are 1.5 million described species of animals. One million of those are insects,\" said Derek Hennen, a research associate with the Virginia Museum of Natural History who led the discovery of the Taylor Swift millipede -Nannaria swiftae, or the \"Swift twisted-claw millipede.\" \"Vertebrates like birds and mammals, which are the first things people think of when they think of animals, are not most of the animal diversity when it comes down to it. But since they're larger, more charismatic, those are the groups that have had a big focus on them for hundreds of years at this point.\"\n\nIt's unlikely that researchers will discover a tiger or an elephant that has yet to be classified by science. But with the more \"cryptic\" organisms, there's a lot more to uncover. According to Hennen, there are an estimated 15,000-30,000 millipede species that await identification. (I'm not sure there's a big enough supply of pop stars to award them all celeb names, if scientists ever were to find them all).\n\nUsing species names to honor modern icons like Gorman and Swift can help bring attention to some of those overlooked creatures. \"I think it's a useful cultural way to connect people with animals and plants and these other species,\" said Hennen. It's also a reckoning over past naming tendencies. For years, new species were named after their morphological characteristics, where they were from, or famous scientists. ( Charles Darwin has more than 300 species named after him).\n\n\"Many botanists in the 1700-1800s were men and they named things after other men that they respected in the field, that had contributed somehow to that field, to honor them,\" Kathleen Pryer, a professor of biology at Duke University said. In 2012, Pryer's lab devoted an entire genus of ferns-which includes species such as the Gaga germanotta and Gaga monstraparva- to the Mother Monster herself, Lady Gaga.\n\n\"In our particular case, we had an opportunity here to name a genus and we discussed it and didn't want it to be named after an old white man,\" says Pryer. \"Because she was part of the popular culture at the time, and still is, and we were listening to her music, we suggested 'let's do it in honor of her.' \"\n\nHennen had a similar experience, noting how he's been a devout Swiftie for years and her music helped him get through some tough times. It was a no-brainer to name one of the new species he discovered after her. \"There are so many more deserving people than just scientists or older scientists that have been in the field for a long time,\" Hennen said.\n\nPryer also noted how it's also a way to connect two worlds that are often perceived as quite separate, by letting scientists show off their inner pop culture fan. \"It's a way to say we, the people stuck away in labs, we pay attention and we appreciate what they're doing,\" said Pryer.\n\nPond scum might seem like a dubious way to honor someone. But to scientists, it's more than just some vegetation.\n\n\"We see beauty in every organism and [the Gormaniella terricola ] is a very pretty organism,\" Li said. \"From a distance, it's just green stuff, but under a microscope, it's really pretty. This is not a lowly organism. To us, this is a really pretty thing. \"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Biden's Granddaughters! Bernie's Mittens! All of Michelle Obama!\n\nJoe Biden's inauguration isn't just a relief in terms of politics. It's also a relief in terms of style: After four years of Scotch-taped ties and generally upsetting aesthetics , we can finally expect some more appealing visuals. At Biden's swearing-in ceremony on Wednesday, he, along with Vice President Kamala Harris, their families, and other attendees, gave us our first official glimpse at what the fashion of the Biden years might have in store. And it was pretty spectacular, honestly.\n\nPresident Joe Biden wore an understated navy suit and overcoat, both by Ralph Lauren, but no surprises here: The women's outfits were far more worthy of discussion. First lady Jill Biden, in a turquoise-y blue coat and matching dress by Markarian, an up-and-coming American label, partook in one of the big trends of the day, dressing monochromatically. As notable as all the head-to-toe looks in one color were, each woman was able to put her own spin on it, and Jill's, with her textured wool and darker collar and cuffs, had a touch of fairy godmother-from- Sleeping Beauty whimsy to it. Both the president and the first lady wore masks as well, a choice that seems like a no-brainer in the pandemic but that certainly has never before been a common sight at an inauguration. In contrast to the superspreader events of the Trump White House, the sea of masked faces was some kind of relief . The question of how to pair masks with formalwear also introduced a novel challenge here-the first lady led the way by opting for a shade similar to the rest of her outfit.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris answered the question of what the first-ever female vice president wears to be sworn in: a purple suit by Christopher John Rogers, an American designer who is Black and queer, with darker gloves and a black mask. The emphasis on uplifting American designers represents a return to the Obama era, when first lady Michelle Obama was known for championing American, and often Black American, labels.\n\nThough pantsuits are normally Kamala's thing, for the inauguration, she went a bit more feminine and formal. (She also skipped the Chucks.) Vogue and other outlets speculated that the purple, though it looked royal blue in some lights à la the Dress , may have been a reference to both the women's suffrage movement and the idea of bipartisanship, purple being the result of mixing red and blue; others said it called back to her campaign colors and Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman to run for president as a major-party candidate.* Kamala also wore a set of pearls-by an American designer of Puerto Rican heritage, Wilfredo Rosado-that have special significance to members of the sorority she was part of at Howard University, Alpha Kappa Alpha.\n\nBut the undisputed showstopper of the day, to judge by the rapture online, was Michelle Obama in another monochromatic standout in a maroon look by Sergio Hudson, a Black American designer. The outfit's floor-length coat, funky belt, and high-waisted, bell-bottomed pants added some serious swagger to the day's proceedings, as befitting a post-presidency first lady who can dress like she has Netflix money and no more campaigns or approval ratings to worry about ever again.\n\nSome more ecstatic favorites from the day included the Biden granddaughters, who wore pantsuits and matching jackets (and masks) in pink, white, and tan, leading more than one Twitter user to joke that they were serving Neapolitan-ice cream chic . Their only real in-family competition? Hunter Biden's baby son Beau, having a plaid/bonnet moment.\n\nMore monochromatic queens included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in blue and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton-remember her?-who opted for a similar shade of purple as Kamala with her pantsuit selection, but her choice of a darker jacket gave the look decidedly less drama.\n\nMeanwhile, it's safe to say that the ceremony was a big coming out moment for the extended Harris-Emhoff clan. Ella Emhoff , the vice president's stepdaughter, turned heads with her quirky sparkle-laden Miu Miu coat-which turns out to be just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to her Ella's art-school-kid style, as evidenced by her Instagram page , which is full of her modeling unique clothes she's made herself. Guessing her follower count is gonna see a bump.\n\nAnother one of Kamala's most stylish relatives might be her niece Meena Harris, who rocked a green dress and silver boots to the inauguration, but whose husband, Nikolas Ajagu, may have outshone her with his Air Jordan Dior 1s ... if it weren't for both of them being outdone by their daughters, wearing furry animal-print coats inspired by a coat Kamala wore in a childhood photo Meena shared on Twitter.\n\nWE IN HERE AMERICA pic.twitter.com/8qrE6aytoH\n\nThe mystery man wearing the Air Jordan Dior 1s is Nikolas Ajagu, husband of Meena Harris, Kamala's niece. #Inauguration pic.twitter.com/kuyn20Mr2z\n\nSpecial coats to look just like Auntie's. pic.twitter.com/3WHaysbj4A\n\nElsewhere in new faces, inaugural poet Amanda Gorman proved that she is just as good at putting together outfits as she is at putting together words, wearing a bright yellow Prada coat, a red satin headband, and a red bejeweled mask that was probably the best face covering of the day.\n\nNo fashion roundup of the inauguration would be complete without an overview of the pop stars in attendance. National anthem singer Lady Gaga, whose most recent album title, Chromatica , preordained that she would not be limited to one color, wore a custom Schiaparelli Couture ball gown , featuring a navy long-sleeve top and low-waisted red bell skirt. With milkmaid-style braids and an oversize gold dove pin, Gaga did a nice job of integrating \"inauguration-appropriate\" with the ongoing performance art piece that is being Lady Gaga.\n\nOur other present pop star was Jennifer Lopez, who graced the inauguration crowd with a \"This Land Is Your Land\"/\"America the Beautiful\" medley. (She threw in a little bit of \"Let's Get Loud,\" which was ... a moment.) Lopez wore classic all white, but she did some texture-mixing in there too, pairing a ruffled shirt with sequined pants and a Chanel coat.\n\nDespite lacking the glamour of a J. Lo or a Gaga, social media was as enthralled with Sen. Bernie Sanders as ever, praising his coat- the same one he's wearing in an image that's become a meme , and thus confirming that he is a frugal king-as well as his mittens, which were made from repurposed wool sweaters and, according to his admirers , provide undeniable proof of his competence, because of the extremely low odds of owning a pair of mittens for two years without losing them.\n\nLadies don't have the privilege of going full unkempt Bernie in their looks, but it was nice to see some kind words for Treasury Secretary-designate Janet Yellen's more casual vibe as well: She had on a black puffer coat and was sensibly keeping warm under a blanket.\n\neveryone is talking about Michelle Obama but turns out my fashion icon is Janet Yellen pic.twitter.com/10snrjcDpS\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren was also in a no-frills puffer coat, but her pink blanket scarf with a prominent Planned Parenthood logo on it was a nice touch. Being practical and sticking to your principles: hopefully that will never go out of style.\n\nBruce and I are honored to be at the Capitol for the inauguration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.

Bandleader Gregg Alexander, broadcasting from Pennsylvania, explained that \"when we heard that 'You Get What You Give' was a Biden family anthem, we pledged [that] if Joe won, we'd get together and play our little song, both in memory and in honor of our new president's patriot son Beau, and also with the prayer of Joe being able to bring our country together again.\"\n\nThe video, tweeted by the Biden Inaugural Committee, shows Alexander dedicating the song to Biden and Harris before cutting away to the New Radicals' performance as well as a montage of Americans from all over the country holding signs displaying their cities' names and aphorisms celebrating a new political era.\n\nWe are honored that the New Radicals reunited for this moment (featuring one of @SecondGentleman Doug Emhoff's favorite songs!) 🎶 #Inauguration2021 pic.twitter.com/UUHmyAwxQ0\n\nThe performance is one for heartstrings: Alexander and his bandmates still sound great, and the iconic hat that graced his group's one and only album cover makes a prominent appearance. But the reunion jam conspicuously omits the controversial bridge of the song, which reads as follows:\n\nHealth insurance ripoff, lying\n\nFDA, big bankers buying\n\nFake computer crashes dining\n\nCloning while they're multiplying\n\nFashion shoots with Beck and Hanson,\n\nCourtney Love and Marilyn Manson\n\nYou're all fakes\n\nRun to your mansions\n\nCome around\n\nWe'll kick your ass in!\n\nWe presume that, in the spirit of Biden's pledge to be a president for \"all Americans,\" the New Radicals did not wish to engage in divisive rhetoric by repeating old disses and potentially alienating the all-important voting bloc of Gen X alt-rock fans.\n\n-Nitish Pahwa\n\nAfter taking his place at the Oval Office desk on Wednesday afternoon, President Joe Biden signed 15 executive orders that cover some of the most urgent priorities his administration plans to address within the first 100 days. The measures include several COVID-19 orders, rollbacks of Trump administration orders, and plans for tackling longer-term issues like climate change. Among the most significant of the orders:\n\n• Mask-wearing and social distancing mandates for federal employees\n\n• A declaration to rejoin the World Health Organization\n\n• A call for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to extend its eviction moratorium until March 31\n\n• A \"pause\" on student loan payments until Sept. 30\n\n• An end to the so-called Muslim travel ban, which restricted foreign nationals from several primarily Muslim and African countries from entering the U.S.\n\n• Protections for Dreamers and other undocumented immigrants, as well as an end to border wall construction and a direction to the Census Bureau to count noncitizens within the census again\n\n• A recommitment to the Paris Agreement\n\n• A freeze of last-minute Trump administration deregulations\n\n• A revocation of permits for the Keystone XL Pipeline\n\nSome of these actions can be carried out by Biden's Cabinet, while others will likely make their way to Congress as legislation. But with the Senate split 50-50 and the filibuster alive and well, we'll see how that goes.\n\n-Nitish Pahwa\n\nIn the weeks following the Jan. 6 riot that enveloped Congress, there had been chatter on social media about more violent insurrection attempts at state capitols from Jan. 16 to Jan. 20 . The FBI issued warnings last week that it had received intel concerning armed protests at the capitols in all 50 states. Police departments across the country announced that they would be stepping up security in and around their state capitols. More than a dozen states also mobilized National Guard troops in preparation for the potential unrest. Yet those threats failed to materialize on Inauguration Day. Photo dispatches from a variety of state capitols indicated that the protests were extremely sparse and largely peaceful.\n\nMark Leggiero is the one lone Trump supporter out in front of the NYS Capitol.

Alex Padilla of California and Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff of Georgia into office on Wednesday afternoon. It was a historic event in a number of ways: the first woman and person of color to hold the vice presidency swearing into office the first Hispanic senator from California and first Black and Jewish senators from Georgia, making Chuck Schumer the first Jewish Senate majority leader. In order to seat Padilla, Harris had to announce that the seat had opened up because of her own ascension to the vice presidency and read her own name. It was both awkward and cute, and Harris burst into laughter before saying, \"That was very weird.\"\n\n\"Ok that was really weird.\" - @VP Harris laughs as she presides over filling the Senate vacancies, including her own. pic.twitter.com/JDVscSqC8z\n\nShe then swore in the new senators, along with new Senate President Pro Tempore Patrick Leahy of Vermont, who now moves third in line for the presidency behind Harris and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.\n\nBREAKING: Democrats gain control of US Senate as VP Harris swears in Jon Ossoff, Raphael Warnock and Alex Padilla as the chamber's newest members. pic.twitter.com/MvOQS2s5MF\n\nNew Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, meanwhile, appeared at one point to be a bit verklempt at his own historic promotion. He gave a speech that at least seemed to nod at the consequence of this moment and the necessity for his majority to deliver bold action. \"This will be an exceptionally busy and consequential period for the United States Senate. There is much to do and we are ready to get to work,\" Schumer said. \"As the majority changes in the Senate, the Senate will do business differently. The Senate will address the challenges our country faces head-on and without delay. Not with timid solutions, but with boldness and with courage.\"\n\nSchumer also seemed to go out of his way to state definitively that his majority would be seeking to approve major action on climate change. \"Make no mistake, the Senate will forcefully, consistently, and urgently address the greatest threat to this country and to our planet, climate change,\" Biden said. \"This Senate will legislate. It will be active, responsive, energetic, and bold.\" He then nodded toward the need for bipartisanship and unity, but the affirmative declaration that the Senate would be legislating, and specifically on climate change, should be a welcome sign for those worried that a split 50-50 Senate with Harris as the tiebreaking vote would lead to an overly timid Democratic conference.\n\nDemocrats will likely have to push through much of their agenda via the reconciliation process, which allows for a majority vote, to get around any Republican filibuster. The indication has been, though, that Schumer will not give in to a request by now-Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to include a promise not to kill the filibuster in an agreement on how to run the 50-50 split Senate. Removing that at least as a potential threat would destroy much of Schumer's leverage in any effort to pass legislation on a bipartisan basis. On Tuesday, the majority leader seemed to indicate he would bow to no such agreement, with a spokesman releasing a statement saying that he had told McConnell \"that the fairest, most reasonable and easiest path forward is to adopt the 2001 bipartisan agreement without extraneous changes from either side.\"\n\nDuring his first speech as minority leader, McConnell called on \"both parties to find common ground for the common good everywhere that we can and disagree respectively where we must.\"\n\n-Jeremy Stahl\n\nIn a piece about prospective executive orders , the Hill has what appears to be a scoop: On Feb. 2, Biden plans to sign an order reinstating the Obama administration goal of closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility for \"war on terror\" detainees. As Slate's Joshua Keating anticipated recently , however, the new president will face the same congressional and public relations obstacles to actually closing the base that Obama did, and it's not yet clear how (or even if) he plans to try and change the political math on the issue in his favor.\n\n- Ben Mathis-Lilley\n\nWe talked to some members of a National Guard unit from Pennsylvania. They are excruciatingly bored. They felt so unconcerned about everything going on that they're not really paying attention to the people walking by-mostly reporters at this point.\n\nThe members we talked to were here for the inauguration four years ago and said it was also uneventful. This time around, they're passing their time just talking about \"dumb stuff\" they hoped no one could overhear and making fun of the new guy in their unit. (They called it \"therapy.\") They felt overprepared, but said that's the way they liked it. They complained that they had to carry heavy bulletproof vests with plates in them-they are hoping their security gets downgraded and they can use less heavy vests.\n\nThis group got to D.C. on Saturday, and they initially were staying in a hotel. More recently, they've been sleeping on the floor of a federal building. They say it's fine-it's warm, and they've dealt with worse. Their main concern is that they still don't know when they get to go home.\n\n-Molly Olmstead and Aymann Ismail\n\nAt least some D.C. locals were not totally cheering the departure of Trump from the city: the street vendors who hawk branded political merchandise to visitors from out of town. Two weeks ago, business was brisk. Today, it was terrible.\n\n\"Trump supporters bought more than Biden. This ain't nowhere close to what Trump did,\" one told me about his sales.\n\nHe lamented the fortress around the Capitol and seemed to miss the rioters who filled these streets two weeks ago. \"They were buying like crazy. Anything that said 'Trump,' they bought.\"\n\n\"Anything that says 'Biden,' they walk past,\" he said of today's small factions of mostly Biden-friendly passersby. He had sold four items all day.\n\n-Aymann Ismail\n\nTwenty-two-year-old Amanda Gorman, the nation's first-ever National Youth Poet Laureate, gave an energetic and well-received delivery of a new poem, \"The Hill We Climb,\" after Biden was sworn in. Here's her performance:\n\nFULL AMANDA GORMAN POEM: \"We will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one ... There is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it. If only we're brave enough to be it.\" The 22-year-old is the youngest inaugural poet in U.S. history: https://t.co/SIPU57hEKH pic.twitter.com/X4JQZO8rlY\n\nGorman completed the poem after the Jan. 6 occupation of the Capitol, and it makes direct reference to those events .\n\n- Ben Mathis-Lilley\n\nAn accurate observation by our colleague Joel:\n\nremain impressed by people who can sit comfortably with their legs crossed like this. bernie has some real hip flexibility. pic.twitter.com/oQqvluPmrR\n\nAccording to some internet research, Sanders stays active by taking walks , chopping wood , and doing his own laundry and shopping. He's also known to participate in sports on the campaign trail and has purportedly cut high-fat food out of his diet since his October 2019 heart attack.\n\n- Ben Mathis-Lilley\n\nJoe Biden was sworn in shortly before noon by Chief Justice John Roberts, officially making him the 46 th president of the United States.\n\nFor the ritual, Biden placed his hand on a bulky Bible that has been in his family since 1893 . It's tradition for a president-elect to choose the Bible for the ceremony. Biden has used his family Bible, which features a Celtic cross, throughout his political career, including when he took oaths for his Senate seat and the vice presidency. Beau Biden, the president's son, did the same during his swearing-in as the Delaware attorney general. Presidents Ronald Reagan and Franklin D. Roosevelt also used family Bibles for their inaugurations. Biden's Bible is 5 inches thick and is bound in leather. It's also been inscribed with the dates of each of Biden's swearing-in ceremonies. He is the country's second Catholic president, after John F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nPresident Biden's hand on the bible. #InaugurationDay pic.twitter.com/4RTrBRmHea\n\n-Aaron Mak\n\nAfter attending a Catholic church service in downtown D.C., President-Elect Joe Biden rode down Connecticut Avenue on his way to the Capitol for his inauguration. Waving furiously from the sidewalk were three visitors in town from Tennessee. They were en route to the Capitol, too, and had the good luck of stumbling across the motorcade by chance.\n\n\"He saw us, he saw us!\" said Yessica Leon, 33, who had voted for Biden in November in her first U.S. election. Leon, who was wearing a spangled Biden-Harris mask and holding a matching flag, is originally from Mexico City. \"I just got my citizenship last year,\" she said. \"I was like, uh, first time voting and my candidate won?! So it was a big deal for me.\"\n\nLeon supported Biden for his positions on immigration. Her parents, who have lived in the U.S. for 19 years, stand to benefit from Biden's proposed plan to offer pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Leon's sister, a DACA recipient, will qualify for Biden's plans to shore up the program and allow recipients to apply for green cards immediately.\n\nLeon was joined by her son, 13-year-old Balian Sanders, and her cousin, 19-year-old Bryan Godinez. Back in November, Godinez, who'd also voted for Biden in his first election, had asked Leon if she wanted to go to D.C. for the inauguration. \"It's his fault,\" Leon said. \"He texted me, 'Hey, are we going?' and I was like, 'Why not?' \" The trip was also planned as a celebration for Leon's birthday, which was Tuesday.\n\n\"I didn't actually believe she was going to want to go,\" Godinez said. His immediate family will also benefit from Biden's immigration proposals.\n\nThe three briefly reconsidered their plans after the Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6 but decided, since they already had their tickets, they'd take as many safety precautions as possible and keep their trip on the books. Their plans for a tour of the monuments were foiled by the militarized blockade of federal property in the city, but they'd rented Capital Bikeshare bikes and set a full agenda for the day.\n\n\"We're just gonna try to follow [Biden] around,\" Leon said. \"We've got his schedule.\"\n\n-Christina Cauterucci\n\nIn lieu of the crowds that would normally be present at a presidential inauguration, organizers for Joe Biden's swearing-in have filled the National Mall with more than 191,500 American flags to represent the people who are unable to attend due to the coronavirus pandemic and the threat of another insurrection attempt. The flags are grouped in 56 pillars representing the states and territories. The Presidential Inaugural Committee illuminated the flags in a ceremony on Tuesday that took about 46 seconds, symbolizing Biden's role as the 46 th president of the country. The committee had requested that people not travel to D.C. to witness the inauguration and instead participate virtually . \"This Field of Flags, which will cover the National Mall up to 13th Street, will represent the American people who are unable to travel to Washington, DC, and reflect PIC's commitment to an inclusive and safe event that everyone can enjoy from their home,\" the committee said in a statement . In order to promote social distancing, organizers have only distributed about 1,000 tickets for the event, when in normal times that number would be around 200,000. There are also enhanced security measures in place, including the presence of 25,000 members of the National Guard.\n\n200k flags have been placed on the #NationalMall representing people from around the world who would gather for the #Inauguration of President Biden & VP Harris.

One had a Biden-Harris hat on, but most of the others looked like they had been out for a morning jog. A 60-year-old woman with an American flag said she'd come out to try to see Biden. Another woman expressed mild (and possibly amused) frustration that the street was blocked off and she couldn't get to her office. \"I knew I should have brought my laptop home with me last night,\" she said on a phone call.\n\n-Molly Olmstead\n\nIt's desolate out here in D.C. Nearly everyone I've seen on the ground has been in official tactical gear. In the end, the National Park Service reported it approved just one protest permit for Inauguration Day -and it's for a left-wing group that will be outside the secure perimeter. Another group, \"Let America Hear Us, Roar for Trump,\" also sought a permit, but was refused after it repeatedly declined to speak about its plans.\n\nThis morning, I saw self-described \"antifa scum\" hanging out at Black Lives Matter Plaza:\n\nI've encountered exactly one Trump supporter. He declined to be interviewed shortly after the president spoke a final time. \"I'm pissed off,\" he told me. \"Trump let me down.\" Then he stormed off.\n\n-Aymann Ismail\n\nTrump's final speech as president, classically rambling and suitably bizarre, included a thank-you to Mike Pence (who declined to attend ) and promised \"we will be back, in some form.\" The remarks were off script.\n\nIf you can endure the rest of it, you'll be rewarded with a sublime send-off from the president. Goodbye, Donald Trump.\n\n-Jeffrey Bloomer\n\nAfter all, Trump did leave Biden a note, a White House official confirms.\n\nSo far the changing of the presidential guard hasn't been as much a \"transition\" as a painstaking process of peeling back one president's fingers from his grip on the White House. Trump, who isn't diplomatic or magnanimous or gracious, hasn't acted as such during the months since he lost the presidency-no dignified concession, no gracious presidential tour of the White House, no attending his opponent's inauguration. It all adds up for a president who doesn't believe in anything larger than himself. But Trump reportedly left Biden a note! Perhaps a ransom of some sort. Since Trump is not exactly a man of letters, or emotions, the over-under on its length, according to me, is nine words-not including the signature.\n\n-Elliot Hannon\n\nThis didn't always seem like a foregone conclusion, but it actually happened. Donald Trump no longer occupies the White House. He still has just under four hours remaining as president to do something bonkers or terrifying, but we're almost there.\n\nWATCH: President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump depart the White House for the final time  en route to Joint Base Andrews for their flight to Mar-a-Lago https://t.co/uuOO71t2C6 pic.twitter.com/IHsNDcLAKX\n\n-Elliot Hannon\n\nTrump is set to depart the White House at 8 a.m. Vice President Mike Pence is not expected to be there.\n\nReporters are now gathering for President Trump's final White House departure. He's expected to leave the building at 8 a.m.\n\n-Elliot Hannon\n\nWednesday also marks the most fraught handover of (digital) power in social media history-the @POTUS Twitter account. At noon Wednesday, the presidential account, along with the attendant accounts @WhiteHouse, @VP, @FLOTUS, and @PressSec, will all change hands , but not without some controversy! When Biden's teams assume control of the official accounts of the presidency, unlike four years ago, the new owner won't automatically retain the account's followers-33 million of them when it comes to @POTUS.\n\n\"These institutional accounts will not automatically retain the followers from the prior administration,\" Twitter wrote on its blog about the handover. \"People on Twitter who previously followed institutional White House Twitter accounts, or who currently follow relevant Biden or Harris Twitter accounts, will receive in-app alerts and other prompts that will notify them about the archival process, as well as give them the option to follow the new administration's Twitter accounts.\"\n\nIt's not totally clear why Twitter is purging the U.S. government accounts. The Biden digital team seems annoyed , but surely has bigger things to worry about. Facebook and YouTube are also transitioning Wednesday.\n\n-Elliot Hannon\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Biden's Granddaughters! Bernie's Mittens! All of Michelle Obama!\n\nJoe Biden's inauguration isn't just a relief in terms of politics. It's also a relief in terms of style: After four years of Scotch-taped ties and generally upsetting aesthetics , we can finally expect some more appealing visuals. At Biden's swearing-in ceremony on Wednesday, he, along with Vice President Kamala Harris, their families, and other attendees, gave us our first official glimpse at what the fashion of the Biden years might have in store. And it was pretty spectacular, honestly.\n\nPresident Joe Biden wore an understated navy suit and overcoat, both by Ralph Lauren, but no surprises here: The women's outfits were far more worthy of discussion. First lady Jill Biden, in a turquoise-y blue coat and matching dress by Markarian, an up-and-coming American label, partook in one of the big trends of the day, dressing monochromatically. As notable as all the head-to-toe looks in one color were, each woman was able to put her own spin on it, and Jill's, with her textured wool and darker collar and cuffs, had a touch of fairy godmother-from- Sleeping Beauty whimsy to it. Both the president and the first lady wore masks as well, a choice that seems like a no-brainer in the pandemic but that certainly has never before been a common sight at an inauguration. In contrast to the superspreader events of the Trump White House, the sea of masked faces was some kind of relief . The question of how to pair masks with formalwear also introduced a novel challenge here-the first lady led the way by opting for a shade similar to the rest of her outfit.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris answered the question of what the first-ever female vice president wears to be sworn in: a purple suit by Christopher John Rogers, an American designer who is Black and queer, with darker gloves and a black mask. The emphasis on uplifting American designers represents a return to the Obama era, when first lady Michelle Obama was known for championing American, and often Black American, labels.\n\nThough pantsuits are normally Kamala's thing, for the inauguration, she went a bit more feminine and formal. (She also skipped the Chucks.) Vogue and other outlets speculated that the purple, though it looked royal blue in some lights à la the Dress , may have been a reference to both the women's suffrage movement and the idea of bipartisanship, purple being the result of mixing red and blue; others said it called back to her campaign colors and Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman to run for president as a major-party candidate.* Kamala also wore a set of pearls-by an American designer of Puerto Rican heritage, Wilfredo Rosado-that have special significance to members of the sorority she was part of at Howard University, Alpha Kappa Alpha.\n\nBut the undisputed showstopper of the day, to judge by the rapture online, was Michelle Obama in another monochromatic standout in a maroon look by Sergio Hudson, a Black American designer. The outfit's floor-length coat, funky belt, and high-waisted, bell-bottomed pants added some serious swagger to the day's proceedings, as befitting a post-presidency first lady who can dress like she has Netflix money and no more campaigns or approval ratings to worry about ever again.\n\nSome more ecstatic favorites from the day included the Biden granddaughters, who wore pantsuits and matching jackets (and masks) in pink, white, and tan, leading more than one Twitter user to joke that they were serving Neapolitan-ice cream chic . Their only real in-family competition? Hunter Biden's baby son Beau, having a plaid/bonnet moment.\n\nMore monochromatic queens included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in blue and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton-remember her?-who opted for a similar shade of purple as Kamala with her pantsuit selection, but her choice of a darker jacket gave the look decidedly less drama.\n\nMeanwhile, it's safe to say that the ceremony was a big coming out moment for the extended Harris-Emhoff clan. Ella Emhoff , the vice president's stepdaughter, turned heads with her quirky sparkle-laden Miu Miu coat-which turns out to be just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to her Ella's art-school-kid style, as evidenced by her Instagram page , which is full of her modeling unique clothes she's made herself. Guessing her follower count is gonna see a bump.\n\nAnother one of Kamala's most stylish relatives might be her niece Meena Harris, who rocked a green dress and silver boots to the inauguration, but whose husband, Nikolas Ajagu, may have outshone her with his Air Jordan Dior 1s ... if it weren't for both of them being outdone by their daughters, wearing furry animal-print coats inspired by a coat Kamala wore in a childhood photo Meena shared on Twitter.\n\nWE IN HERE AMERICA pic.twitter.com/8qrE6aytoH\n\nThe mystery man wearing the Air Jordan Dior 1s is Nikolas Ajagu, husband of Meena Harris, Kamala's niece. #Inauguration pic.twitter.com/kuyn20Mr2z\n\nSpecial coats to look just like Auntie's. pic.twitter.com/3WHaysbj4A\n\nElsewhere in new faces, inaugural poet Amanda Gorman proved that she is just as good at putting together outfits as she is at putting together words, wearing a bright yellow Prada coat, a red satin headband, and a red bejeweled mask that was probably the best face covering of the day.\n\nNo fashion roundup of the inauguration would be complete without an overview of the pop stars in attendance. National anthem singer Lady Gaga, whose most recent album title, Chromatica , preordained that she would not be limited to one color, wore a custom Schiaparelli Couture ball gown , featuring a navy long-sleeve top and low-waisted red bell skirt. With milkmaid-style braids and an oversize gold dove pin, Gaga did a nice job of integrating \"inauguration-appropriate\" with the ongoing performance art piece that is being Lady Gaga.\n\nOur other present pop star was Jennifer Lopez, who graced the inauguration crowd with a \"This Land Is Your Land\"/\"America the Beautiful\" medley. (She threw in a little bit of \"Let's Get Loud,\" which was ... a moment.) Lopez wore classic all white, but she did some texture-mixing in there too, pairing a ruffled shirt with sequined pants and a Chanel coat.\n\nDespite lacking the glamour of a J. Lo or a Gaga, social media was as enthralled with Sen. Bernie Sanders as ever, praising his coat- the same one he's wearing in an image that's become a meme , and thus confirming that he is a frugal king-as well as his mittens, which were made from repurposed wool sweaters and, according to his admirers , provide undeniable proof of his competence, because of the extremely low odds of owning a pair of mittens for two years without losing them.\n\nLadies don't have the privilege of going full unkempt Bernie in their looks, but it was nice to see some kind words for Treasury Secretary-designate Janet Yellen's more casual vibe as well: She had on a black puffer coat and was sensibly keeping warm under a blanket.\n\neveryone is talking about Michelle Obama but turns out my fashion icon is Janet Yellen pic.twitter.com/10snrjcDpS\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren was also in a no-frills puffer coat, but her pink blanket scarf with a prominent Planned Parenthood logo on it was a nice touch. Being practical and sticking to your principles: hopefully that will never go out of style.\n\nBruce and I are honored to be at the Capitol for the inauguration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.

      "text": "Obama's Inaugural Poet on Amanda Gorman, and the Voices America Needs to Hear\n\nSubscribe to What Next on Apple Podcasts for the full episode.\n\nBefore today, there had only been five poets at U.S. presidential inaugurations , the very first being Robert Frost at John F. Kennedy's swearing-in. When Richard Blanco performed at President Barack Obama's 2013 inauguration, he was, at the time, the youngest inaugural poet, the first Latinx inaugural poet, and the first gay inaugural poet-and he'd been selected personally by Obama. As a new administration enters the White House, relieved Americans tuned in to see a new vision of the country as articulated by President Joe Biden and by his inaugural poet, Amanda Gorman, who spoke with Blanco before she performed her poem \"The Hill We Climb.\" On Wednesday's episode of What Next , I spoke with Blanco about preparing for Obama's inauguration, his view of the U.S. then versus now, and where he thinks we go from here. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nMary Harris: That overall message of unity in your inauguration poem, \" One Today ,\" I've been thinking about it a lot over the past few days because it's such a powerful and appealing message, but at the same time that unity seems harder than ever to achieve. If you were going to read the inaugural poem this year, would your message change?\n\nRichard Blanco: Somewhat. That poem is already making a statement like, we're not really one, we need to check ourselves, and we need to think about what this what this this charge is, what this great experiment is. That means going back to the drawing table and seeing what went wrong. Where has this gone awry? How did we end up here?\n\nSomething I didn't know until I was preparing for this interview is that you actually wrote three potential poems for Obama's inauguration, and the president's team chose \"One Today.\"\n\nYeah, they asked me to write three poems. I'm not exactly sure why. I think they were running a little behind because there was another budgetary crisis. But it was interesting to have the assignment-those poems each made me think about different things.\n\n\"One Today,\" the poem you ended up reading, focused on things that unite us. Then \" Mother Country \" was about your mother and her deep attachment to the United States. But the first poem you gave the White House was called \"What We Know of Country.\" It's darker.\n\nListen to Richard Blanco read \"What We Know of Country,\" or read the full poem below.\n\nThose picture books from grade-school days: Pilgrims in tall hats, their gold-buckled shoes I wanted so badly. White-wigged men standing tall in velvet-curtained rooms, holding feathers in their hands, inked words buzzing off the page into my heart's ear: Life, Liberty, Happiness for we, the people, singing of shining seas crossed, the spacious skies of a God-blessed land when a song and a book were all I knew of country.\n\nI've forgotten the capital of Vermont and Iowa, but I remember my eyes on a map mesmerized by faraway cities, towns I couldn't pronounce, or believe the vast body of this land belonged to me, and I to it: the Rockies' spine, blue stare of the Great Lakes, and the endless shoulders of coastlines, the curvy hips of harbors, rivers like my palms' lines traced with wonder from beginning to end, the tiny red dot of my heart marking where I lived-when what I knew of country was only what I read from a map.\n\nI wanted to live in the house I dreamed from television: cushy sofas, crystal candy dishes, mothers who served perfectly roasted turkeys with instant stuffing, children with allowances and perfect teeth, fathers driving teal-blue cars with silver fins to some country club I'd surely belong to someday. Though the gunfire, blood of war beamed into my bedroom, though I fell asleep, though our men from the moon landed on my roof with empty promises from space- fantasy was still all I could believe of country.\n\nI didn't want to change the channel, but I did: I lifted the shades, let light shine on the carpets stained with lies I'd missed, and saw the dust of secrets settled over the photos. The house began to creak, fall apart around me, alone for years waiting at the kitchen table, the last to know, asking my reflection in the windows: How could you, America? With no answer for all I knew of country was my hurt and rage.\n\nBut home was home: I dusted off the secrets, cleaned up the lies, nailed the creaky floors down, set a fire, and sat with history books I'd never opened, listened to songs I'd never played, pulled out the old map from a dark drawer, redrew it with more colors, less lines. I stoked the fire, burning on until finally: Okay, nothing's perfect, I understood, I forgive you , I said-and forgiveness became my country.\n\nI stayed, you stayed, we stayed for our boys and girls returning as heroes, some without legs or arms, for our Challenger and Towers fainting from the sky, for the terrified lives of the Big Easy stranded like flightless birds on roofs, for the sea that drowned our North, but we swept each grain of sand back to shore, for the candles we lit for our twenty children of Sandy Hook, feeling what we've always felt: to know a country takes all we know of love:\n\nsome days better than others, but never easy to keep our promise every morning of every year, of every century, and wake up, stumble downstairs with all our raging hope, sit down at the kitchen table again, still blurry-eyed, still tired, and say: Listen, we need to talk .\n\nYou've called \"What We Know of Country\" a \"braver\" poem than \"One Today.\"\n\nIt is a bit braver. It's a little more in your face, so to speak, because it acknowledges that complexity that we have with our country. It takes us through the stages. For example, it begins with when you're a little kid, you know, you're learning about this great country and liberty and justice for all and all these great ideals, and you believe all that. Especially as an immigrant kid, you know, it's just the idea that that meant so much to me. Then it's high school, college, when you start learning some of the real history of the United States, that we're not we're certainly not innocent, that there's a lot of blood on our hands. There was a period of my life where I got really angry at America. I was like, how could you do this to me? I think that's one of those line lines in the poem. How could you?\n\nYou've said that early on in your career you tried to avoid politics, and that was partially because you grew up as a Cuban exile in Miami and you were aware of how polarizing politics could be. I wonder if you can explain that a little bit.\n\nThat's exactly right. It's growing up around so much rhetoric but also realizing, in the history books and the classes, you'd read one thing and again, you see it at home or the community as another thing. For example, as we all know historically, for Cuban exiles in general, JFK was a traitor-many Cubans turned Republican because of the Bay of Pigs. And then you read in the third and fourth grade history books that he's this great hero. Who's telling the truth, and where is the truth, and what is perspective?\n\nI can't see that other America that I'm supposed to love. I contextualized a lot of that through TV. And that's in that poem. I thought that once you left Miami there was a Brady Bunch is everywhere. I wanted that life to write, and so I described it. And I don't have a real Cuba either. I mean, Miami was Cuban, but it wasn't Cuba either.\n\nI always describe it as living between two real imagined stories. One is the story of Cuba, this place we came from, this country that's supposedly paradise in some ways, and all this turmoil that is my history that I knew nothing about. And then the other real imagined narrative was this America, that we weren't quite there yet either.\n\nEverything was a blur. And isn't that where art lives? Right in the gray area. It's in that space where I think I've always found truth.\n\nI think it's interesting that in some of your poetry, you tap into the idea that Donald Trump used those familiar television tropes and made the idea that that was somehow the real America. Part of the reason you've talked about why that touches so many people is we all grew up watching that same story play out.\n\nIn this new book, in the poem titled \"Let's Remake America Great,\" I start critiquing that and realizing that that is actually a fantasy, that it wasn't real. And not only that, but that it was a dangerous fantasy. America was never that great.\n\nAt the time you were selected to read at President Barack Obama's inauguration, you were the youngest inaugural poet ever. And you were fortysomething, right?\n\nI was 44.\n\nThis time the poet, Amanda Gorman, is 22. I heard she was in touch with you.\n\nWe got to connect. I got to say she's an ace. Just an amazing human being, amazing spirit.\n\nWhat did you want her to know?\n\nMostly what a beautiful experience this is going to be, because on the surface, it feels so terrifying and it can feel like overwhelming. In my case, I had to read in front of a million people. What do you do with that? So I wanted to let her know that it's absolutely gorgeous once-in-a-lifetime experience and that she should embrace it, take it all in, and enjoy every second.\n\nI can't be any more pleased with their choice. This country right now needs a young voice. You can't solve a problem with the same paradigm that created it, so to speak. I think we need the input of our youth to help us with this mess we've created.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Words Mean Something Again\n\nJoe Biden has struggled with a stutter for most of his life. He has publicly described what that impediment does to a soul . So it is fitting that Biden ushered in his presidency with a speech about fragility, brokenness, and the possibility of overcoming the most intractable challenges. The speech was perhaps not a master class in public oratory. But it was a perfect mapping of language to self. He is what he speaks, from \"C'mon man,\" to \"Look, folks.\" And on Wednesday, he seemed to understand that his words weren't just words. They were words wrested from his soul, offered up to all of us. As he put it, \"My whole soul is in it today, on this January day.\"\n\nIt is impossible to witness the transition from the Trump era to the Biden administration without reflecting on the power of words, the effort that goes into controlling one's words, and the moral and political utility of finding precisely the right ones. This was a day of carefully chosen, hard-fought voice. It follows an age of careless, rash, heedless spew that tumbled forth from a leadership that believed words didn't matter, or that they were so fluid as to mean everything and nothing. What a profound, audible, relief it is to bear witness to speeches wrenched from the mouths of those who have learned not to take them for granted.\n\nA daily email update of the stories you need to read right now.\n\nThere has been so much lying over these past four years. So much violence done to language, which is then cast as jokes or irony or merely what \"other people\" are saying. So much of our work of the past four years has been to find the bits of truth in the ash heap. That's why it matters that Biden's words today came from a tongue that used to fail him. He knows their power. They aren't easy trinkets for him. And unlike Trump's \" American carnage\" speech from four years ago-a speech full of lies about the Constitution and about freedom , lies he then toiled to make truth -Biden's speech centered on what is real.\n\n\"There is truth and there are lies,\" he said. \"Lies told for power and for profit. And each of us has a duty and a responsibility as citizens, as Americans, and especially as leaders-leaders who have pledged to honor our Constitution to protect our nation-to defend the truth and defeat the lies.\" He closed his speech with a promise: \"My fellow Americans, I close the day where I began, with a sacred oath. Before God and all of you, I give you my word. I will always level with you. I will defend the Constitution. I'll defend our democracy.\"\n\nHis gave us his word. Which, in a moment when so many of us are broken from the lies-from the lies of the press secretaries to the lies of elected officials to the efforts to graft lies onto legal processes and democratic processes-felt like a revelation of possibility. Even with the enormous work that is surely ahead, the promise of truth as lodestar is something powerful and poetic.\n\nJoe Biden was not the only one at this inauguration to understand how hard-won delivering one's own words can be. Amanda Gorman, the poet laureate who cracked the inauguration ceremony into a million pieces with her poem , was also a child who overcame a speech impediment, by writing poems. Speaking to NPR about her struggles with pronunciation, she mentioned one of her predecessors, Maya Angelou, who also delivered an inaugural poem and was mute as a child.* \"I think there is a real history of orators who have had to struggle, a type of imposed voicelessness, you know, having that stage at inauguration,\" she said. \"So it's really special for me.\" Gorman's voice was perhaps the most poignant symbol for millions and millions of Americans who have been struggling to speak truth in the face of years of dark, pixelated nonsense.\n\nAs a project and a promise, reconnecting democracy to truth and to language seems both trivial and obvious. But that is where we currently are as a country. And it's fitting in the extreme that this was a day of excavated, hard-fought words, and not pretty, easy fibs. It was an inauguration that challenged us to use language to understand what has happened to us, and what we must do to move forward now. \"The new dawn blooms as we free it,\" Gorman closed. \"For there is always light, if only we are brave enough to see it-if only we are brave enough to be it.\"\n\nCorrection, Jan. 25, 2021: Due to an editing error, the original version of this piece stated that Amanda Gorman overcame a stutter. The speech impediment Gorman overcame was dropping letters.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

It's also a relief in terms of style: After four years of Scotch-taped ties and generally upsetting aesthetics , we can finally expect some more appealing visuals. At Biden's swearing-in ceremony on Wednesday, he, along with Vice President Kamala Harris, their families, and other attendees, gave us our first official glimpse at what the fashion of the Biden years might have in store. And it was pretty spectacular, honestly.\n\nPresident Joe Biden wore an understated navy suit and overcoat, both by Ralph Lauren, but no surprises here: The women's outfits were far more worthy of discussion. First lady Jill Biden, in a turquoise-y blue coat and matching dress by Markarian, an up-and-coming American label, partook in one of the big trends of the day, dressing monochromatically. As notable as all the head-to-toe looks in one color were, each woman was able to put her own spin on it, and Jill's, with her textured wool and darker collar and cuffs, had a touch of fairy godmother-from- Sleeping Beauty whimsy to it. Both the president and the first lady wore masks as well, a choice that seems like a no-brainer in the pandemic but that certainly has never before been a common sight at an inauguration. In contrast to the superspreader events of the Trump White House, the sea of masked faces was some kind of relief . The question of how to pair masks with formalwear also introduced a novel challenge here-the first lady led the way by opting for a shade similar to the rest of her outfit.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris answered the question of what the first-ever female vice president wears to be sworn in: a purple suit by Christopher John Rogers, an American designer who is Black and queer, with darker gloves and a black mask. The emphasis on uplifting American designers represents a return to the Obama era, when first lady Michelle Obama was known for championing American, and often Black American, labels.\n\nThough pantsuits are normally Kamala's thing, for the inauguration, she went a bit more feminine and formal. (She also skipped the Chucks.) Vogue and other outlets speculated that the purple, though it looked royal blue in some lights à la the Dress , may have been a reference to both the women's suffrage movement and the idea of bipartisanship, purple being the result of mixing red and blue; others said it called back to her campaign colors and Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman to run for president as a major-party candidate.* Kamala also wore a set of pearls-by an American designer of Puerto Rican heritage, Wilfredo Rosado-that have special significance to members of the sorority she was part of at Howard University, Alpha Kappa Alpha.\n\nBut the undisputed showstopper of the day, to judge by the rapture online, was Michelle Obama in another monochromatic standout in a maroon look by Sergio Hudson, a Black American designer. The outfit's floor-length coat, funky belt, and high-waisted, bell-bottomed pants added some serious swagger to the day's proceedings, as befitting a post-presidency first lady who can dress like she has Netflix money and no more campaigns or approval ratings to worry about ever again.\n\nSome more ecstatic favorites from the day included the Biden granddaughters, who wore pantsuits and matching jackets (and masks) in pink, white, and tan, leading more than one Twitter user to joke that they were serving Neapolitan-ice cream chic . Their only real in-family competition? Hunter Biden's baby son Beau, having a plaid/bonnet moment.\n\nMore monochromatic queens included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in blue and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton-remember her?-who opted for a similar shade of purple as Kamala with her pantsuit selection, but her choice of a darker jacket gave the look decidedly less drama.\n\nMeanwhile, it's safe to say that the ceremony was a big coming out moment for the extended Harris-Emhoff clan. Ella Emhoff , the vice president's stepdaughter, turned heads with her quirky sparkle-laden Miu Miu coat-which turns out to be just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to her Ella's art-school-kid style, as evidenced by her Instagram page , which is full of her modeling unique clothes she's made herself. Guessing her follower count is gonna see a bump.\n\nAnother one of Kamala's most stylish relatives might be her niece Meena Harris, who rocked a green dress and silver boots to the inauguration, but whose husband, Nikolas Ajagu, may have outshone her with his Air Jordan Dior 1s ... if it weren't for both of them being outdone by their daughters, wearing furry animal-print coats inspired by a coat Kamala wore in a childhood photo Meena shared on Twitter.\n\nWE IN HERE AMERICA pic.twitter.com/8qrE6aytoH\n\nThe mystery man wearing the Air Jordan Dior 1s is Nikolas Ajagu, husband of Meena Harris, Kamala's niece. #Inauguration pic.twitter.com/kuyn20Mr2z\n\nSpecial coats to look just like Auntie's. pic.twitter.com/3WHaysbj4A\n\nElsewhere in new faces, inaugural poet Amanda Gorman proved that she is just as good at putting together outfits as she is at putting together words, wearing a bright yellow Prada coat, a red satin headband, and a red bejeweled mask that was probably the best face covering of the day.\n\nNo fashion roundup of the inauguration would be complete without an overview of the pop stars in attendance. National anthem singer Lady Gaga, whose most recent album title, Chromatica , preordained that she would not be limited to one color, wore a custom Schiaparelli Couture ball gown , featuring a navy long-sleeve top and low-waisted red bell skirt. With milkmaid-style braids and an oversize gold dove pin, Gaga did a nice job of integrating \"inauguration-appropriate\" with the ongoing performance art piece that is being Lady Gaga.\n\nOur other present pop star was Jennifer Lopez, who graced the inauguration crowd with a \"This Land Is Your Land\"/\"America the Beautiful\" medley. (She threw in a little bit of \"Let's Get Loud,\" which was ... a moment.) Lopez wore classic all white, but she did some texture-mixing in there too, pairing a ruffled shirt with sequined pants and a Chanel coat.\n\nDespite lacking the glamour of a J.

Gorman, 22, wrote on Twitter that a security guard \"tailed\" her while she was walking home Friday night. \"He demanded if I lived there because 'you look suspicious.' I showed my keys & buzzed myself into my building,\" Gorman wrote . \"He left, no apology. This is the reality of black girls: One day you're called an icon, the next day, a threat.\"\n\nGorman wrote the Friday night tweet quoting another message she wrote in February linking to a Washington Post profile about her newly found stardom after the inauguration. \"We live in a contradictory society that can celebrate a black girl poet & also pepper spray a 9 yr old,\" Gorman wrote . \"Yes see me, but also see all other black girls who've been made invisible. I can not, will not, rise alone.\"\n\nIn a subsequent tweet, Gorman said that \"in a sense\" the security guard was right. \"I AM A THREAT: a threat to injustice, to inequality, to ignorance,\" she wrote . \"Anyone who speaks the truth and walks with hope is an obvious and fatal danger to the powers that be.\"\n\nGorman, who is from Los Angeles, was named the first national youth poet laureate in 2017 while she was a student at Harvard University. Three years earlier, when she was just 16, Gorman was named the first youth poet laureate of Los Angeles. This year, Gorman became the youngest poet to speak at a presidential inauguration and she recited the poem \" The Hill We Climb .\" She was widely celebrated for the poem , which she recited mere days after rioters stormed the Capitol while lawmakers certified the results of the presidential election.\n\n\"Somehow we weathered and witnessed a nation that isn't broken, but simply unfinished,\" Gorman read in part of the poem. \"We, the successors of a country and a time where a skinny Black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president, only to find herself reciting for one.\" A month later, Gorman performed at the Super Bowl preshow.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

Amanda Gorman, who is 22 years old and was named the first youth poet laureate of the United States in 2017, delivered her poem \"The Hill We Climb\" to the waiting crowd. Within minutes, her Twitter account jumped from 48,000 followers to 255,000 and counting.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times , Gorman, who graduated from Harvard last year with a degree in sociology, said she struggled to compose \"The Hill We Climb\" in the weeks leading up to the inauguration. Then came the Capitol riots of January 6.\n\nGorman says she stayed up late into the night after the riots, composing a poem that would address the violence of the day while still offering hope for the future. The result, which nods to the Broadway musical Hamilton , reads, in part, as follows:\n\nWe've seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it, Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy. And this effort very nearly succeeded. But while democracy can be periodically delayed, It can never be permanently defeated. In this truth, in this faith, we trust. For while we have our eyes on the future, History has its eyes on us.\n\n\"We have to confront these realities if we're going to move forward, so that's also an important touchstone of the poem,\" Gorman told the New York Times . \"There is space for grief and horror and hope and unity, and I also hope that there is a breath for joy in the poem, because I do think we have a lot to celebrate at this inauguration.\"\n\nGorman, who was chosen to write a poem for the inauguration after Jill Biden saw a video of her performing at the Library of Congress, has something in common with President Joe Biden. An audio processing disorder left her with a speech impediment at a young age, and she underwent extensive therapy to correct it, as Biden did with his own stutter . In 2018, Gorman told the Harvard Crimson that as a child, strangers who heard her impediment used to assume that she was a British or Nigerian immigrant.\n\n\"It kind of became my mini experiment,\" she said . \"If they thought I was from Europe, they would treat me very well, like I was a sophisticated intellectual; if I let them believe that I was from Nigeria, they'd make comments like, 'Oh, this is how credit cards work,' or, 'You might not know this in the village you come from.'\"\n\n\"But I don't look at my disability as a weakness,\" Gorman told the LA Times earlier this week. \"It's made me the performer that I am and the storyteller that I strive to be. When you have to teach yourself how to say sounds, when you have to be highly concerned about pronunciation, it gives you a certain awareness of sonics, of the auditory experience.\"\n\nDressed in a yellow Prada coat that she can also be seen modeling in an editorial campaign , Gorman delivered \"The Hill We Climb\" in a melodic spoken-word cadence, drifting from rhymed verse to free verse and back again.

And as education experts tell Vox, the bans can have the effect of cutting out entire groups and themes from students' learning experiences, particularly stories centering people of color and LGBTQ people.\n\nLast month, a Miami-Dade County school removed Amanda Gorman's poem \"The Hill We Climb\" from its elementary school collection following a complaint filed by a parent, according to a report by the Miami Herald . Gorman, who was 22 during the inauguration, was the country's national youth poet laureate at the time. Her poem, which she wrote shortly after the January 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection, laid out an optimistic vision of how the country could move forward and attempt to bridge its divides.\n\nIn the complaint, the parent reportedly flagged multiple books addressing Black history, and claimed that Gorman's poem \"indirectly\" featured \"hate messages.\" The poem is still available to the school's middle schoolers, but not younger readers. The decision to change access to the poem is alarming given both the message it contains, and the important historical context it provides.\n\nThe treatment of Gorman's poem, however, is just one example of a broader resurgence of book bans driven by Republican lawmakers across multiple states . Last year, Florida's legislature approved legislation that limited teachings about race and LGBTQ rights, both of which have led to certain books being removed from school shelves. Districts in states including Texas, Missouri, Utah, and South Carolina have also put forth similar restrictions. And according to an American Library Association Report , the number of book ban attempts at schools and public libraries reached a record high in 2022 and included nearly double the number of challenges that the group observed in 2021.\n\nAs Vox's Zack Beauchamp explained , Republican lawmakers have increasingly turned to book bans as a way to push an \"ideologically slanted vision of what children should learn about American culture, society, and history.\" In many cases, like the Florida laws, these bans have specifically focused on curbing information about systemic racism, LGBTQ identity, and the contributions of marginalized groups to American society. Educational experts emphasize that these bans mean students are exposed to a narrower range of ideas and that many may not see themselves represented in the literature they read.\n\n\"Unnecessary book bans like these are on the rise, and we must fight back,\" Gorman wrote in a Facebook post Tuesday responding to the Florida school's decision. \"Robbing children of the chance to find their voices in literature is a violation of their right to free thought and free speech.\"\n\nThe limits placed on Gorman's poem, like many other book bans in recent years, highlight how some schools and libraries are now restricting content that students are exposed to based simply on parental objections. In Florida, a new law passed by the legislature goes so far as to require that a book needs to be removed for review within five days of it being flagged by a parent or teacher.\n\nThe complaint about Gorman's poem , which was shared by the Florida Freedom to Read Project, an activist group dedicated to combating the state's restrictions, came from a parent who also raised concerns about other books focused on Black history and Cuba including titles The ABCs of Black History , Love to Langston , and Cuban Kids . The parent argued that Gorman's poem would \"cause confusion\" and \"indoctrinate students.\"\n\n\"It was determined at the school that 'The Hill We Climb' is better suited for middle school students and it was shelved in the middle school section of the media center,\" Miami-Dade County Public Schools spokesperson Elmo R.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nBiden's inauguration was marked by Covid-19 restrictions and high-security measures.\n\nby Kainaz Amaria and Ella Nilsen\n\nJoe Biden was sworn in as the 46th president of the United States on the steps of the US Capitol on Wednesday, surrounded by past presidents, members of Congress, and his family.\n\nIt was an unusual inauguration in many respects.\n\nThe National Mall that is usually teeming with spectators was mostly empty due to heightened security measures put in place following the recent insurrection and Covid-19 restrictions. In their place, 200,000 small flags were planted on the Mall to represent the number of Americans who couldn't attend the inauguration. On the steps of the Capitol, dignitaries and lawmakers wore masks and were spaced six feet apart.\n\nBiden took the oath of office and gave his address on the steps of a building that still bears the scars of a violent insurrection that took place two weeks ago, as supporters of outgoing President Donald Trump invaded the Capitol in an attempt to disrupt the legislative process of confirming Biden's electoral votes. The violence in the Capitol claimed at least five lives, including two US Capitol Police officers.\n\nAnd for the first time in 152 years, the outgoing president was not there to witness the incoming president take the oath of office. Trump had already departed for his home in Florida by the time the inauguration started; former Vice President Mike Pence was there instead.\n\nWith his hand placed on his family's Bible, President Biden took the oath of office at 11:50 am on Wednesday - about 10 minutes ahead of schedule. He officially became the 46th president at noon, in the middle of his inaugural address .\n\nSpeaking to the American public , Biden pleaded with a deeply and bitterly divided country to unite.\n\n\"This is America's day. This is democracy's day,\" Biden said. \"A day of history and hope - of renewal and resolve. We've learned again that democracy is precious; democracy is fragile. And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed.\"\n\nThe new president promised to be a president for all Americans, including those who didn't vote for him. Calling for unity has been a hallmark of Biden's campaign from the beginning, but it has never been so urgent. He will face an evenly divided US Senate, and lead a country not completely convinced that his presidency is legitimate: A recent NBC News poll found that 74 percent of Republican voters don't believe Biden won the 2020 election legitimately.\n\n\"We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal,\" Biden said. \"Politics doesn't have to be a raging fire, destroying everything in its path. Every disagreement doesn't have to be a cause for total war. And we must reject the culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured.\"\n\nBeyond the usual pomp of the ceremony, Inauguration Day was historic. Vice President Kamala Harris became the first woman vice president , as well as the first Black person and the first person of South Asian descent to take the post.\n\nAt least one Inauguration Day speaker made history as well: Amanda Gorman , who at 22 years old became the youngest inaugural poet in American history. Dressed in yellow, Gorman recited her poem \"The Hill We Climb,\" her words flowing in the cold winter air. Gorman recently told NPR she finished her poem on the night of the Capitol attack.\n\n\"In this truth, in this faith we trust. For while we have our eyes on the future, history has its eyes on us,\" Gorman read.\n\nInauguration attendees also watched a benediction by Rev. Silvester Beaman, and musical performances from Lady Gaga, Garth Brooks, and Jennifer Lopez on the steps of the Capitol. Lady Gaga, dressed in a flowing red and navy gown, performed the national anthem. Lopez, singing \"America the Beautiful\" and \"This Land Is Your Land,\" capped off her performance by singing her signature line, \"Let's get loud!\" at the end.\n\nWednesday morning saw a parade of past presidents and current congressional leaders arrive ahead of President Joe Biden's swearing-in and inaugural address.\n\nFormer Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama all attended, arm in arm with former first ladies Hillary Clinton (the 2016 Democratic nominee for president), Laura Bush, and Michelle Obama.\n\nThe one person missing was outgoing President Donald Trump, who chose not to attend Biden's inauguration. Trump broke with 152 years of tradition by skipping Biden's swearing-in. The last president to do so was Andrew Johnson in 1869. (Like Trump, Johnson was also impeached.)\n\nDespite Trump's lack of attendance, Biden's inauguration was still a bipartisan affair. Former Vice President Mike Pence represented the Trump administration, and congressional leaders, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, incoming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and incoming Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, all attended.\n\nOne of the most notable appearances was from US Capitol Police officer Eugene Goodman , who single-handedly held off a violent mob of insurrectionists, leading them away from the US Senate chamber two weeks ago. Goodman - who was recently promoted to the acting deputy Senate sergeant at arms - escorted Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, Douglas Emhoff, to their seats.\n\nAhead of the inauguration, Trump officially left Washington, DC , a city he's had a tumultuous relationship with for the past four years. Trump departed from the Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Wednesday morning and is headed to his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\n\"Goodbye. We love you. We will be back in some form,\" he told supporters before boarding Air Force One. Trump's departure wasn't without some form of festivities - the Village People song \"YMCA,\" a mainstay of Trump rallies, played in the background.\n\nEven though Trump is gone, his presence will still be felt on Capitol Hill.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nA Florida school has restricted who can read \"The Hill We Climb,\" a poem read at Biden's 2021 inauguration.\n\nby Li Zhou\n\nOne Florida school's decision to restrict access to a poem written for and performed at President Joe Biden's 2021 inauguration has increased scrutiny of book bans in the state, and the growing commitment to such efforts across the country.\n\nThe bans, some of which can begin with a single parent flagging a book as objectionable, have included books like The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison and The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky. And as education experts tell Vox, the bans can have the effect of cutting out entire groups and themes from students' learning experiences, particularly stories centering people of color and LGBTQ people.\n\nLast month, a Miami-Dade County school removed Amanda Gorman's poem \"The Hill We Climb\" from its elementary school collection following a complaint filed by a parent, according to a report by the Miami Herald . Gorman, who was 22 during the inauguration, was the country's national youth poet laureate at the time. Her poem, which she wrote shortly after the January 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection, laid out an optimistic vision of how the country could move forward and attempt to bridge its divides.\n\nIn the complaint, the parent reportedly flagged multiple books addressing Black history, and claimed that Gorman's poem \"indirectly\" featured \"hate messages.\" The poem is still available to the school's middle schoolers, but not younger readers. The decision to change access to the poem is alarming given both the message it contains, and the important historical context it provides.\n\nThe treatment of Gorman's poem, however, is just one example of a broader resurgence of book bans driven by Republican lawmakers across multiple states . Last year, Florida's legislature approved legislation that limited teachings about race and LGBTQ rights, both of which have led to certain books being removed from school shelves. Districts in states including Texas, Missouri, Utah, and South Carolina have also put forth similar restrictions. And according to an American Library Association Report , the number of book ban attempts at schools and public libraries reached a record high in 2022 and included nearly double the number of challenges that the group observed in 2021.\n\nAs Vox's Zack Beauchamp explained , Republican lawmakers have increasingly turned to book bans as a way to push an \"ideologically slanted vision of what children should learn about American culture, society, and history.\" In many cases, like the Florida laws, these bans have specifically focused on curbing information about systemic racism, LGBTQ identity, and the contributions of marginalized groups to American society. Educational experts emphasize that these bans mean students are exposed to a narrower range of ideas and that many may not see themselves represented in the literature they read.\n\n\"Unnecessary book bans like these are on the rise, and we must fight back,\" Gorman wrote in a Facebook post Tuesday responding to the Florida school's decision. \"Robbing children of the chance to find their voices in literature is a violation of their right to free thought and free speech.\"\n\nThe limits placed on Gorman's poem, like many other book bans in recent years, highlight how some schools and libraries are now restricting content that students are exposed to based simply on parental objections. In Florida, a new law passed by the legislature goes so far as to require that a book needs to be removed for review within five days of it being flagged by a parent or teacher.\n\nThe complaint about Gorman's poem , which was shared by the Florida Freedom to Read Project, an activist group dedicated to combating the state's restrictions, came from a parent who also raised concerns about other books focused on Black history and Cuba including titles The ABCs of Black History , Love to Langston , and Cuban Kids . The parent argued that Gorman's poem would \"cause confusion\" and \"indoctrinate students.\"\n\n\"It was determined at the school that 'The Hill We Climb' is better suited for middle school students and it was shelved in the middle school section of the media center,\" Miami-Dade County Public Schools spokesperson Elmo R. Lugo told Axios . \"The book remains available in the media center.\"\n\nMoves that reduce book access for younger readers still curb students' ability to learn certain materials, Stephana Ferrell, the director of research and insight at Florida Freedom to Read Project, told the Miami Herald. The pulling of books and complaints about them have centered heavily on offerings that feature people of color and LGBTQ people as main characters or authors, according to the American Library Association.\n\nConservatives who've advanced such bills have argued that they're needed to protect children from being exposed to ideas about race that make them feel guilty, or ideas about sexuality that they are too young to understand. Educational experts note, however, that these policies are intended to change the narrative of what students learn and see, and whose contributions are treated as valuable in the US.\n\n\"They are using erasure of students and erasure of groups of people as educational violence. Kids need to see themselves in what they read and learn,\" says Northeastern University education professor Jaci Urbani. \"All kids need to see the contributions of people of color, of people who are queer, of people who are different from themselves.\"\n\nThe push to ban books has come as Republicans have made schools and parental rights a major focus of their culture wars, an issue they've harped on in recent elections to some success in places like Virginia and Florida. Longer term, it's a way for lawmakers to elevate voices that most align with the groups they'd like to keep in power.\n\n\"Particularly in [Florida], the increase seems to be a reactionary measure, decidedly to prevent systemically marginalized populations from having a 'seat at the table,'\" Duke University education professor Kisha Daniels told Vox in an email.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe 22-year-old, who was the US's first youth poet laureate, wrote \"The Hill We Climb\" the night of the Capitol riot.\n\nby Constance Grady\n\nAfter Joe Biden finished delivering his inaugural address , the youngest-ever inauguration poet in US history took the stage and stole the show . Amanda Gorman, who is 22 years old and was named the first youth poet laureate of the United States in 2017, delivered her poem \"The Hill We Climb\" to the waiting crowd. Within minutes, her Twitter account jumped from 48,000 followers to 255,000 and counting.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times , Gorman, who graduated from Harvard last year with a degree in sociology, said she struggled to compose \"The Hill We Climb\" in the weeks leading up to the inauguration. Then came the Capitol riots of January 6.\n\nGorman says she stayed up late into the night after the riots, composing a poem that would address the violence of the day while still offering hope for the future. The result, which nods to the Broadway musical Hamilton , reads, in part, as follows:\n\nWe've seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it, Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy. And this effort very nearly succeeded. But while democracy can be periodically delayed, It can never be permanently defeated. In this truth, in this faith, we trust. For while we have our eyes on the future, History has its eyes on us.\n\n\"We have to confront these realities if we're going to move forward, so that's also an important touchstone of the poem,\" Gorman told the New York Times . \"There is space for grief and horror and hope and unity, and I also hope that there is a breath for joy in the poem, because I do think we have a lot to celebrate at this inauguration.\"\n\nGorman, who was chosen to write a poem for the inauguration after Jill Biden saw a video of her performing at the Library of Congress, has something in common with President Joe Biden. An audio processing disorder left her with a speech impediment at a young age, and she underwent extensive therapy to correct it, as Biden did with his own stutter . In 2018, Gorman told the Harvard Crimson that as a child, strangers who heard her impediment used to assume that she was a British or Nigerian immigrant.\n\n\"It kind of became my mini experiment,\" she said . \"If they thought I was from Europe, they would treat me very well, like I was a sophisticated intellectual; if I let them believe that I was from Nigeria, they'd make comments like, 'Oh, this is how credit cards work,' or, 'You might not know this in the village you come from.'\"\n\n\"But I don't look at my disability as a weakness,\" Gorman told the LA Times earlier this week. \"It's made me the performer that I am and the storyteller that I strive to be. When you have to teach yourself how to say sounds, when you have to be highly concerned about pronunciation, it gives you a certain awareness of sonics, of the auditory experience.\"\n\nDressed in a yellow Prada coat that she can also be seen modeling in an editorial campaign , Gorman delivered \"The Hill We Climb\" in a melodic spoken-word cadence, drifting from rhymed verse to free verse and back again. The full poem will be included in her forthcoming poetry book, also entitled The Hill We Climb , set to publish in September.\n\nThere's one more big thing Gorman has in common with Joe Biden.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\n\"My whole soul is in this\": Joe Biden has been sworn in as the 46th president of the United States.\n\nby Emily Stewart , Dylan Scott , Ella Nilsen , Jen Kirby , and Li Zhou\n\nAnd just like that, Donald Trump is no longer president, and Joe Biden is.\n\nOn Wednesday, January 20, at noon Eastern time, Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. was inaugurated as the 46th president of the United States. He took the oath of office from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, and his vice president, Kamala Harris , from Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Harris became the first woman, first Black person, and first South Asian person to be elected to the vice presidency of the US.\n\nBiden, 78, enters the White House at an unprecedented moment of crisis . A pandemic has left more than 400,000 Americans dead , and a coordinated federal response is of the utmost importance. The economic fallout from Covid-19 has left millions of people in desperate need of help.\n\nPolitically and culturally, much of the country is in chaos - the transition of power between presidential administrations has been disturbingly tumultuous. Biden's predecessor and many Republicans spent months casting doubt on the election results and refusing to accept the former vice president's victory. Their rhetoric and actions helped incite a violent riot at the US Capitol just days before the inauguration, which left five people dead. Because of the threat of more violence, Washington, DC, and other political centers across the country are on high alert , and 25,000 National Guard troops have descended upon the nation's capital to try to maintain safety and order.\n\nAt the inauguration, Biden - who staked his candidacy in part on his ability to work with both sides of the aisle - tried to strike a tone of unity that acknowledged the current landscape but looked forward to a brighter future.\n\n\"Today, we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate but of a cause: the cause of democracy,\" he said. \"The people, the will of the people, has been heard, and the will of the people has been heeded. We've learned again that democracy is precious, democracy is fragile, and at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed.\"\n\nFor millions of Americans, Biden's victory is a moment for celebration. He has laid out an ambitious agenda, much of which has a decent chance of becoming reality with Democrats in control of the House and the Senate. He will be able to quickly reverse course on some of Trump's ugliest policies, such as the travel ban and exiting the Paris climate agreement. He gives the country a chance to reset its coronavirus response. But it's also a moment for reflection: The country is deeply divided, and how to address that is far from clear.\n\n\"Without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury. No progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only a state of chaos. This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge, and unity is the path forward,\" Biden said on Wednesday. \"And we must meet this moment as the United States of America.\"\n\nHere's a look at the winners and losers of the inauguration of Joe Biden, the 46th president of the United States.\n\nBiden has wanted to be president for a long, long time - he made White House runs in 1988 and 2008. Now, he's finally made it.\n\nThat Biden would be the Democratic nominee and beat Trump in 2020 were not foregone conclusions. While he was ahead in the polls for much of the primary, he stumbled in early races, and it wasn't until votes were cast in South Carolina that the tide began to turn. In Trump, he faced a formidable opponent: Incumbents usually win, and prior to Covid-19, for many people in the country, the economy and life in general were plugging along just fine.\n\nBiden met the moment in a way that perhaps only he could. His political life is wrapped up in his identity as a kind, decent man . He is the eternal empath and can sit with people's pain because he's felt that pain, too.\n\nHe has an extensive record and certainly has his fair share of flaws , and he faces enormous challenges in the days, weeks, and months ahead. He will have to navigate a singular public health and economic landscape. He'll also have to deal with political forces on the right - many of the same ones that thwarted much of President Barack Obama's agenda - and fault lines within his own party between progressives urging him to go big and moderates advocating for a more conventional path. And he'll be doing it at 78 years old.\n\n\"We'll press forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to do in this winter of peril and significant possibilities - much to repair, much to restore, much to heal, much to build, and much to gain. Few people in our nation's history have been more challenged or found a time more challenging or difficult than the time we're in now,\" Biden said in his inaugural speech.\n\nHe later added: \"My whole soul is in this, bringing America together, uniting our people, uniting our nation, and I ask every American to join me in this cause.\"\n\n-Emily Stewart\n\nThroughout his business career and presidency, Donald Trump has sought icon status. He's wanted to seem larger than life. He exits the White House feeling quite small.\n\nTrump lost the 2020 presidential election by millions of votes and has never completely acknowledged it. He insisted for weeks his loss was the result of mass voter fraud and cheating, despite having no evidence to back him up. After the election, he peddled conspiracy theories and lies and filed dozens of largely frivolous lawsuits .\n\nThese tactics culminated in a violent invasion of the Capitol, after which Trump was impeached for the second time in his four-year term . Since then, Trump has largely disappeared from the public sphere. The corporate and political interests that (often selfishly) enabled him have largely abandoned him . In the public appearances and speeches he has made in recent days, Trump has appeared tired and sullen . Without the Twitter account he wielded as a weapon for years , he has retreated.\n\nTrump refused to attend his successor's inauguration, bucking decades of tradition, and instead exited the White House in the early morning hours on Wednesday. The day before his exit, he released a 20-minute farewell address that focused on his achievements, brushed over his shortcomings, and reframed his legacy as one of success. He delivered a second goodbye speech on Wednesday from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, taking a similar tack. \"We were not a regular administration,\" he said - a point with which few people would disagree.\n\nWhat's next for Trump is unclear. \"Goodbye, we love you, we will be back in some form,\" he said on Wednesday. His closer: \"Have a good life, we will see you soon.\"\n\n-ES\n\nThe earliest days of Trump's presidency were defined by a rapid clip of executive orders to undo the work of the Obama administration.\n\nFrom the travel ban that shut out immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries and caused chaos at airports to an executive order attempting to repeal Obamacare and start construction of a border wall to revoking Obama's protections for LGBTQ individuals and slashing environmental regulations, Trump set a record for most executive orders signed in a president's first 100 days.\n\nThe problem for Trump? Executive orders can be erased with the stroke of a pen. And after Biden takes office Wednesday, many of Trump's executive actions will be gone .\n\nBiden has planned an aggressive executive order agenda for day one of his presidency that involves rolling back many of Trump's actions, in addition to instating other executive actions to advance Biden's agenda - many of which are related to getting America's Covid-19 crisis under control. He'll sign these executive orders later Wednesday at the White House.\n\nAmong the new Biden executive orders that cancel out Trump's agenda: ending the travel ban to majority-Muslim countries, rejoining the Paris climate accord after Trump pulled the US out of it, rejoining the World Health Organization, and halting the construction of the wall on the US-Mexico border. Biden will also direct his agencies to review federal fuel emission standards lowered by Trump, and sign an executive order revoking a permit for the controversial Keystone XL pipeline - marking a huge win for environmental groups that have been fighting it for years.\n\nBeyond rolling back Trump's agenda, Biden also will lay out more of his own executive actions related to Covid-19 - including a 100-day mask mandate in federal buildings and on federal lands, and action to extend moratoriums on eviction and student debt payments to ease the financial burden for struggling families.\n\n\"I want to be clear: These measures are important but they are not sufficient,\" Biden's National Economic Council director, Brian Deese, told reporters recently. \"Responding to the crisis effectively will require Congress to act on the rescue plan that the president-elect laid out, and the recovery plan [he'll] lay out shortly.\"\n\nBiden's aides have stressed that there will be many more executive actions to come, in addition to the new president's legislative agenda. But Biden's first day shows that the end of the Trump era isn't just about rhetoric - it's about immediate policy action.\n\n- Ella Nilsen\n\nDonald Trump's presidency is officially over, and Obamacare is still alive .\n\nTrump, who promised in 2016 that he would deliver \"great health care at a tiny fraction of the cost - and it's going to be so easy,\" quickly realized how wrong he was. Republican congressional attempts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act consumed most of his first year in office .\n\nThe repeal push failed catastrophically when Sen. John McCain gave his thumbs-down in July 2017. Though Republicans tried to make a second attempt that fall, it quickly sputtered and never came up for a vote.\n\nTrump and Republicans couldn't come up with a plan to keep the grandiose promises they had made. Rather than cover everybody, as Trump said he wanted to do, millions of people would have lost their insurance under the repeal plans. Rather than protect Medicaid, as the president pledged he would, their proposals would have cut hundreds of billions of dollars in spending and led to millions falling off its rolls. People with preexisting conditions would have lost the iron-clad protections that Obamacare had given them, that they would not be denied coverage or charged a higher premium because of their medical history.\n\nThe Trump White House paid the price for its miscalculation. Democrats, campaigning heavily on preserving health care, won back the House in the 2018 midterms. The GOP's Senate majority was lost in 2020. Biden pummeled Trump over his health care agenda and made the latter a one-term president.\n\nBiden begins his term looking to quickly build on the ACA, expanding the welfare state that the outgoing president tried but failed to shrink. There are still serious problems in US health care: tens of millions uninsured and medical care unaffordable for many others who do have an insurance card.\n\nBut the new president will pick up where Barack Obama left off, almost as if the Trump administration never happened.\n\n-Dylan Scott\n\nKamala Harris is now the first woman - as well as the first Black and South Asian person - to become vice president, and her role is poised to be a singular one.\n\nHarris will serve as both a pivotal tiebreaker in the Senate and a close adviser to Biden. As one of few vice presidents who'll preside over a 50-50 Senate, she could be a key vote on everything from Cabinet nominees to budget reconciliation. And as a leader who Biden has said he'd like to be the \"last person in the room,\" she'll have an important voice on a wide range of policy issues as the White House tackles ongoing public health and economic crises.\n\nHarris brings wide-ranging expertise and a diverse set of lived experiences to the role as a longtime public servant and daughter of immigrants. Now the highest-ranking woman in US government, she starts her term as vice president by making history.\n\n-Li Zhou\n\nIt happened as it was supposed to happen. Joe Biden took his oath of office and became the 46th president of the United States at noon on January 20.\n\nKamala Harris, the first female vice president, was also sworn in, right before. And if all you did is look at the West Side of the Capitol, at the band and at the podium and the flags draped from the building, it looked and sounded and felt like the democratic tradition Americans are familiar with. The law, the institutions, prevailed.\n\nBut just two weeks earlier, this very same Capitol building was under siege. A mob, incensed by conspiracy theories about a stolen election, stormed the halls of Congress. They tried to overturn a democratic election and interrupt the certification of Biden's victory. Five people died in the attack.\n\nThe threat of more violence loomed over Biden's inauguration. State capitols around the country put up fortifications because of potential unrest . Washington, DC, became a fortress . Last week, a black fence went up around the perimeter of the Capitol. Police cars and trucks cut off access around the National Mall . About 25,000 armed National Guard troops deployed to the Capitol. The security perimeter extends blocks and blocks, with subway stations shut down and storefronts boarded up. Flags replaced crowds on the Mall.\n\nIn 2021, the peaceful transfer of power had to be enforced. That fragility - of how close America might have come to not making it to this moment - lingered around the edges of the inauguration ceremony.\n\nBiden confronted this in his inaugural address. He spoke about the country's divisions, which he called an \"uncivil war.\" He described the \"historic moment of crisis and challenge,\" from the pandemic, from economic inequities, from misinformation, and from domestic terrorism and white supremacy.\n\n\"We've learned again that democracy is precious. Democracy is fragile. And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed,\" Biden said on Wednesday. \"For now on this hallowed ground where just a few days ago violence sought to shake the Capitol's very foundation, we come together one nation under God, indivisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries.\"\n\nBiden did not underestimate the hard work, though he - and others - came out on the side of hope. \"If we do this,\" Biden said, \"then when our days are through, our children and our children's children will say of us, they gave their best, they did their duty, they healed the broken land.\"\n\nThis 59th inauguration may ultimately be a testament to democracy's resilience, the first step toward reckoning and repair. Or it could be a political system running on muscle memory. We don't know the answer right now. America lost something two weeks ago, and it will take more than the inauguration to recover it.\n\n-Jen Kirby\n\nThe Trump years were marked by misinformation and untruths, a blurring of facts and fiction. In his inaugural speech, Biden promised a break from that and a return to a focus on truth - even truths that are difficult to acknowledge.\n\nPart of Biden's call for unity was an understanding of the context in which he is taking office - one that is disjointed and divided even on the basic agreement of facts. And those divisions have reached a dangerous level.\n\n\"Politics doesn't have to be a raging fire, destroying everything in its path. Every disagreement doesn't have to be cause for total war,\" Biden said. \"And we must reject the culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured. My fellow Americans, we have to be different than this.\"\n\nWhile Biden did not call out former President Trump by name, he did acknowledge his role in the situation and signaled his determination to be different. \"What are the common objects we as Americans love, that define us as Americans? I think we know. Opportunity, security, liberty, dignity, respect, honor, and, yes, truth,\" he said. \"Recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson. There is truth and there are lies, lies told for power and for profit. Each of us has a duty and responsibility as Americans, and especially as leaders - leaders who have pledged to honor our Constitution and protect our nation - to defend the truth and defeat the lies.\"\n\nConspiracy theories that have been allowed to run rampant on the internet and parroted by Trump and some Republicans have infiltrated many American households and fostered a political and cultural situation that is untenable. Biden taking over the White House promises a return to a more honest, straightforward administration - one that won't begin, as Trump's term did, with obvious lies about his inauguration's crowd size .\n\n-ES\n\nAfter Biden's inaugural speech, a poet took the stage: a young Black woman named Amanda Gorman , who would recite a work titled \"The Hill We Climb.\" The work captures the country's fragile moment and the hope ahead. Part of it reads :\n\nWe've seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it,\n\nWould destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy.\n\nAnd this effort very nearly succeeded.\n\nBut while democracy can be periodically delayed,\n\nIt can never be permanently defeated.\n\nIn this truth, in this faith, we trust.\n\nFor while we have our eyes on the future,\n\nHistory has its eyes on us.\n\nGorman, now 22, was named the youth poet laureate of Los Angeles when she was 16 years old and became the national youth poet laureate while an undergraduate at Harvard. Ahead of the inauguration, she spoke with the New York Times about her intentions for the moment and her feelings about it. Gorman, the youngest inaugural poet in US history, told the Times she wanted the poem to be about unity and a new chapter in the country without acknowledging the darkness the country is experiencing right now.\n\n\"We have to confront these realities if we're going to move forward, so that's also an important touchstone of the poem,\" she said. \"There is space for grief and horror and hope and unity, and I also hope that there is a breath for joy in the poem, because I do think we have a lot to celebrate at this inauguration.\"\n\nGorman's words and appearance hit a nerve and were a poignant bookend to the inaugural ceremony. Gorman also has political aspirations of her own: In 2017, she told the Times she wanted to make a White House run someday. \"This is a long, long, faraway goal, but 2036 I am running for office to be president of the United States,\" she said. \"So you can put that in your iCloud calendar.\"\n\n-ES\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

In their place, 200,000 small flags were planted on the Mall to represent the number of Americans who couldn't attend the inauguration. On the steps of the Capitol, dignitaries and lawmakers wore masks and were spaced six feet apart.\n\nBiden took the oath of office and gave his address on the steps of a building that still bears the scars of a violent insurrection that took place two weeks ago, as supporters of outgoing President Donald Trump invaded the Capitol in an attempt to disrupt the legislative process of confirming Biden's electoral votes. The violence in the Capitol claimed at least five lives, including two US Capitol Police officers.\n\nAnd for the first time in 152 years, the outgoing president was not there to witness the incoming president take the oath of office. Trump had already departed for his home in Florida by the time the inauguration started; former Vice President Mike Pence was there instead.\n\nWith his hand placed on his family's Bible, President Biden took the oath of office at 11:50 am on Wednesday - about 10 minutes ahead of schedule. He officially became the 46th president at noon, in the middle of his inaugural address .\n\nSpeaking to the American public , Biden pleaded with a deeply and bitterly divided country to unite.\n\n\"This is America's day. This is democracy's day,\" Biden said. \"A day of history and hope - of renewal and resolve. We've learned again that democracy is precious; democracy is fragile. And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed.\"\n\nThe new president promised to be a president for all Americans, including those who didn't vote for him. Calling for unity has been a hallmark of Biden's campaign from the beginning, but it has never been so urgent. He will face an evenly divided US Senate, and lead a country not completely convinced that his presidency is legitimate: A recent NBC News poll found that 74 percent of Republican voters don't believe Biden won the 2020 election legitimately.\n\n\"We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal,\" Biden said. \"Politics doesn't have to be a raging fire, destroying everything in its path. Every disagreement doesn't have to be a cause for total war. And we must reject the culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured.\"\n\nBeyond the usual pomp of the ceremony, Inauguration Day was historic. Vice President Kamala Harris became the first woman vice president , as well as the first Black person and the first person of South Asian descent to take the post.\n\nAt least one Inauguration Day speaker made history as well: Amanda Gorman , who at 22 years old became the youngest inaugural poet in American history. Dressed in yellow, Gorman recited her poem \"The Hill We Climb,\" her words flowing in the cold winter air. Gorman recently told NPR she finished her poem on the night of the Capitol attack.\n\n\"In this truth, in this faith we trust. For while we have our eyes on the future, history has its eyes on us,\" Gorman read.\n\nInauguration attendees also watched a benediction by Rev. Silvester Beaman, and musical performances from Lady Gaga, Garth Brooks, and Jennifer Lopez on the steps of the Capitol. Lady Gaga, dressed in a flowing red and navy gown, performed the national anthem. Lopez, singing \"America the Beautiful\" and \"This Land Is Your Land,\" capped off her performance by singing her signature line, \"Let's get loud!\" at the end.\n\nWednesday morning saw a parade of past presidents and current congressional leaders arrive ahead of President Joe Biden's swearing-in and inaugural address.\n\nFormer Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama all attended, arm in arm with former first ladies Hillary Clinton (the 2016 Democratic nominee for president), Laura Bush, and Michelle Obama.\n\nThe one person missing was outgoing President Donald Trump, who chose not to attend Biden's inauguration. Trump broke with 152 years of tradition by skipping Biden's swearing-in. The last president to do so was Andrew Johnson in 1869. (Like Trump, Johnson was also impeached.)\n\nDespite Trump's lack of attendance, Biden's inauguration was still a bipartisan affair. Former Vice President Mike Pence represented the Trump administration, and congressional leaders, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, incoming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and incoming Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, all attended.\n\nOne of the most notable appearances was from US Capitol Police officer Eugene Goodman , who single-handedly held off a violent mob of insurrectionists, leading them away from the US Senate chamber two weeks ago. Goodman - who was recently promoted to the acting deputy Senate sergeant at arms - escorted Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, Douglas Emhoff, to their seats.\n\nAhead of the inauguration, Trump officially left Washington, DC , a city he's had a tumultuous relationship with for the past four years. Trump departed from the Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Wednesday morning and is headed to his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\n\"Goodbye. We love you. We will be back in some form,\" he told supporters before boarding Air Force One. Trump's departure wasn't without some form of festivities - the Village People song \"YMCA,\" a mainstay of Trump rallies, played in the background.\n\nEven though Trump is gone, his presence will still be felt on Capitol Hill. Beyond the sway he maintains within the Republican Party, Trump will likely soon face his second impeachment trial in the US Senate .\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misstated the name of former first lady Laura Bush.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue. But the benefits of fighting his lawless deportations are worth the political risks.\n\nTrade wars are easy to win - if you're China.\n\nHow Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.\n\nCanary Mission, the controversial organization targeting student activists, explained.\n\n3 theories for Gen Z's return to God and faith.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

      "text": "Poet Amanda Gorman criticizes book ban effort in Florida targeting Biden's inauguration poem\n\nA complaint from a parent targeted several books on Black history.\n\nAfter news broke that Amanda Gorman's historic poem \"The Hill We Climb\" was moved to the middle school section of a Miami-Dade school, the poet slammed efforts to restrict or censor books in schools.\n\n\"I'm gutted,\" she said in a statement posted to her social media accounts.\n\nShe continued, \"I wrote The Hill We Climb so that all young people could see themselves in a historical moment ... Robbing children of the chance to find their voices in literature is a violation of their right to free thought and free speech.\"\n\nDocuments obtained via a public records request by the activist group Florida Freedom to Read Project found that a complaint by one parent targeted several books concerning Black history -- including \"The Hill We Climb,\" \"The ABCs of Black History,\" and \"Love to Langston.\" The School Materials Review Committee recommended these three books be shelved in the middle school section of the media center.\n\nThe complaint said the poem \"indirectly\" contained \"hate messages\" and believed it could \"cause confusion and indoctrinate students.\" \"Critical race theory\" and \"indoctrination\" were cited as reasons behind the complaints of the other books.\n\nTwo books on Cuba were also targeted by the parent, who cited \"indoctrination about socialism\" in their complaint.\n\nIn a statement, Miami-Dade County said Gorman's poem was not banned or removed from their schools, assuring that the book remains available in the media center as part of the middle grades collection.\n\nThe Miami Herald first reported the story.\n\nIn 2022, the American Library Association documented a record-breaking number of reported book ban attempts across the country. The organization found 1,269 demands to censor or restrict library materials or resources, the highest total since it began compiling this data more than 20 years ago. More than 2,571 unique titles were targeted, with the majority of the books being written by or about LGBTQ characters or people of color.\n\nPenguin Random House, one of the country's largest book publishers which also published Gorman's poem, is part of a lawsuit targeting a separate Florida school district for removing certain books from the shelves of public school libraries.\n\nThe lawsuit argues that the school board's removal and restriction of books that discuss racism and have LGBTQ themes violates the First Amendment.\n\nFlorida has been at the center of the clashes in education, as recent legislation has led to restrictions and removals of books across the state.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Inaugural poet Amanda Gorman releases new poem 'New Day's Lyric' to welcome 2022\n\nGorman shared her new poem on Instagram.\n\nAmanda Gorman is ringing in the new year with a new poem.\n\nThe National Youth Poet Laureate, who is most famous for her poem \"The Hill We Climb,\" which she recited at President Joe Biden's inauguration earlier this year, partnered with Instagram on the new poem \"New Day's Lyric.\"\n\nGorman shared a video of her reciting the poem on her Instagram, as did the platform, on their own account. In the clip, Gorman wears a a white dress and powerfully recites \"New Day's Lyric\" in an empty theater.\n\n\"New Day's Lyric\" reflects on 2021 and looks ahead to 2022.\n\n\"May this be the day / We come together,\" she says. \"Tethered by this year of yearning, / We are learning / That though we weren't ready for this, / We have been readied by it. / We steadily vow that no matter / How we are weighed down, / We must always pave a way forward.\"\n\nIn a separate post, Gorman shared that she is raising money for the International Rescue Committee, which provides lifesaving programs to vulnerable communities worldwide affected by the coronavirus pandemic as well as humanitarian crises. According to her post, Instagram has also pledged $50,000.\n\n\"I wrote A New Day's Lyric both to celebrate the new year & honor both the hurt & the humanity of the last one,\" she wrote. \"I'm always shy to quote my own poems, but I believe it in my bones when I say: Come, look up with kindness yet, for wherever we come together, we will forever overcome.\"\n\nGorman has had a whirlwind of a year. Following her reading of \"The Hill We Climb\" at Biden's inauguration, she read another poem she wrote called \" Chorus of the Captains ,\" which was filmed for the Super Bowl's pregame ceremony and honored the front-line workers of the COVID-19 pandemic. She also signed with IMG models , the same modeling agency that represents Gigi and Bella Hadid.\n\nThen, in April, she graced the cover of Vogue and co-chaired the 2021 Met Gala in September.\n\nGorman released her third book of the year, \"Call Us What We Carry,\" just this month.\n\nWatch the full video below of Gorman reciting \"New Day's Lyric\":\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
