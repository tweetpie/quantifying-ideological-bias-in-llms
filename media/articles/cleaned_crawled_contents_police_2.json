Hersl responded, \"I can use the money, I'm in the process of buying a house.\"\n\nThe officers were caught on tape entering her complex.

      "text": "Lying Is a Fundamental Part of American Police Culture\n\nPolice officers lie under oath in court so often that they've even given the practice a nickname. \"Behind closed doors, we call it testilying,\" New York City police officer Pedro Serrano told the New York Times . \"You take the truth and stretch it out a little bit.\"\n\nThe term, the Times notes, came into common usage among cops about 25 years ago , but the issue of police perjury is far older, a problem African Americans have complained of for many decades. In rare instances, those with intimate knowledge have publicly acknowledged not only how rampant testilying is, but also how rarely cops caught in the act face consequences.\n\n\"Every lawyer who practices in the criminal courts knows that police perjury is commonplace ,\" former New York State criminal court judge, U.S. attorney and NYU law professor Irving Younger wrote in the Nation in 1967. \"Policemen see themselves as fighting a twoâ€'front war-against criminals in the street and against 'liberal' rules of law in court. All's fair in this war, including the use of perjury to subvert 'liberal' rules of law that might free those who 'ought' to be jailed. And even if his lies are exposed in the courtroom, the policeman is as likely to be indicted for perjury by his coâ€'worker, the prosecutor, as he is to be struck down by thunderbolts from an avenging heaven.\"\n\nMore than 50 years after Younger's broadside, a newly released Times study has turned up more than two-dozen instances of police lying in court since January 2015-and these confirmed cases \"are almost certainly only a fraction\" of the real total. The ubiquity of plea deals, which effectively halts cases before they're weighed by a court, means \"the possibility that an officer lied is seldom aired in public.\" Even when false police testimony comes to public light, court papers are generally sealed and an officer's misdeed protected from scrutiny. \"[T]he cases identified by The Times reveal an entrenched perjury problem several decades in the making that shows little sign of fading,\" the report notes.\n\nThe apparent goal of most perjurious officers in cases examined by the Times was to cover up unlawful searches, undertaken without reasonable suspicion and in violation of suspects' constitutionally guaranteed rights. Predictably, the analysis also found numerous lies that \"appear aimed at convicting people-who may or may not have committed a crime-with trumped-up evidence.\" Those goals are underwritten by demands from police higher-ups to meet ever-increasing arrest quotas, an open secret of law enforcement . The Times also cites the general pressure officers face to identify suspects and close cases for purposes ranging from public relations to politics.\n\nIn one case cited by the Times, Bronx police officer Sean Kinane lied about watching drug dealers conduct street deals just before he swooped in to make an arrest. When a suspect's lawyer made it known there was video of the incident, Kinane recanted, stating only that he \"misspoke when [he] was in grand jury,\" without further explanation. The officer has since been elevated to a new position within the force.\n\nIn another example, plainclothes officer Christopher Thomas testified he'd seen a man attempt to hide a gun in his car as the officer approached the vehicle. That turned out to be a falsehood, which Thomas quickly retracted when made aware of the existence of video footage. Now a \"sergeant in a narcotics unit,\" Thomas later \"stated to the A.D.A. that he did not know why he had testified to those facts before the grand jury\" according to an email from prosecutors.\n\nSome officers seem to have lied not to cover up their disregard for a suspect's constitutionally granted rights, but for more petty and vainglorious reasons. Dornezia Agard, a plainclothes Brooklyn officer, claimed in court that as she approached a man, he knelt behind a parked van and threw down a \"hard metal object\" that turned out to be a gun. Prosecutors later discovered Agard hadn't even been among the first law enforcement arrivals to the scene. \"The prosecutors did not address why Officer Agard claimed to be a witness,\" the Times notes, \"or why the other officers present seem to have allowed her to process the arrest.\"\n\nThe report isn't the first to feature the NYPD as a case-in-point for questions around officer trustworthiness. A 2015 WYNC examination of more than 1,000 civil and criminal court records found \"more than 120 officers with at least one documented credibility issue over the past 10 years .\" Almost none of the officers faced anything beyond the mildest of penalties for their misconduct, and \"at least 54 went on to make more than 2,700 arrests after the date their word was challenged .\" The pattern is just a sliver of the mountain of evidence indicating a culture of corruption in New York policing. Earlier this month, a Buzzfeed News report found between 2011-2015, nearly 320 NYPD employees \"who committed offenses serious enough to merit firing were allowed to keep their jobs.\" Nearly 50 of those \" lied on official reports, under oath , or during an internal affairs investigation.\"\n\nBut it would be naive to pretend the NYPD is the only department where perjury appears commonplace. The Baltimore police scandal has revealed widespread wrongdoing within the city's Gun Trace Task Force, including police theft of \"more than $300,000, at least three kilos of cocaine, 43 pounds of marijuana, 800 grams of heroin and hundreds of thousands of dollars in watches from suspected drug dealers and civilians,\" according to the Washington Post . (Among the most sinister revelations was that some cops, on advice from team sergeant Wayne Jenkins, drove around with fake guns in their possession to plant on unarmed suspects they shot .) The Baltimore Sun described the case as \"evidence [of a] dysfunctional police department in which officers confidently lied in official paperwork and in court to cover their tracks without fear of repercussions.\"\n\nFollowing a judicial order demanding its release, newly elected Philadelphia district attorney Larry Krasner recently made public a cheat sheet listing 66 current and former police officers whose well-established track records of falsehoods made them unreliable witnesses. The inventory was a hand-me-down from the office of outgoing district attorney Seth Williams. \"The former aides who drew up the list saw it as an in-house reference sheet for frontline prosecutors to consult as they went over lists of potential police witnesses for cases,\" per the Philly Inquirer. \"It ultimately was seen as a tool to eliminate testimony from officers who might lie on the witness stand .\"\n\nA pattern of police lies and corruption was confirmed by a 2016 Chicago Tribune investigation that turned up numerous examples of \"police officers shading the truth in subtle ways or outright lying from the witness stand .\" The Tribune found:\n\n\"...more than a dozen examples over the past few years in which police officers, according to judges, gave false or questionable testimony-but experienced few, if any, repercussions. Over four years, from February 2012 to February 2016, 11 Chicago police officers had disciplinary charges brought against them for writing a false report or making a false statement. None of the cases, though, was for false testimony in court, according to police disciplinary records.\"\n\nPolice lying is as old as policing itself, and like all culturally ingrained customs, it will not disappear without the sustained intervention of outside forces. That is especially true in law enforcement, an institution governed by its own insular codes of silence, conduct and reprisal for speaking out. The U.S. government has never been deeply invested in seeing justice done, but the Obama administration had begun taking the most tentative of steps in the right direction by investigating abuses of major police departments around the country. But in his first speech after taking office last year, Attorney General Jeff Sessions promised to halt those reviews , just one aspect of his Justice Department's complete lack of interest in protecting civil rights, particularly those of marginalized people. The decision was inspired by the same tired, \"few rotten apples\" excuse that brands most of the current DOJ's policies toward policing. \"Law enforcement, as a whole, has been unfairly maligned and blamed for the unacceptable actions of a few of their bad actors,\" Sessions stated, ignoring the data and numbers on police abuse that had prescribed the investigations in the first place. \"They felt they have become targets. Morale has suffered.\"\n\nElsewhere, as silver linings go, among the few upsides of the ubiquity of cameras in the pockets of unwitting citizen journalists and on cops' bodies is that police lies have been revealed in many cases where they would otherwise have gone unquestioned. But what good is all that footage if it fails to result in punishment for lying and otherwise corrupt cops , as we've seen with countless videos documenting egregious police abuses and murder that juries have seemingly ignored ? The counterintuitive result of so much surveillance is that even if the country, not to mention the internet, is watching, it rarely matters where justice is concerned. The refusal of juries to convict or even indict cops in the face of the most damning evidence only reinforces, particularly for folks of color, the demoralizing fact that police have endless system accessories for remaining above the law. That message basically adds up to a national carte blanche for cops to do as they wish without repercussions. One anonymous 10-year veteran of the NYPD told the Times as much.\n\n\"There's no fear of being caught,\" he said. \"You're not going to go to trial and nobody is going to be cross-examined.\""

      "text": "The 8 Most Popular Types of 'Copaganda': How the Police Play the Media\n\nMedia critics spend a lot of time discussing how our military industry manipulates the press into war and bloated defense budgets. Far less time, however, is spent discussing how our local police departments plays the media to suit their ends. The reason for this mostly has to do with the fragmented nature of localized propaganda, combined with a prejudice that police aren't very savvy. But ever since Ferguson and the subsequent unrest, various departments and their ideological allies have gotten more sophisticated at playing the media without much notice.\n\nTo counter this, police reform and police abolitionist activists on Twitter have invented a rather useful term: \"Copaganda.\" Copaganda is any news story that uncritically advances a police department's image or helps undermine reform efforts.\n\nHere are eight of the most common forms of copaganda.\n\n1. The conveniently timed \"how dangerous the job is\" story.\n\nOne of the more subtle ways the media helps muddy the waters on police violence is by publishing tales of how difficult the police have it as PR-intensive trials of police officers are being carried out in the public. While not directly apologizing for police violence, the \"fog of war\" framing sows doubts in the public's mind and allows more leeway in highly charged cases of police misconduct.\n\nThese pieces almost always involve the ride-along and adopt many of the police's (anecdotal) tales of occupational woe. One of the more recent examples was Fox 5 in New York City, which sent Lisa Evers and a former NYPD detective on what's called a \"vertical patrol,\" a controversial tactic of hyper-vigilant policing whereby two officers go from the top of a public housing complex to the bottom looking for criminality.\n\nThe ostensible reason for the report was a recent nonfatal shooting of two NYPD police officers who were doing a vertical patrol of the Melrose Houses in the Bronx. The subtext may have been to help justify a previous incident of police violence, the killing of Akai Gurley by Officer Peter Liang in early 2014 during a vertical patrol, the verdict of which was to be announced the next day . The report stresses the dangers (despite the fact that being a police officer doesn't crack the top ten most dangerous jobs in the United States) and relies almost entirely on police testimony, ominous framing, and some hand-picked locals who want more police presence in their neighborhood.\n\n2. The diversity boosting story.\n\nThe racism inherent in most stories of police brutality tricks many into thinking a more diverse police force necessarily makes for a less racist one. While the science backing up this assumption is inconclusive , the wildly disproportionate white police representation of Ferguson combined with their rank, systemic racism strikes most people as intuitively problematic.\n\nWhile a more representational police force certainly can't hurt, stories highlighting how inclusive policing are give the appearance of reform where no concrete evidence of reform exists. Take this article highlighting black women on the L.A. police force, \" Shifting the blue line: Why a black woman is joining LAPD ,\" which details one African-American woman's journey to join the notorious Los Angeles Police Department. It is full of examples of why those around her disliked her decision to join, but doesn't objectively analyze whether these concerns were justified. It simply advances a tale of singular courage that ignores broader concerns of systemic racism and instead reads like a recruiting brochure for the LAPD.\n\n3. The bogus threat.\n\nA time-honored tradition that dates back to the civil rights era, police will claim they've received threats from activists to preemptively justify any crackdowns they may want to engage in. Here we have an AP story from the first day of the Selma march:\n\nAnd here we have an AP article from last year's Baltimore uprising the day of Freddie Gray's funeral:\n\nThere's only one problem: a FOIA request made by Vice's Jason Leopold months later revealed the Baltimore PD's \"credible\" gang threat was entirely without basis :\n\nHours later, in the same email chain, another DHS employee said, \"FBI Baltimore has interviewed the source of this information and has determined this threat to be non-credible, \" apparently making this the first time that it was debunked since the threat first surfaced.\n\nThis means the Baltimore Police Department deliberately spread rumors of a threat they, and the FBI, knew was \"non-credible\" in the ramp up to public demonstrations and the media mindlessly and uncritically disseminated it, despite seeing no evidence supporting the claim. But the effect was achieved: the protesters were preemptively criminalized and the crackdown that followed provided the necessary PR cover.\n\n4. Pinkwashing.\n\n\"Pinkwashing\" is an increasingly popular tool used to describe the exploitation of LGBT rights to whitewash negative aspects of an otherwise reactionary institution. A frequent PR tool employed by Israel , large metropolitan police departments from Fort Worth to Buffalo have joined in Gay Pride parades to show their progressive values. A video of an NYPD officer dancing at the New York gay pride parade went viral last summer, only six years after some NYPD officers were charged with trawling adult video stores and falsely arresting gay men in sleazy entrapment operations.\n\n5. Anonymously smearing police shooting victims.\n\nIn the wake of a police shooting, cops and their media partisans rush to get as much dirt on the victims out as possible. The nominal reason for this is to provide color, nuance and a bit of background, but the reason, at least in effect, is to provide the police post-facto justification for excessive force in the press. We saw this in the cases of Eric Garner, Sandra Bland , Sam Dubose , Charly \"Africa\" Keunang , and Freddie Gray .\n\nAs I wrote last August:\n\nFrom the beginning, the media was quick to contextualize Brown's shooting by finding unflattering personal details about his life including routine run-ins with the law. The most shameless case was the now infamous August 25 profile in the New York Times that insisted \"Mike Brown was no angel\" as if anyone had argued otherwise about him, or another human being on earth.... For Brown, and countless black victims like him, they were as much, if not more, on trial than the person who had done the actual killing....\n\nIn the wake of a police shooting, the need to rationalize police violence -- typically under the guise of \"balance\" -- almost always means demonizing the victim through public records requests, government leaks, and selective interviews. When one adopts a \"both sides\" mentality for police shootings, based on the nature of murder, one person cannot speak for themselves, invariably leaving us with one perspective: that of the police.\n\n6. The \"saving kittens\" story.\n\nWho doesn't love a heartwarming tale of saving kittens and homeless people? Everyone, mostly notable a lazy media who routinely run stories of police doing everyday acts of kindness, some of which are curated and highlighted by the police department's public relations apparatus or friendly media. One of the more embarrassing examples of this trope was a recent New York Times Metro story about NYPD counterterrorism police helping rescue a kitten:\n\nSure, it's swell a few bored counterterrorism cops saved a kitten, but did the story really need coverage in the New York Times , Express UK and Gothamist ? Schmaltzy articles about one-off acts of charity are not something serious news organizations should be indulging. In a healthy media environment, power should be met with the highest standard of skepticism, not a false sense of balance by highlighting PR-fed stories of heartstring-pulling saccharin.\n\n7. The community policing myth.\n\nIn the aftermath of the unrest in Ferguson there was a rush to try and show how certain police departments were making progress. In the absence of substantive change, PR-driven fairy tales about community policing and outreach are peddled by police departments and a media hungry for progress. The most tone-deaf was the Washington Post 's Wes Lowery who ran a Fresno Police Department infomercial about supposed reforms they had made, \" In Fresno, a community-policing ethos builds ties between officers and residents ,\" complete with police smiling with local residents and other progress entirely defined by tone and optics. As Josmar Trujillo at FAIR notes, the catch-all community policing is a red herring:\n\nThat \"vagueness\" is huge hit with police officials. In theory, community policing advocates better collaboration between cops and the neighborhoods they patrol. In practice, it simply means more police, oftimes using them to coax information out of one group of people that can be useful in arresting another. Police can, for example, take their cue to conduct more \"quality-of-life policing\" (arresting beggars, street performers or teenagers standing on a corner) from a concerned community member. It also frames police as community problem-solvers in lieu of actual problem-solvers, like social workers, school counselors, etc.\n\nCommunity policing is a term so vague as to mean nothing. Indeed, the same 1994 crime bill that got us here in the first place was loaded with references to community policing, which, as Trujillo notes, only led to more police and thus more police violence and harassment and arrests. The idea that having better relations with the civilian population is inherently good is superficially appealing, but without tethering such gestures to concrete reform and a de-escalation of police presence, they amount to little more than fluff.\n\n8. The Christmas gift surprise.\n\nOne of the more nakedly shameless tactics, some police departments have taken to pulling over random people, who presumably think they're about to get a ticket, and handing them cash or toys :\n\nThe media reports these heartwarming stories without bothering to ask why emotionally terrorizing poor people with the prospect of a ticket is offset by giving people a wad of cash or a teddy bear -all the name of running a silly and pointless commercial for the local department.\n\nh/t @OLAASM who popularized the term on Twitter."

As Fanone saw it, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris was the real law-and-order candidate.\n\nAfter President Trump returned to the White House on January 20, 2025, he issued blanket, across-the-board pardons for around 1,500 January 6 rioters - including those who violently attacked police officers. Fanone has been vehemently critical of the pardons , but not all of the criticism is coming from people who opposed Trump in the 2024 election.\n\nIn a joint statement , the FOP and the NACP criticized Trump as well as former President Joe Biden for their \"pardons.\" However, they didn't specifically mention Trump's January 6 pardons or unrelated pardons from Biden.\n\nBefore leaving the White House, Biden commuted the life sentence of Native American activist Leonard Peltier - who was convicted of killing two FBI agents in the 1970s. Peltier's supporters maintain that he was wrongly convicted.\n\n\"The International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) and the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) have had longstanding and positive relationships with both President Trump and President Biden and have greatly appreciated their support of the policing profession,\" the organizations said in their statement . \"However, the IACP and FOP are deeply discouraged by the recent pardons and commutations granted by both the Biden and Trump Administrations to individuals convicted of killing or assaulting law enforcement officers. The IACP and FOP firmly believe that those convicted of such crimes should serve their full sentences.\"\n\nThe organizations continued, \"Crimes against law enforcement are not just attacks on individuals or public safety - they are attacks on society and undermine the rule of law. Allowing those convicted of these crimes to be released early diminishes accountability and devalues the sacrifices made by courageous law enforcement officers and their families.\n\nFanone, meanwhile, specifically addressed Trump's January 6 pardons and said, \"I have been betrayed by my country.\""

But you do that through officers working double shifts and averaging ... 50 hours of overtime every pay period,\" Manger said.\n\nThe division that protects leadership currently holds about 250 officers, but Manger pressed for that to be doubled to at least 500.\n\n\"And not only can we provide protection for the leadership 24/7, but when we have people that have threats against them that require us to stand up temporary details, we can do that,\" Manger said. \"Because right now, when we do it, we're robbing Peter to pay Paul. We're yanking somebody off another detail to stand up a detail to help someone for a temporary threat situation.\"\n\nThere are numerous situations, he testified, where if USCP had more officers it could better protect lawmakers both on and off Capitol Hill. For example, USCP needs more than the 20 or so agents it currently has investigating threats against members of Congress.\n\nThreats against lawmakers have been on the rise for years, but are having increasingly dire consequences. Just this week a woman in Georgia was killed in what local police described as a \"tragic chain of events\" after an email falsely claimed there was a bomb in the mailbox at Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's home there.\n\nManger said during the hearing in the Senate Rules Committee that lawmakers need to raise USCP's spending levels to allow it to continue holding 12 recruiting classes per year of 25 officers each for the next few years.\n\nThe mandatory retirement age for USCP should also be raised from 60 to 65 to match the \"tweak\" the Secret Service holds that allows it to keep senior officers working above the ceiling of 57 years old for federal law enforcement, which Manger called \"shameful\" because he believes it is too low.\n\n\"We have people that are in the prime of their career at that age and they got to go. And so, you know, I've been able to get the Capitol Police Board to agree to extend it to the age 60. And I have several officers that I've spoken with just in the last month who are hitting 60 years old, and they said, 'Chief, I don't want to go,'\" Manger said. \"And you look at them, and they look like they're 35 and they certainly can still do the job, physically, mentally, and they're some of the best cops you'd ever want to work with. But I have no ability to hold on to them.\""

And on Tuesday, April 2, the 2024 GOP presidential nominee received an endorsement from the Police Officers Association of Michigan (POAM) - which has 12,000 members - and its president, Jim Tignanelli.\n\nBut support of Trump is hardly universal among Americans with a law enforcement background.\n\nIn a scathing opinion column published on April 4 , Frank Figliuzzi - former assistant director of counterintelligence for the FBI - argues that POAM's Trump endorsement is embarrassing in light of the violence that his supporters inflicted on police officers when the U.S. Capitol Building was attacked on January 6, 2021.\n\n\"Tiagnelli and the POAM's leadership might argue that Trump has the backs of police around the country,\" Figliuzzi writes . \"Tell that to the U.S. Capitol Police union who tallied 140 officers injured during the insurrection on January 6, 2021.

Jean Carroll alleged that Trump sexually assaulted her in a Manhattan department store in 1996. Carroll won both cases, and between the two, Trump owes more than $88 million in damages.\n\n\"Endorsing a man who refers to migrants as animals, and was found liable for sexual assault, is anathema to the law enforcement mission,\" Figliuzzi argues . \"Will rape victims report crimes to police departments who endorse Trump? Will migrants who are beaten because of the color of their skin report their incident to a sheriff who supports what Trump stands for? Hate and division are Trump's bread and butter - but hate and division have no business dressing up in a police uniform.\"\n\nThe former FBI official continues , \"Tignanelli said he 'hopes that in the future with leaders like Trump, honor will be restored to the law enforcement profession.'

      "text": "The True History of the Origins of Police: Protecting and Serving the Masters of Society\n\nIn most of the liberal discussions of the recent police killings of unarmed black men, there is an underlying assumption that the police are supposed to protect and serve the population. That is, after all, what they were created to do. Maybe there are a few bad apples, but if only the police weren't so racist, or didn't carry out policies like stop-and-frisk, or weren't so afraid of black people, or shot fewer unarmed men, they could function as a useful service that we all need.\n\nThis liberal way of viewing the problem rests on a misunderstanding of the origins of the police and what they were created to do. The police were not created to protect and serve the population. They were not created to stop crime, at least not as most people understand it. And they were certainly not created to promote justice. They were created to protect the new form of wage-labor capitalism that emerged in the mid- to late-19th century from the threat posed by that system's offspring, the working class.\n\nBefore the 19th century, there were no police forces that we would recognize as such anywhere in the world. In the northern United States, there was a system of elected constables and sheriffs, much more responsible to the population in a very direct way than the police are today. In the South, the closest thing to a police force was the slave patrols. Then, as Northern cities grew and filled with mostly immigrant wage workers who were physically and socially separated from the ruling class, the wealthy elite who ran the various municipal governments hired hundreds and then thousands of armed men to impose order on the new working-class neighborhoods.\n\nClass conflict roiled late-19th century American cities like Chicago, which experienced major strikes and riots in 1867, 1877, 1886 and 1894. In each of these upheavals, the police attacked strikers with extreme violence. In the aftermath of these movements, the police increasingly presented themselves as a thin blue line protecting civilization, by which they meant bourgeois civilization, from the disorder of the working class. This ideology has been reproduced ever since - except that today, poor black and Latino people rather than immigrant workers are the main threat.\n\nOf course, the ruling class did not get everything it wanted. It had to yield on many points to the immigrant workers it sought to control - this is why, for instance, municipal governments backed away from trying to stop Sunday drinking and why they hired so many immigrant police officers, especially the Irish. But despite these concessions, businessmen organized themselves to make sure the police were increasingly isolated from democratic control. The police, meanwhile, increasingly set themselves off from the population by donning uniforms; establishing their own rules for hiring, promotion and firing; working to build a unique esprit de corps; and identifying themselves with order. And despite complaints about corruption and inefficiency, they gained more and more support from the ruling class, to the extent that in Chicago, for instance, businessmen donated money to buy the police rifles, artillery, Gatling guns and buildings and to establish a police pension out of their own pockets.\n\nThere was a never a time when the big city police neutrally enforced \"the law\" - nor, for that matter, a time when the law itself was neutral. Throughout the 19th century in the North, the police mostly arrested people for the vaguely defined \"crimes\" of disorderly conduct and vagrancy, which meant that they could target anyone they saw as a threat to \"order.\" In the post-bellum South, they enforced white supremacy and largely arrested black people on trumped-up charges in order to feed them into convict labor systems.\n\nThe violence the police carried out and their moral separation from those they patrolled were not the consequences of the brutality of individual officers, but of policies carefully designed to mold the police into a force that could use violence to deal with the social problems that accompanied the development of a wage-labor economy. For instance, in the short, sharp depression of the mid-1880s, Chicago was filled with prostitutes who worked the streets. Many policemen recognized that these prostitutes were generally impoverished women seeking a way to survive and initially tolerated their behavior. But the police hierarchy insisted that the patrolmen arrest these women, impose fines and drive them off the streets and into brothels, where they could be ignored by some members of the elite and controlled by others. Similarly, in 1885, when Chicago began to experience a wave of strikes, some policemen sympathized with strikers. But once the police hierarchy and the mayor decided to break the strikes, policemen who refused to comply were fired.\n\nThough some patrolmen tried to be kind and others were openly brutal, police violence in the 1880s was not a case of a few bad apples - and neither is it today.\n\nMuch has changed since the creation of the police - most importantly, the influx of black people into Northern cities, the mid-20th century civil rights movement and the creation of the current system of mass incarceration in part as a response to that movement. But these changes did not lead to a fundamental shift in policing. They led to new policies designed to preserve fundamental continuities. The police were created to use violence to reconcile electoral democracy with industrial capitalism. Today, they are just one part of the \"criminal justice\" system that plays the same role. Their basic job is to enforce order among those with the most reason to resent the system - in our society today, disproportionately among poor black people.\n\nIf there is one positive lesson from the history of policing's origins, it is that when workers organized, refused to submit or cooperate and caused problems for the city governments, they could force the police to curb the most galling of their activities. The murders of individual police officers, as happened in Chicago on May 3, 1886, and more recently in New York on December 20, 2014, only reinforced calls for harsh repression. But resistance on a mass scale could force the police to hesitate. This happened in Chicago during the early 1880s, when the police pulled back from breaking strikes, hired immigrant officers and tried to re-establish some credibility among the working class after their role in brutally crushing the 1877 upheaval.\n\nThe police might back off again if the widespread reaction against the killings of Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice and countless others continues. If they do, it will be a victory for those mobilizing today, and will save lives. But as long as this policing system endures, any change in policy will be aimed at keeping the poor in line more effectively.\n\nA democratic police system in which police are elected by and accountable to the people they patrol is imaginable. But as long as we have an economic and political system that rests on the exploitation of workers and pushes millions of people into poverty, we are unlikely to see policing become any more democratic than the rest of society.\n\nThis article was adapted from an earlier version published on the Labor and Working-Class History Association blog."

      "text": "'May never result in charges': Trump's top prosecutor won't sign arrest warrant for GOP rep\n\nThe seal of the U.S. Justice Department is seen on the podium in the Department's headquarters briefing room before a news conference with the Attorney General in Washington, January 24, 2023.\n\nPolice in Washington D.C. reportedly tried to arrest a Republican member of Congress for an alleged act of domestic violence, but U.S. Attorney Ed Martin is apparently not signing the arrest warrant.\n\nThat's according to a Monday article by NBC 4 Washington , which reported that an arrest warrant for Rep. Cory Mills (R-Fla.) was sent back to D.C. Metropolitan Police unsigned. According to the report, Martin - who is the Department of Justice's top prosecutor in D.C. - said the case merited \"further investigation\" after declining to sign the warrant.\n\nNBC 4 noted that in the police report, an unidentified 27 year-old woman who was not Mills' wife accused Mills of assaulting her at his apartment. The alleged victim said Mills \"grabbed her, shoved her and pushed her out of the door\" and showed responding officers bruises that officers on the scene described as \"fresh.\"\n\nThe alleged victim's police report also describes a phone call in which she \"let officers hear [Mills] instruct her to lie about the origin of her bruises ... Eventually, [Mills] made contact with police and admitted that the situation escalated from verbal to physical, but it was severe enough to create bruising.\" When officers encountered the alleged victim in the lobby of a nearby hotel, they noted that she was \"shaking and scared.\"\n\nOnce police informed Mills that he would be arrested, the alleged victim is said to have recanted her allegations, including where her bruises came from. A subsequent police report described the incident not as an assault but as a \"family disturbance.\" And a third police report reclassified the incident as an \"assault\" but clarified it was still \"under investigation.\"\n\nNBC 4 reported that the Metropolitan Police Department sent the arrest warrant for Mills to Martin's office, though Martin apparently refused to sign it. His office would only say that it \"does not comment on uncharged cases.\"\n\n\"Sources familiar with how cases are handled say this type of back-and-forth is not uncommon and may never result in charges,\" NBC 4 reporters Ted Oberg, Mark Segraves, Paul Wagner and Rick Yarborough wrote.\n\nMartin is a 2020 election denier and longtime far-right activist who President Donald Trump officially selected as the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, after naming his as interim U.S. attorney after his second inauguration. Martin was previously a defense counsel for participants in the January 6, 2021 insurrection. Earlier on Monday, his office sent a tweet accusing the Associated Press of \" refus[ing] to put America first. \" He also referred to U.S. attorneys as \"President Trumps'[ sic ] lawyers,\" though he was fact-checked by an X community note that read: \"The DOJ is not the personal law firm of the President.\"\n\nMills, who was elected in 2022, is married and has two children. In a statement, the Florida Republican maintained his innocence.\n\n\"This week, law enforcement was asked to resolve a private matter at Congressman Mills' residence,\" the statement read. \"Congressman Mills vehemently denies any wrongdoing whatsoever, and is confident any investigation will clear this matter quickly.\""
