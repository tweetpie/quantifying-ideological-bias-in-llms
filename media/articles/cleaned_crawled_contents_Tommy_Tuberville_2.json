      "text": "The Senate's Deep and Dirty Secret\n\nThe Senate \"hold\" procedure is making the institution's basic work impossible, and every member seems fine with that.\n\nWhat is a \"hold\" in the Senate? This is not a question that many casual observers of American politics would normally ask. But Tommy Tuberville, the senator from Alabama, has made it a more urgent one with his blanket hold on all key military promotions that have to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Tuberville's action, now in its seventh month, has kept hundreds of military leaders, including top officials, in limbo, doing real harm to the nation's armed forces.\n\nAs Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro told CNN, Tuberville is \"playing Russian roulette with the very lives of our service members by denying them the opportunity to actually have the most experienced combat leaders in those positions to lead them in times of peace and in times of combat.\" The three top service secretaries wrote jointly in The Washington Post earlier this month, decrying what Tuberville is doing.\n\nNo specific rule created the Senate-hold procedure; it is a custom, but one that flowed from the rules of a legislative body that values consensus and has enacted that value by requiring unanimous consent to do much, indeed most, of its business. Formally, a hold occurs when a senator writes a letter to the leaders in the body indicating that he or she will deny unanimous consent to moving to a vote on a nominee. Without unanimous consent, the only effective way to get to a vote is for another senator to file a cloture petition, meaning a separate vote to move to act on the nomination. For confirmations, that now takes only a majority of votes (legislation takes a supermajority of 60 out of 100 senators), but it is still a time-consuming process. After the petition is filed, it must be held over for two legislative days, with more parliamentary maneuvering before a cloture vote takes place and then, if that's successful, hours of guaranteed debate after. With what could be 650 military promotions, each needing individual actions without unanimous consent to bundle them, and with Senate-floor time a precious commodity, this is not feasible. Promotions at the officer level or above require Senate confirmation. This has never been controversial. But what was routinely done without any fanfare-military promotions, confirmed by voice vote, often en bloc, with unanimous consent-is no more.\n\nTuberville, a former college-football coach and someone who has never served in the military, is taking this step to force the Pentagon to eliminate a policy that enables active service members on military installations in states that ban abortions to travel to another state to obtain such a procedure; service members pay for the abortion itself, but not the travel costs. He is oblivious to the damage to the military and national security, and has faced criticism even from many members of his own party, including his leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nIn theory, if McConnell or the Senate Republicans really wanted to stop this insanity, they could do it any time that Tuberville is not on the Senate floor, if the Senate majority leader asked for unanimous consent and no other senator objected. But in reality, someone would object: When the Senate is in session, each party always has at least one member on the floor to prevent mischief from the other. That means denying unanimous consent if the other party wants to jam something through. The standard practice has been that members of your party respect the hold prerogative and deny unanimous consent, even if the person who placed the hold is nowhere to be found. Any move by Chuck Schumer to act on these promotions is denied a chance at unanimous consent by whatever Republican senator is on the floor at the time.\n\nThe Senate's deep and dirty secret is that holds work only because every member of the Senate wants them to. Other senators continue to deny unanimous consent not just to protect the prerogatives of their absent colleague, but to protect their own ability to use holds in the future. Every member of the body is culpable, because every one of them wants to have the opportunity to gain leverage over a president or another executive-branch official or agency. Even senators of the same party as the president find many instances where their pleas for attention or action are ignored or downplayed. Using a hold to block confirmation of someone a president dearly wants in office means that attention will be given. Of course, in most cases, the holds are for individuals and do not last very long.\n\nHolds have been a part of Senate procedure for a long time, but their use for punitive or ideological motives is relatively recent. During the Obama administration, Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas put a hold on Barack Obama's nominee for ambassador to the Bahamas, Cassandra Butts, that lasted for 27 months, until she died of cancer. The hold had nothing to do with Butts's qualifications or character-it was purely punitive. Tuberville is not the only senator now using blanket holds for partisan or ideological purposes; Kentucky's Rand Paul has a blanket hold on more than 60 ambassadors and other key State Department officials, and Ohio's J. D. Vance has done the same for Justice Department nominees, including the head of the Office on Violence Against Women and several nominees for U.S. attorney, in retaliation for DOJ actions against Donald Trump.\n\nFor a long time, holds were an allowable and sometimes beneficial practice that helped balance power between the Senate and the presidency. Senators rarely took advantage of the process by applying blanket holds or sustaining them for unreasonable periods of time. The main abuses in the past were when individual senators tried to keep their holds secret to avoid criticism. That practice was severely limited a few years ago. But the norms that kept the practice in check have been shredded.\n\nWhat to do? Two simple rule changes could break the impasse. First, by majority, the Senate could require an up-or-down floor vote on a confirmation within 30 days after the nominee has been reported out by the relevant committee. An alternative would be for the Senate to create by rule its own variation of the House's discharge petition: If a majority of senators sign such a petition, it would force a floor vote under a privileged resolution.\n\nThe Senate should go further yet to facilitate confirmations of judges and executive officials. It should allow multiple confirmations to occur en bloc, and move on from the practice of individual votes, which can involve several steps that use precious floor time. And it should significantly reduce the number of positions that require Senate confirmation. The old Senate is no more. In the new, tribalized Senate with too many obdurate and radical members willing to damage governance and national security without regard for the consequences, better rules are the only way to avoid these abuses."

      "text": "America Ruined College Football. Now College Football Is Ruining America.\n\nCoaches shouldn't be senators.\n\nUpdated 12:48 p.m. ET on November 5, 2022\n\nE very sports fan , whether they acknowledge it or not, has a line they won't cross-where the intrusion of the ugly real world onto the playing field becomes too much to ignore and they have to look away. Maybe you're a Miami Dolphins fan, so you'll root for Tyreek Hill, the Dolphins' $120 million wide receiver whose girlfriend accused him of threatening her life and breaking their 3-year-old son's arm, but you refuse to draft him in your fantasy league. Maybe you stuck with the Brooklyn Nets' Kyrie Irving when he wouldn't get vaccinated, but dropped him when he finally got suspended this week for refusing to apologize for tweeting out the link to an anti-Semitic, Islamophobic documentary.\n\nWhat are Cleveland Browns fans supposed to do about DeShaun Watson, their new franchise quarterback, whom team ownership signed to a five-year, $230 million megadeal this spring knowing full well that the NFL was about to suspend him for being a sexual predator? Boycott the team? Root for everyone on the field but him? His 11-game suspension ends in early December. What if he turns their season around and they make a playoff run? Some Browns fans won't skip a beat-they'll mutter something about second chances and note that the criminal charges were dropped-and some Browns fans are going to feel lousy about it until the day he leaves Cleveland.\n\nI was so obsessed with college football growing up that I would spend all of December watching every single televised bowl game, until it got preposterous, until I was wasting a Saturday afternoon watching the Poulan Weed-Eater Independence Bowl. I still love so much about the game-the unhinged unpredictability, the ludicrous offensive schemes, the mad carnival that is ESPN's College GameDay, Lee Corso going to his grave in a Wisconsin Badgers mascot head. I wasn't looking for reasons to break up with college football. The reasons came and found me.\n\nJemelle Hill: College football is cannibalizing itself\n\nI drifted from the game for all kinds of reasons, but at first it was just life stuff. I had two kids, and once you have kids you can watch football on Saturday or Sunday, but not both, and my fantasy team plays on Sunday. I went to a college in the Atlantic Coast Conference, but it was a basketball school-let's leave it at that.\n\nMy queasiness began with the revelations about undiagnosed concussions, the science of traumatic brain injuries (known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE), and the obvious reality that no one in a position of authority at any level of football-high school, college, or pro-could be trusted to worry about what used to be called \"getting your bell rung.\" Maybe it seems hypocritical to swear off college football but still watch the NFL. It is hypocritical. Stipulated. I was watching when the Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa's fingers twisted up during what looked like a seizure after his head slammed on the turf. But at least Tua had $30 million in the bank. He wasn't a teenager, too young to understand the risks, counting on the adults to protect him. The NFL has also, at a minimum, acknowledged the link between the sport and CTE; the NCAA, which is fighting a wrongful-death lawsuit filed by the family of a former University of Southern California linebacker, has not.\n\nOver the same period, head coaches at elite college programs were accumulating so much power that I began to see them as dictators of their own sovereign kingdoms. They had grown rich off of free labor, and they could get away with anything, it seemed, except losing.\n\nCollege-ball coaches have always been larger than life, but that's all they wanted to be-ball coaches. Politics was for bullshitters and pantywaists. True, Nebraska sent the Cornhusker legend Tom Osborne to the U.S. House of Representatives during George W. Bush's presidency, but he was an exception-and a rock-ribbed conservative, not a far-right ideologue. Now there's a wave of college-football candidates, and this generation has higher aspirations and scarier politics.\n\nIn North Carolina's most competitive congressional district, the Republican nominee is a 27-year-old Trump disciple named Bo Hines, who has built his political brand around his college-football career . Hines chose a scholarship to North Carolina State University ( Go Pack! ) over several other offers because he already knew, at 18, that he wanted to run for office. Now he speaks largely in football jargon, except when he's arguing that rape or incest victims should be allowed to get an abortion only \"on a case-by-case basis through a community-level review process outside the jurisdiction of the federal government\" according to a local news site . Hines spent one year at NC State, transferred to Yale, blew through his first marriage in 10 months, and lives off of a trust fund. He's probably going to win.\n\nThe trite old phrase about sports holding up a mirror to our society no longer applies to college football. The image is no longer just imagery. The sport's tribalism is being repackaged as an electoral strategy. It's an offshoot of Trumpism-cults of personality disguising a multibillion-dollar engine of capitalism fueled by nostalgia and grievances about how great America used to be. For people who live in SEC or Big 10 country-and the way those two conferences keep gobbling up schools, soon all of America will be one or the other-the degrees of separation between college football and the gears of politics, the daily operation of our nation, are being erased.\n\nLooking back, my breaking point with college football occurred in August 2020, during that awful first summer of COVID-19. A plague was sweeping through Mississippi. ICUs were full. Bodies were piling up. And so Governor Tate Reeves invoked the only thing he could think of that might get his citizens' attention, something even more dear to them than their own survival.\n\n\"I want to see college football,\" Reeves said in a press conference. \"The best way for that to occur is for us all to realize that wearing a mask-as irritating as that can be, and I promise I hate it more than anyone watching-is critical.\" If you won't wear a mask for your loved ones, do it for the Ole Miss Rebels.\n\nThat was it. That was when I completed my transition from a kid who grew up cheering for Bobby Bowden and the Florida State Seminoles-no matter how often they lost to Miami, because my stepfather went there-to the guy I am now: a grown man and father of two who still watches sports way too much, but who can't watch college football at all anymore.\n\nF or two years now , Alabama has been represented in the U.S. Senate by Tommy Tuberville, the former head football coach at Auburn University, who won in a landslide even though his most recent qualification for the job was winning the Chick-fil-A Bowl in 2007. (A year later they paid him $5 million to leave. Two years after that, his successor led Auburn to a national title.) As The Atlantic 's Jemele Hill pointed out recently on Twitter , Tuberville's coaching career depended on being invited into the homes of young Black men, looking into their parents' eyes, and asking them to put their sons' futures in his hands. \"He made millions off their abilities, but here's what he really thinks about Black folks,\" she wrote, sharing a clip of Tuberville at a Donald Trump rally on October 8, ranting about a nonspecific \"they\" who \"want reparation because they think the people that do the crime are owed that! Bullshit!\"\n\nNo prominent Republican called for Tuberville to resign, or even to apologize. That includes Herschel Walker, the former University of Georgia running back, another ghost of Southeastern Conferences past, whom Georgia Republicans are trying to put in the Senate alongside Tuberville. A couple more and they can caucus together.\n\nWalker's ex-wife says he once put a gun to her head and told her he was \"going to blow [her] brains out.\" According to his estranged son, Christian, now 23, Walker was such a threat that he and his mother moved \" over 6 times in 6 months running from [his] violence .\" When Donald Trump released a statement urging Walker to run , he didn't mention any of this. Nor did he mention Walker wasting his prime on the former president's New Jersey Generals of the USFL, the historic bust that brought the two of them together in the mid-1980s. But Trump did mention the Georgia Bulldogs, Walker's team when he won the Heisman Trophy 40 years ago. That trophy is Walker's one and only qualification for the U.S. Senate, and the only one he needs.\n\nPeter Wehner: Herschel Walker perfectly embodies the GOP\n\n\"Wouldn't it be fantastic if the legendary Herschel Walker ran for the United States Senate in Georgia?\" Trump said. \"He would be unstoppable, just like he was when he played for the Georgia Bulldogs, and in the NFL. He is also a GREAT person. Run Herschel, run!\"\n\nRegardless of whether Walker wins or loses next week, Republican kingmakers surely realize by now that they've discovered a gold mine of future candidates. What's most perplexing about Tuberville's ascendance is that he's way down on the list of popular ex-football coaches from Alabama. He's not even the most popular ex-football coach from Auburn. (That would be Gus Malzahn, who led Auburn to a national title in 2013.) Walker is a serial abuser who played football at Georgia so long ago that no voter under the age of 40 was alive yet to witness it. These aren't even the good candidates yet.\n\nIf Nick Saban decided to run for president tomorrow, he could remain on the sidelines in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, for the next two years and he'd still roll tide into the White House in 2024. Except Saban would never do it, because his current job pays far too well, and he's very good at it. Tommy Tuberville wasn't, and that's why he was available to run for Senate. Now whenever I see a clip of the Clemson head football coach, Dabo Swinney, patrolling the sidelines embodying every tweet by the blowhard-coach parody account @3YearLetterman , all I see is a future senator from the great state of South Carolina.\n\nSometimes I'm not quite sure what unnerves me more: when good coaches aren't held to account for being bad people, or when bad people aren't even held to account for being bad coaches.\n\nConsider Urban Meyer, who built a pair of elite college programs and got paid roughly $9 million to bring his culture of winning to the NFL's hapless Jacksonville Jaguars. He was fired after just 13 games, having revealed himself to be a toxic and abusive leade r, a goofus too stupid not to get filmed in a bar after a loss with a woman who was not his wife grinding on his thigh . He seemed particularly baffled that grown men making actual salaries weren't okay with being bullied by some Big 10 loudmouth with zero NFL wins.\n\nBut within months, he had passed back through the college-football reality-distortion field and was restored to his seat on Fox's Big Noon Kickoff pregame-show panel, where he wasn't the worst coach in NFL history-he was the two-time national champion Urban Meyer, former head coach at the Ohio State University, where they extend your contract for kicking the kicker when he misses a goddamn kick, as well as the former head coach at the University of Florida, where he remains a Gator for life. Meyer is a future senator, too, if he ever wants to switch careers. The only question is whether he runs in Florida or the Ohio state.\n\nIn this alternate universe, Brett Favre, the NFL Hall of Fame quarterback and University of Southern Mississippi football star who pushed the state's previous governor to siphon off welfare funds in order to build a volleyball stadium, isn't a shameless embezzler. He's a family man and a gridiron legend who was just trying to give back to his community. Tuberville isn't an ignorant racist who viewed every Black kid he recruited as someone he was rescuing from jail or slavery-he's a proven winner. If Georgia voters send Walker to Washington, they won't be electing a failed ex-athlete who fumbled his pro career, beat his wife, and terrorized his children-they'll be electing grainy YouTube footage of a Heisman Trophy winner. They'll be electing someone who makes them feel about America the way they feel about college football.\n\nM y earliest college-football memory might explain why I fell so hard for the sport: Doug Flutie, Boston College's pint-size quarterback, with the bashed golden helmet and smeared white jersey, flinging the ball 60 yards into the end zone as time expired in the Orange Bowl in 1984 against the University of Miami Hurricanes. Unlike the ball used in the NFL, the college ball has white stripes on either end, so even without the video, I can still picture Flutie's perfect spiral, the ball sneaking through a crack in the wall of bodies and flailing arms at the goal line and into the end zone, where the wide receiver Gerard Phelan caught it while falling backwards. BC wins, 47-45. \"I don't believe it!\" Brent Musburger, the voice of college football, yelped on CBS. Here in New England, they still call it the \"Hail Flutie,\" or just \"Flutie to Phelan.\"\n\nIn retrospect the game was meaningless. Miami had already lost the previous week and was out of the running for the national title. BC finished the 1984 season 10-2, ranked fifth overall in the final AP poll, beat the Houston Cougars in the Cotton Bowl, and hasn't been heard from since. The Hail Flutie was thrilling, but there are thrilling Hail Fluties every other weekend in college football. The play lingers in sports history primarily because of the story around it-the collision of two very different cultures, a tidy allegory for the War on Drugs era-all of which went over my head at the time, because I was 8.\n\nI didn't know that this game was viewed by many people through a prism of good versus evil, with a none-too-subtle racial coding. I didn't know anything about \"the U,\" Luther Campbell and 2 Live Crew, the Mariel Boatlift, race riots, or police brutality, and I only knew about cocaine because of Nancy Reagan. I didn't understand that the story here-at least the story my team was telling-was about a bunch of scrappy white Catholic boys from Massachusetts storming into a drug den from Miami Vice and pulling off the college-football miracle of the century. The day after Thanksgiving no less, as though inspired by the Pilgrims themselves.\n\nWhat I remember is the spiral. Most pro coaches back then believed in patient ball control, three yards and a cloud of dust, and no one threw the ball over the middle because decapitation was still legal. The NFL was dour and militaristic. Your jersey number corresponded strictly to your position. Quarterbacks stayed below 20, and even 19 was a little weird. Wide receivers were expected to wear numbers in the 80s , and only the 80s. Maybe one wideout in the league wore a 12, and if you pulled that kind of shit, you better be good. But no one gave a flip in college football. Gerard Phelan wore 20! Doug Flutie-a quarterback-wore 22! You make simple decisions when you're a kid.\n\nCollege football was sloppy fun, and best of all, they chucked the ball over the field. Some schools did, anyway. Some didn't throw the ball at all, ever-they were so earthbound and conservative that they ran an offense called the \"wishbone\" that featured three running backs. Power football. System football. Final score 13-9 football. I hated the wishbone. If this whole sport was just one big war metaphor, then I wanted to see an all-out aerial attack. I wanted quarterbacks who threw the football like they'd just pulled all the pins out of a box of grenades. For me, college football peaked on Friday nights, when I would stay up past midnight watching Western Athletic Conference football-the Wacky WAC of the Rocky Mountains-where all the coaches were light-headed from the altitude and breathing all of that Bill Walsh West Coast Offense air. I'd fall asleep watching Robbie Bosco shatter passing records at Brigham Young University and win games by scores like 59-48.\n\nThe college game in that era was regional and ragtag, a loose confederacy in the mold of America itself, and the bowl system helped keep it that way by being, in a word, idiotic. Intentional chaos, purposeful haziness. You had to be invited to a bowl, which was shady and favored the big programs that could deliver big TV ratings. Then they'd play all of these huge games with national-title implications on New Year's Day, one right after another, into the night, and then the season just ... stopped. The title was decided by not one but two polls, one for coaches, one for the sports media. Sometimes two teams split the polls, and the college-football season would end with something downright un-American: co-national champs. It was destined to be replaced with a playoff system, and eventually it was, and I think I speak for all sports fans when I say good riddance .\n\nBut I also loved it. Each bowl had its own quirks, silly traditions, historic enmities. Each New Year's Day, a different bowl could luck into deciding the national title. And in the same way that Flutie to Phelan was filling me with a story about America while I was focused on the tight spiral and the cool white stripes, bowl season had the grateful optimism of a colorful bounteous harvest. The Peach Bowl! The Sugar Bowl! The Cotton Bowl! The Orange Bowl! All these ... crops. All these games held under the beating sun, on giant fields all across the former Confederacy ... played by strong young Black men ... monitored by older white men who took all the money.\n\nRead: The Super Bowl was a game changer for the NFL\n\nRight around this time, Herschel Walker was carrying the Georgia Bulldogs to a national title at the Sugar Bowl. After he retired from pro football, Walker was institutionalized for dissociative identity disorder rooted in deep childhood trauma, and he has said that at one point he was managing 12 different \"alters.\" There's no cure for dissociative identity disorder. It's often triggered by stress. He's a damaged man who's done terrible things, but to Georgia Republicans, he's just a promising recruit with a spotty record, and they're counting on him to carry them to victory. He's a teenager again, and they're back in his living room, looking him in the eye. And if he loses on Election Night, they'll dump him before sunrise.\n\nT he optics of college football have always been problematic, but they've mostly been just that: optics. Now Tuberville is a U.S. senator who, by the way, adamantly opposes college athletes getting paid for the use of their NIL-their \"name, image, and likeness\"-in other words, for owning their own body. He fears that last summer's monopoly-busting Supreme Court ruling in NCAA v. Alston , which ruled that restrictions on \"education-related benefits\" for college athletes violate antitrust law, \"has created an environment where student-athletes can be exploited.\" He thinks only coaches should be able to do that.\n\nCollege-football coaches despise the idea of players getting paid, and they've taken to slinging mud at one another's programs, accusing rivals of buying recruits. That's how you know it's working, by the way: The fraternity is turning on itself. They keep doomsaying about how fair compensation for NIL is going to destroy college football, when in reality, that's the only justification for saving it.\n\nI often think about a photograph, by the artist Hank Willis Thomas, of two young Black men squaring off on a floodlit field at night. You know Thomas's work if you've ever crossed the Brooklyn Bridge-he made the 22-foot bronze sculpture near the bridge's exit of a Black athlete's outstretched arm pointing a finger to the heavens, or maybe it's spinning an invisible basketball, or maybe it's anointing its owner the greatest. (The arm belongs to the All-NBA center Joel Embiid, who plays in Philadelphia-a little inside joke from a sports-mad artist.) In Thomas's photograph, the two men crouch in the familiar arrangement of opposing linemen prior to the snap. On the right side is a football player in a classic three-point stance, ready to explode; on the left, another man is in the same pose, only he's in a cotton field, and instead of a uniform he's wearing weather-beaten clothes and a wide-brim straw hat. The photograph is called The Cotton Bowl .\n\nThomas made the photo in 2011, but I didn't come across it until many years later, right around when all these thoughts started swirling in my head. The idea came to him, Thomas told me recently, when he saw an archival photo of prison laborers at Angola, the infamous Louisiana state penitentiary that was named after the former slave plantation upon which it was built. The pitched angles of the prisoners' bodies reminded him of that three-point stance. Once I saw The Cotton Bowl , I couldn't unsee it: two economies of human exploitation, captured in a single photograph.\n\nThomas isn't prescribing any behavior; he's not calling for a boycott of college football. He's doing what artists do: showing us the truth. He's challenging us to take in the whole portrait, and not just the parts that are reassuring to see, or that tell us the story about America we want to believe.\n\nThomas made The Cotton Bowl during President Barack Obama's first term, and in that moment, it looked reflective, an act of connecting past to present. But when I look at it now, it feels more like a warning about how easily we could slide backwards. Tommy Tuberville coached in the Cotton Bowl in 2007. He'll be in the U.S. Senate until at least 2026. He is America's future.\n\nThis article originally misidentified the bowl at which Herschel Walker and the Georgia Bulldogs won a national title. It was the Sugar Bowl, not the Orange Bowl."

      "text": "The Senate Exists for a Reason\n\nThese four Trump picks should be stopped.\n\nThis is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.\n\nAs president-elect, Donald Trump has the right to name the people he wants in his Cabinet. Some of Trump's nominations, such as Senator Marco Rubio to lead the State Department, are completely ordinary. A few are ideological red meat for Republicans. Others are gifts to Trump loyalists .\n\nFour of these nominees, however, are dangerous to the security of the United States and to the well-being of its people: Pete Hegseth (Defense), Tulsi Gabbard (Office of the Director of National Intelligence), Matt Gaetz (Justice), and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (Health and Human Services). The Senate must turn back these nominations, and do so en bloc.\n\nThe Gaetz and Kennedy nominations are apparently already in trouble , and more than enough has been written about them. Gaetz is an accused sexual predator (he has long denied the allegations); ironically, he is the least dangerous of this pack. Yes, as attorney general he would green-light every raving demand from MAGA world for investigations into Trump's enemies, but in a strange blessing, he is also likely to be completely incompetent. The Department of Justice, as Trump himself learned during his first term, is packed to the rafters with very sharp lawyers who would almost certainly jam up any of Gaetz's unconstitutional orders. Gaetz's tenure at Justice would be a national humiliation and destructive to the rule of law, but it would also likely be very short.\n\nThe RFK Jr. nomination is, in a word, pathetic. Most of his views are little more than pure anti-science kookery , and if he is confirmed, Americans-and especially their children-will be in peril from this anti-vaccine crusader. But he would be a danger to the health of individual Americans (especially those who watch too much TV and spend too much time on the internet) rather than to the continued existence of the United States.\n\nWhich brings me to Gabbard and Hegseth.\n\nTulsi Gabbard, as I wrote last week, is unqualified for the job of DNI, but she is also a security risk: I have held security clearances for most of my adult life, and had I worked in any federal office next to her, I would have had no compunction about raising her as an \"insider threat\" because of her political views and her shady international connections. (As a member of Congress in 2017, she held meetings with the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad outside of U.S. government channels-an obvious problem for anyone seeking a senior role in national security.)\n\nGaetz, Kennedy, and Gabbard are terrible choices. The Hegseth nomination, however, is easily the most dangerous and irresponsible of all of Trump's picks. (Gabbard is a significant hazard, but she would not have a gigantic army at her disposal, and she would not be involved with the control of nuclear weapons.) Like the other three in this group, Hegseth is shockingly unqualified for the job he's been asked to take, but in this case, the Senate is faced with a proposal to place a TV talking head at the top of the Pentagon and insert him into the nuclear chain of command.\n\nHegseth has made personal choices that make him unfit to lead the DOD, including his extramarital affairs (which apparently helped tank his chances to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs in Trump's first administration) and a payoff to a woman who claimed that he'd sexually assaulted her. He denies the assault allegation, but in any case, adultery is a criminal violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice and can be a career-ending mistake for a member of the armed forces.\n\nI will leave aside whether Hegseth's tattoos identify him as a white supremacist. Hegseth denies the claim. But some of Hegseth's ink is popular with extremists; that's why one of his own military comrades reported him as an insider threat in the first place-and not, as Hegseth and some whining conservatives claim, because he is being persecuted as a Christian. I knew many people in federal service with patriotic tattoos. (I have one myself, and no, it's none of your business where it is.) I am also a Christian who wears a cross-one that I had blessed in a church-every day. That's not what any of this is about.\n\nHegseth's defenders seem unable to understand that neither Hegseth nor anyone else has a right to be the secretary of defense: If the nominee made choices earlier in life that would now undermine his effectiveness in the job, then that's his problem, not the Pentagon's. But even if Hegseth were not an example of a sexist, MAGA-bro culture -his statements about women in the military are particularly noxious-the Senate is still faced with the problem that he's utterly unqualified.\n\nA former Army major, he has no serious background in national-security or defense issues beyond his military service. (And how that service ended is apparently now a matter of some dispute .) He has not worked anywhere in the defense world: not in any of its agencies, not with any of its industries, not with any of its workforce in any capacity. He has never managed anything of any significant size.\n\nNot only would he be incapable of administering America's largest government department, but he'd also be in a position of terrifying responsibility for which he is unprepared. Imagine an international crisis, perhaps only a year or two from now. President Trump is facing a situation that could be rife with danger to the United States and our allies-perhaps even one that involves nuclear threats. At this dire moment, Trump turns to ...\n\nPete Hegseth and Tulsi Gabbard?\n\nThe Senate must do everything in its constitutional power to stop this. Trump won the election, but no president has an absolute right to his Cabinet nominations: The Constitution requires the Senate to consent to those nominations. Trump has already warned that if the Senate balks, he will subvert this process by using \" recess appointments ,\" in effect a demand that the Senate take a walk and let Trump do whatever he wants-to consent, in other words, to autocracy.\n\nIncoming Majority Leader John Thune and others who still might care about their duty to the nation have time to go to Trump, right now, and tell him that these four nominations are DOA. They could tell Trump that it is in his own interest-the only interest he recognizes-not to risk multiple defeats. And if the Senate folds and decides to take these up one at a time, Trump will wear them down, likely accepting that Gaetz must be a Succession -style \" blood sacrifice ,\" in return for which Trump gets everyone else. For Thune-who, one assumes, does not wish to begin his tenure as a statelier version of Senator Tommy Tuberville, the MAGA obstructionist who held up military promotions for months-accepting such a deal would be a huge strategic error.\n\nWhomever Trump nominates as replacements will likely be dangerous in their own way. But these four nominees have to be stopped-and right now.\n\nRelated:\n\nHere are four new stories from The Atlantic :\n\nToday's News\n\nDispatches\n\nExplore all of our newsletters here.\n\nEvening Read\n\nHow Jimmy O.

      "text": "Republican Leaders Are More Afraid of Trump Than Ever\n\nTrump's ridiculous Cabinet nominations will provide senators with a new test.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nIf you had predicted before the election that Donald Trump's second administration would seek to hand some of the most sensitive and powerful roles in government to a Fox News personality (Pete Hegseth, nominated for defense secretary), a recurring Fox News guest who is also featured frequently on Russian state-controlled media (Tulsi Gabbard, nominated for director of national intelligence), and the target of an ongoing House Ethics Committee sexual-misconduct investigation (Matt Gaetz, nominated for attorney general), you might have been accused of fearmongering. The notion would have sounded like a beyond-worst-case scenario cooked up to scare moderates out of voting for Trump. And yet that scenario is now upon us.\n\nFollowing the announcement of Trump's unconventional slate of Cabinet picks, serious Republicans attempted to make clear that they are still in charge and won't let things get out of hand. The Gaetz pick, in particular, drew immediate derision. Gaetz \"will never get confirmed,\" an unnamed Republican senator told Fox News. Senator John Cornyn rolled his eyes and let out \"an audible snort,\" while Gaetz's Republican House colleagues reportedly gasped when they heard the news.\n\nMaybe the Senate caucus really will draw the line somewhere-perhaps at Gaetz, perhaps at one or both of Gabbard and Hegseth. But there is something disconcertingly familiar in the confident yet carefully hedged assertions that the old-line GOP will stop this madness. It is exactly what Republicans said would stop Trump from receiving the nomination in 2015, from winning the presidency in 2016, and from reclaiming the party's leadership after the ignominy of January 6. \"I don't think he's a serious candidate,\" Senator Lisa Murkowski said yesterday, of Gaetz. That is almost a verbatim repetition of what elected Republicans once said about Trump.\n\nElaine Godfrey: Matt Gaetz is winning\n\nAt every step along the way, Republican elites have assumed that they could stop Trump later. But when the decisive moment arrived, they discovered that the cost of confrontation had gotten higher, not lower. Opening a breach with a man whom the base had come to admire, and then worship, would imperil their own ambitions, not just Trump's.\n\nThe Republican affirmations of support for Gaetz have been less ambiguous than the background statements, facial contortions, and guttural noises expressed against him. \"There's no question we've had our differences,\" Senator Markwayne Mullin acknowledged , referring to Gaetz. (The \"differences\" to which Mullin was tactfully alluding presumably consist of, as he once described to a CNN reporter, Gaetz's penchant for showing pictures of \"girls that he had slept with\" to disgusted House colleagues and bragging about his creative use of erectile-dysfunction pills.) Still, Mullin said, \"I completely trust President Trump's decision making on this one.\" Mullin granted that Gaetz would have to answer \"a lot of questions that are gonna be out there.\" While this technically leaves open the possibility that Gaetz supplies a \"wrong\" answer, it also implies that there is a correct one that would justify confirming an alleged sex pest whose primary qualification is a willingness to abuse power.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham's reaction to the Gaetz announcement was a microcosm of his Trump-era career. \"I don't know yet, I'll have to think about that,\" he initially told reporters yesterday afternoon. By evening, having evidently given the matter all the necessary thought, Graham had transformed into a loyalist, pleading with his fellow partisans to join him in submission. \"Elections have consequences,\" he explained on Fox News. \"To every Republican: Give Matt a chance.\"\n\nSenator Tommy Tuberville not only pledged his support for Trump's slate of nominees but threatened primaries against any Republicans who dissent. This is deadly serious business. Loyalty to Trump is the main basis on which Republican-primary voters choose their nominees. Trump has proved willing time and again to handicap the GOP's prospects of holding seats-thus undermining his own base of support in Congress-by endorsing the most slavish loyalists over slightly more independent and much more electable alternatives.\n\nTom Nichols: The loyalists are collecting their rewards in Trump's Cabinet\n\nAt the moment, having won reelection with an actual popular-vote majority, and about to enter his tenth year as the party's most prominent figure, Trump's command over its base is at an apogee. To block Trump's selections would be not only to flout his authority, but to deny a narrative to which the base has subscribed: Trump as the innocent victim of a relentless \"deep state\" conspiracy. If Republican senators prevent Trump from installing the allies he says he needs to defeat that vast conspiracy, their voters may well conclude that those senators side with Trump's enemies.\n\nThe Republican lawmakers who justified Trump's election on the grounds that they would restrain his worst impulses now realize that his worst impulses have arrived, and they're not so easy to restrain. One can see the rationalizations forming in advance. Do legislators really want to blow up their relationship with Trump before his term has even begun, forfeiting their chance to exert influence over policy and staffing? Wouldn't it be better to let Trump have his nominees, but hold them to account with strict oversight hearings? \"What I'm hearing privately from a few key GOP senators: yes, they'd prefer to not have a messy fight over Gaetz,\" the CBS News reporter Robert Costa posted this morning on X. \"Not their favorite. But they also don't have a lot of energy for pushing back. Trump runs the show, they say. If Gaetz can reassure them, they're open to backing him.\"\n\nOld-guard Republicans appear to be in the middle stage of a familiar Trump-era progression. It begins He'd never do it before moving on to We'll stop him if he tries and finally settling on There was nothing we could have done anyway . As they advance through these stages, they will cede Trump more and more power, which will only vindicate their ultimate fatalism. How could they ever have stood up to somebody so strong?"

      "text": "American Democracy Perseveres-For Now\n\nAntibodies against authoritarianism are still working, but the U.S. system remains under immense strain.\n\nThis is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.\n\nDemocracy is under attack around the world; in the United States, the summer brought good news and bad news. The institutions of democracy are still functioning, but not for long if enough Americans continue to support authoritarianism.\n\nFirst, here are four new stories from The Atlantic :\n\nLayered Repression\n\nAlmost two years ago, I engaged in a thought experiment about what the failure of democracy in the United States might look like. I wrote it for an Atlantic subscriber newsletter I had back then, and I hope you'll forgive me for revisiting it, but after a summer in which American democracy has been walking a tightrope over the authoritarian chasm, it's worth looking back to see how we've done since early 2022.\n\nThe most important point, and the one that I think bears repeating, is that the failure of democracy in America will not look like a scene from a movie, where some fascist in a black tunic ascends the steps of the Capitol on Inauguration Day and proclaims the end of freedom:\n\nThe collapse of democracy in the United States will look more like an unspooling or an unwinding rather than some dramatic installation of Gilead or Oceania. My guess-and again, this is just my stab at speculative dystopianism-is that it will be a federal breakdown that returns us to the late 1950s in all of the worst ways.\n\nWe're already seeing this unwinding in slow motion. Donald Trump and many on the American right (including the national Republican Party) have made clear their plans to subvert America's democratic institutions. They made continuous efforts to undermine the will of the voters at the state level, most notably in Georgia, after the 2020 presidential election, and then they tried to overrule the results at the national level by setting a mob on Congress on January 6, 2021. If Trump returns to the Oval Office, he and his underlings will set up a system designed to set up a series of cascading democratic failures from Washington to every locality they can reach.\n\nThey intend to pack courts with judges who are loyal to Trump instead of to the Constitution. They want to destroy an independent federal civil service by making all major civil servants political appointees, which would allow the right to stuff every national agency with cronies at will. They want to neuter independent law-enforcement institutions such as the FBI , even if that means disbanding them. They will likely try to pare down the senior military ranks until the only remaining admirals and generals are men and women sworn not to the defense of the United States but to the defense of Donald Trump , even if that means employing military force against the American public.\n\nTrump and his supporters are not even coy about some of these ideas. The Heritage Foundation- once a powerhouse think tank on the right that has since collapsed into unhinged extremism and admiration for foreign strongmen -has a \"Project 2025\" posted on its website, with sections that read like extended Facebook comments. I took a look so that you don't have to, including at a policy-guide chapter on the military authored by former Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller.\n\nHeritage and Miller (a seat warmer brought in by Trump at the tail end of his administration) think it's very important for the next president-I wonder who they could possibly have in mind-to \"eliminate Marxist indoctrination and divisive critical race theory programs\" and to reinstate personnel dismissed for disobeying orders to get vaccinated.\n\nAlso:\n\nCodify language to instruct senior military officers (three and four stars) to make certain that they understand their primary duty to be ensuring the readiness of the armed forces, not pursuing a social engineering agenda.\n\nWhy not just write up a loyalty oath to Trump? Little wonder that Senator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama is holding up the promotion of some 300 senior officers ; perhaps it's occurred to him (or others) that sitting on those promotions until 2025 might open the door for Heritage's unnamed next U.S. president to sweep out the Marxist gender theorists and replace them with \"real Americans\" who know that their duty is to a man rather than a moldering document in the National Archives.\n\nThe rest of Project 2025 is a lot of putative big-think from wannabe conservative intellectuals such as Ken Cuccinelli, Ben Carson, Stephen Moore, and Peter Navarro (who is currently on trial for contempt of Congress). Much of this stuff is nonsense, of course, but it'll be nonsense right up until the point it isn't: These are all names that would reappear in a second Trump administration, and this time, they'd move a lot faster in breaking down the federal guardrails around democracy.\n\nThis layered state, federal, and local repression is what I worried about back in early 2022:\n\nThis is where we really will have \"free\" and \"unfree\" Americas, side by side. To drive from Massachusetts to Alabama-especially for women and people of color-will not be crossing the Mason-Dixon line so much as it will be like falling through the Time Tunnel and emerging in a pre-1964 America where civil rights and equal treatment before the government are a matter of the state's forbearance. If an American citizen's constitutional rights are violated, there will be no Justice Department that will intervene, no Supreme Court that will overrule. (And arresting seditionists? Good luck with that. I expect that if Trump is reelected, he will pardon everyone involved with January 6.)\n\nTrump, of course, has since made the promise to drop pardons like gentle rain from the sky. America's democratic immune system, however, is for now still functioning. The courts have done their duty even when elected officials have refused to do theirs. (Imagine how much healthier American democracy would be right now if the Senate had convicted Trump in his second impeachment. Alas.) Trump is now under indictment for 91 alleged crimes, and Jack Smith seems undaunted in his pursuit of justice.\n\nLikewise, the major ringleaders of January 6-all but one, I should say-have been convicted of seditious conspiracy, among other crimes, and sentenced to lengthy prison terms. Some of these supposed tough guys ended up blubbering and pleading for mercy in a federal courtroom, but to no avail. The would-be Oath Keepers centurion Stewart Rhodes and a leader of the Proud Boys, Ethan Nordean, each got 18 years, a record broken yesterday when a Trump-appointed federal judge sent the ex-Proud Boys chair Enrique Tarrio inside for 22 years, meaning he will be sitting out the next five presidential elections.\n\nThis is the good news, but none of it will matter if Trump returns to the White House.\n\nI shouldn't end on such a dire note. Trump is the likely nominee, and although I still feel a chill about the threat of authoritarianism, I also can't shake the feeling that most Americans in most states want no part of this ongoing madness. I still have faith that most people, when faced with the choice, will continue to support the constitutional freedoms of the United States-but only if they understand how endangered those freedoms are.\n\nRelated:\n\nToday's News\n\nEvening Read\n\nHip-Hop's Fiercest Critic\n\nBy Spencer Kornhaber\n\nOne sunny day in 1995, the Notorious B.I.G. sat in the passenger seat of a black Mercedes-Benz, smoking joints and talking shit. Of course, Biggie did these things on many days during his short lifetime, but on this particular day, a neighborhood friend named dream hampton was in the back seat with a video camera. Wearing Versace sunglasses and a checked purple shirt, the 23-year-old rapper-whose breakout album, Ready to Die, had come out the year before-held a chunky cellphone to his ear. He was making plans and talking about girls, riffing in his lisped woof of a voice. He laughed and brought a square of rolling paper, full of pot leaves, to his lips.\n\nFrom behind the camera, hampton asked whether he intended to consume their entire bag of weed. Annoyed at the interruption, Biggie mocked her question. Hampton's voice turned sharp. \"Why are you going at me today?\" she asked. \"What's the problem?

Rhode Island CD 1 is a heavily Democratic district (it went for Joe Biden in 2020 by 29 points ), so the winner of the Democratic primary is likely to prevail in the general election. Yesterday's Democratic winner was Gabe Amo , a young man who worked in the Obama and Biden administrations. Amo is Black, and if he goes to Washington, he'll be the first person of color to represent Rhode Island in Congress.\n\nBut what fascinated me yesterday was that we all voted in Rhode Island CD 1 without having much of an idea who was likely to win. For various reasons, including the short run-up to the primary, none of the local media outlets or universities did any polling. Twelve candidates, including several Rhode Island elected officials, ran in the primary. A few looked to be prohibitive favorites early on; one was felled at the last minute by scandal. Another, Aaron Regunberg, seemed to be ubiquitous on the airwaves, with ads touting his endorsement from Bernie Sanders. (Probably not a great idea in Rhode Island; Regunberg came in second but ran more than seven points behind Amo.)\n\nI often say that people should vote as if their one vote will make the difference; for once, I walked into the booth with the thought that my vote could, in fact, be the deciding vote. As a political junkie, I love polls, but it was nice to be able to cast a ballot without knowing whether my preferred candidate was the likely winner or loser.\n\n- Tom\n\nIsabel Fattal contributed to this newsletter.\n\nWhen you buy a book using a link in this newsletter, we receive a commission.

      "text": "Did Russia Invade Ukraine? Is Putin a Dictator? We Asked Every Republican Member of Congress\n\nTwo simple questions, few straight answers\n\nSign up for Trump's Return , a newsletter featuring coverage of the second Trump presidency.\n\nUpdated at 4:05 p.m. ET on February 27, 2025\n\nI n just three weeks , President Donald Trump has exploded long-standing U.S. foreign policy and sided with Russia against Ukraine and the rest of NATO. He sent American diplomats to open negotiations with Russian counterparts-without inviting Kyiv to participate. He falsely blamed Ukraine for starting the war with Russia, and echoed the Kremlin line by calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a \"dictator.\" Then, in a press conference on Monday, Trump declined to say the same of Vladimir Putin. \"I don't use those words lightly,\" he told a reporter.\n\nMost Republicans strongly condemned Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, and have voted on multiple occasions to send the country military aid. But with their party's leader back in the White House, many of them have grown quiet. Are any GOP lawmakers willing to say, in plain terms, what is true?\n\nI reached out to all 271 Republican members of the House and Senate to find out, asking each of them two straightforward questions: Did Russia invade Ukraine? And is Putin a dictator? So far, I have received 25 responses.\n\nSome members were unambiguous: \"Yes and yes,\" a spokesperson for Senator Susan Collins of Maine replied in an email. \"Vladimir is undisputedly an enemy of America and a dictator,\" read part of the statement from the office of Representative Jeff Hurd of Colorado.\n\nOthers chose to send excerpts of previous non-answer statements or links to past TV interviews rather than answer either \"yes\" or \"no.\" A spokesperson for the GOP's House leader, Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana, replied only with a readout of Johnson's praise for Trump's dealmaking prowess. A spokesperson for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas replied with a link to an interaction with ChatGPT in which the chatbot noted that Cruz had in 2022 acknowledged Russia's invasion of Ukraine and did in 2020 call Putin a dictator. (Still, no straightforward \"yes\" from Cruz today.)\n\nThe House Foreign Affairs Committee, chaired by Representative Brian Mast of Florida, opted to stake out a position that seemed different from Trump's: The panel posted a screenshot of our questions on X, with the caption: \"ON THE RECORD: Russia invaded Ukraine & Putin is a dictator. But that doesn't mean our European allies shouldn't match Russian military spending & recruitment.\" (Another post referred to our questions as \"BS.\") The Atlantic followed up to ask whether this statement represented Mast's personal view, but received no further response.\n\nOthers refused to answer entirely: \"Does the Atlantic believe we're here to answer gotcha questions to advance narrow opinion journalism?\" Jonathan Wilcox, communications director for Representative Darrell Issa of California, said in an email.\n\nIn fact, it is clearly in the public interest to know how elected officials, particularly those who make decisions about national security, regard foreign powers that have long positioned themselves against the United States. And it is also clearly in the public interest for citizens to know if their representatives' views have shifted on who is-or is not-a foreign adversary.\n\nWhat follows is the full list of responses from every Republican member of Congress. It will be regularly updated with any additional responses.\n\nRepresentative Don Bacon of Nebraska : A spokesperson pointed to a statement on X from Bacon on February 19, in which he said: \"Putin started this war. Putin committed war crimes. Putin is the dictator who murdered his opponents. The EU nations have contributed more to Ukraine. Zelensky polls over 50%. Ukraine wants to be part of the West, Putin hates the West. I don't accept George Orwell's doublethink.\"\n\nRepresentative Michael Baumgartner of Washington : \"The Congressman expressed all his thoughts on the Russia-Ukraine War to the Spokane-Review on February 19. He was very clear that Russia and Vladimir Putin were the aggressors of the war in Ukraine,\" a spokesman said, adding this link .\n\nSenator Susan Collins of Maine : \"As Senator Collins has said multiple times, yes and yes,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz of Texas : A spokesperson for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas replied with a link to an interaction with ChatGPT in which the chatbot noted that Cruz had in 2022 acknowledged Russia's invasion of Ukraine and did in 2020 call Putin a dictator.\n\nSenator John Curtis of Utah : A spokesperson pointed to Curtis's bipartisan resolution supporting Ukraine and a February 25 interview on KSL NewsRadio , in which Curtis said, \"Ukraine was invaded by a dictator.\"\n\nRepresentative Julie Fedorchak of North Dakota : \"Yes, Vladimir Putin and Russia invaded Ukraine and yes, he is a dictator,\" the representative told me. \"This war has cost countless lives and destabilized the world. I believe President Trump has the strength and leadership to bring peace and restore stability in a way that puts America's interests first.\"\n\nRepresentative Jeff Hurd of Colorado : \"Did Russia invade Ukraine? Russia's invasion of Ukraine was an unprovoked act of war. Russian President Vladimir Putin is a dictator? Vladimir is undisputedly an enemy of America and a dictator. It is dishonorable and wrong not to stand up against the tyranny of Putin,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nRepresentative Young Kim of California : \"Yes to both,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nRepresentative Mike Lawler of New York: A spokesperson pointed to a recent statement in which Lawler said, \"Vladimir Putin is a vile dictator and thug who clearly started the war in Ukraine.\"\n\nRepresentative Brian Mast of Florida : A spokesperson for Mast sent a link to a post on X from the House Foreign Affairs Committee: \"ON THE RECORD: Russia invaded Ukraine & Putin is a dictator. But that doesn't mean our European allies shouldn't match Russian military spending & recruitment. Europe must realize that for our alliance to be the strongest in history, America needs a Europe that can hold its own.\" (Another post referred to our questions as \"BS\"and declaring it would cancel its subscription to our magazine.)\n\nSenator Jerry Moran of Kansas: A spokesperson pointed to a statement in which the senator references \"Putin's unjustified invasion of Ukraine,\" and confirmed that the senator would call him a dictator.\n\nSenator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska : A spokesperson sent a link to a statement in which the senator said that Russia launched an \"unprovoked war on Ukraine.\" The spokesperson added: \"And yes, she does believe that Vladimir Putin is a dictator.\"\n\nRepresentative Austin Scott of Georgia: \"Russia invaded Ukraine and is the aggressor in this war,\" the representative told me. \"Putin is a dictator who has invaded Ukraine multiple times-this war would end today if he would pull his troops back into Russia.\"\n\nSenator Roger Wicker of Mississippi: A spokesperson pointed to previous statements in which Wicker said Russia invaded Ukraine and called Putin \"a war criminal who should be in jail for the rest of his life, if not executed.\"\n\nSenator Todd Young of Indiana : \"Yes and yes,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nRepresentative Dan Crenshaw of Texas : A spokesman provided a link to an interview with Piers Morgan in which Crenshaw cautioned against returning to a pre-World War II order allowing \"dictators to conquer other countries and take their stuff.\"\n\nRepresentative Warren Davidson of Ohio : A spokesperson said the representative declined to comment.\n\nSenator Joni Ernst of Iowa : \"Like all Americans, Ernst wants to see an end to Putin's unjust war that has cost far too many lives,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nRepresentative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia: A spokesperson said: \"These questions are ridiculous. I'd advise you to search Congresswoman Greene's X page.\"\n\nRepresentative French Hill of Arkansas : A spokesperson did not address the question of whether Putin is a dictator, but sent a link to an Arkansas PBS interview in which the representative said, \"This war was started by Vladimir Putin,\" and that \"Ukraine has to be at the table\" for any peace deal.\n\nRepresentative Bill Huizenga of Michigan: A spokesperson pointed to a statement from the congressman acknowledging the invasion and encouraging peace, but did not answer whether Putin is a dictator.\n\nRepresentative Darrell Issa of California : A spokesperson said, \"Does the Atlantic believe we're here to answer gotcha questions to advance narrow opinion journalism?\"\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana : A spokesperson sent over Johnson's recent comments during this week's GOP leadership press conference about Trump's dealmaking skills and his desire for peace in Ukraine, but did not answer either question directly.\n\nRepresentative Scott Perry of Pennsylvania: A spokesperson pointed to two recent statements by Perry regarding Ukraine and Russia, but did not answer the questions directly.\n\nSenator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama : A spokesperson did not answer directly but sent a link to an interview with Newsmax, in which the senator said, \"President Trump is not a Putin apologist.

Tuberville is a major backer of Donald Trump. In 2020, he defeated Democrat Doug Jones, who served in the Senate from 2018 to 2021 and was a U.S. attorney who successfully prosecuted two members of the Ku Klux Klan involved in the 1963 Birmingham, Alabama, church bombing that killed four girls. We get response to Tuberville from Jones and look at white supremacists in the military and more with Southern Poverty Law Center senior investigative reporter Michael Edison Hayden.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Alabama Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville is coming under fire after expressing support for white nationalists in the U.S. military. Tuberville made the comments last week while talking to WBHM , an NPR affiliate in Alabama.\n\nSEN . TOMMY TUBERVILLE : We are losing in the military so fast our readiness in terms of recruitment. And why? I'll tell you why: because the Democrats are attacking our military, saying, \"We need to get out the white extremists, the white nationalists, people that don't - don't believe in our agenda, as the Joe Biden agenda.\" They're destroying it.\n\nRICHARD BANKS : You mentioned the Biden administration trying to prevent white nationalists from being in the military. Do you believe they should allow white nationalists in the military?\n\nSEN . TOMMY TUBERVILLE : Well, they call them that. I call them Americans.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : \"I call them Americans.\" In an attempt to walk back his comments, Senator Tuberville told a reporter at NBC , quote, \"I look at a white nationalist as a Trump Republican.\" Listen carefully.\n\nSEN . TOMMY TUBERVILLE : I look at a white nationalist as a - as a Trump Republican. That's what we're called all the time, a MAGA person. That's what I'm just - that\" -\n\nJULIE TSIRKIN : Do you agree with that assumption?\n\nSEN . TOMMY TUBERVILLE : Well, I agree that we should not be characterizing Trump supporters as white nationalists.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Senator Chuck Schumer blasted Tuberville's remarks, describing them as \"utterly revolting.\" The controversy comes as President Biden told graduates at Howard University Saturday white supremacy is a poison and the, quote, \"most dangerous terrorist threat in the country.\"\n\nMeanwhile, on Sunday, members of the white supremacist group Patriot Front marched along the National Mall in Washington, D.C., carrying shields and battle drums.\n\nSenator Tommy Tuberville was already facing criticism for blocking nearly 200 military promotions to protest a Pentagon policy which covers paid leave for workers who have to travel out of state to get an abortion. Tuberville remains a major backer of Donald Trump. Last week, he decried the New York jury that unanimously found Trump had sexually assaulted and defamed E. Jean Carroll. Tuberville said the jury's decision, quote, \"makes me want to vote for him twice.\"\n\nWe're joined now by former Alabama Senator Doug Jones, a Democrat who served in the Senate from 2018 to 2021. He lost to Tuberville in the 2020 election. Jones is also a former U.S. attorney, who successfully prosecuted two Ku Klux Klan members involved in the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, that killed four girls between the ages of 11 and 14.\n\nSenator Doug Jones, welcome to Democracy Now! If you could first respond to your former opponent - Tuberville beat you for the Senate seat that you held - talking about, responding to the issue of the Pentagon Secretary Lloyd Austin trying to rout out white supremacists in the military?\n\nDOUG JONES : Well, I think it's absolutely outrageous, what he's saying. It's deplorable. You know, he talks about the fact that Democrats are attacking the military. No, Democrats are not attacking the military. We're actually supporting the military. It is Senator Tuberville who is attacking the military and all of their policies, whether it is holding up nominations for promotions, which affects readiness and morale, or attacking the policies that the administration is trying to do to kind of weed out these white nationalists, these white supremacists. You know, you only have to look at what happened in Boston recently, where a young National Guardsman leaked classified information, and now we're learning he is the very kind of person that the administration is trying to weed out of there. It makes no sense whatsoever, what Senator Tuberville says, and is purely a political ploy attacking the administration at every turn.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : When asked about white nationalists, he said he calls them Americans. You have a long, illustrious civil rights history. You put two members of the Ku Klux Klan behind bars for the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in 1963, the bombing happened. Can you talk about what white nationalism means and what he's saying?\n\nDOUG JONES : Sure. You know, look, they may be American citizens, but they're dang sure not patriots. These are not people that support the government of the United States. They support themselves. They support only the white nationalists that they are. They don't support a diverse society. They don't support a diverse America. And if you look at what's happening, just look at the Patriot Front guys who marched around the Capitol just recently, they are hell-bent on trying to make this a purely white country, and totally not recognizing what's going on in this country and how supportive this country is of the diversity that we see. And that's the real problem. They will resort to violence. They will resort to subversion of the United States, if possible, in order to get the kind of country they, in their mind, think is appropriate. And that is a real problem in the United States military. It's a problem in law enforcement across this country. And we have to make sure that we do everything necessary to get those people out of the chain of command, out of the military, so that we can protect all Americans and protect our national security.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : During a March 28th hearing with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Senator Tuberville was quoted saying, quote, \"War is hell. You know that better than anybody. Every recruit should know that. But in the last few years we've put them through a different kind of hell. In one of your first acts, Mr. Secretary, you put our military - every single member, active and reserve - through a mandatory training to root out 'extremists.'\" Tuberville was clearly disparaging this. Your response, Senator Jones?\n\nDOUG JONES : It's just hard to respond to just stupid statements like that. I mean, that's the only way that you can describe that kind of reaction to the United States military, to think that we should not be rooting out extremism - on either side, by the way. It doesn't matter whether if it's extremism on the right or extremism on the left. That is dangerous to the United States military, to morale, to the chain of command, to our national security. And, yes, war is hell. Everything is difficult in the military. That is exactly why you have to have a disciplined military, not people that are going to go off like this guy did and provide classified information to his buddies online. You've got to have that discipline. And you cannot have that discipline if you have extremes on either side.\n\nYou know, this is not an old John Wayne movie, where you've got that kind of war is hell. This is a very diverse military. It has people of all races, all religions. It has - you know, I think roughly 20, 25% are now women. And the military brass, the leaders of our military, have to protect all of our servicemen and women, and they have to do it in a way that recognizes the differences we have, but at the same time being able to watch the chain of command and keep that in line. That is what is most important. And the extremism, that Senator Tuberville is complaining that there is being rooted out, needs to be rooted out.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to continue on this issue of white supremacists. In addition to Senator Jones, we're joined by Michael Edison Hayden, senior investigative reporter with the Southern Poverty Law Center, which is based in Alabama, where he focuses on far-right extremism. He's joining us from New York City.\n\nMichael, thanks you for joining us again. A report you helped author last year said, quote, \"Roughly one in five applicants to the white supremacist group Patriot Front claimed to hold current or former military status, according to leaked documents reviewed by Hatewatch.\" Explain, and also put this in the context of Senator Tuberville's comments.\n\nMICHAEL EDISON HAYDEN : Well, yeah, I mean, Senator Tuberville is correct in saying that these folks are Americans, you know, and America has a very serious problem with radical-right extremism, as evidenced by all the violence that we've seen in recent years, all the different times I've come on your show to talk about it. So, I mean, people with military backgrounds are heavily sought after by extremist groups like Patriot Front, partly because they have a knowledge of how to operate in these kind of urgent situations. Think about January 6th, although Patriot Front was not involved there, and the degree to which military training could be advantageous to folks in the Proud Boys or Oath Keepers. All right, so there's like a technical understanding of things that they understand. And there's also the fact that we don't treat our veterans particularly well in this country, which, you know, allows extremist groups to feed off of potential resentment or feelings of frustration, and makes those folks good recruits.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go back to Doug Jones and talk about Tuberville's role right now in saying that over 200 Department of Defense promotions are being blocked. They're being blocked by one senator, by Senator Tuberville, who's demanding the Pentagon change its abortion policy for servicemembers and dependents which the Biden administration has supported since last October. Explain how it's possible that one senator, Senator Tuberville, can block the actions of the entire Senate. What's the procedure used? And talk about what he's doing it for.\n\nDOUG JONES : Well, first of all, I think he's doing it for - because he's fighting culture wars. He accuses Democrats and others of politicizing the military, but yet he is the one politicizing the military. He is the one that is blocking promotions of military across the services because of the culture war issue over the abortion policy that the Department of Defense has to protect women in the military.\n\nSo, what he's doing is that he cannot completely block a nomination. And a lot of people don't realize that military promotions at certain ranks have to be confirmed by the United States Senate. And what he's doing is he's preventing those from being considered, and blocked, literally, you know, maybe a hundred or 200 at a time, where promotions can be moved through the Senate very quickly and very efficiently. That is always a nonpartisan issue. That is something that is done routinely to give deference to the military, to give deference to the administration. He has decided not to do that and to require the Senate to take up every nomination, every promotion, one at a time, which requires - the Senate rules have a number of hours. It will delay work in the Senate. It will delay the military.\n\nAnd it has a ripple effect through the chain of command, because these servicemen and women that are in line for the promotions, their entire careers are on hold. And those behind them, that are set to fill the positions that they're being left vacant, are also on hold. This is really devastating to morale, again, to the chain of command and, ultimately, national security and our readiness. And it shows a fundamental misunderstanding about the nature of the military, the nature of service to this country, and what people are looking for when they decide to go into the military as a career. It is really outrageous, what he's doing in the Senate.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : At the same time, Michael Edison Hayden, we have the massacre in Allen, Texas, where the gunman, who killed eight people and injured 10, was influenced by neo-Nazi and white supremacist ideology. You have the march by the Patriot Front on the National Mall this weekend. And you have jury selection in the trial of Robert Bowers, the 50-year-old man who killed 11 worshipers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. Can you put this all together at this point? And then I have a final question for the senator.\n\nMICHAEL EDISON HAYDEN : Sure. You know, Senator Tuberville's comments speak to the deep, deep denial in this country of what is happening, as far as radical white extremism is concerned. You know, I mean, like, we have people being murdered on a semi-regular basis now. Go back to the Tree of Life terror attack in October of 2018. Then you have, like, El Paso, for example, in the summer of 2019. You have the attack in Colorado Springs focused on the LGBTQ community. And then you have, of course, what happened in Allen, Texas. And there are some in between.\n\nThis type of thing keeps happening, just as we have this problem with - you know, we have this problem with radicalization in the military, which we've been warning about going back to the mid-'80s, without enough of a response. We had - for example, in the '90s, we had Timothy McVeigh. These things keep being brought up, these issues of violence and racism. These are core problems in American life that go to the real struggles to be American and to keep people safe. Now, think about the fact that we have 700 - over 700 Confederate symbols on military bases, and we have Black people serving throughout the military. So these are core problems, and the denial in this country is really deep, and it has to change.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And you have Fort Benning just changing its name to Fort Moore.\n\nMICHAEL EDISON HAYDEN : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : But I want to end with Doug Jones on a note of history. You have repeatedly said that perhaps the most important thing you've ever done as U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Alabama was to prosecute the Klansmen who killed the four little girls in Birmingham, Alabama, when they blew up the church. We're approaching the 60th anniversary of that tragedy in September. Talk about the case and fighting white supremacist violence then, your role in convicting Thomas Blanton and Bobby Frank Cherry, and where you think we stand today, 60 years later.\n\nDOUG JONES : Well, I appreciate you asking that question, because it is something that has been very important to me, to Alabama, to this country, that we recognize one of the most horrific civil rights crimes in the history of this country, a civil rights crime that really, I do believe, changed the course of civil rights history. And we use the term \"woke\" these days, but, in fact, that bombing really awakened America to the tragedies and the horrifics of Jim Crow and the fact that you had so much racial violence in the '50s and '60s. And what concerns me now is that we are forgetting that. We haven't looked back and learned the lessons of history and the tragedies of history that I think we should have.\n\nAnd, in fact, the similarities that I see today is the rhetoric of politicians. In those days, it was Bull Connor, the racist police commissioner. It was governors like George Wallace and Ross Barnett, who stoked anger and stoked hatred and stoked violence with their dog whistle-type politics. And I think what we're seeing now is something very, very similar. You see that across the board, where it's particularly a kind of - the MAGA right Republicans that seem to want to instill violence and hatred, support for people who violate the law and attack others. That's a real danger.\n\nAnd it goes beyond just black and white now. It gets into religion. It goes to the Hispanic community. It goes to the Muslim community. We are a much more diverse society than we were in the 1960s, in 1963, when this bomb exploded, killing those four young girls. And I think we have to celebrate this diversity. But instead, what we're seeing is the hate and the violence spreading its wings to all races, all ethnic groups, all religions. And that is that white nationalist philosophy that Tuberville thinks, apparently, is OK in the military, OK in our law enforcement, and apparently OK in this country. Well, it's not. It's not. And we have to work very, very hard, remember the lessons of the past and work very hard to root that out.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Doug Jones, I want to thank you very much for being with us, former Democratic senator for Alabama, speaking to us from Washington, D.C. And Michael Edison Hayden, senior investigative reporter with the Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nNext up, we turn from extremism in the military and in the Senate to a Neo-Nazi in the offices of Congress? Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "Tommy Tuberville Wants Mahmoud Khalil, Other Protesters In Jail: 'Free Speech Is Great, But...'\n\nTrends Reporter\n\nSen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) is joining a chorus of Republican lawmakers in condemning Mahmoud Khalil , the Palestinian activist and recent Columbia University graduate who organized peaceful protests on campus last year amid Israel's ongoing war on Gaza.\n\nThe Syria-born legal U.S. resident was abducted from his university-owned apartment Saturday by federal immigration agents who didn't have a warrant or a crime to charge him with. Khalil is currently being held in a detention facility in Louisiana .\n\nWhile most conservatives who support this apparent First Amendment breach appear content with calls to deport Khalil, Tuberville told Fox Business on Wednesday that he belongs in jail - along with \"all\" the other protesters supposedly disrupting education.\n\n\"The Democrats , basically, they don't like our country anymore,\" said Tuberville . \"They just want to tear it down ... Every Democrat that we work with up here, they're gonna take this guy's side and they're gonna try to drive this narrative that he's doing the right thing.\"\n\n\"You know, we have two levels of education,\" Tuberville added. \"We have K-12 and we have higher ed. We've gotta treat both of them different, but when it comes to protesters, we gotta make sure we treat all of 'em the same: Send 'em to jail.\"\n\nImmigration agents claimed after detaining Khalil that his green card will be revoked, but his attorney Amy Greer filed a habeas corpus petition on his behalf Monday - prompting a district judge to rule against his deportation pending further legal action in his case.\n\nTommy Tuberville: \"When it comes to protesters, we gotta make sure we treat all of them the same: send them to jail.\" pic.twitter.com/Na55pK3QsM\n\nPresident Donald Trump , who appears to call anyone belonging to his political opposition \"Palestinian\" these days, labeled Khalil a \"Radical Foreign Pro-Hamas Student\" on his Truth Social platform Monday, despite there being zero evidence to support that claim.\n\nMore than a dozen progressive lawmakers published an open letter Tuesday demanding Khalil's release , arguing that the Trump administration's \"illegal actions set a dangerous precedent\" of stifling constitutional rights \"to free speech and due process\" in America.\n\n\"Free speech is great, but hateful, hate, free speech is not what we need in these universities,\" Tuberville said Wednesday about anti-Israel protests across schools. \"And they don't need to be doing things that they're preaching from Hamas, about antisemitism.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) on Wednesday came up with an unexpected way of trying to describe a triangle as he called for cuts to the Defense Department.\n\nAnd he name-checked a demon from the DC Universe in the process.\n\n\"We have to start in the Pentagon,\" he said on Fox News as he advocated for budget cuts pushed by tech billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency. \"We need to make a trigon, three sides instead of five sides, in the Pentagon.\"\n\nHe called the Pentagon \"way too big, way over-bloated\" and urged Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to continue to \"cut out all the bloat, and all the DEI, get our military back to a killing machine.\"\n\nIt's at least the second time Tuberville has referred to a triangle as a \"trigon.\"\n\nHe also did it last week when speaking to reporters as he suggested \"taking it from a Pentagon to a Trigon\" by cutting \"a couple sides\" from the building.\n\nCritics noted that Tuberville's archaic reference to a triangle also inadvertently conjured up a powerful villain in the DC Universe: Trigon, a dimension-hopping demon DC Comics describes as the \" living embodiment of evil itself \" who frequently battles the Teen Titans.\n\nTuberville was given a free lesson in \"triangle\" vs. \"Trigon\" on social media:\n\nIf only we had a name for a three-sided object.\n\nDid he say, \"Trigon\"? pic.twitter.com/FMFZ9R5ewx\n\nA triangle.

You are, without question, the dumbest man to ever walk the halls of congress.\n\nTrigon? The DC comics supervillain?!?\n\nTrigon again?  At this point I gotta believe it's intentional.\n\nIf you combined the intellects of Trump and Tuberville they still would have trouble completing kindergarten. A trigon?

      "text": "Tommy Tuberville Suggests GOP Senators Should Blindly Support Trump's Nominees\n\nReporter, HuffPost\n\nSen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) is not known for his constitutional scholarship. But he demonstrated a new level of misunderstanding on Thursday as he spoke to CNN 's Manu Raju about Pete Hegseth , President-elect Donald Trump 's pick to run the Department of Defense.\n\nHegseth, a former Fox News host, has been confronted with a series of allegations about alcohol abuse, sexual misconduct and financial mismanagement since Trump announced he wanted him to oversee the U.S. military.\n\nWhile the president may choose whomever he wants to fill his Cabinet and other top positions, the Constitution states that he must do so with the \"advice and consent\" of the Senate. In other words, it is the Senate's job to help vet the president's nominees.\n\nIn Tuberville's view, however, Republican senators should offload that job onto their Democratic colleagues, trusting that Trump has vetted his nominees well enough.\n\nTuberville told CNN's Raju he had concerns about Republicans who presume to be \"a better vetter and picker of people than Donald Trump.\"\n\nRaju countered that providing advice and consent is Tuberville's job.\n\n\"Advice and consent, but that's more the Democrats,\" Tuberville responded.\n\n\"But don't you think both sides should do the vetting?\" Raju asked.\n\nTuberville agreed, \"to some degree,\" but added that Democrats \"should do all the background work.\"\n\n\"Donald Trump did all the vetting they needed to do on Pete Hegseth, and I just can't believe we even have people on our side that are saying, 'Well, I've got to look at this, got to look at that,\" he said.\n\n\"What they're doing is they're throwing rocks at Donald Trump. They're not throwing them at Pete Hegseth. They're throwing them at Donald Trump because they're saying, 'Well, we don't believe you did the right vetting and we don't believe he can do that job.' Wait a minute. That's not our job to do that. That's the Democrats.\"\n\nOther GOP senators have indicated they take their role seriously.\n\nSen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) told Fox News on Thursday that she had a \"thorough\" conversation with Hegseth the day before but would not commit to supporting him through the nomination process just yet.\n\n\"I think, for a number of our senators, they want to make sure that any allegations have been cleared, and that's why we have to have a very thorough vetting process,\" said Ernst, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\nHegseth has indicated he intends to fight for the job, although he has no senior military leadership experience.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Tommy Tuberville Says 'Housewife' Katie Britt Gave A Good State Of The Union Speech\n\nSenior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\n\nWASHINGTON ― Sen. Tommy Tuberville tried to praise fellow Alabama Republican Sen. Katie Britt for her response to President Joe Biden 's State of the Union on Thursday, but landed himself in hot water in the process.\n\nAsked if he had concerns with the setting of Britt's speech ― she delivered it in her home kitchen in Alabama, which some on the left and right found in poor taste ― Tuberville said he didn't, because \"she was picked as a housewife, not just a senator.\"\n\nHe added: \"Somebody who sees it from a different perspective, you know ― education, family, all those things. ... I mean, she did what she was asked to do. I thought she did a good job. And it's hard when you've never done anything like that.\"\n\nTuberville said he disagreed with critics of Britt's delivery, panned by pundits on both sides of the aisle as being overly dramatic, and told HuffPost she did a good job.\n\n\"I thought the delivery was good. People were going to make fun of anybody. Some people like it, some people don't,\" Tuberville said.\n\nBritt, 42, is a former attorney and aide to retired Sen. Richard Shelby, who she replaced in the Senate in 2023. She's considered a rising star in the GOP and has even been discussed as a possible vice presidential nominee. Republican leadership picked her for the job in part to offer a generational contrast with the 81-year-old Biden.\n\nBut many people found Britt's tone in her speech off-putting and forced - including some on the right, like commentator and staunch Trump supporter Charlie Kirk.\n\n\"I'm sure Katie Britt is a sweet mom and person, but this speech is not what we need,\" Kirk wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \"Joe Biden just declared war on the American right and Katie Britt is talking like she's hosting a cooking show whispering about how Democrats 'dont get it'.\"\n\nBritt's GOP Senate colleagues downplayed the flak she got online, however, arguing the kitchen setting worked well to highlight how Biden's policies are impacting working families.\n\n\"I think her point though was to sort of discern or differentiate between the big podium and the kitchen table topics is what she was aiming for,\" Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said. \"Whether she struck that, I don't know, but I'm quite certain the audience she was aiming at wasn't Charlie Kirk's audience ― swing voters in swing states, probably suburban professional women.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "OOF: Trump's 'Great' New Football Story Contains A Fumble For The Ages\n\nDeputy Editor, Trends, HuffPost\n\nCritics are calling foul on President Donald Trump for an easily debunked claim about Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) and Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes , who will make his fifth Super Bowl appearance this weekend.\n\n\"And Tommy Tuberville, a great coach,\" Trump said on Wednesday as he signed an executive order aimed at blocking trans student-athletes from girls' and women's sports.\n\nTrump continued:\n\n\"You know, his quarterback was named Mahomes. He was a great college coach. And I said, 'How good was he?' He said, 'You don't want to know how good. He made me into a great coach.' He's a pretty good quarterback, right? Yeah, he was very good. He's a good guy, too.\"\n\nTuberville once coached at Texas Tech, where Mahomes played before entering the NFL.\n\nBut he never coached Mahomes.\n\nIn fact, Tuberville split for the University of Cincinnati in 2012 ― nearly two years before Mahomes' first game for the Red Raiders in 2014.\n\nTuberville shared the story on X despite the fact that it's not true:\n\nThank you, Mr. President, for standing up for women's sports! pic.twitter.com/O3TUWsfAEB\n\nTuberville has in the past said he helped to recruit Mahomes for Texas Tech, but AL.com says that's also false .\n\nFans were quick to offer up some fact-checks on social media:\n\nWhat a dilemma for Tommy Tuberville.He now has to say that Trump completely lied about the story where he had a whole conversation with Tommy about coaching Mahomes.Or he has to lie and say that he coached Mahomes.What's a good cultist supposed to do here?\n\nIf Biden said this it'd be a weeklong story at least\n\nTuberville taking credit for Mahomes 😂 What an honest US Senator. https://t.co/R9hlvQ8gUb\n\nTuberville also coached Tom Brady, LeBron James, and Tiger Woods.

No mention that he didn't coach Mahomes but shares it anyway!! 😅😂🤣🤡 https://t.co/NBO40KKpIz\n\nMy favorite part of this is not that Tuberville never coached Mahomes but that Trump either fabricated that conversation with Tuberville or Tuberville pretended he did coach Mahomes. Either quite possible. https://t.co/ABOnEmnckA\n\nI'll never understand how every right-wing Southerner and rural American thinks this guy is like them. He doesn't know sports, he's never been hunting or fishing, he doesn't like country music, he doesn't like trucks, he doesn't drink beer, he's not a Christian and knows nothing about it, etc.\n\nOh my god his team posted the clip on his official account, they don't even care that he's lying https://t.co/8USnMuFV3j\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "GOP Senators Blast Tommy Tuberville Over Blockade On Military Promotions\n\nSenior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\n\nWASHINGTON ― Republican frustration with Sen. Tommy Tuberville's (R-Ala.) monthslong hold on over 300 military nominees boiled over on Wednesday when several of his GOP colleagues railed against his tactics.\n\nIn an extraordinary debate on the Senate floor, Republican senators blasted Tuberville's hold and sought to approve via voice vote promotions of uncontroversial senior military officials stalled because of his objection to the Pentagon's policy on travel for abortion care that was put in place after the reversal of Roe v. Wade last year.\n\nTuberville was unmoved and objected to each one.\n\n\"I will keep my hold in place until the Pentagon follows the law or the Democrats change the law,\" he said of the travel policy.\n\nRepublicans stood by Tuberville's hold for months, trying to craft a compromise with Democrats behind the scenes. Their patience finally broke on Wednesday.\n\nSen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), a Marine, said he disagreed with the Pentagon's abortion policy but called Tuberville's hold \"hugely disruptive\" to military readiness, and pushed back against the characterization from some on the right that the military is somehow dominated by \"woke\" culture.\n\n\"The idea that these officers are supposedly 'woke' or 'desk jockeys' is ridiculous,\" Sullivan said. \"These are some of the most combat-experienced generals and admirals we've ever had in our country.\"\n\n\"Why are we putting holds on war heroes?\" he asked.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told Tuberville to change tactics and file legal challenges to the Pentagon's abortion policy, rather than block nominees who have no control over it.\n\n\"If you think they've done something illegal, go to court,\" Graham said.\n\nAfter Tuberville objected to Graham's request to promote one major general nominee, Graham said: \"You just denied this lady a promotion.

Mitt Romney (R-Utah) piled on, calling Tuberville's hold \"an abuse of the powers we have as senators.\" Senatorial holds on nominees ought to be \"reasonable\" and targeted to officials in charge of policy, he said.\n\nSen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), an Iraq war veteran, similarly tried to get Tuberville to stand down on individual nominees, but the Alabama Republican refused to budge.\n\n\"Democrats think abortion is more important than the nomination and our military,\" Tuberville said even though no Democrats appeared on the Senate floor on Wednesday.\n\nThe Senate typically approves military promotions quickly and unanimously in blocks of nominations. To take them up one at a time, as Tuberville has insisted, would require months of Senate floor time.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Collectively they traded hundreds of millions of dollars worth of stocks and related securities - usually from industries that are closely regulated by Congress.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) continues to lead the field in options trading, having bought $12.75 million worth of options contracts in 2021.

And the way they buy and sell shares, you'd be forgiven for thinking Congress is less a deliberative body for crafting laws than an extension of the stock market.\n\nIn spite of a pair of insider trading scandals that cost Georgia's Republican senators their seats at the start of last year, Congressional gambling on the share market actually increased in 2021, according to a year-end report issued this week by investment watchdog Unusual Whales, comprising more than $400 million worth of transactions. What's more, members of both parties in each chamber of Congress averaged higher-than-market returns for the year, other than Senate Republicans, who performed just below the market average.\n\nThe biggest jump came from stock options, devices that give investors the right to later buy or sell a stock before a particular date, an investment vehicle that reached record popularity in 2021, but tends to favor more experienced and wealthier investors. Members of Congress traded a total of $140 million worth of options last year, more than five times the amount in 2020, according to the report, which is based on all the financial disclosure forms between December 1, 2020 and December 22 of last year.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), who just recently defended Congressional stock trading by arguing the United States is a free market economy, continues to lead the field in options trading, having bought $12.75 million worth of options contracts in 2021. It's well more than the next highest trader, Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), who sold $2 million worth of options.\n\nBut they were both blown out of the water in 2021 by Representative Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ), who both bought and sold more than $60 million worth of contracts, all of whose call options - meaning, those contracts giving him the right to later buy a company's stocks at a certain price - were in Microsoft stock. Gottheimer is maybe best known as the corporate-funded obstructionist who led a short-lived effort to torpedo the Build Back Better bill, which included a modest corporate tax hike.\n\nWhile the volume of stock trading fell by nearly $200 million since 2020, Congress still bought and sold nearly $290 million in stocks over the course of the year. The report points out that much of this drop is due to the exit from Congress of Republicans David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, the Georgia stock traders who moonlit as senators through 2020, a year in which they carried out roughly $200 million worth of stock trades. \"When we exclude these two Senators, stock trading in both years were comparable,\" states the report.\n\nThe busiest periods of trading came at the beginning and closing months of the year. GOP senators made a large amount of stock purchases in January, the start of Biden's term, and in March, the month Biden signed his $1.9 trillion stimulus, which Republicans in the Senate opposed lockstep.\n\nMeanwhile, House Democrats sold tens of millions of dollars worth of stocks in September and October, as negotiations over Biden's infrastructure agenda was reaching a critical point, while senators sold nearly $8 million worth of stock in November, most of it by Republicans. This was the same month Biden signed his physical infrastructure package and effectively shelved his plans for funding human infrastructure like education and child care. Both bills were opposed in near lockstep by Republicans.\n\nThe report singles out several fortuitously timed transactions by congresspeople that suggest illegal insider trading. Representatives Kevin Hern (R-OK) and Kathy Manning (D-NC), for instance, both bought Lockheed Martin stocks shortly before the company won a nearly $11 billion Air Force contract, while Representative Blake Moore (R-UT) bought $60,000 of Raytheon shares while on a subcommittee reviewing defense contracts.\n\nSimilarly, Tuberville and Representative Pat Fallon (R-TX), both of whom also sit on committees that oversee defense contracts, sold considerable amounts of Microsoft stock two weeks before a $10 billion Pentagon contract with the company was canceled. Representative Brian Mast (R-FL) bought shares in Tilray, a marijuana producer, shortly before voting for a marijuana de-scheduling bill in 2020, then sold them for a 564 percent return in February 2021, one of the biggest returns in the House all year.\n\nMore generally, tech and fossil fuel were the top-traded stocks among congresspeople, with shares in certain individual mineral and mining companies being particularly popular among Senate Republicans specifically. It points to one of the difficulties of the failing US attempt to transition away from fossil fuels, when the politicians meant to be steering this effort are financially invested in their continued exploitation. It also suggests that Republican senators were maneuvering to get rich off the flurry of construction Biden's infrastructure bill was set to put into motion, at the same time they overwhelmingly opposed the bill and falsely blamed its spending for the rise in inflation.\n\nThe list of members of Congress who beat the market in 2021 includes every one of the names already mentioned, excluding Hern, Manning, and Fallon, as well as a variety of other prominent lawmakers. That includes Democrats Thomas Carper, Elaine Luria, and Ron Wyden, and Republicans Shelley Capito, Mitch McConnell, and Dan Crenshaw, who had a particularly successful year in playing the share market. Even progressive representative Peter Welch (D-VT) is on there, years after being embroiled in a scandal that found him trading stocks in pharmaceutical companies that supported a bill he voted for - a bill that ended up limiting authorities' power to stop prescription drugs from ending up on the black market.\n\nAll of this was made possible by a 2012 law that set some limits on members of Congress and their staff trading off information they received in briefings, and mandated the public disclosure of trades. But even this has been limited, with a recent Insider investigation finding that as many as fifty-four federal lawmakers failed to report their stock trades.\n\nMore importantly, as the Unusual Whales report shows, the 2012 law merely placed this corruption out in the open without actually curbing it, and a bipartisan push to ban congressional stock trading entirely now seems to be in its early stages.\n\nJon Ossoff, the Georgia senator who owes his seat in large part to his predecessor's insider trading, has introduced a bill banning stock trading by members of Congress and their families, with Senator Josh Hawley (D-MO) introducing his own, less strict bill to do the same. House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy has also said he might try for a ban if Republicans win back the House in 2022, but some leading Democrats, following Pelosi's lead, have been noncommittal so far.\n\nShould the push for a full ban be actually serious and successful, it will only be one small step in ending the open corruption of the US political system. Members of Congress will still continue to be bribed with campaign contributions and corporate jobs, while US politics continues, logistically, to be almost exclusively limited to the wealthiest strata of society - the very people most likely to trade in stocks and otherwise invest on the side as they set public policy.\n\nStill a law banning the practice is long-since needed, and would be more than welcome. Until then, the political elite will day-trade while Rome burns.\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nAs Congress comes back into full swing following the midterm elections, we find ourselves in this year's National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) season. Since last year's record-high $778 billion budget, this year's NDAA top line, authorized by the Senate Armed Services Committee, is coming in at an astounding $858 billion .\n\nThis number surpasses even Joe Biden's original astronomical request of $813 billion. Prior to going on recess, the Senate proposed NDAA amendments adding up to $100 billion to the originally proposed budget. While these amendments vary in subject, they are united in their biggest beneficiaries. Military contractors like Boeing and General Dynamics will profit greatly from the approval of more military weapons purchases, finding an even larger market for their V-22 Osprey aircrafts, Abrams tanks, and Stryker vehicles. And as several members of Congress own significant stocks in these and other defense companies, they have a lot to gain from a bigger NDAA budget too.\n\nWeapons industry money in politics takes many different forms , ranging from corporate campaign contributions to lucrative earmarks to pricey industry lobbyists. Arguably the most direct tie between political power and financial gain, though, is Congress members' ability to hold and trade stock in industries they directly legislate over.\n\nAccording to an explainer published by the Congressional Progressive Caucus in April 2022, 284 members of Congress, or 53 percent, own stock - meaning their personal finances are pegged to the success or failure of specific industries and companies. More recent and egregious examples of insider trading, such as members of Congress trading stocks based on early coronavirus briefings in 2020, have made congressional stock trading a hot-button issue. But the problem is not only that members of Congress are trading stocks with insider information. It's also that they have the power to shape policy over the industries they hold stock in. A recent New York Times report found that at least 97 members of Congress or their spouses or dependents have bought or sold stocks or other financial assets in the industries that those members legislate over in their congressional work.\n\nThe armed services committees are no exception. In fact, they've been acknowledged as having the most stock trades of all congressional committees. On the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC), multiple members hold significant stocks in the very defense corporations whose federal contracts they vote to increase each year. Examples include Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) owning $200,000 in defense companies Honeywell, Lockheed Martin, General Electric, Raytheon, and General Dynamics alone; Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV) owning up to $110,000 in General Electric stock; and Senator Gary Peters (D-MI) holding around $15,000 in Raytheon stock. Some SASC members trade even more responsively, such as Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK) buying and selling military technology stocks while SASC negotiated a $10 billion technology contract with the Pentagon.\n\nWhile Barack Obama's 2012 STOCK Act was intended to hamper members of Congress from trading and holding stocks with insider information, it has been minimally enforced and hasn't meaningfully changed the situation. According to Insider, as of this month, seventy-four members of Congress have violated the STOCK Act . Current penalties constitute no more than a slap on the wrist, with an average fine of $200.\n\nWhile current trading is going largely unchecked, congressional legislation is aiming to change that. Since the beginning of the year, multiple pieces of legislation have been introduced to implement a more actionable and robust stock-trading ban. The Ban Congressional Stock Trading Act was introduced in January by Democratic senator Jon Ossoff. In February, the less-rigorous Bipartisan Ban on Congressional Stock Ownership Act was introduced by Senator Elizabeth Warren. Also in February, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer formed a working group to develop consensus stock trading ban legislation. The hearing for the legislation was postponed until after the midterm elections, but will likely come up for a vote soon .\n\nThe monthslong back-and-forth process on this bill is deeply frustrating but hardly surprising. Why would stock-holding politicians push for a vote on an issue that's popular with their constituents but contrary to their vested interests, especially as they're campaigning for midterms? Despite legislative sluggishness, congressional stock trading is still garnering more public attention than in recent decades. Opponents of money in politics - and especially antiwar opponents of defense industry entanglement leading to surging military budgets - should counter Congress's hesitation with popular urgency.\n\nIf business as usual continues in Congress writ large, and in the Senate Armed Services Committee specifically, the NDAA will not stop at $853 billion. Recent research by the National Taxpayers Union has predicted that the annual military budget could exceed $1 trillion by 2027.\n\nCongress members' stocks aren't the only thing keeping them from voting for militarized solutions over diplomacy and peace, but they're certainly a major personal incentive. There's no doubt that they'll keep voting for higher and higher Pentagon budgets as long as they directly profit from weapons companies receiving increased federal spending.\n\nWhile a revamped stock-trading ban will not single-handedly slash the Pentagon budget, it will push members of Congress - especially those sitting on critical decision-making committees - to at least create legislation and spending packages without direct personal financial motivation (campaign donations and defense-industry networks are another matter). Money in politics is costing lives around the world, and an improved stock-trading ban is a step in the right direction to less biased and more humane policy.\n\nShea Leibow is CODEPINK's Divest from the War Machine national coordinator.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Butch Dill / Getty\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nDonald Trump and his party's leaders have been simultaneously pushing to shield higher education officials from COVID-related lawsuits while demanding that schools ignore health warnings and launch the college football season. In calling for a resumption of collegiate sports, Republican lawmakers have depicted themselves as defending the interests of players because, in their words, \"these young men need a season.\"\n\nNew research, however, suggests that it is not the unpaid players who most \"need\" a season. Instead, those with a real financial stake in reopening are the coaches and university officials who are together making huge sums of money off players who are barred from being paid and joining a union to collectively bargain for compensation. Those prohibitions continue, thanks to the same lawmakers now demanding the unpaid players risk their lives by returning to the football field to generate the revenues that finance coaches' multimillion-dollar pay packages.\n\nA new study from researchers at Northwestern University, University of Chicago, and University of Michigan found that if Congress permitted Division I college football and basketball players to form a union and collectively bargain for the same revenue share as professional athletes, on average, each college \"football player would receive $360,000 per year and each basketball player would earn nearly $500,000 per year.\"\n\nThat amount, the researchers note, \"is significantly higher than the current average value of full scholarships these athletes are currently receiving.\" Indeed, they find that less than 7 percent of football and basketball revenues go to pay scholarships and living expenses - far less than the revenue share professional athletes get. Of course, in most professional sports leagues, players are represented by unions that collectively bargain with owners.\n\nIf you think college athletes revenue-generating activities aren't \"work,\" read the findings of the 2014 National Labor Relations Board.\n\n\"Players spend 50 to 60 hours per week on their football duties during a one-month training camp prior to the start of the academic year and an additional 40 to 50 hours per week on those duties during the three or four month football season,\" the agency wrote. \"Not only is this more hours than many undisputed full-time employees work at their jobs, it is also many more hours than the players spend on their studies. In fact, the players do not attend academic classes while in training camp or the first few weeks of the regular season.\"\n\nSo what happens to the nearly $5 billion of revenue that unpaid college football and basketball players are generating every year? With Congress refusing to pass new laws protecting college athletes' rights as workers, an ever-larger share of that cash haul is being funneled into huge salaries for college coaches, university officials, and athletic facilities.\n\nThe Northwestern study notes that, as unpaid players have generated bigger and bigger revenues, \"coaching salaries have grown substantially along with athletic department budgets.\"\n\n\"Average salaries of Power 5 football coaching staffs at public schools grew from $4.8 to $9.8 million from 2008 to 2018,\" the researchers found. \"There have been corresponding increases in spending on non-coaching administrative salaries as well. From 2008 to 2018 these increased from $12.1 to $22.3 million.\"\n\nAlabama Republican Senate nominee Tommy Tuberville embodies one iconic example of public universities enriching coaches with revenues generated by unpaid players. Auburn University gave him a $5 million severance payout even though he quit his job. He then received a $2-million-a-year pay package from Texas Tech University, which raised his salary while slashing compensation for educators. He then went on to receive a $2.2 million salary from the University of Cincinnati, whose officials said, \"It's a market rate.\"\n\nRevenues from players' unpaid labor has also been used to increase spending on athletic facilities. The Washington Post reported that in 2014, forty-eight schools in the wealthiest sports conferences \"spent $772 million combined on athletic facilities, an 89-percent increase from $408 million spent in 2004.\"\n\nThe researchers also found that as the revenues generated by unpaid football and basketball players are distributed to other sports programs, \"the existing limits on player compensation effectively transfers resources away from students who are more likely to be black and more likely to come from poor neighborhoods towards students who are more likely to be white and come from higher-income neighborhoods.\"\n\nAs GOP lawmakers demand a resumption of college sports, players have asked for new legislation that would let them be paid for their work and the right to form a union . But bills have yet to move forward, as the NCAA and its allies have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on a lobbying campaign in Washington.\n\nWith legislation stalled, players have tried to take matters into their own hands. Last year, a Villanova University player filed a class action lawsuit arguing that in refusing to pay athletes, universities are violating minimum-wage laws.\n\nPrior to that, the National Labor Relations Board in 2015 overturned a ruling by one of its regional directors and refused to recognize Northwestern University players as employees entitled to the right to collectively bargain.\n\nMeanwhile, the US Supreme Court in 2016 refused to hear a case to resolve allegations that the NCAA is illegally refusing to compensate players for the lucrative commercial use of their names, images, and likenesses.\n\nYou can subscribe to David Sirota's newsletter \"Too Much Information\" here .\n\nDavid Sirota is editor-at-large at Jacobin .

It's an effective strategy used by city elites to artificially inflate conservative political power.\n\nA recent annexation vote in Mobile, Alabama, will shrink the white-black voter gap by thousands. (Win McNamee / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nLast week's annexation vote in Mobile, Alabama, was pitched as a race to be among the biggest cities in the Southern state. The Gulf Coast city added more than fifteen thousand residents , hoisting Mobile above Montgomery and Birmingham, and just below Huntsville.\n\n\"God answers prayers! We're the second-largest city in Alabama!\" proclaimed Mobile mayor Sandy Stimpson.\n\nWhat annexation supporters were more reluctant to talk about was the racial disparity. Only 27 percent of the city's new residents are black, shrinking the white-black voter gap by thousands in a majority-minority city with a history of institutional racism.\n\nThe annexation was less God's plan than a years-long effort to \"Make Mobile Great Again\" by the city's elite Republican power players. The campaigners were led by Stimpson, a wealthy lumber scion who once served as Jeff Sessions's finance chairman.\n\nSince the era of the civil rights movement, annexing white suburbs has been a tool for Southern and Sunbelt cities seeking to dilute the black vote.\n\nIn 1970, Richmond, Virginia, annexed twenty-three square miles and fifty thousand people, primarily white. That instantly changed Virginia's capital from a majority-black to a majority-white city. The Supreme Court later ruled that the annexation had been made for racial reasons and placed an injunction on Richmond's municipal elections for seven years.\n\nThe following year, Atlanta mayor Sam Massell tried and failed to do much the same thing in Georgia's capital city. The Justice Department blocked a Houston, Texas, annexation in 1979 that would have added one hundred forty thousand mostly white people to the city's population, diluting the voting power of blacks and Latinos. In North Carolina, Charlotte's boundaries have swollen to the physical size of New York City due to constant annexation over the last several decades.\n\nThe July 18 vote was actually plan B for Mobile's annexation plan.\n\nIn 2019, Stimpson tried to fast-track a \"Grow Mobile\" plan to annex land from unincorporated areas in suburban West Mobile County, where approximately 70 percent residents are white and where voters chose Stimpson over his two black opponents by a nine-to-one ratio.\n\nThe city council voted 4-3 along racial lines in favor of that first annexation plan. Still, a five-vote supermajority was required as part of the Zoghby Act, reconfiguring Mobile's government in 1985 following a civil lawsuit. The US Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division had previously found that Mobile's city commission form of government was discriminatory, with \"smoking gun\" evidence in the form of a 1909 letter written by a white state senator, which explicitly said the post-Reconstruction government was set up because \"we were trying to exclude not the ignorant vote, but the Negro vote.\" Little wonder that no black people had been elected in Mobile's city government from Reconstruction until after the Zoghby Act.\n\nAfter the initial defeat of the 2019 annexation plan, Mobile County sheriff Sam Cochran held a press conference announcing a petition effort to strip the supermajority rule from the city council. The council's three black members condemned the petition as a \"full-out assault on our citizens,\" and it eventually failed.\n\nAs Stimpson pressed for another annexation vote in 2021, Mobile politics turned darkly surreal.\n\nFirst, city council president Levon Manzie, who was black, died a few weeks before the municipal election in November 2021. Almost immediately after Manzie's passing, dark money from a conservative PAC chaired by a man with political ties to Tommy Tuberville, Jeff Sessions, and the Alabama Republican Party flowed into the dead councilman's campaign coffers.\n\nMeanwhile, Stimpson appointed Manzie's mother, Jeanette, to serve on the city council for a month in her deceased son's seat. Two black pastors in Mobile said they believed Jeanette was being used as a pawn to vote for annexation before the election. After Jeanette withdrew a day later, a mysterious campaign started to elect the recently deceased Manzie, with mailers claiming that people should vote for him to honor him.\n\nFormer Mobile mayor Sam Jones, the city's first black mayor, wasn't convinced. \"The attempt was apparently to buy who you wanted into that seat to influence [policy],\" Jones said at the time. But the wild scheme to elect a dead man in order to handpick a candidate favorable to annexation failed after William Carroll, another black candidate, won by just four hundred votes.\n\nCarroll's win and the threats of lawsuits put Stimpson's annexation plan on ice. Shortly after the election, the Southern Poverty Law Center sent the City of Mobile a letter warning they'd sue the city if they found evidence of a \"racial gerrymandering technique\" of \"packing\" and \"cracking\" in the city's redistricting plan, or an annexation plan that \"would serve to dilute the political power of communities of color.\"\n\nMobile's black voters won a victory in August of 2022 when the council voted for a redistricting plan that included majority black council representation for the first time in city history. But thanks to Stimpson, annexation continued to hang over the city like the sword of Damocles.\n\nStimpson's latest annexation plan was finally successful in last Tuesday's special election, with three of four areas voting to enter the City of Mobile.

Joe Biden has a clear roadmap, the legal authority, and the duty to right this wrong by taking executive action.\n\nUS corporations have exploited the H-1B visa program to replace IT and other high-skilled workers with indentured and underpaid foreign ones. (Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nEvery April 1, the government decides, via lottery of all methods, which employers will get new visas for the H-1B, a temporary work program that has inflicted serious harm on millions of workers over the past three decades.\n\nThe stories of two American IT workers, Hank Nguyen and Judy Konopka , are typical and instructive. Their employers, the University of California and Eversource Energy, respectively, exploited the visa program to replace them with indentured and underpaid H-1B workers, and then added insult to injury by forcing them to train their replacements before terminating them. On the flip side of the work program, software engineer Gobi Muthuperiasamy , a college-educated H-1B worker from India, was sued by his employer to prevent him from switching jobs as he searched for better pay and working conditions.\n\nThe exploitation of both H-1B and US workers is well known. Yet the government continues to hand out H-1B visas as if the program worked flawlessly.\n\nAs we and others have documented, weak labor safeguards are at the heart of the program's failures. President Joe Biden has a clear roadmap, the legal authority, and the duty to right this wrong by taking executive action to modernize those labor safeguards. This is his opportunity to stand with workers and build solidarity between immigrants and Americans. Biden must stand up to the companies that earn billions in profits not through their productive activity but by stealing from workers like Hank, Judy, and Gobi, and from hundreds of thousands of others each year.\n\nThe H-1B program provides work authorization for migrant workers in occupations that typically require a four-year college education, like accounting, teaching, and software development. It is the largest US temporary work visa program - also known as a guest-worker program - with nearly 600,000 workers currently in the United States. Approximately 140,000 new guest workers will receive visas for fiscal year 2023, with another 300,000 receiving renewals.\n\nBut due to a lack of interest from successive presidential administrations in enforcing basic labor protections, the H-1B program is leading to disastrous outcomes for H-1B and American workers alike.\n\nGuest-worker programs operate outside of standard employment laws, allowing firms to employ a workforce that has few of the protections afforded to citizens and permanent residents. By their nature, all guest-worker programs, and guest workers themselves, are vulnerable to abuse - whether they are in the United S tates or United Arab Emirates , or for high - or low -wage occupations. To minimize abuse, every guest-worker program needs strong labor safeguards.\n\nThe labor safeguards for America's largest guest-worker program are clearly deficient, and the safeguards that do exist are not enforced. As a result, the thirty-two-year-old H-1B program has drifted far from its purpose of filling US labor shortages with foreign workers who possess rare skills. The often disturbing outcomes have been exposed by the media (including 60 Minutes , Reveal , the New York Times , and the Los Angeles Times ), during many congressional hearings, and even in presidential campaign debates .\n\nThe H-1B program's failures are almost too many to list. Most H-1B workers are vastly underpaid , earning less than the market average for their occupation and location. Government inaction allows large-scale wage theft of H-1B workers. While some H-1B workers do possess rare skills that benefit the US economy, most who are admitted possess ordinary skills - skills that are abundantly available in the US - and end up filling entry-level jobs. H-1B workers are placed in working arrangements akin to indentured servitude . Program rules subsidize the outsourcing and offshoring of US jobs and fissure the workforce, and even incentivize firms to directly replace their US workers with H-1B workers , who can be legally underpaid.\n\nSimply put, weak labor safeguards make it extraordinarily profitable for an employer to hire an H-1B worker instead of a US worker, not because the H-1B worker possesses skills that are hard to find in the US but because they reduce payroll costs and are virtually indentured to their employer.\n\nThe half-hearted labor safeguards are especially mismatched to today's US employment model. Employer loyalty towards workers has been slowly but surely eroded by the financialization of corporations , whose executives are increasingly pressured to maximize shareholder value. In response to these pressures, firms have moved aggressively to lower labor costs, with little concern about serious blowback from a public and government that have become inured to such behavior. Highly profitable firms have reduced job security, shifted risk from employers to workers , cut pensions , hired contract workers rather than full-time employees, offshored both blue - and white -collar work, busted unions, and even forced workers to train their replacements. In sum, employment norms have radically transformed without much change in employment law. Much corporate behavior that is taken for granted today would have been unfathomable when the H-1B program's core safeguards were formulated in 1990.\n\nInstead of responding to the new employment norms by bolstering labor safeguards in H-1B, successive administrations enervated them. The rules setting minimum wage levels for H-1B workers are set absurdly low - so low that the Department of Labor estimated that keeping the rules in place leads to a transfer of $10 to $15 billion per year from H-1B workers to employers. Meanwhile, enforcement has been effectively nonexistent, and bizarre legal interpretations have made key safeguards disappear if an employer hires its H-1B worker through a staffing firm.\n\nThere's no question: the program is broken, and vast numbers of workers will continue to suffer the consequences every year until it is fixed.\n\nFor more than fifteen years, proposals to strengthen labor safeguards have been made by senior members of Congress on both sides of the aisle to no avail.\n\nThe most recent version of the legislation, the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act, was reintroduced in March, and is authored and cosponsored by some of the most progressive and conservative legislators in the Senate. On the Democratic side, these include Senators Richard Durbin (IL), Bernie Sanders (VT), Richard Blumenthal (CT), and Sherrod Brown (OH), along with Republicans Chuck Grassley (IA), Bill Hagerty (TN) and Tommy Tuberville (AL).\n\nHowever, passing any law through Congress that is vigorously opposed by a well-financed business community - particularly the tech giants that benefit the most from H-1B - has become nearly impossible, especially when tens of billions are at stake and celebrity CEOs publicly advocate for the program to be expanded.\n\nWhile legislative reform through a dysfunctional Congress is unlikely, fortunately it's not the only path to fixing the H-1B program. As a presidential candidate, Biden promised he would reform work visa programs, and as president, he has authority to fundamentally fix H-1B by modernizing and enforcing labor safeguards.\n\nThe Biden administration can follow a clear path: close the loophole that incentivizes outsourcing; raise wage rates for H-1B workers so they match US standards; ensure US workers have a legitimate opportunity to apply for jobs open to H-1B workers; investigate rampant wage theft; and allocate H-1B visas by prioritizing the most highly skilled workers rather than through a random lottery.\n\nFurther, the Departments of Justice, Labor, and Homeland Security should join whistleblowers as plaintiffs in the H-1B abuse lawsuits filed under the False Claims Act. Congress can help by urging the administration to act, and recently did so: on March 17, the Congressional Progressive Caucus included reforming H-1B in its list of proposed executive actions it is urging the Biden administration to issue and implement.\n\nThe vested interests profiteering by exploiting the current H-1B program - tech companies, staffing firms, and even universities - will sue the government to overturn any new rules. But they're worth fighting for. Because if the government cannot represent the American workers and the relatively powerless guest workers who work alongside them against powerful employers, then what use is government at all?\n\nRon Hira is an associate professor of political science at Howard University.

But as The Washington Post reported , some lawmakers took the opportunity to \"lobby\" the Republican megadonor on \"pet ideas.\"\n\nSen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Alabama), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he had encouraged Musk to reduce the number of generals and other high-ranking military officers and to use the savings to increase the pay of rank-and-file soldiers. \"I don't want to get in their way,\" he said. \"They know what they're doing a hell of a lot more than I do.\"\n\nAs it happens, there's a lot to unpack in that short and simple quote.\n\nRight off the bat, the Alabama senator's idea is difficult to take seriously. If Congress wants to give U.S. troops another pay raise, lawmakers are free to do exactly that. They don't need to shrink the number of military leaders as a cost-saving exercise.\n\nWhat's more, the idea that Tuberville is concerned about getting \"in the way\" of Musk and his DOGE surrogates is discouraging, since it's pretty much the opposite of how oversight and checks and balances are supposed to work. Not to put too fine a point on this, but the coach-turned-politician is an elected member of Senate, while Musk is an unelected campaign donor who's been given enormous White House influence.\n\nTuberville may not want to get \"in the way\" of Musk and his team, but getting \"in the way\" is, for all intents and purposes, part of the senator's job.\n\nAs for the Republican senator's claim that Musk and his surrogates \"know what they're doing a hell of a lot more\" than he does, that was hardly reassuring. Tuberville is, among other things , a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. If he's going to pitch a quasi-governmental \"department\" and its billionaire overseer about reducing the number of U.S. military generals, it's far from ideal that he assumes that the presidential adviser with little background in national security policy knows \"a hell of a lot more\" than he does.\n\nAs for the Alabaman's assumptions of DOGE competence, let's also not overlook the vast evidence to the contrary .\n\nBut stepping back, it's also worth appreciating the fact that Tuberville and other members of Congress have reached the point at which they're pushing Musk to take their ideas seriously.\n\nFor the last couple of centuries, campaign donors lobbied powerful members of Congress. In 2025, powerful members of Congress apparently feel compelled to lobby a campaign donor.\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

Tommy Tuberville would steer clear of controversies related to the U.S. military. Evidently, however, the Alabama Republican can't seem to help himself.\n\nLast year, the coach-turned-politician launched an unprecedented 10-month blockade on armed services confirmations, which undermined his own country's military during international crises. In the end, the right-wing senator had nothing to show for it but a ruined reputation .\n\nThis is the same Tuberville who has reportedly failed to follow through on his commitments to veterans' charities, failed to tell the whole truth about his father's military service, lied about the U.S. military not being \"an equal opportunity employer,\" used veterans to push a debunked anti-immigrant conspiracy theory and claimed earlier this year , \"We've kinda gone downhill with our military.\"\n\nIt is against this backdrop that the Alabaman came up with yet another idea related to the military: Tuberville decided it'd be smart to block the promotion of Lt. Gen. Ronald P. Clark, who was nominated to become the four-star commander of all U.S. Army forces in the Pacific.\n\nAs the GOP senator saw it, Clark was a senior aide to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin when the Pentagon chief underwent surgery to treat prostate cancer last year, which Austin failed to disclose. (He ultimately apologized for the secrecy.)\n\nThankfully for the military, Tuberville backed down shortly before lawmakers wrapped up their pre-election work. Politico reported :\n\nSen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) has dropped his objection to President Joe Biden's nominee to lead Army forces in the Pacific, ending a weekslong standoff over the officer's role in Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's hospitalization. The Senate on Tuesday quietly confirmed Lt. Gen. Ronald Clark's promotion to four-star general. The vote, which Tuberville had been blocking in recent weeks, occurred just hours after the Alabama Republican met with Clark to clear the air.\n\nThe senator initially wanted to delay the general's promotion until he saw an inspector general's report on Austin's hospitalization, but those findings aren't complete, and U.S. forces in the Pacific couldn't wait.\n\nSo Clark and Tuberville had a private meeting, at which point the senator concluded Austin's misplaced secrecy \" wasn't his problem .\"\n\nThat's probably the sort of detail the Republican might've realized before blocking the general's promotion, but at least Tuberville allowed Clark to be confirmed.\n\nThe list of Tuberville's military-related missteps, however, continues to grow.\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

Tommy Tuberville, a former college football coach himself, wants to shake up college sports, but his recent complaints about recruitment and so-called name, image and likeness (NIL) rules are drawing flags.\n\nDuring a discussion with the Monday Morning Quarterback Club, a football-adjacent nonprofit, Tuberville condemned the current state of NIL rules, as reported on AL.com . \"I don't think you should be able to recruit with money,\" he said. \"I think you recruit with your school and your salesmanship, but then you get there and then you give them the opportunity to make money.\" He bemoaned schools \"buying a new player, new football team every year\" and used the University of Indiana's football team, which has relied on dozens of transferred athletes to carry it to a 10-0 record , as an example of a team he claims was \"bought.\"\n\nOver the past couple years, I've covered the attempts - mostly, by college administrators and conservative members of C ongress - to rein in NIL rules that allow college athletes to make money through advertising. Many people agree the current arrangement could use more structure. But the legislative proposals introduced so far, including a bill Tuberville co-sponsored last year, have been criticized for favoring college administrators while potentially disadvantaging college athletes , who can collectively generate millions of dollars for their schools .\n\nAthletes and activists have worked for years to secure \"freedom of movement\" to allow players to leave schools at will - and Tuberville seems pretty peeved about it. \"I'm not against players making money, but we got to have some kind of penalty for players breaking contracts,\" he said. And there was more where that came from, per Al.com:\n\n'There's going to have to be some exceptions,' Tuberville said. 'But my thoughts are, you know, you sign a contract on NIL, I mean you can't just up and break it. I mean you gotta ... you wanna sign a year, two-year, three-year, you got a three-year contract. If you break it, there's gotta be some kind of penalty. We'll have to go through all the rules and regulations when it comes to the commerce committee on this.'\"\n\nAs AL.com noted, Tuberville isn't the ideal source for gripes about breaking commitments:\n\nTuberville did that twice - once when leaving Mississippi for Auburn in 1999 after promising he'd never leave and again in 2012 when bolting for Cincinnati while coaching at Texas Tech.\n\nFunny how conservatives pick and choose when they want to support free-market capitalism. Online, Tuberville's complaints were met with responses like the one below, noting his hypocrisy:\n\nIf Republicans plan to put together a federal bill regulating NIL, they might want to find someone a bit less conflicted on the matter than Sen.

Tommy Tuberville appeared on Fox Business yesterday morning and continued to express great confidence in Donald Trump 's presidential campaign. But part of the Alabama Republican's pitch could use some work:\n\n\"You know, the unemployment rates of all people in the country were very, very low under Donald Trump, but not under this president. Everybody is looking for a way to get a job.\"\n\nHe didn't appear to be kidding.\n\nLook, no administration is perfect, and there are plenty of legitimate criticisms for President Joe Biden's detractors to present to the public.\n\nBut as anyone with a passing familiarity with current events really ought to know, this isn't one of them. Indeed, it's not a matter of opinion; it's a matter of reality.\n\nAs regular readers know , over the course of the first three years of Trump's presidency - when the Republican said the United States' economy was the greatest in the history of the planet - the economy created nearly 6.4 million jobs, spanning all of 2017, 2018, and 2019.\n\nAccording to the latest tally , the U.S. economy has created nearly 16 million jobs since January 2021 - more than double the combined total of Trump's first three years.\n\nAs for the unemployment rate, which the coach-turned-politician specifically referenced on the air, the Trump-era numbers were good, but the Biden-era numbers are definitely better.\n\nIn 2017, the average unemployment rate for the year was 4.4%. A year later, the average improved to 3.9%. In 2019, it improved a little more, with an average jobless rate for the year of 3.7%.\n\nIn 2020, of course, the Covid pandemic led to a recession; the unemployment rate spiked to nearly 15%; and the average for the year climbed to 8.1%.\n\nIn Biden's first year in the White House, the unemployment rate rapidly improved, falling from 6.4% in January to 3.9% in December. In 2022, the average for the year improved to 3.6%. A year later, it remained at 3.6%.\n\nIn fact, in April 2023, the jobless rate fell all the way to 3.4% - a level unseen in the United States since before the Moon landing. What's more, the unemployment rate has now been below 4% for 27 consecutive months - a streak also unseen since the 1960s.\n\nIf Tuberville wants to have a debate about how and why we're seeing these numbers, that's fine. If he wants to discuss who deserves credit for encouraging economic data, we can do that, too.\n\nBut to argue - out loud and on national television - that the unemployment rate isn't low under Biden, and that it was actually better under Trump, is demonstrably ridiculous.\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) argued Wednesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin-who ordered the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 while declaring that the country has no claim to independence and that its people are \"connected with us by blood\"-doesn't actually want Ukraine because he already has \"enough land.\"\n\nThe Alabama Republican sat down with Steve Bannon and explained his belief that Putin doesn't really want to wage war in Ukraine.\n\nAfter downplaying Russian attacks in Ukraine from recent months, Tuberville said , in reference to Putin, \"He doesn't want Ukraine. He doesn't want Europe. Hell, he's got enough land of his own. He just wants to make sure that he does not have United States weapons in Ukraine pointing at Moscow.\"\n\nIn the same interview, the right-wing senator questioned why the U.S. is backing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom Tuberville described as \"a dictator.\"\n\nAll of this echoes the script the Kremlin wants politicians, especially those in the West, to follow.\n\nMaking matters worse, of course, is the larger pattern involving the coach-turned-hapless politician. Two years ago, the Alabaman insisted that Putin launched an invasion of Ukraine in order to acquire \"more farmland\" because \"he can't feed his people.\" The idea that Russia was incapable of feeding its population was plainly wrong . The GOP senator either didn't know or didn't care - and his new position is that Putin already has \"enough land.\"\n\nIn the months that followed, Tuberville repeatedly said Ukraine couldn't prevail in a conflict against Russia - another line favored by the Kremlin - so it made sense for the U.S. simply to let Moscow prevail.\n\nEarlier this year, after Putin told Tucker Carlson he's interested in \"peace,\" Tuberville suggested that Russia's authoritarian leader deserved the benefit of the doubt . He argued soon after that it was the U.S. that \"forced\" Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAround the same time, the Alabaman appeared on a radio show and said , \"You can tell Putin's on top of his game.\" After complaining again that the U.S. was responsible for pushing Russia into a military offensive, Tuberville added , \"I can understand what he's talking about,\" referring to Putin.\n\nAs recently as April, Tuberville also appeared on Newsmax and accused Ukrainian officials of buying luxury goods with American taxpayers' money, which also happens to be pro-Russia disinformation .\n\nIt's against this backdrop that GOP senator claimed this week that Putin \"doesn't want Ukraine\" - all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding - and Zelenskyy is \"a dictator\" undeserving of U.S. backing.\n\nAll of which leaves me with a lingering question: Why, exactly, is Tommy Tuberville still on the Senate Armed Services Committee?\n\nBetween his 2023 blockade that undermined his own country's military, Tuberville's ongoing disparagement of the American armed forces and his apparent willingness to say exactly what the Kremlin wants to hear, it's hardly outlandish to think senators should have a conversation about whether it's time to revisit his committee assignments.\n\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage .\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

Tommy Tuberville , R-Ala., is not exactly a paragon of senatorial excellence. His main contribution since taking office in 2021 has been to be a team player for the MAGA wing of the caucus, give the most confounding sound bites possible, and annoy his colleagues with his stunts. And yet it was still a surprise to see a post from him on X where he calls President Joe Biden a \"garbage human being.\"\n\nIt's a sentiment that would have been a scandal in its own right not too long ago. But Tuberville is unlikely to face any sort of consequences for it. Instead, it reflects how the Senate, which has long prided itself on its gentility in comparison to the \"vulgar demeanor\" of the House, has become a much crasser place.\n\nThe Senate has rules that cover a lot of things , but in this case, Tuberville seems to be in the clear. For one, the body's rules only apply to debate in the Senate chamber. During those debates, senators cannot \"directly or indirectly, by any form of words impute to another Senator or to other Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator.\" It also bars them from offensively referring to other states.\n\nNow, if Tuberville went to the floor and said, for example, that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is a \"garbage human being,\" the chair would gavel him down. Likewise, if he said during debate that neighboring Georgia is a \"garbage state,\" he'd be called out for it. But even though Biden is a former senator, there don't seem to be rules against speaking ill about the president during speeches. And as a fellow public figure, the bar would be pretty high for Biden to take legal action for defamation or anything of the sort based on Tuberville's post.\n\nThere are also Senate rules on the use of official social media accounts . The Senate Ethics Committee has further made clear that there can't be \"any linkage from a Member's official website or social media to any campaign website or social media.\" But Tuberville was using his personal X account to attack Biden, and it doesn't appear that his official account interacted with the post at all.\n\nIt feels limiting though to say that the rules governing how a senator comports themself are limited to their time on the Senate floor. This made more sense in a time when senators relied primarily on open debate to make their views known. Interviews with the press tend to prompt politicians to smooth out their rougher edges, for better or worse, to appear more respectable to their intended audience.\n\nAs we can see from Tuberville's account, that's not the case in an age when the GOP base is expecting even 69-year-old senators to sound like keyboard warriors. I'll admit that it took me a second to really register how bizarre a thing it is for him to post, as it's the kind of internet-fueled hyperbole that has become the norm. It's entirely possible the communications staffer running his account didn't think twice before firing off an incendiary statement about the president.\n\nAs we can see from Tuberville's account, that's not the case in an age when the GOP base is expecting even 69-year-old senators to sound like keyboard warriors.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't think there's any kind of official fix that could be applied here. The Senate could theoretically alter its rules to cover personal social media accounts as well. I'm not sure though if the Senate's constitutional mandate to write its own rules and \"punish its members for disorderly behavior\" would clash with the First Amendment speech of its members here. I somehow doubt there'd be much enthusiasm among senators to find out.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., or one of his fellow members on leadership could also step up to take Tuberville to task. But McConnell is preparing to step down as leader in November, leaving him a limited amount of political capital to expend on something like this. The race to replace him is likely to be close, leaving the main candidates likely unwilling to alienate a potential vote over a statement that many of their own constituents would support.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems this is just the world we live in now. The norms and gravitas that the Senate has cloaked itself in are a poor bulwark against the lowered standards that former President Donald Trump has set. It has become an expectation among many Republican voters for their elected officials to cast political opponents in the harshest terms possible. Tuberville, whose track record on leadership as a senator is lacking, isn't the first person to call Biden a \"garbage human being.\" It's not even fair to say that he's being a bad role model for his constituents. He's just giving them exactly what they want, no matter how poisonous it is for the country's political health.\n\nHayes Brown is a writer and editor for MSNBC Daily, where he helps frame the news of the day for readers.

Tommy Tuberville has struggled on a great many fronts. The Alabama Republican is perhaps best known for launching an unprecedented, 10-month blockade , preventing confirmation of U.S. military leaders, all the while failing to understand the implications of his own tactics, but that's really just the start of a larger conversation.\n\nAs we recently discussed , Tuberville is also known for his election denialism , his provocative rhetoric about race , his disparagements of the U.S. military, his difficulties with basic details related to civics and modern American history, and his willingness to give Russia's Vladimir Putin the benefit of the doubt .\n\nAlas, the list keeps growing. NBC News reported on the coach-turned-politician struggling to share his thoughts on his state's Supreme Court ruling that embryos must be seen as people.\n\n\"Yeah, I was all for it,\" Tuberville told reporters at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday when asked about the Alabama Supreme Court's Friday ruling that embryos created through in vitro fertilization are considered children under state law. \"We need to have more kids. We need to have an opportunity to do that, and I thought this was the right thing to do,\" Tuberville said.\n\nWhen NBC News pressed further, asking about the implications of the ruling, most notably for families trying to have children through IVF, Tuberville said several words, though they weren't altogether clarifying.\n\n\"Well, that's, that's for another conversation. I think the big thing is right now, you protect - you go back to the situation and try to work it out to where it's best for everybody. I mean, that's what - that's what the whole abortion issue is about,\" the GOP senator added.\n\nTuberville acknowledged that he hadn't read the ruling, and as NBC News' report added, the Alabaman \"appeared to struggle to explain how the decision, which threatens to limit access to IVF treatment, would help more people have children.\"\n\nSo, that interview could've gone better for the Republican. Perhaps he'd better explain his position in a different interview? HuffPost gave it a try .\n\nSen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) said Thursday that he is \"all for\" the Alabama Supreme Court's decision that frozen embryos are children. He also said he opposes the effects of the ruling. And that he supports fertility treatments like IVF that are now being denied to women across his state as a result of the court's ruling. And that he wants to read the legislation more closely before saying more - except there is no legislation.\n\nSemafor also talked to the senator and asked about the real-world effects the state Supreme Court's decision was having on women who had begun to go IVF treatment in Alabama. \"I don't know enough about how that works,\" Tuberville said after endorsing the court's ruling.\n\nJust so we're all clear, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled seven days ago that frozen embryos are actual people . As a consequence, the University of Alabama at Birmingham suspended its IVF treatments on Wednesday, and two more medical facilities followed suit a day later.\n\nFor Tuberville, this isn't an obscure dispute unfolding in a state thousands of miles from his home. At issue is an important ruling in his home state, affecting many of his own constituents, which the senator doesn't seem to understand in a meaningful way.\n\nTuberville hadn't exactly earned a reputation for competence before this week. His standing is nevertheless a bit worse now.\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

Tommy Tuberville has made quite a name for himself. The Alabama Republican is perhaps best known for launching an unprecedented, 10-month blockade , preventing confirmation of U.S. military leaders, but that's not the right-wing senator's only notable contribution.\n\nTuberville has also made headlines for embracing Donald Trump's \"Big Lie,\" for example, and voting against certification of the 2020 election results. He's also disputed the racism of white nationalists and presented an unsubtle argument that \"inner city\" school teachers are lazy and possibly illiterate . He's also struggled with basic details related to civics and modern American history.\n\nBut let's also not forget that Tuberville has shared a variety of curious thoughts about foreign policy in general and Russia's attack on Ukraine in particular. Two years ago this month, the Alabaman insisted that Vladimir Putin launched an invasion in order to acquire \"more farmland,\" because \"he can't feed his people.\" The idea that Russia was incapable of feeding its population was plainly wrong , though the GOP senator apparently didn't know that. (In the same public appearance, Tuberville complained that China's economy has surpassed the United States', which also wasn't even close to being true .)\n\nTwo years later, Tuberville is taking a firm stand against U.S. security aid to our Ukrainian allies, and he turned to social media last week to explain why:\n\n\"Last night's [Tucker Carlson's] interview with Putin shows that Russia is open to a peace agreement, while it is DC warmongers who want to prolong the war. That is why I'm voting to stop 60 BILLION MORE of our tax dollars to this conflict.\"\n\nRight off the bat, it's worth pausing to appreciate the apparent fact that Tuberville considers Russia's authoritarian leader a credible source. Putin said he's open to peace, and Tuberville, relying on his vast expertise, is inclined to take the dictator's rhetoric at face value and give him the benefit of the doubt.\n\nAs truly ridiculous as this was, however, let's not brush past the fact that, according to the senior senator from Alabama, \"it is DC warmongers,\" and not the Kremlin, \"who want to prolong the war.\" In other words, Tuberville could hold Putin responsible for Putin's invasion of Ukraine, but instead, the Republican is inclined to blame officials in his own country .\n\nAll of which leaves me with a lingering question: Why, exactly, is Tommy Tuberville still on the Senate Armed Services Committee?\n\nBetween his 2023 blockade, his ongoing disparagement of the U.S. military, and his willingness to shift responsibility for the war in Ukraine from Moscow to D.C., it's hardly outlandish to think senators should have a conversation about whether it's time to revisit his committee assignments.\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

Tommy Tuberville should simply stop talking about the United States military. After all, the Alabama Republican was responsible for an unprecedented 10-month blockade on armed services confirmations, which undermined his own country's military during international crises.\n\nThe same far-right senator has also reportedly failed to follow through on his commitments to veterans' charities, failed to tell the whole truth about his father's military service, and even lied about the U.S. military not being \"an equal opportunity employer.\"\n\nBut while it's tempting to think the Alabaman would realize he should probably focus his energies elsewhere, Tuberville apparently can't help himself.\n\nLast week, for example, my MSNBC colleague Ja'han Jones noted that the Republican senator used veterans to push a debunked anti-immigrant conspiracy theory. The Department of Veterans Affairs found it necessary to issue a statement setting the record straight after Tuberville helped promote the misinformation.\n\nThis week, the coach-turned-politician appeared on Fox Business and thought it'd be a good idea to complain about what he perceives as the U.S. military's \"weakness.\"\n\n\"You've got people that I don't trust running the show. We've got less experience. Our military is the weakest it's been in many, many years. Since 1991, you know, we've kinda gone downhill with our military.\"\n\nTo be sure, it's a free country. Senators are not required to support or respect the armed forces. If Tuberville wants to disparage the U.S. military, that's between him, his conscience, and his constituents.\n\nBut there are a few things worth keeping in mind.\n\nFirst, there's a degree of irony in seeing Tuberville take steps to weaken the military and then whine about how weak he thinks the military is.\n\nSecond, the idea that the armed forces have \"gone downhill\" over the last 33 years isn't supported by any evidence, and the GOP senator made no effort to substantiate his baseless rhetoric.\n\nAnd finally, I can't help but remember a recent Senate Armed Services Committee hearing in which Tuberville boasted that \"there's nobody more military up here than me.\" The Alabama Republican - who has literally never spent a day serving in the armed forces - was referring to a panel filled with actual military veterans from both parties, many of whom received honors for their service, some of whom served in combat, and some of whom suffered serious injuries while in uniform.\n\nTuberville's \"more military\" boasts were offensive at the time , but they appear even worse in hindsight.\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

Other officials in senior positions were left to operate on an \"acting\" basis, unable to hire people to staff their new positions or to move into the quarters that come with the job.\n\n\"In the end, this was all pointless,\" President Biden said in a statement. \"Senator Tuberville, and the Republicans who stood with him, needlessly hurt hundreds of service members and military families and threatened our national security - all to push a partisan agenda.

Senate ethics rules bar the use of official resources for campaign purposes.\n\nAnd in another exchange, he erroneously said that Mr. Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee in 2000, was president-elect for 30 days during an intense, protracted recount and legal battle. Neither Mr. Gore nor George W. Bush was considered the president-elect during that process.\n\nThe interview amounted to the most in-depth remarks Mr. Tuberville had given since he was elected last week. He cut a low profile on the campaign trail, rarely making himself available to reporters other than those at conservative outlets, but had positioned himself as a staunch supporter of President Trump.\n\nCatie Edmondson is a reporter in the Washington bureau, covering Congress.\n\nAdvertisement"

It did not go well.\n\nA little more than a decade ago, after departing from Auburn University where he was head coach, Mr. Tuberville entered into a 50-50 partnership with a former Lehman Brothers broker named John David Stroud. Their ventures, which included TS Capital Management and TS Capital Partners - T for Tuberville and S for Stroud - turned out to be a financial fraud. Mr. Stroud was sentenced to 10 years in prison, and Mr. Tuberville was sued by investors, who accused him of fraud and violating his fiduciary duty to take care of their investments; he reached a private settlement in 2013.\n\nThe episode has been seldom discussed in Mr. Tuberville's Republican primary campaign for the Senate, in which his opponent in the July 14 runoff is Jeff Sessions , the former senator and attorney general who became an object of Mr. Trump's ire after recusing himself from the Russia inquiry. The winner will face Doug Jones, considered perhaps the most vulnerable Democrat in the battle for control of the Senate.\n\nAsked about the hedge fund venture on the campaign trail in February , Mr. Tuberville described himself as \"an investor like the rest of them,\" much as he had in media reports at the time of the accusations.\n\n\"They sued me because I invested in it, and he used my name to get other people to put money in,\" he said. \"There was nothing ever implicated by anybody that I'd done anything wrong. I felt bad that he used my name.\"\n\nBut a review of public court records shows that he had a broader role. While he was not picking stocks, or even a frequent presence in the office, Mr. Tuberville made introductions to potential investors, had business cards identifying himself as managing partner, and leased a BMW and got his health insurance through the company. Its offices in Auburn were filled with his coaching memorabilia. In 2010, he traveled to New York with Mr. Stroud to meet potential brokers for the fund, and was kept in the loop on decisions about hiring, according to email traffic.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

That allowed the officers' swift confirmation by unanimous consent - and enabled senators to wrap up a major piece of business standing between them and a holiday break.\n\n\"These 11 flag officers have now been approved, joining the rest of their colleagues,\" Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, said on the Senate floor. \"That's good news.\"\n\nLater Tuesday night, the Senate also voted by voice to pass a bill extending the authorization of the Federal Aviation Administration through early March, buying Congress time to continue working on a five-year extension to improve air travel and safety while updating airport infrastructure.\n\nMr. Tuberville had been holding up the promotions of senior military officials to protest a Pentagon policy ensuring that service members needing to go long distances to obtain an abortion or other reproductive health care services would receive time off and have their travel expenses covered. The Defense Department adopted the policy after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, creating a patchwork of abortion laws throughout the country.\n\nMr. Tuberville had long insisted that the Pentagon would have to reverse the policy for him to relent. But under pressure from other Republicans, he agreed this month to allow the bulk of the promotions to proceed , and the Senate promptly confirmed over 440 service members to senior positions as a bloc. Under that arrangement, Mr. Tuberville had continued to object to the promotions of the 11 most senior generals and admirals pending before the Senate.\n\nThe list of four-star officers confirmed on Tuesday included the heads of major combatant commands. Among them were Lt. Gen. Gregory M. Guillot of the Air Force, who will lead U.S. Northern Command; Lt. Gen. Timothy D. Haugh of the Air Force, who will take over U.S. Cyber Command; and Lt. Gen. Stephen N. Whiting of Space Force, who will be the head of U.S. Space Command.\n\nThe Senate also confirmed officers to serve as vice chiefs of staff for the Army, Navy, Air Force and Space Operations. The Senate had voted this year to confirm the top uniformed officers in the Army, Navy, Marines and Air Force as well as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, all of whose promotions had been subject to Mr. Tuberville's hold.\n\n\"It's a really strong group,\" Senator Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, said in an interview before the vote. Mr. Sullivan was one of the leading Republicans pressuring Mr. Tuberville to drop his objections in recent weeks.\n\nKaroun Demirjian covers Congress with a focus on defense, foreign policy, intelligence, immigration, and trade and technology.\n\nAdvertisement"

Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, steps down on Oct. 1. And a space for a photo that would make history, of a woman on that wall for the first time, will be empty, too.\n\nFor more than six months, Senator Tommy Tuberville, Republican of Alabama, has held up military nominations in protest of a Pentagon policy created to ensure that service members have access to abortions and other reproductive medical care. Hundreds of promotions have now been delayed in a battle that has it all.\n\nIt is a showdown between a white former football coach and the country's first Black defense secretary, two Alabama men, both with deep roots at Auburn University. It is a preview of just how much of an albatross the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade might be on Republicans in elections next year. And it is a political game of chicken in which the country's national security is at stake.\n\nCaught in the middle is the Pentagon and the people picked by the military and the White House to fill top positions: the Army and Air Force chiefs of staff; the chief of naval operations and the Marine Corps commandant; the head of the Missile Defense Agency; the under secretary of defense - the Pentagon's top policy post - who helps manage the American response to a surging Chinese military and the war in Ukraine and everything in between.\n\nAnd many more.\n\nThe problem will be on sharp display in coming weeks when General Milley retires. In May, President Biden nominated Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr. of the Air Force to become the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. But the vice chairman, Adm.

But his financial record raises questions.\n\nBy Danny Hakim\n\nTommy Tuberville , the Republican candidate for Senate in Alabama, is running in large measure on his experience in college football's Southeastern Conference, known as the S.E.C., where he coached Auburn University.\n\nBut he has had experience with another S.E.C., the Securities and Exchange Commission, and other financial regulators.\n\nA review by The New York Times found that Mr. Tuberville, who is leading Senator Doug Jones in the polls, has a history of involvement with at least three people who were later convicted of financial fraud in what were described as Ponzi schemes. Mr. Tuberville was largely seen as a victim and was never charged with a crime.\n\nIn two episodes, Mr. Tuberville lost millions of dollars. A third was more minor, when Mr. Tuberville and his wife, Suzanne, bought a home through a company created by a lawyer who was later convicted of running a real estate-related Ponzi scheme.\n\nThe Times review included a small charitable foundation created by Mr. Tuberville, finding that its tax records indicated that less than a third of its proceeds went to the veterans' causes it was set up to advance. The foundation also had bookkeeping issues.\n\nThe review raised questions about Mr. Tuberville's judgment and financial acumen. While he has said on the campaign trail that he hoped to serve on the \"banking finance\" committee - the Senate has separate, and prestigious, banking and finance committees - he has at times undercut his own qualifications. In regards to an ill-fated hedge fund venture, he once told a reporter, \"I'm not smart enough to understand all the numbers.\"\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

More than half of the current Joint Chiefs are expected to step down from their posts during the next few months without a Senate-approved successor in place, leaving the president's chief military advisory body in an unprecedented state of flux at a time of escalating tensions with China and Russia.\n\nThe Biden administration and Senate Democrats have vociferously condemned Mr. Tuberville's blockade as dangerous and misplaced. But while many Republicans are deeply uncomfortable with his tactics, G.O.P. leaders' criticism has been more restrained.\n\n\"I don't support putting a hold on military nominations,\" Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the minority leader, told reporters recently when asked about Mr. Tuberville's actions. That has not been enough to dissuade the Alabama senator or his staunch supporters in the G.O.P. ranks, who have stood in for him when he was not at the Capitol to press his objections to a policy that has angered the anti-abortion Republican base.\n\nThe resulting impasse is beginning to take a tangible toll on the military. On Monday, the first of the departing Joint Chiefs, Gen. David H. Berger, the Marine commandant, will retire in a \"relinquishment of office\" ceremony, leaving his current deputy and nominated successor, Gen. Eric Smith, to take over without Congress's blessing.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

While it has been reviewed by human transcribers, it may contain errors. Please review the episode audio before quoting from this transcript and email transcripts@nytimes.com with any questions.\n\nFrom the New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. This is \"The Daily.\"\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nFor the past few months, a single senator, Tommy Tuberville, has blocked hundreds of promotions within the US military as a political protest against the Biden administration. Today, my colleague, Karoun Demirjian, explains what's behind his blockade and why military leaders say it's becoming a threat to national security.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nIt's Monday, July 24.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nKaroun, tell us about this Republican Senator, Tommy Tuberville, who is very much at the center of this months-long drama.\n\nSo Tommy Tuberville is probably best known to the general population as a storied coach of the Auburn University football team.\n\nTommy Tuberville is getting another shower as -\n\nHe took Auburn to more wins over Alabama than anybody else had. And that was his whole public persona until he decided to stage his first political campaign.\n\nThe way I was raised, before a football game, you stood to honor America. And after the game, you knelt to honor God.\n\nAnd run for Alabama's Senate seat in 2020.\n\nSo I'm getting off the sidelines and into the fight. As your Senator, I'll have President Trump's back. We can't be bought, and we won't back down.\n\nAnd he wins.\n\nRight.\n\nSo Tuberville arrives in Washington three days before January 6. Obviously, DC is in turmoil. And we don't hear that much from him, except for he's one of those MAGA guys that's newly in office in 2021. It isn't until the next year in the summer of 2022, frankly, that the issue that will end up defining him starts to emerge. And that is that the Supreme Court strikes down \"Roe v. Wade.\" and that creates this patchwork of different abortion laws in various states around the country.\n\nAnd so people are scrambling to figure out how to navigate this new patchwork of a post-Roe world. And one organization that faces a lot of pressure to do something is the Pentagon. The military has a bit of a unique situation. They deploy service members to states all over the country in places with different levels of access to reproductive care.\n\nRight.\n\nAnd so the question becomes whether they're going to dictate a policy that will equalize that playing field for all different service members, regardless of where they're stationed. So if you're based in Massachusetts, you have a relatively equal ability to access abortion, reproductive care, whatever that may be as somebody based in Alabama because members of the military don't get to choose where they're stationed.\n\nRight. Suddenly, a couple of dozen states are banning abortion. And service members might be in those states, or they might be in states where it's perfectly legal in a post-Roe world.\n\nAbsolutely. And it takes the Pentagon a good long time to come up with what its policy is going to be. It isn't until February of this year that they actually say, OK, what we're going to do is we're going to offer time off and travel reimbursement to anybody who needs to go out of state to obtain an abortion or some other form of reproductive care that is not offered in the state where you're stationed. And Tommy Tuberville says, oh, no, you're not going to do that.\n\nAnd why is he upset about this government solution to a post-Roe world for soldiers who might need abortions?\n\nWell, there's two reasons. Politically, it's pretty clear where Tuberville is coming from. He's coming from Alabama. He ran on a very conservative Republican platform. And for him, the logical place that plays well at home, given where his state is, given where he has been politically, is you don't vote for abortion. You don't enable abortions to happen. That doesn't work with your brand of Republicanism.\n\nThe other argument that he makes is that it's illegal, that there are federal laws that say you cannot spend money on an abortion. And his argument is spending money to facilitate an abortion is basically the exact same thing. And so he issues an ultimatum to the Pentagon and says, if you go ahead with this policy, I am going to prevent you from being able to promote any of your generals or your admirals because the Senate actually has to say, OK, we approve for those things to happen.\n\nIt's really rare that somebody actually says, I'm not going to allow uniformed senior members of the military to move up in rank because it's a leadership issue in the military. And it's kind of one of those third rails that politicians don't touch. But Tuberville did, and that was the threat that he made.\n\nAnd what is the response from the military, from the Biden administration to that threat?\n\nThey basically ignore it, and they go ahead and they implement the policy anyway in March. And so when the next batch of senior military promotions comes up on the Senate floor, Democrats try to move it through, and Tuberville says, no.\n\nThe senior Senator from Alabama.\n\nReserving the right to object.\n\nI object. He makes good on the threat.\n\nI'm holding the DOD nominations because the Secretary of Defense is trying to push through a massive expansion of taxpayer subsidized abortions.\n\nAnd he makes this speech explaining, I told you what the terms were. I told you what I needed you to change about this policy, how I was not OK with you putting it in place. You did it anyway, so I'm doing what I threatened that I would do.\n\nI object, and I will continue to object to any nominees as long as this illegal new abortion policy is in place. Americans want a military focused on a national defense. And that's what I'm fighting for.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nOK, well, explain how Tuberville, a single senator whose party, the Republican party, is in the minority in the Senate, has the ability to be a one man blockade on any promotion in the senior ranks of the US military because that seems hard to wrap your head around.\n\nRight. So this gets into the rules and the arcane guts of how the Senate operates. It's a very strange place. But basically, to be able to do anything without having to jump through a series of time-sucking procedural hurdles, you need what's called unanimous consent.\n\nYou need all the senators to just be like, OK, I don't care. Go ahead. Do it. And then you can get a whole lot of things done that would otherwise suck up a whole lot of time on the floor. Military promotions are one of these things that traditionally have been done by unanimous consent because everybody supports the uniformed military.\n\nRight.\n\nBut that means any one Senator has outsized influence because they can deny you unanimous consent. All of a sudden, when you have one Senator saying, absolutely not, no, you don't have that unanimity. And that's what gives Tuberville the ability to have a one man blockade against basically the entire military and the entire way that things have happened in the Senate for decades upon decades.\n\nSo Tuberville has successfully exploited a funky little logistical reality of unanimous consent.\n\nYeah, he does. And then he does it again and again. And weeks go by. And then the question becomes for everybody else, how do we get Tuberville to stand down? He and the Defense Secretary have a phone call a few weeks into the protest, and the Defense Secretary tries to explain why it's a bad idea. And Tuberville is not convinced. And he leaves that call and says, nope, this was not enough for me. I want this policy changed.\n\nHis GOP colleagues in the Senate also are really not comfortable with what he's doing. There's a lot of defense hawks in their ranks. They are not comfortable messing with the military's ability to do its job. But the most that they're willing to say, publicly at least at the outset, is I agree with your protest in substance, but do you have to do it this way? Because remember, the GOP also doesn't like abortion and they don't like this Pentagon policy.\n\nMore weeks go by. And in that time, Democrats try over and over and over again to bring up these promotions to get them through the floor. And every time, Tuberville is there saying, no, I object. And so what becomes clear is that Tuberville is demanding this issue be settled by an act of Congress.\n\nWhat Tuberville's fundamental complaint is is that the administration, the Defense Department, should not have been able to do this on their own. And what he wants is for Congress to actually dictate what the policy should be. That means either an act of Congress to force the Pentagon to undo their policy on abortion access, or proactively passing a law that says that policy, that's the law. And if they fail to do that, if lawmakers can't get that law through Congress, he wants the Pentagon to revoke its policy.\n\nSo for him, it's an all or nothing approach. And it doesn't sound like one that's logistically and politically likely to go his way because, of course, the Senate is controlled by Democrats. So this just keeps dragging on week after week, month after month. And I'm curious, what becomes the impact of this one man, all or nothing blockade?\n\nAs the blockade goes on, the backlog of these senior uniformed commanders who haven't been promoted grows and grows. So what was initially dozens becomes hundreds. It's also now becoming really visible and tangible because it's affecting the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nNow the Joint Chiefs of Staff are made up of the most senior uniformed officials in each of the branches of the services. They're also, as a body, the top military advisory crew for the president. And over the course of the summer, we may end up in a situation where over half of the Joint Chiefs don't actually have Senate confirmation, as is traditional process.\n\nThey will be places occupied by acting officials, but those are temporary and they don't have the authority and the blessing of Congress to make changes, to make decisions about policy. And that's really what's setting off alarm bells now.\n\nOne in five members of the US military are women. Abortion laws in this country that are now being passed are absolutely having an effect on their willingness to continue serving in uniform, or to -\n\nAnd you're starting to hear senior members of the military.\n\nThis is a national security issue. It's a readiness issue. And we shouldn't kid ourselves. And I think any member of the Senate Armed Services Committee knows that.\n\nThe Secretary of Defense, the White House.\n\nThe idea that we're injecting into fundamental foreign policy decisions what, in fact, is a domestic social debate on social issues is bizarre.\n\nSaying this is becoming a real problem and could actually affect our military readiness and our ability to respond to threats around the world.\n\nRight. If there's one organization in the US government where you want people to firmly be in their jobs and for there to be no question about their authority and its power, it is the United States military. And it is especially the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nRight. Because their counsel, their advice is considered to be pivotal for the president. And the president is the Commander in Chief. And so this really goes right up to the top now about, how much authority do they have to give that counsel? And how is that affecting the United States's standing in the world?\n\nI'm really curious what Senator Tuberville says in response to all these senior military people saying very pointedly, you, Senator, are making the military weaker with this blockade, with this protest. You must stop. National security is at risk.\n\nFirst of all, he's not buying their argument that the sky is falling. And he's also saying, well, if you think so, change your policy because it doesn't help military readiness and defense, he says, to be focused on things like providing abortion access. We should be talking about defense, and that's it. And these are extraneous issues that that's what makes us weaker. That's his take.\n\nAnd, frankly, he's getting a lot of support for this, both from people at home in Alabama and even increasingly so in Washington, where a lot of far right Republicans in the House have basically taken up his cause and made this a fight against the Pentagon not just to undo the abortion access policy, but a whole bunch of other social policies that they say should be more conservative.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nWe'll be right back.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nSo, Karoun, describe exactly what it is that Senator Tuberville seems to have helped inspire over in the Republican controlled House.\n\nSo over the months that he's objecting, there's a group of far right Republicans who are actually coming to physically show their support for Tuberville on the back of the Senate chamber when he makes these objections. And then it becomes time for the House to do its annual defense bill. This is something that the House tackles every year. It's basically Congress setting the rules of the road for how the Pentagon can spend the money, the taxpayer money, that Congress eventually appropriates for them.\n\nAnd they demand an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that would basically bar the Pentagon from being able to implement this policy for service members that would need to leave the state for an abortion.\n\nSo they basically put Tuberville's plan in their bill.\n\nThey put Tuberville's plan in their bill. And they succeed in getting it attached, one, because a couple of Republicans in the House also have outsized power because the GOP's majority is so, so slim. But also because Republicans don't like the policy. And so when you put it to the floor, the GOP is hard pressed to vote against it, even if they're worried it might blow up the whole defense bill.\n\nAnd actually, the far right Republicans managed to do a lot more. They go after health coverage for people transitioning gender and say, you can't spend money on that in the military. They go after the diversity training initiatives. And they stopped just short of saying can't spend money on it at all, but they say we're going to cut all the offices and all the personnel that are tasked to those offices to actually teach about diversity, equity, and inclusion in the military.\n\nSo they take what Tuberville is up to, which is pretty narrow - take the issue of abortion out of the military, and they broadened it. And they are basically trying to take all social issues they don't agree with out of the military.\n\nRight. The military thus becomes a forum, at least in the House's defense bill, for these culture wars. And what ends up happening to the bill is that you took a defense bill that started off as a bipartisan product with support from Democrats. And by the time you're actually voting on it, load it up with all this stuff. Almost no Democrats are willing to support it anymore.\n\nAnd so what you have left is a GOP-backed bill. And that's kind of a unique situation because, normally, you end up having a bipartisan vote for these defense bills. That's the goal. And for the last 60 years, Congress as a whole has managed to annually pass a defense bill. But that's in doubt now because you can't get this bill with all of these conservative social policy clawbacks through a Democrat-backed Senate. And that could fundamentally change Congress's relationship overseeing the military.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nRight, because you're saying it's quite likely in the coming weeks, or I guess months, that the Senate might not pass this Defense Authorization Bill. And, suddenly, the military's budget would be in doubt.\n\nThe Senate's working on its own Defense Authorization Bill version right now, and it's not going to look anything like the House's bill on these issues. After this, they have to appoint negotiators to go work out a compromise. The question is, can they actually compromise? And whatever compromise they strike, can it get through both of these chambers?\n\nUsually, the answer is Yes because Congress thinks that continuing to direct how dollars should be spent in the military is a super important thing. But the answer to that question is a big question mark right now because there's such a split on these social issues that really cut to the core of each party.\n\nRight. So at this point, Tuberville has seemingly emboldened his far right Republican colleagues to make social issues so central to the way that they think about the military that it may end up jeopardizing the military's funding in a very unusual way this year.\n\nRight. Usually, if you have disputes over social policy as part of the whole defense bill, they start to go away by the time you actually strike a compromise. But the far right Republicans have been emboldened. They realize the outsized power that they can have, even in small numbers. And they are not inclined to make a deal.\n\nI'm curious if Republican leaders have either a plan or the power to end what Tuberville is doing, and I guess, by extension, sending a message to House far right Republicans to stop what they are doing.\n\nWell, the thing is they don't. Unless you change the rules of the Senate, you can't really stop one Senator from objecting. Unless you miraculously find dozens more Republicans to give you a bigger than a five vote majority in the House, you can't really change the fact that the far right Republicans in the House have a lot of power.\n\nAnd the leaders of the party, knowing that they're between a rock and a hard place, are not talking as tough as a lot of the mainstream Republicans and Democrats want to see them talk. They're not threatening these guys in ways that they want to see happening, at least not openly, because they really don't have their hand on that lever to pull the kill switch and make this stop.\n\nSo back to the beginning of our story here, Karoun, how does this all come to an end? How does this one man blockade end? Does it ever end if Tuberville wants to keep doing what he's doing?\n\nWell, first of all, I should say that Tommy Tuberville has basically rejected the idea that you can settle this under the defense bill because he thinks that Congress is too split, and it's true, to actually be able to get it done that way. And he's making these demands for standalone bills that, frankly, could never pass both the House and the Senate in similar ways. So that's not very practical. The only way to get through Tommy Tuberville's blockade right now seems to be to go around Tommy Tuberville's blockade.\n\nAnd what does that look like?\n\nThat means the Senate has to start putting these nominees one by one up for votes on the floor. The concern is if you have to do that for every single one of the promotions that are stuck in this backlog, you would be on the Senate floor for weeks on end if you went 24 hours, seven days a week, which is not how they work. Months on end if you actually parcel it out so it's something akin to a normal workday. And you wouldn't be able to get very much else done.\n\nRight. This is the virtue of unanimous consent. It avoids having to spend hundreds, thousands of hours trying to get military promotions through the Senate.\n\nIt's efficiency when it comes to things that should be pretty non-controversial, yeah. And so now the question being laid at the feet of the Senate Majority leader, Democrat Chuck Schumer, is, are you going to do that to get your Joint Chiefs in place?\n\nAnd even if you say, OK, fine, we'll do that, we'll relent on the Joint Chiefs, we'll make that a special issue, what about everybody else? There's still no conclusion on the hundreds of other senior officers, commanders who are still stuck in that backlog and need to see those promotions get through.\n\nRight. So it doesn't look like Chuck Schumer is going to take this laborious, time-consuming approach for all the hundreds of promotions that are in this backlog. That's what you're saying.\n\nIt's the equivalent of shutting down the Senate floor for a long, long time to anything else. But also remember, it's not just about what you happen to have time to do this month. It's what precedent do you set for the future?\n\nRight.\n\nAnd they are very, very concerned about saying this is a legitimate protest that we will engage with because what about the next time somebody has a complaint with a Pentagon policy? What if everybody could have their way on niche issues by threatening to block hundreds of promotions for months on end? You wouldn't actually be able to ever get any laws passed, even in a season where you'd need to.\n\nSo what would it look like for Senator Tuberville to prevail here and for the military and the Biden administration, by extension, to cave and give in on this abortion access policy so that it can get the military appointment process back to normal?\n\nIt would not be unprecedented for the Biden administration to cave on a social policy to Republicans. This actually happened recently when they said, OK, we'll take down the COVID mandate. That was more of an argument that happened in the contours of the defense bill.\n\nBut there's something very different about this one. We're heading into a presidential election year next year, and Democrats think that the abortion issue for them is a winner on the campaign trail. They did better than they were expecting to in the midterm elections because they campaigned on \"Roe v Wade.\"\n\nRight.\n\nThey want to still paint the GOP as extreme on abortion and a whole bunch of other social policies because they believe that will get them votes to keep a Democrat in the White House. If they give up on this, that is undermining what is supposed to be a signature central campaign issue. And so the long-term consequences of that could be pretty severe at the ballot box.\n\nSo they can't politically afford to cave on this issue. And the result is going to be a somewhat dysfunctional US military.\n\nYeah, at least organizationally. And the thing is, we don't know how long that's going to go on and what the repercussions are going to be in the long term because, frankly, right now, Tommy Tuberville seems like he can continue this blockade for just about as long as he wants to.\n\nWell, Karoun, thank you very much. We appreciate it.\n\nThank you. [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nWe'll be right back.\n\nHere's what else you need to know today.\n\n[CROWD PROTESTING]\n\nIn Israel over the weekend, tens of thousands of people marched to the capital city of Jerusalem in a last ditch protest against their government's plan to reduce the power of the country's highest court. That plan, which is supported by the far right government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is expected to be adopted today.\n\nNetanyahu and his supporters say it's necessary to prevent the left-leaning court from repeatedly overruling his government. But opponents say it's a dangerous power grab that will endanger Israel's democracy.\n\nToday's episode was produced by Rob Szypko, Asthaa Chaturvedi, Carlos Prieto, and Sydney Harper, with help from Eric Krupke.

And so he issues an ultimatum to the Pentagon and says, if you go ahead with this policy, I am going to prevent you from being able to promote any of your generals or your admirals because the Senate actually has to say, OK, we approve for those things to happen.\n\nIt's really rare that somebody actually says, I'm not going to allow uniformed senior members of the military to move up in rank because it's a leadership issue in the military. And it's kind of one of those third rails that politicians don't touch. But Tuberville did, and that was the threat that he made.\n\nAnd what is the response from the military, from the Biden administration to that threat?\n\nThey basically ignore it, and they go ahead and they implement the policy anyway in March. And so when the next batch of senior military promotions comes up on the Senate floor, Democrats try to move it through, and Tuberville says, no.\n\nThe senior Senator from Alabama.\n\nReserving the right to object.\n\nI object. He makes good on the threat.\n\nI'm holding the DOD nominations because the Secretary of Defense is trying to push through a massive expansion of taxpayer subsidized abortions.\n\nAnd he makes this speech explaining, I told you what the terms were. I told you what I needed you to change about this policy, how I was not OK with you putting it in place. You did it anyway, so I'm doing what I threatened that I would do.\n\nI object, and I will continue to object to any nominees as long as this illegal new abortion policy is in place. Americans want a military focused on a national defense. And that's what I'm fighting for.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nOK, well, explain how Tuberville, a single senator whose party, the Republican party, is in the minority in the Senate, has the ability to be a one man blockade on any promotion in the senior ranks of the US military because that seems hard to wrap your head around.\n\nRight. So this gets into the rules and the arcane guts of how the Senate operates. It's a very strange place. But basically, to be able to do anything without having to jump through a series of time-sucking procedural hurdles, you need what's called unanimous consent.\n\nYou need all the senators to just be like, OK, I don't care. Go ahead. Do it. And then you can get a whole lot of things done that would otherwise suck up a whole lot of time on the floor. Military promotions are one of these things that traditionally have been done by unanimous consent because everybody supports the uniformed military.\n\nRight.\n\nBut that means any one Senator has outsized influence because they can deny you unanimous consent. All of a sudden, when you have one Senator saying, absolutely not, no, you don't have that unanimity. And that's what gives Tuberville the ability to have a one man blockade against basically the entire military and the entire way that things have happened in the Senate for decades upon decades.\n\nSo Tuberville has successfully exploited a funky little logistical reality of unanimous consent.\n\nYeah, he does. And then he does it again and again. And weeks go by. And then the question becomes for everybody else, how do we get Tuberville to stand down? He and the Defense Secretary have a phone call a few weeks into the protest, and the Defense Secretary tries to explain why it's a bad idea. And Tuberville is not convinced. And he leaves that call and says, nope, this was not enough for me. I want this policy changed.\n\nHis GOP colleagues in the Senate also are really not comfortable with what he's doing. There's a lot of defense hawks in their ranks. They are not comfortable messing with the military's ability to do its job. But the most that they're willing to say, publicly at least at the outset, is I agree with your protest in substance, but do you have to do it this way? Because remember, the GOP also doesn't like abortion and they don't like this Pentagon policy.\n\nMore weeks go by. And in that time, Democrats try over and over and over again to bring up these promotions to get them through the floor. And every time, Tuberville is there saying, no, I object. And so what becomes clear is that Tuberville is demanding this issue be settled by an act of Congress.\n\nWhat Tuberville's fundamental complaint is is that the administration, the Defense Department, should not have been able to do this on their own. And what he wants is for Congress to actually dictate what the policy should be. That means either an act of Congress to force the Pentagon to undo their policy on abortion access, or proactively passing a law that says that policy, that's the law. And if they fail to do that, if lawmakers can't get that law through Congress, he wants the Pentagon to revoke its policy.\n\nSo for him, it's an all or nothing approach. And it doesn't sound like one that's logistically and politically likely to go his way because, of course, the Senate is controlled by Democrats. So this just keeps dragging on week after week, month after month. And I'm curious, what becomes the impact of this one man, all or nothing blockade?\n\nAs the blockade goes on, the backlog of these senior uniformed commanders who haven't been promoted grows and grows. So what was initially dozens becomes hundreds. It's also now becoming really visible and tangible because it's affecting the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nNow the Joint Chiefs of Staff are made up of the most senior uniformed officials in each of the branches of the services. They're also, as a body, the top military advisory crew for the president. And over the course of the summer, we may end up in a situation where over half of the Joint Chiefs don't actually have Senate confirmation, as is traditional process.\n\nThey will be places occupied by acting officials, but those are temporary and they don't have the authority and the blessing of Congress to make changes, to make decisions about policy. And that's really what's setting off alarm bells now.\n\nOne in five members of the US military are women. Abortion laws in this country that are now being passed are absolutely having an effect on their willingness to continue serving in uniform, or to -\n\nAnd you're starting to hear senior members of the military.\n\nThis is a national security issue. It's a readiness issue. And we shouldn't kid ourselves. And I think any member of the Senate Armed Services Committee knows that.\n\nThe Secretary of Defense, the White House.\n\nThe idea that we're injecting into fundamental foreign policy decisions what, in fact, is a domestic social debate on social issues is bizarre.\n\nSaying this is becoming a real problem and could actually affect our military readiness and our ability to respond to threats around the world.\n\nRight. If there's one organization in the US government where you want people to firmly be in their jobs and for there to be no question about their authority and its power, it is the United States military. And it is especially the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nRight. Because their counsel, their advice is considered to be pivotal for the president. And the president is the Commander in Chief. And so this really goes right up to the top now about, how much authority do they have to give that counsel? And how is that affecting the United States's standing in the world?\n\nI'm really curious what Senator Tuberville says in response to all these senior military people saying very pointedly, you, Senator, are making the military weaker with this blockade, with this protest. You must stop. National security is at risk.\n\nFirst of all, he's not buying their argument that the sky is falling. And he's also saying, well, if you think so, change your policy because it doesn't help military readiness and defense, he says, to be focused on things like providing abortion access. We should be talking about defense, and that's it. And these are extraneous issues that that's what makes us weaker. That's his take.\n\nAnd, frankly, he's getting a lot of support for this, both from people at home in Alabama and even increasingly so in Washington, where a lot of far right Republicans in the House have basically taken up his cause and made this a fight against the Pentagon not just to undo the abortion access policy, but a whole bunch of other social policies that they say should be more conservative.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nWe'll be right back.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nSo, Karoun, describe exactly what it is that Senator Tuberville seems to have helped inspire over in the Republican controlled House.\n\nSo over the months that he's objecting, there's a group of far right Republicans who are actually coming to physically show their support for Tuberville on the back of the Senate chamber when he makes these objections. And then it becomes time for the House to do its annual defense bill. This is something that the House tackles every year. It's basically Congress setting the rules of the road for how the Pentagon can spend the money, the taxpayer money, that Congress eventually appropriates for them.\n\nAnd they demand an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that would basically bar the Pentagon from being able to implement this policy for service members that would need to leave the state for an abortion.\n\nSo they basically put Tuberville's plan in their bill.\n\nThey put Tuberville's plan in their bill. And they succeed in getting it attached, one, because a couple of Republicans in the House also have outsized power because the GOP's majority is so, so slim. But also because Republicans don't like the policy. And so when you put it to the floor, the GOP is hard pressed to vote against it, even if they're worried it might blow up the whole defense bill.\n\nAnd actually, the far right Republicans managed to do a lot more. They go after health coverage for people transitioning gender and say, you can't spend money on that in the military. They go after the diversity training initiatives. And they stopped just short of saying can't spend money on it at all, but they say we're going to cut all the offices and all the personnel that are tasked to those offices to actually teach about diversity, equity, and inclusion in the military.\n\nSo they take what Tuberville is up to, which is pretty narrow - take the issue of abortion out of the military, and they broadened it. And they are basically trying to take all social issues they don't agree with out of the military.\n\nRight. The military thus becomes a forum, at least in the House's defense bill, for these culture wars. And what ends up happening to the bill is that you took a defense bill that started off as a bipartisan product with support from Democrats. And by the time you're actually voting on it, load it up with all this stuff. Almost no Democrats are willing to support it anymore.\n\nAnd so what you have left is a GOP-backed bill. And that's kind of a unique situation because, normally, you end up having a bipartisan vote for these defense bills. That's the goal. And for the last 60 years, Congress as a whole has managed to annually pass a defense bill. But that's in doubt now because you can't get this bill with all of these conservative social policy clawbacks through a Democrat-backed Senate. And that could fundamentally change Congress's relationship overseeing the military.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nRight, because you're saying it's quite likely in the coming weeks, or I guess months, that the Senate might not pass this Defense Authorization Bill. And, suddenly, the military's budget would be in doubt.\n\nThe Senate's working on its own Defense Authorization Bill version right now, and it's not going to look anything like the House's bill on these issues. After this, they have to appoint negotiators to go work out a compromise. The question is, can they actually compromise? And whatever compromise they strike, can it get through both of these chambers?\n\nUsually, the answer is Yes because Congress thinks that continuing to direct how dollars should be spent in the military is a super important thing. But the answer to that question is a big question mark right now because there's such a split on these social issues that really cut to the core of each party.\n\nRight. So at this point, Tuberville has seemingly emboldened his far right Republican colleagues to make social issues so central to the way that they think about the military that it may end up jeopardizing the military's funding in a very unusual way this year.\n\nRight. Usually, if you have disputes over social policy as part of the whole defense bill, they start to go away by the time you actually strike a compromise. But the far right Republicans have been emboldened. They realize the outsized power that they can have, even in small numbers. And they are not inclined to make a deal.\n\nI'm curious if Republican leaders have either a plan or the power to end what Tuberville is doing, and I guess, by extension, sending a message to House far right Republicans to stop what they are doing.\n\nWell, the thing is they don't. Unless you change the rules of the Senate, you can't really stop one Senator from objecting. Unless you miraculously find dozens more Republicans to give you a bigger than a five vote majority in the House, you can't really change the fact that the far right Republicans in the House have a lot of power.\n\nAnd the leaders of the party, knowing that they're between a rock and a hard place, are not talking as tough as a lot of the mainstream Republicans and Democrats want to see them talk. They're not threatening these guys in ways that they want to see happening, at least not openly, because they really don't have their hand on that lever to pull the kill switch and make this stop.\n\nSo back to the beginning of our story here, Karoun, how does this all come to an end? How does this one man blockade end? Does it ever end if Tuberville wants to keep doing what he's doing?\n\nWell, first of all, I should say that Tommy Tuberville has basically rejected the idea that you can settle this under the defense bill because he thinks that Congress is too split, and it's true, to actually be able to get it done that way. And he's making these demands for standalone bills that, frankly, could never pass both the House and the Senate in similar ways. So that's not very practical. The only way to get through Tommy Tuberville's blockade right now seems to be to go around Tommy Tuberville's blockade.\n\nAnd what does that look like?\n\nThat means the Senate has to start putting these nominees one by one up for votes on the floor. The concern is if you have to do that for every single one of the promotions that are stuck in this backlog, you would be on the Senate floor for weeks on end if you went 24 hours, seven days a week, which is not how they work. Months on end if you actually parcel it out so it's something akin to a normal workday. And you wouldn't be able to get very much else done.\n\nRight. This is the virtue of unanimous consent. It avoids having to spend hundreds, thousands of hours trying to get military promotions through the Senate.\n\nIt's efficiency when it comes to things that should be pretty non-controversial, yeah. And so now the question being laid at the feet of the Senate Majority leader, Democrat Chuck Schumer, is, are you going to do that to get your Joint Chiefs in place?\n\nAnd even if you say, OK, fine, we'll do that, we'll relent on the Joint Chiefs, we'll make that a special issue, what about everybody else? There's still no conclusion on the hundreds of other senior officers, commanders who are still stuck in that backlog and need to see those promotions get through.\n\nRight. So it doesn't look like Chuck Schumer is going to take this laborious, time-consuming approach for all the hundreds of promotions that are in this backlog. That's what you're saying.\n\nIt's the equivalent of shutting down the Senate floor for a long, long time to anything else. But also remember, it's not just about what you happen to have time to do this month. It's what precedent do you set for the future?\n\nRight.\n\nAnd they are very, very concerned about saying this is a legitimate protest that we will engage with because what about the next time somebody has a complaint with a Pentagon policy? What if everybody could have their way on niche issues by threatening to block hundreds of promotions for months on end? You wouldn't actually be able to ever get any laws passed, even in a season where you'd need to.\n\nSo what would it look like for Senator Tuberville to prevail here and for the military and the Biden administration, by extension, to cave and give in on this abortion access policy so that it can get the military appointment process back to normal?\n\nIt would not be unprecedented for the Biden administration to cave on a social policy to Republicans. This actually happened recently when they said, OK, we'll take down the COVID mandate. That was more of an argument that happened in the contours of the defense bill.\n\nBut there's something very different about this one. We're heading into a presidential election year next year, and Democrats think that the abortion issue for them is a winner on the campaign trail. They did better than they were expecting to in the midterm elections because they campaigned on \"Roe v Wade.\"\n\nRight.\n\nThey want to still paint the GOP as extreme on abortion and a whole bunch of other social policies because they believe that will get them votes to keep a Democrat in the White House. If they give up on this, that is undermining what is supposed to be a signature central campaign issue. And so the long-term consequences of that could be pretty severe at the ballot box.\n\nSo they can't politically afford to cave on this issue. And the result is going to be a somewhat dysfunctional US military.\n\nYeah, at least organizationally. And the thing is, we don't know how long that's going to go on and what the repercussions are going to be in the long term because, frankly, right now, Tommy Tuberville seems like he can continue this blockade for just about as long as he wants to.\n\nWell, Karoun, thank you very much. We appreciate it.\n\nThank you. [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nWe'll be right back.\n\nHere's what else you need to know today.\n\n[CROWD PROTESTING]\n\nIn Israel over the weekend, tens of thousands of people marched to the capital city of Jerusalem in a last ditch protest against their government's plan to reduce the power of the country's highest court.

      "text": "Tommy Tuberville's Military Blockade Shows the Senate's Rules Need to Change\n\nEven as the U.S. military faces threats in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, Tommy Tuberville-a first-term Republican senator and former football coach without a whit of political experience, and maybe a half-whit of knowledge-is single-handedly blocking the promotion of 367 generals and admirals .\n\nHe has been doing so for nine months and hasn't let up, even after one of the stalled generals, Marine Corps Commandant Eric Smith, suffered a heart attack -and Tuberville's hijinks probably contributed to it. Because the nominee for assistant commandant has been held up, Smith has been working 18-hour days at both jobs, a situation that he'd recently described as unsustainable. (He is recovering in the hospital. Now the Marines' third-ranking general is having to do three jobs at once.)\n\nTuberville has carried on his crusade, despite urgings and protests from the Senate's GOP leadership, the entire Joint Chiefs of Staff, the secretary of defense, and a petition signed by 1,000 family members of officers whose entire lives-in some cases, plans to relocate and place their children in new schools-have been thrown into chaos by what they denounce as the Alabama senator's \"political showmanship.\"\n\nSmith's heart attack earlier this week roused a handful of top GOP senators to pressure Tuberville more loudly, but to little effect so far.\n\nThe freshman senator has been able to persist because of a bizarre, outmoded Senate rule. In weighing whether to confirm a president's high-level political nominees, the Senate investigates, holds committee hearings, and conducts floor debates before voting. But for many nonpolitical assignments, the Senate leaders ask for \"unanimous consent,\" a procedure that takes a few minutes. This is especially the case for nominations and promotions of military officers-thousands of which take place every year. There is no time for the Senate to vote on each individually; nor, unless someone on the Senate Armed Services Committee has raised an objection, is there a need to do so.\n\nHowever, according to the rules, even a single senator can object to the request for unanimous consent-and thus hold up the process. For nine months now, Tuberville has been doing this with the entire slate of military nominations and promotions-affecting 367 top-level officers. They include 151 one-star generals and admirals, 137 two-stars, 66 three-stars, and 13 four-stars-in all, more than 40 percent of all the generals and admirals in the U.S. armed forces.\n\nAs a result, according to a fact sheet compiled by the Senate Armed Services Committee, the following posts are either vacant or filled by acting officers who lack the legal authority to make many decisions that are required: chief of naval operations, Air Force chief of staff, Cyber Command commander (who also serves as director of the National Security Agency), U.S. military representative to NATO, and directors of the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Missile Defense Agency, as well as the commanders of the Pacific Fleet, the 7 th Fleet, the 5 th Fleet, the Pacific Air Forces, the Air Combat Command, and the Army's Space and Missile Defense Command.\n\nWhen I wrote about this in September , there were 273 blocked promotions and unfilled senior offices. The number has risen by almost one-third since then, and if the block continues, it will rise by another three-quarters-to 650-by the end of this year.\n\nTuberville has mounted his crusade as a protest to the Defense Department's policy on abortion. After the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade last year, leaving abortion policy to the states, the Pentagon said it would pay the travel expenses for a servicewoman who wanted to have an abortion but who was based in a state that outlawed it. (The Justice Department passed a similar allowance for pregnant prisoners.)\n\nStarting in February, Tuberville put a hold on every military promotion and nomination, saying he would not let up until the Pentagon dropped its abortion policy. Since then, DOD and DOJ lawyers have ruled that the allowance is legal; no one has filed a lawsuit to challenge it; the Senate Armed Services Committee voted down a motion to suspend the policy; and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has offered to let a vote on the measure come to the floor (where it would certainly be rejected).\n\nNone of this has appeased Tuberville.\n\nThe rules do allow the Senate to take formal votes on individual nominees, but doing that for 367 officers, one at a time, would take many months. Senate leaders have also been reluctant to make exceptions for the most senior nominees, saying it would create a bad precedent. Enlisted members of the military might think that their immediate superiors are considered less important than the top brass, and future obstructionists would be encouraged to follow Tuberville's example, knowing that the most serious consequences would be sidestepped.\n\nNonetheless, Schumer scheduled votes on three of these officers and won overwhelmingly on all three. The margins were 95-1 for Adm. Lisa Franchetti as chief of naval operations and Gen. David Allvin for Air Force chief of staff, and 86-0 for Lt. Gen. Christopher Mahoney as assistant Marine Corps commandant.\n\nTuberville voted to confirm all three. (The one nay vote was cast by Kansas Republican Roger Marshall.) However, he has not agreed to drop his objection to a unanimous-consent vote on the remaining 364 officers.\n\nSo this will not end the standoff. Ultimately the Senate must change its rules. I would suggest requiring three senators-not just one-to obstruct a unanimous-consent motion. But any rule change would require the votes of 60 senators-all the Democrats and nine Republicans. The problem is that despite the near-universal view that Tuberville's move is harming national security and military morale, there may not be nine Republicans willing to step up.\n\nMuch of the Republican \"base\" agrees with Tuberville's position. In a CBS/YouGov poll in August, 68 percent of primary-voting Republicans said they think abortion should be illegal across the nation in most or all cases.\n\nTuberville is also a favored acolyte of Donald Trump , who, despite his role as defendant in four criminal trials, seems headed toward being the Republican nominee in the 2024 presidential election. Tuberville won Alabama's Senate primary in 2022-even though he'd lived in Alabama for only a short while and despite a financial scandal with a hedge fund that he co-owned-entirely on the basis of Trump's endorsement. He then handily defeated his Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, who had barely won a special election in 2017 after the Republican candidate, Roy Moore, was accused of sexually assaulting a minor. (Moore denied the allegations, and no criminal charges were brought against him.)\n\nIn various interviews, Tuberville has defined the three branches of government as the House, the Senate, and the Executive. He has said that the United States fought World War II \"to free Europe of socialism.\" He has denounced the Navy for being \" too woke ,\" saying, \"We've got people doing poems on aircraft carriers.\" Asked in an interview on a Birmingham radio station whether white nationalists should be allowed to serve in the military, he replied, \" Well, they call them that-I call them Americans .\"\n\nIn short, Tuberville can in no way be regarded as a serious figure. Kyle Whitmire , political columnist for AL.com and winner of this year's Pulitzer Prize for commentary, called him \"a fire hydrant of crazy talk\" who leaves behind him a trail of \"stupid stuff\" \"the way pulpwood trucks belch smoke along back country roads.\"\n\nIn the old days, a Senate leader would banish someone like Tuberville into oblivion, threatening to pull his committee slots, canceling contracts in his district, and finding someone to run against him in the next primary. But the two parties don't have the same leverage over the rank-and-file that they once did.\n\nMeanwhile, the world looks at the chaos unleashed by this petty egomaniac and wonders whether American-style democracy is worth emulating after all.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Mess of the Tubervilles\n\nSen. Tommy Tuberville dropped his hold on the promotion of more than 400 senior U.S. military officers for one reason only-to avoid abject humiliation, which was about to come his way if he didn't relent.\n\nFor 10 months , the first-term Alabama Republican blocked the promotions as a protest of the Defense Department's policy on abortion. After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, leaving abortion policy to the states, the Pentagon said it would pay the travel expenses for servicewomen who wanted to have an abortion but were based in states that had outlawed it. (The Justice Department passed a similar allowance for pregnant prisoners.) Tuberville put a hold on every military promotion and nomination, saying he would not let up until the Pentagon changed its policy.\n\nHe was able to do this because of a peculiar Senate rule. In weighing whether to confirm a president's high-level political appointees, the Senate investigates, holds hearings, and conducts debates before voting. But for many nonpolitical assignments, Senate leaders ask for \"unanimous consent,\" a procedure that takes a few minutes. This is particularly true of nominations and promotions of military officers-thousands of which occur each year. To vote on all of them individually would take hundreds, even thousands of hours.\n\nHowever, according to the rules, a single senator can object to the request for unanimous consent-and thus hold up the process. This is what, until this week, Tuberville had been doing for 10 months: blocking the routine advancement of nearly half of all the generals and admirals in the U.S. armed forces.\n\nOn Tuesday, he lifted his hold , telling reporters, \"It's been a long fight. We fought hard. We did the right thing for the unborn and for our military, fighting back against executive overreach.\" This is sheer nonsense. In a rare political move, all three service secretaries publicly condemned Tuberville's tactic as a hindrance to military readiness. More than 1,000 family members of officers signed a petition urging him to \" stop playing politics \" with their lives. And as for executive overreach, the Senate Armed Services Committee rejected a motion to overturn the Pentagon's rule. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer offered to hold a vote on the Senate floor, even though the measure lost in committee; Tuberville declined the offer. The Pentagon's lawyers deemed the rule legal. Not even anti-abortion groups challenged the rule in court.\n\nIn short, Tuberville-a former football coach who was elected to the Senate on a fluke and has almost no knowledge of government ( he once identified the three branches as the executive, the House, and the Senate)-was simply grandstanding.\n\nHe finally gave up the fight not as a heroic gesture but because he was about to get pummeled. Schumer was going to bring to the floor a measure that would temporarily drop the rule allowing one senator to block a unanimous-consent vote. Senate aides told me many Republicans were planning to support the change-enough for Tuberville to be roundly defeated, even within his own party. His stance of principled opposition would be exposed as the sheer ego trip it has been all along.\n\nAs soon as Tuberville announced his concession, a measure to promote 445 generals and admirals passed without objection.\n\nTuberville said he would continue to block the swift approval of 11 officers who have been nominated for promotion to four-star general or admiral on the grounds that some of them have views that are \"too woke.\" He has particularly condemned the Navy on this score, complaining, in one interview, \"We've got people doing poems on aircraft carriers.\"\n\nThe Senate will no doubt approve all 12 of the remaining officers in one-by-one votes. Last month, the body took votes on the three most senior officers that Tuberville was blocking-the candidates for chief of naval operations, Air Force chief of staff, and assistant commandant of the Marine Corps. The first two passed 95-1; the last, 86-0. Even Tuberville voted to confirm all three.\n\nThe head-shaker is why Tuberville's Senate colleagues didn't threaten to change the rule months ago, when this drama began. One reason is that senators tend to hold their rules sacred, especially those that distinguish the body-even in the most bizarre ways-from the House. Another is that many Republicans feared crossing Tuberville, who was enthusiastically backed for office by Donald Trump, and alienating their constituents, many of whom oppose abortion.\n\nThree factors helped spur them to action. First, polls are showing that a firm anti-abortion stance doesn't help most Republicans. Second, with the U.S. military facing active threats on several fronts, most recently in the Middle East, Tuberville's antics really did seem to be harming national security. (The nominees whose promotions were blocked included several combatant chiefs, including the commanders of the Pacific Fleet, the 7 th Fleet, the 5 th Fleet, the Pacific Air Forces, the Air Combat Command, and the Army's Space and Missile Defense Command.)\n\nAnother turning point came in late October, when the Marine Corps commandant, Gen. Eric Smith, suffered a heart attack . Smith had been working 18-hour days, a situation he'd recently described as unsustainable, because the nominee for his assistant had been among the officers blocked. It was shortly after the heart attack-for which Tuberville was blamed-that the vote to promote three top officers, including the assistant commandant, was scheduled. (Smith has since recovered, by the way.)\n\nDemocrats will doubtless cite the episode as a campaign issue. President Biden released a statement on Tuesday: \"In the end, this was all pointless. Sen. Tuberville and the Republicans who stood with him needlessly hurt hundreds of service members and military families and threatened our national security-all to push a partisan agenda. I hope no one forgets what he did.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Republican Cowardice Is Creating a Mess for the U.S. Military\n\nSen. Tommy Tuberville, a first-term Republican from Alabama-a former college football coach without a lick of political experience and barely more than a lick of pertinent knowledge-is tossing the U.S. military into a rumpus unlike any since ... well, nobody can recall any time one otherwise insignificant lawmaker has unleashed such a storm.\n\nEarlier in the summer, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin blasted Tuberville for \"undermining America's military readiness ... hindering our ability to retain our very best officers, and ... upending the lives of far too many American military families.\"\n\nJust this week, the civilian secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force-who usually stay out of political matters and almost never take to insulting members of Congress- wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post blaming Tuberville for single-handedly \"putting our national security at risk\" and eroding \"the foundation of America's military advantage.\"\n\nFor seven months now, Tuberville has put a one-man hold on the promotions and nominations of all senior U.S. military officers-the current total comes to 273 generals and admirals. He says he won't drop the hold until the Defense Department drops its policy of paying for female military personnel to travel across state lines, if necessary, in order to obtain legal abortions. (The policy was put in place after the Supreme Court's repeal of Roe v. Wade , thus allowing states to ban abortion-which 15 states, many of them the sites of military bases, now have .)\n\nAs a result, for the first time in 100 years, the Marine Corps lack a Senate-confirmed commandant. Other positions currently filled with \"acting\" heads-according to a list compiled by the Senate Committee on Armed Services-include the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Army chief of staff, the chief of naval operations, the director of the National Security Agency (who is also commander of Cyber Command), director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, the U.S. military representative to NATO, commander of the 7 th Fleet and of the 5 th Fleet, commander of Air Combat Command and of Pacific Air Forces, commander of the Army Space and Missile Defense Command, and superintendent of the Naval Academy.\n\nThe officers who have assumed the job of \"acting\" commander or director in many cases lack the legal authority to make decisions that those with Senate confirmation make routinely. On a more immediate level, dozens of officers have had to take on the responsibilities of two jobs-or to assume the jobs for which they've been nominated without the promotion in rank, thus forfeiting $2,000 a month or more in pay. Officers who were scheduled to move have been held in place, many with children who have left one school but can't enroll in a new one.\n\nAs another example of the havoc being wreaked, more than 550 active-duty military spouses signed a petition to Tuberville in late July, urging him to \"end this political showmanship\" and \"respect the service and sacrifice of those who pledge to defend this nation.\"\n\nTuberville is able to pull this off in part because of a dumbfounding rule of the Senate-and in part because of his Republican colleagues' cowardice.\n\nUsually, military promotions, often dozens or hundreds at a time, are passed-first through the Senate Armed Services Committee, then on the Senate floor-in a \"unanimous consent\" vote. However, Senate rules allow any senator to object to this consent. When this happens, it's usually because a senator has a problem with a particular nominee. On a few occasions, a senator has held up promotions or nominations to pry information or favors out of the Pentagon. Charles Stevenson, a former Senate aide who now teaches at Johns Hopkins University, recalled that Sen. Harold Hughes, his old boss, once blocked 6,000 Navy and Air Force promotions for a few weeks until the Pentagon released information that he and other Democrats had requested on the Vietnam War. Other senators have blocked nominations until the Pentagon restored funding for a local weapons project or base.\n\n\"Usually,\" Stevenson told me in an email, \"these senators get something they can call a win or back down because their colleagues pressure them quietly.\" The exercise is usually kept private, and it's all over, one way or another, in a matter of a few days or weeks. Tuberville's drama, on the other hand, is public; it concerns a big social issue; and it's gone on for seven months, with no sign of the first-term senator relenting.\n\nIf the block persists, another 400 or more nominations could be held up by the end of the year.\n\nAustin has called Tuberville twice in an effort to come to a compromise, to no avail. The Senate Armed Services Committee held two votes on a motion to rescind the Pentagon's abortion policy. After it was voted down both times, the panel's Republican leaders urged Tuberville to drop his blockade-which he refused to do. Last month, Pentagon officials testified on the legality of the regulation. In the course of the hearing, they pointed out that the Justice Department pays for prisoners to travel across state lines in order to obtain abortions, noting that it would send quite the signal to deny the same right to women who have taken an oath to fight and die for their country.\n\nThere is one way to override Tuberville's obstruction: The Senate could call a roll-call vote on each of the 273 promotions. However, Senate aides of both parties estimate that this would take about 700 hours of floor time. Or Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer could call votes on just the nominees for the handful of senior posts. But he and other Democrats have decided not to do this for two reasons. First, it would alienate rank-and-file members of the military to give exemptions to the top brass while leaving their immediate commanders in the lurch. Second, it would create a dreadful precedent: Backbench senators would pull this stunt over and over again if they knew that that the leaders would respond by calling a handful of votes for the most high-profile officers or officials and thus lessen the damage.\n\nMeanwhile, Tuberville is making no friends among his colleagues with these tactics. A Senate Republican aide told me, \"We all agree this is something that needs to be resolved sooner rather than later.\" They have avoided putting the screws on Tuberville-say, threatening to take away his committee appointments, killing some major project in his district-because they are afraid of offending the GOP base, much of which agrees with Tuberville on abortion policy, and of offending Donald Trump.\n\nTuberville won the 2020 primary for his Senate seat, even though he'd lived for only a short time in Alabama (his primary residence was listed as Florida) and despite a financial scandal with a hedge fund that he co-founded (his partner was indicted for fraud), entirely because of Trump's enthusiastic endorsement. In the general election, he handily defeated the Democrat, Doug Jones, who had barely won a special election in 2017 after the Republican candidate, Roy Moore , was accused of sexual assaulting a minor.\n\nAt least some Republicans know that opposing legal abortions, cuddling up with Trump, and alienating the military are hardly the shrewdest ways to win general elections. But for now they're choosing to ignore all the alarm bells.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Hidden Damage GOP Sen. Tommy Tuberville Is Currently Inflicting Upon the Military\n\nThe current political impasse over military nominations will result in not just an operational crisis but a cultural one.\n\nSince February, Alabama's Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville has held the process of hiring and promoting military personnel hostage to protest the Pentagon's decision to pay for out-of-state travel for service members seeking abortions. As a result, for 21 days now, the United States Marine Corps has been without a commandant, the title of the top military officer in that branch. It's the first time since 1910 the Corps has lacked its commandant, an epic event that has made headlines in part because of its political motive.\n\nIt's no wonder that on Thursday, President Joe Biden attacked Tuberville's \"extreme political agenda\" in a speech at the Truman Civil Rights Symposium that emphasized the blockade's risk to America's \"immense national security challenges.\"\n\nBut the obvious truth is the Marine Corps appears to be doing just fine without a top officer. Anyone with government experience understands that major agencies, including military branches, are often run by senior officials below the \"face\" of the organization: chiefs of staff who do the behind-the-scenes work while the secretary or senator or bureau chief smiles for the cameras. It can be tempting to wonder if a military branch really needs its commandant, if a helmless Marine Corps really is a crisis.\n\nI am here to tell you: It absolutely is.\n\nAsked about the impact of not having a commandant confirmed by the normal Senate process, acting Commandant Gen. Eric Smith said it was \"not ideal,\" coded language for anyone who knows the understatement typical among top military brass for \"total disaster.\" He went on to note the \"ripple effect\" of the anomaly all the way down the line for the entire Corps.\n\nHe's not kidding. The old axiom \"the fish rots from the head\" is more true in the military than in many other institutions. Militaries are famously hierarchical. Officers take their cues from their seniors, who set the organizational culture, passing the values of the service down to their noncommissioned officers, who in turn instill it in the enlisted corps-the workforce who carries out the day-to-day operations of a successful military. This culture doesn't encompass only things that affect the job of the military-work ethic, commitment to operational excellence, and attention to detail-but also life in the military: how personnel treat one another, how they face personal adversity, and how they live together in the unique community that is any military installation, from the biggest domestic base to the smallest combat outpost overseas.\n\nAnd in the intensely hierarchical environment of the military, this culture flows from the top-from the very top. From the commandant.\n\nTake a look at Gen. David Berger, the outgoing Marine Corps commandant, and his service planning guidance . In it, he sets the tone for the Corps' big-picture direction, how the force will be equipped and postured, how it will fight wars, and how it trains its personnel to win. But the guidance also covers the organization's essential humanity, recognizing that a military service is a collection of people, a community, and how that community functions when it's not working is just as important as how it functions when it's hitting the beach under heavy fire. Berger succinctly but comprehensively addresses the Corps' core values of honor, courage, and commitment, defining the terms as more than buzzwords. He stresses the importance of tackling the scourges of sexual assault, drug use, and hazing that continue to dog the military. Berger underscores this with a directness worth quoting in full:\n\nLeaders must ensure Marines are well-led and cared for physically, emotionally, and spiritually, both in and out of combat. \"Taking care of Marines\" means vigorously enforcing our high standards of performance and conduct, it does not mean relaxing the standard. When we fail to hold the standard, we establish new lower standards. Elite organizations do not accept mediocrity and they do not look the other way when teammates come up short of expectations. We must hold each other accountable.\n\nNot just performance: conduct . Taking care of one another.\n\nDuring my time in the Coast Guard, our Commandant Adm. Robert Papp continuously emphasized the concept of \" servant leadership ,\" a cornerstone of the culture he sought to impart to his officer corps. I was incredibly fortunate to have Papp visit my unit when I led the Reserves at U.S. Coast Station New York during his tenure. Servant leadership is a popular concept, and a lot of ink has been spilled on it, but Papp's visit was a rare opportunity for me to understand what the term specifically meant for him and, more importantly, his expectations for how company-grade officers like me should implement his vision throughout the entire service. I cramped my wrist taking furious notes during his brief remarks.\n\nTo Papp, servant leadership meant that you work for the people who report to you. It meant that you recognized that the people you led, not you, made the guard function. It meant that you should be the last to eat and go to sleep. It meant that you should be the last person to stop work each day. It meant that you should be visible to everyone you outranked as doing the work to the utmost. Most importantly, it meant that the well-being of every person under your command, not just professionally but personally, was your top priority. The mental and physical health of your coast guards are your responsibility-not in a way that pries into lives, but rather in a way that ensures that people have the resources they need to support themselves. It was on leaders to relentlessly communicate the availability of these resources, and to create a culture in which accessing them was not stigmatized.\n\nThis degree of detail and nuance became critical to how I led, and to how my colleagues led, throughout our service careers. We took seriously the responsibility to convey that culture to our chief petty officers, the senior-enlisted coast guards who set the tone for the service all the way down, tasking junior personnel and managing up to company-grade officers like myself.\n\nIt came from the commandant. He set the standard. Without that leader in place, that message gets diffused across multiple senior leaders, each with even slightly differing expectations, or it gets vested in an acting leader on whose term lower-level officers can't rely, knowing they will quickly be replaced as soon as the political crisis passes. Right now this is the state of things in the Marines, and a different message must be getting relayed: confusion.\n\nMuch of the criticism directed at Tuberville's nomination holds has centered on military readiness and national security , and that is absolutely correct, but the holds' effects on culture and community, with impacts on job satisfaction, quality of life, and the corresponding ripples through recruiting and retention, sit at the heart of the military. I am confident this impasse will eventually resolve. But in the meantime, service members will be left waiting for the realization of acting Commandant Smith's words to the force at Berger's retirement ceremony: \"Further guidance to the force will follow.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "What Tommy Tuberville's Former Auburn Players Think of His  Alabama Senate Run\n\nTommy Tuberville, the Republican candidate for Senate in Alabama, is leading incumbent Sen. Doug Jones by 14 points in the polls. The highly watched race has attracted huge outside spending, and pundits have speculated about what it might take for the country's most vulnerable senator to hold onto his seat. But the reality is the race can be boiled down to two of Alabama's favorite things: Trump and football.\n\nTuberville has clung close to President Donald Trump throughout the campaign. Trump endorsed Tuberville in the primary over Jeff Sessions-Trump's former attorney general and an Alabama senator from 1997 to 2017.  In return, Tuberville has said that his number one priority was \"taking that stick out of [Trump's] hand and giving [him] a baseball bat.\" He has also promoted birtherism, complained bitterly about environmentalists , said immigrants were bringing \"drugs\" and \"diseases,\" and stoked fear about the socialist and communist \" indoctrination \" of the education system.\n\nTuberville has never held elected office, but he gained fame in the state from nearly a decade as head coach of the Auburn Tigers. In 2004, Tuberville led the team to a 13-0 season and an SEC championship. He also led Auburn to six straight victories over the University of Alabama in its longest winning streak against the in-state rival. (Remarkably, Crimson Tide fans do not seem to hold this against him .) Jones' campaign has attacked Tuberville's team loyalty (highlighting one story from Tuberville's time as coach of Texas Tech, when he ditched a dinner with recruits after getting offered a job at Cincinnati). Tuberville, meanwhile, has continued to cite his leadership experience as a coach, and his outsider status, as the reason he should represent the state.\n\nTo get a better sense of how Coach Tuberville could translate to Sen. Tuberville, Slate spoke with four of his former Auburn players to hear what they make of his turn to a Trump-loving politician. Their answers have been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nSlate: Were you surprised Tommy Tuberville ran for Senate?\n\nPrechae Rodriguez (played 2005 to 2007): I was really surprised. Because he had his fair share of coaching, and I thought he was going to be a [football] analyst.\n\nSpencer Johnson (2000-2003): Honestly, I didn't see it coming. I'm not a Trump supporter. So I was a little disappointed to see that Coach Tuberville had aligned himself with those beliefs. But I don't know if I was completely surprised by it. Just because of where Tubs is, financially. So aligning with big businesses and stuff like that, I can see from that standpoint.\n\nAdlai Trone (1996-1999): I'm not surprised. I know at some point he had considered running for some other offices. His name has rung in the political world for a couple of years. It's a big jump, but I'm not surprised at all.\n\nTommy Jackson (2002-2005): All I could think is, why?\n\nWhy do you think he's doing this?\n\nJackson: In terms of power, popularity, social capital-what's beyond being a head football coach at Auburn University in the state of Alabama, in the Southeastern Conference? Running for public office. To me, this is a power grab.\n\nRodriguez: Most athletes usually just play ball, and after that it's just retire and invest your money. Being a professional athlete, [you can] use that tool to be involved in the community. Provide to society in another way. So it's the same thing with Tuberville: he has more to offer to society. And that's getting into politics and making changes.\n\nWhat do you think about his decision to align himself with Trump?\n\nRodriguez: I'll be honest. I didn't really know what [party] he was representing. He coached multicultural kids. I would have thought it was gonna be on the Democratic side. You have knowledge of these kids' backgrounds, where they come from. You sit in their homes and see their circumstances. But with him going on the Republican side, and backing in what Trump is trying to do, it's raised a level of concern. And it makes me want to do my own research on what he is advocating.\n\nTrone: I'm disappointed, because he did come into everyone's living rooms and have this personal connection with everyone when they were young, and they weren't aware of what his political beliefs might be. I think it'll be interesting to know what things that Trump has said or done that he does not agree with. I would be curious to know that.\n\nJohnson: That's the part that disappointed me the most. Just knowing who Tubs was, and knowing that a lot of these kids that he recruited, including myself, were minority kids that came from areas that weren't privileged.\n\nJackson: It's very disingenuous. He coached a team that had a majority of African American players. And President Trump has no interest in Black males. And so for Coach Tuberville to support someone like that-what does that say about somebody who has always thought this way to make millions of dollars off the same people the president is intending to overlook or mistreat? It's shameful. It's downright shameful.\n\nHave you talked to other former players about this?\n\nJohnson: At Auburn, we have a really close-knit group of guys. We talk about every issue. So there's been conversations. I've got a few guys that do agree with Tuberville and support him. And there's a majority of the guys who I deal with that don't. When you talk about Donald Trump, of course some of the guys that are African Americans don't take kindly or don't agree with those particular sentiments.\n\nTrone: A lot of guys keep up with each other. There's lot of different circles. It's the majority that are disappointed. I think a lot of us would like to remain optimistic in saying that maybe if he gets in office, he'll listen to what we have to say. I just hope he stands for something that represents the players that played hard for him.\n\nAre there particular qualities he had as a coach that are relevant to his ability as a senator ?\n\nRodriguez: As a head coach, at that level, there's a lot of pressure. Everyone's criticizing from all angles. There's the naysayers, the critics. You're heavily scrutinized. Everything you do is watched really carefully. And you have to take the blame and fall for a lot of stuff.\n\nTrone: He knows how to place his words in the right place. He knows how to handle the camera, and he knows how to handle a general conversation. He's got a good personality. He held himself accountable. He took problems and accepted responsibility. He knew how to delegate. He had a vision of what the end goal is. And he'd do everything in his might to make sure to get to that goal. That's the type of leader that he was. So [putting aside] politics, just as a person: yeah, I liked the guy. But those [the person and the politician] are two different people.\n\nSometimes we look at him and say, OK, is this Coach Tuberville? And it's like, nah, that's not Coach Tuberville. So it's kind of confusing to us, as well.\n\nJackson: He was smart and let the people around him do the work. And I think that's also an indictment on what he would do in the Senate. If you're going to leave it to all your coaches pretty much all the time to do the work, that's a problem.\n\nJohnson: It's tough for me to take what I've seen from him as a football coach and put into the realm of politics. Yes, you have to be able to recruit and do things like that. But my issue is that I honestly don't think he's qualified to do the job.\n\nWhat do you think of the idea of a former football coach representing Alabama in the Senate?\n\nJackson: Football has never just been a game. It's the only way you can force a racist to actually cheer for a Black man. Football is powerful. In the South, in particular. So you've got a coach who is truly ill-prepared to be a senator. Yet he is polling well. Are you kidding me? I don't want some guy talking about football making decisions about what should be done with federal dollars.\n\nThis is a very serious job, this isn't something that you don't just decide to do. It's concerning. And a lot of people have begun making the decision to vote for him based on him being a former football coach. I'm a guy that played for him: He wouldn't get my vote.\n\nTrone: Politics can [turn into] into a popularity contest to a certain extent. And the state of Alabama is a popular place for college football. When you think of Alabama, that's probably the first thing that comes to your mind. And it's sad, but it's true. I just pray that we don't get lost in college football.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Democrats Should Absolutely, 100 Percent Try to Get Nick Saban to Run for Senate\n\nNick Saban has no apparent reason to run for political office and several reasons not to. But in the next few years, Democrats in Alabama will have no choice but to put relentless pressure on the recently retired University of Alabama football coach to do so. Maybe, they'll need to hope, he will get bored enough in retirement to consider it, or maybe he can be browbeaten into feeling the insatiable itch of public service.\n\nOver two weeks in late January, pollsters from the market research firm YouGov surveyed 532 registered voters in Alabama and found Saban narrowly leading Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville, himself a former college football coach at Auburn, in a hypothetical matchup for Senate in 2026. The polling group, which shared its data with Slate, found Saban leading with 42 percent of the vote to 39 percent. The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 4.9 percent, meaning it's best to think of Saban and Tuberville as tied, the pollster said.\n\nSaban's competitive posture against Tuberville is in stark contrast to how other Democrats fare. Former Sen. Doug Jones trails Tuberville 52 percent to 27 percent, a more expansive margin than Tuberville's 60-40 win over Jones in their 2020 race. (Jones was quite popular in Alabama for a Democrat, but to win his seat , he needed to run against an accused sexual abuser , Roy Moore.) YouGov also polled Tuberville against a \"generic Democrat\" and found the Republican leading with 49 percent of the projected vote to the generic Dem's 32 percent. Only Saban was competitive. No candidates have yet announced a run to challenge Tuberville.\n\n\"Nick Saban looks like an extremely valuable recruit that Democrats should be considering carefully in this race,\" John Ray, the polling director of YouGov Blue, the Democratic political research division that set up the survey, told me. \"I base that on the clear signs of his strong personal constituency and on his relatively strong performance compared to others who Democrats might be considering.\"\n\nThe first step, of course, is the unlikely one of getting Saban to do it. When the most accomplished coach in college football history retired in January, he had an eye toward getting a respite from the grueling grind of his profession. But even now, he has plenty on his plate. Saban just joined ESPN , where he'll get paid well to go on TV a few times a week. A member of multiple exclusive country clubs, Saban plays to a 10.6 handicap index in golf and no doubt would like to get himself into the single digits. He co-owns a Ferrari dealership. Alabama even claims he'll maintain a presence around the football program, ostensibly to smooth the transition to new coach Kalen DeBoer. What's more, Saban has sometimes tried to paint himself as the opposite of politically engaged. The day after the 2016 election, he said he \"didn't even know yesterday was Election Day.\" After that caused a stir, Saban said that he'd voted absentee .\n\nBut Saban has indicated over the years that he does care about professional politics and is at least a little bit-emphasis on \"a little bit\"-of a Democrat. The former coach, a native West Virginian, is a longtime friend of retiring Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin and endorsed him in his 2018 reelection. In 2022 Saban signed a letter urging Manchin to help pass voting rights protections, though Saban later clarified by way of a media leak that he did not support going around the filibuster. Saban said last year that college football players should be unionized and explained to an interviewer , \"General Motors and the automotive industries had unions for a long time and they survived fairly well.\" Saban is a registered voter in Alabama, but the secretary of state's office doesn't list a party affiliation . Saban's agent, Jimmy Sexton, did not reply to emailed questions about whether Saban would have any interest in running or under which party affiliation.\n\nHowever slight, Saban's leanings were enough that his retirement prompted immediate Democratic wondering and wish-casting, including from the state party : Could the seven-time national champion be persuaded to challenge Tuberville, turning the 2026 Senate race into a coaching rematch of the Iron Bowl? Probably not. As Manchin put it : \"You can put that out of your mind, because Nick won't run. He would never run.\"\n\nStill: Democrats should make the pitch anyway, then make it again. When Tuberville ran, he demonstrated that a Republican in Alabama could win a Senate seat with two things: some name recognition from a coaching career and an endorsement from Donald Trump. Saban wouldn't have the latter, but he built up striking popularity via the former. YouGov found that 81 percent of Alabamian registered voters have a favorable view of Saban, with 58 percent describing their view of him as \"very favorable.\" Trump's overall favorability is 58 percent, Tuberville's is 49 percent, and Joe Biden's is 33 percent. Current Auburn head coach Hugh Freeze is at 30 percent. Auburn legend Charles Barkley is at 62 percent.\n\nSaban is comfortably the most popular figure in Alabama public life. For now, that makes up for his status as a Democrat in a state full of Republicans. He leads Tuberville 75 percent to 6 percent among Democrats. Saban also has a 41-25 lead among independents. Tuberville's lead among Republicans is 65 percent to 23 percent. That kind of crossover vote for Saban is consistent with a finding that 17 percent of Tuberville voters in his 2020 race against Jones say they'd pick Saban over Tuberville today.\n\nThat Saban would enjoy a personal advantage over Tuberville, notwithstanding their political parties, is unsurprising. Just about everyone in Alabama roots for either Saban's Crimson Tide or Tuberville's Tigers. But by the time of his Senate election, Tuberville hadn't been the coach at Auburn for 12 years, and even during his career on the sidelines, he was unspectacular. Tuberville went 13-0 in 2004, a year when Auburn would've played for a national championship if USC and Oklahoma had not also had unbeaten seasons. But nearly every Auburn coach, including his two immediate successors, has had a year like that, and Tuberville found himself out of a job after a few years of mediocrity. He then coached and lived out of state before returning for his Senate campaign. Saban has loomed large in the state every day since Tuberville left. (Saban did recently buy beachfront property in Florida, though.)\n\nSaban's 10-point buffer ahead of a hypothetical \"generic\" Democrat caught Ray's attention. \"Typically, a generic candidate is a pretty good bellwether for the state,\" he said, \"and the fact that he overperforms to the degree that he does suggests that he has a strong personal constituency that he could capitalize on should he choose to run.\" For some rough napkin math, getting 10 percent more of the vote share in 2020 would've put Jones in a dead heat with Tuberville. And that year, Tuberville had Trump on the ballot to boost Republican turnout, something he won't have in 2026, a midterm cycle.\n\nBut the case against Saban is easy to make too. He is neck and neck with Tuberville right now, on the immediate heels of his retirement and at a time when almost nobody is saying anything negative about him. From the moment Saban entered the race, he would find himself bombarded with a Republican effort to tie him to the Democratic Party broadly. The GOP effort would be to get voters to forget about Saban's national championships and think more about Chuck Schumer.\n\n\"If he chose to take on a race of this level of attention, it's clear his opponents would try to make him seem like just another Democrat to the extent possible,\" Ray said. \"And the data suggests that if they were successful, that would hurt his candidacy.\"\n\nThat can't sound appetizing to Saban, who could (and almost certainly will) instead spend the next two and a half years playing golf, traveling, and doing TV spots. It may not even appeal to Democrats who are exasperated by Manchin's voting behavior and think Saban would be a redux.\n\nBut given the near impossibility of any other Democrat contending for Tuberville's seat or any other statewide office in Alabama, those in the state party may want to bug Saban about running until he files a restraining order. If they can't press an altruistic case, they could note that at the very least, being Alabama's senator can't be more chaotic than being Alabama's football coach. If Saban enjoyed beating Auburn coaches in his old industry, there's one field out there in which he could try to do it again. This one carries more fundraising responsibilities than running the Crimson Tide, but only marginally.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The GOP Is in Full-Blown Crisis Mode After the Alabama IVF Ruling\n\nA preview of this story was featured in the Surge, Slate's weekly newsletter about all the most important political nonsense. Subscribe now !\n\nTo the fellas in the Republican Party: Are we having fun yet with post- Dobbs reproductive rights policy? As was not unexpected after Dobbs , a state Supreme Court (Alabama's in this case) has determined that frozen embryos have personhood rights , prompting the state's largest hospital to halt IVF treatments for fear of legal repercussions. This is a fully insane situation. The vast majority of everyone supports access to IVF as practiced.\n\nBut-but but but!-this is the sort of outcome you will get when you enshrine into law that personhood begins at the moment of fertilization, and that's a litmus test for many Republican candidates. And so, over the past week, we've seen them tripping all over their own faces trying to discuss the decision. Here's Nikki Haley last week in her cleanup effort , fumbling, blind, for oxygen: \"I didn't say that I agreed with the Alabama ruling. What the question that I was asked is, 'Do I believe an embryo is a baby?' I do think that if you look in the definition, an embryo is considered an unborn baby.\" In the course of a single conversation, meanwhile, Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville said he was \"all for\" the ruling, then said the pause on IVF treatments in Alabama was \"really hard\" and that we \"need more kids.\" Then he diverted to \"I'd have to look at the entire bill, how it's written\" (what bill?) and finally landed on: \"This is a state issue.\" Yeah, no kidding!\n\nOther politicians who had a hard time responding to this news included Sen. Tim Scott, who dodged the issue with a simple \"Well, I haven't studied the issue,\" despite the fact that he, like Tuberville, co-sponsored Rand Paul's 2021 \"personhood bill,\" which would have likely banned IVF.\n\nRepublicans in the House also had a hard time responding to the matter thanks to their own \" Life at Conception Act ,\" which has 124 co-sponsors and no carve-out for IVF. House Rep. Nancy Mace, one of the co-sponsors, pinned a tweet declaring that she would \"stop any and all efforts to ban IVF.\" (The tweet comes with a contextual note from readers that clarifies that she ... is a co-sponsor of an act with no carve-out for IVF.) The Democratic opposition research machine is fully whirring as campaign season rolls around. When Michigan Senate candidate Mike Rogers stated that he opposes \"any and all efforts to restrict access to IVF- period ,\" his rival, Elissa Slotkin, pointed to four bill s he co-sponsored that threatened IVF.\n\nSome Republicans tried to go the more personal route. Reps. Michelle Steel and David Schweikert, both co-sponsors of the Life at Conception Act-which is still in committee and has not had a hearing-spoke of IVF helping their own families. \"IVF allowed me, as it has so many others, to start my family,\" Steel tweeted on Thursday . \"My wife and I struggled for years to have children,\" Schweikert wrote Friday . Both faced accusations of caring about reproductive freedom only as it affected them.\n\nOther Republicans attempted to frame IVF as a pro-life issue, sometimes awkwardly. Florida Rep. Byron Donalds, speaking on Meet the Press on Sunday, tried to imitate Donald Trump, who wrote on social media , \"We want to make it easier for mothers and fathers to have babies, not harder!\" But what he actually managed to say was that IVF is important to couples because \"it helps them breed great families.\" Who doesn't want to \"breed\" a great family? \"Our country needs that,\" he added.\n\nThe Republican party knows this is bad-to the point where the Senate Republicans' campaign group sent a memo to its candidates on Friday instructing them to \"align with the public's overwhelming support for I.V.F. and fertility treatments.\" As the memo noted, 85 percent of all respondents in the group's polling support increased access to fertility treatments, and even 83 percent of evangelical Christians support IVF. Candidates were instructed in the memo to support IVF without equivocation and to reject \"any efforts\" to restrict access. It's no wonder that Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson , went out of their way in their messaging to avoid being tagged the anti-IVF party . It would be a political death knell.\n\nBut Republicans saying that they absolutely adore IVF won't get Democrats off their case just yet. Those who say they support-want to expand, even!-access to IVF procedures as well as broadly worded legislation determining that life begins at conception are in a contradictory position. All eyes will be on the Alabama Legislature, which has promised to take action to ensure the legality of IVF procedures, to see what sort of exception it carves out. Until the Republican Party can determine that path forward, their tongues will remain tied.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Blockhead Football Coach Elected Alabama Senator Says Blockhead Things About Non-Football Topics Like History, Government\n\nAlabama elected former Auburn football coach Tommy Tuberville to the Senate 10 days ago precisely because he keeps it simple: Trump good, not-Trump bad. The state is, of course, overwhelmingly Republican and, since 2016, even more fevered in its support of President Donald Trump. So much so that former Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions-literally one of the original Trumpsters-was deemed not Trumpy enough anymore. So, when shopping around for candidates, it seems safe to say, most people in the state weren't looking for a nuanced understanding of history, the country, or how its government works-they were looking for a blockhead that Trump could step on to elevate himself. And in \"Coach\" Tommy Tuberville, Alabama Republicans got exactly what they were looking for .\n\nIn an interview with Alabama Daily News Wednesday, Tuberville showed a football coach's understanding of history and the American system of governance. Tuberville fumbled when discussing America's three branches of government (kind of a biggie) and the origins of World War II (also not small) before going on to stumble through ethics rules of the job and ultimately rounding it out with a grand football analogy equating the filibuster to a two-minute drill in the dying moments of a football game.\n\n\" Yeah and that's how our government was set up,\" Tuberville said in response to a question about a politically divided Congress. \"You know, our government wasn't set up for one group to have all three of branches of government. It wasn't set up that way, our three branches, the House, the Senate and executive.\" The House and Senate are, of course, part of the same legislative branch of government, with the other two branches being the executive and judiciary.\n\nA daily email update of the stories you need to read right now.\n\nWhen asked about what signal voters sent in this election, Tuberville didn't really answer the question, but did note that he is very concerned because Joe Biden is a socialist. \"Coach\" then goes on to misunderstand the origins of World War II-[ cough ] [ cough ] Nazism-saying that it was, you guessed it, about ridding the world of socialism, kinda like Joe Biden.\n\nI look at it and I see what country I grew up in and what it's meant and the direction that we were going, and it's concerning to me that a guy can run for president of the United States and have an opportunity to win when he leans more to a Socialist type of government. ... And that's concerning to me that we're to the point now where we've got almost half the country voting for something that this country wasn't built on. Very concerning and, you know, as I tell people, my dad fought 76 years ago in Europe to free Europe of Socialism. Today, you look at this election, we have half this country that made some kind of movement, now they might not believe in it 100 percent, but they made some kind of movement toward socialism. So we're fighting it right here on our own soil. We've got to decide, you know, over the years which direction we're going, and that part's concerning to me.\n\nThen there are comparatively smaller matters that the old football coach hasn't gotten straight yet, like the ethics of the office.\n\nMembers of Congress aren't allowed to do fund raising in federal buildings  Somebody better tell Tubby. pic.twitter.com/pv5K9HMctK\n\nBut, to be clear, Tommy Tuberville is a football coach, which is a good metaphor for everything in life.\n\n\"Senate rules. House rules. It's pretty unique,\" Tuberville said of learning the Senate's procedures. \"The filibuster rules and stuff like that of how you can really slow the progress of something that you don't like. I don't care if everybody else likes it in the Senate, you can actually slow it down. You might not be able to beat at the end of the day, but there's a there's a lot of little things, just like a football game. You know, how you slow down the clock, how to run the clock in a two minute drill. And it's no different. It's just the fundamentals of the little things.\"\n\nIt's just the fundamentals of the little things.\n\nYou tell 'em, Coach.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Jeff Sessions' Political Career Is Over\n\nFormer Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who represented Alabama in the U.S. Senate for 20 years, will not be returning to his old seat.* He lost a runoff for the Republican Senate nomination on Tuesday night to former Auburn football coach Tommy Tuberville in a blowout. Tuberville will go on to face Democratic Sen. Doug Jones in November. Sessions will go nowhere. His political career is over because President Donald Trump will be forever mad at him for recusing himself from, and not covering up, the Russia investigation in 2017.\n\nSessions' return bid was painful to watch from the opening statement. After Trump humiliated Sessions nearly daily while he was attorney general and then fired him the morning after the 2018 midterm elections, Sessions introduced himself as a Senate candidate with fulsome praise of the president and his agenda, and a reiteration of his loyalty.\n\nTrump kept his mouth shut through the opening round of the primary, recognizing that the first priority was ensuring that banned mall patron Roy Moore didn't make it into the runoff. As soon as the contest headed to a runoff between Tuberville and Sessions, the president endorsed Tuberville and tweeted biliously against his former top legal official, who had been the first sitting senator to have endorsed him in 2016. Sessions finally began defending his honor against the president, occasionally, in May. It didn't matter. Tuberville was up by about 20 points when the runoff campaign began and won by about 20 points.\n\nAnd that was about the whole campaign, really. Tuberville ran ads about how Trump didn't like Sessions; Sessions ran ads calling Tuberville not a True Conservative. Aspersions, either directly or indirectly, about each other's manliness were mutually cast. Tuberville's argument won out. Tuberville refused to debate, and his strategy of running out the clock on a lead worked.\n\nSessions went from an early, prominent Trump insider to a prized bug for Trump to squash because he was never in on the joke. He thought the whole Trump thing was about policy. In Trump, Sessions saw a vessel for the right-wing populist views that had made him a fringe actor within the Senate Republican conference, namely opposition to immigration of all varieties. Sessions thought Trump cared-like, really cared -about these things. Instead, he used them to acquire power and put Sessions in charge of the Justice Department primarily to shield him from threats to that power. If Sessions wanted to eliminate DACA while he was at Justice? Well yes, sure. But not after voluntarily ceding his power to protect Trump from an FBI investigation. Sessions got his dream job because he was loyal to Trump and then lost job, career, and dignity because, for a moment, he acted according to federal ethics. No need for a memoir either, Jeff. Everyone saw it.\n\nElsewhere Tuesday night, in the grand chess match that is American politics: The Senate Democratic establishment (BOO! HISS!) is poised to run the table this cycle, shepherding each candidate it wanted in competitive states through their respective primaries. Sara Gideon won the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate in Maine and will face Sen. Susan Collins in November. MJ Hegar is leading Royce West for the Texas Democratic Senate nomination, and would face Sen. John Cornyn in November. Former West Wing doctor Ronny \"Candyman\" Johnson is poised to win a GOP runoff for a Texas House seat, and our old pal Pete Sessions -no relation to the wretched Jeff-is on track to return to Congress from a new, more conservative Texas district than the suburban Dallas district in which he lost his 2018 reelection bid.\n\nCorrection, July 15, 2020: This post originally misstated how long Sessions served in the Senate. It was 20 years, not 22.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC. All rights reserved."

      "text": "Republican Sen. Tuberville doubles down on blocking military nominees despite GOP pleas\n\nIt's dangerous to play political games with military, Karine Jean-Pierre said.\n\nAlabama Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville said Thursday he is not backing down after his fiery battle with Republican colleagues on the Senate floor over his unprecedented move to hold up hundreds of military nominations and promotions.\n\nSenate Republicans, led by Sens. Dan Sullivan and Joni Ernst, on Wednesday night angrily challenged Tuberville in an all out Republican-on-Republican brawl on the floor, during which they held the floor for more than four hours as they repeatedly tried and repeatedly failed to get Tuberville to cave on his military holds -- his attempt to change Pentagon abortion policy. Republicans brought 61 military nominees up for individual consideration on the Senate floor Wednesday night. Tuberville spiked every single one.\n\nThe Senate on Thursday did confirm three military nominees using a process to circumvent Tuberville's hold. The process to confirm the nominees was underway before Wednesday's drama on the Senate floor. The Senate confirmed Lisa Franchetti to be Chief of Naval Operations, Gen. David W. Allvin to be Chief of Staff of the Air Force and Lt. Gen Christopher J. Mahoney to be Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps.\n\nOn Thursday, Tuberville doubled down, saying he \"works for the American people\" and speculated that many don't want their money to go toward service members' abortions. Tuberville has been holding military nominees for months over objection to a Department of Defense policy that allows service members to receive compensation to travel out of state for abortion, asserting that it is taxpayer-funded abortion and a violation of the Constitution.\n\n\"I've told you all along -- I hate I have to do this, but somebody has got to listen to us. I work for the people of this country; I don't work for another senator or a president -- I work for the tax payers of this country,\" he said at the Capitol Thursday.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuberville's actions are allowing for vacancies that are \"causing damage to our military readiness.\"\n\n\"The world is too dangerous to play political games with our military,\" she said during Thursday's White House press briefing.\n\nNational Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said in Thursday's White House press briefing that Tuberville's moves are \"beyond ridiculous\" and listed some of the crucial military positions that are vacant as a result of Tuberville's blockade.\n\nTuberville has maintained that his hold does not impact troop readiness.\n\nABC Senior Congressional Correspondent Rachel Scott asked Tuberville what his message was to his Republican colleagues who say that he's weakening the military by continuing to block confirmation of generals.\n\n\"They're wrong -- we've been doing this nine months, all of a sudden it's an emergency,\" Tuberville told Scott. \"We tend to drag our feet around a little bit, so I don't agree.\"\n\nTuberville was clear he will not be changing his position on military nominees despite growing frustration among his GOP colleagues about his methods. Scott asked him if he would consider budging, he was blunt: \"No.\"\n\nRepublicans were out in full force Thursday airing their frustration with Tuberville.\n\n\"Well I'm frustrated on behalf of the force,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said. \"The effect on the force is real, people are losing their slot ... and the ripple effect is going to the lower ranks.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Sullivan was defiant, sarcastic and even sullen in his pleas to Tuberville. At times, Sullivan was livid. One after one, Republicans raised specific military nominees, reading off impressive lists of credentials and then asking for consent for their confirmation. One after one, Tuberville stood on the floor and blocked them.\n\n\"As a U.S. Marine Corps colonel, I know we all know here in the Senate, America needs to have our best players, most combat-capable leaders on the field, and right now that's not happening,\" Sullivan said. \"It needs to change.\"\n\nThe Republican senators who challenged Tuberville Wednesday night were especially frustrated that the Alabama senator blocked the nominees as they were being brought up individually. For months, Tuberville has blocked Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer from advancing military nominees en bloc, but Tuberville had previously said he wouldn't object to votes on individual nominees.\n\n\"We have done the best we can to honor the request of a fellow senator that these nominations be brought to the floor and voted on individually,\" Ernst said. \"I really respect men of their word. I do not respect men who do not honor their word.\"\n\nWhile unanimous confirmation requisitions like the ones made Wednesday night aren't quite the same as individual Senate votes, which could in theory take several days to clear, Senate Republicans hoped this tactic would be the dam break they needed.\n\nIt wasn't. Tuberville blocked every single nominee.\n\n\"I cannot simply sit idly by while the Biden administration injects politics in our military from the White House and spends taxpayer dollars on abortion,\" Tuberville said on the floor.\n\nWednesday night's debacle was a rare moment of Republican infighting on full display on the Senate floor, and speaks to the palpable frustration the Republican conference has with Tuberville for his nine-month blockade.\n\nErnst, leaving the floor at the end of the night warned that Tuberville's move Wednesday night would have consequences: \"This will be remembered. This will be a dark evening,\" Ernst said.\n\nIt's not expected to be the last either. After trying and failing to confirm the 61st military officer of the evening, Sullivan vowed he would continue his efforts to bring nominees up for individual consideration.\n\n\"My message to our generals and admirals who are being held up: hang in there. Some of us have your back -- we have your back, we will be coming here every night to try to get you guys confirmed,\" Sullivan said.\n\n\"...You deserve it and our nation has to have it,\" Sullivan added.\n\nSen. Jack Reed, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee who has for months been trying to find a way around Tuberville's hold, was presiding over the chamber when Sullivan concluded his remarks for the night. He later called Tuberville's unwillingness to allow nominees to be confirmed an act of \"willful ignorance or stubborn hubris.\n\n\"After tonight, one has to wonder why Senator Tuberville persists in his obstruction, which only benefits America's enemies,\" Reed said in a statement. \"Over the last ten months Senator Tuberville has undermined our military readiness and callously mistreated military families.\"\n\nReed applauded the Republican senators who tried to get nominees confirmed Wednesday night.\n\nMost of Tuberville's Republican colleagues have said they agree with his position on the Pentagon's abortion policy, but not his tactics.\n\n\"I'm as pro-life as they come, I strongly disagree with what Secretary [Lloyd] Austin and President [Joe] Biden have done with their politicization of the military on a whole host of fronts including the abortion policy,\" Sullivan said.\n\nBut Republicans are fed up with Tuberville's blockade on nominees, who they say should not be punished for the policy decisions of the administration.\n\n\"Our service members have been failed by their commander in chief and we must do right by them and the security and protection of our own nation,\" Ernst said.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Schumer Schumer earlier Wednesday announced intentions to support a Reed-authored proposal that would allow the Senate to temporarily circumvent Tuberville's hold and to confirm the more than 300 nominees Tuberville is now preventing from going through.\n\nDetails of that resolution aren't quite clear yet, and it will need to go through the Senate Rules Committee to determine the threshold of votes it would need to pass.\n\nThe Thursday confirmations are part of a procedural tool to force votes on individual nominees. Schumer had been reluctant to use this tool to overcome Tuberville's holds over the last nine months because he's argued it risks playing to Tuberville's hand and politicizing the military.\n\nEven as frustration mounts with Senate Republicans, most ABC News spoke to Thursday morning are pushing back on a growing effort by Democrats to pass the temporary change to the Senate rules.\n\nSenate Republicans have been resistant in recent years to any sort of modification to the rules. This move, they say, would weaken the individual power of each senator. Rules that allow senators to hold certain nominees or policies make the chamber distinctly unique from the House.\n\nRepublicans warned on Thursday that if Democrats try to circumvent Tuberville by modifying the chamber rules, it could backfire on them down the line.\n\n\"I think it would be an extraordinary mistake to change the rules on holds, and that I would remind my Democratic colleagues that's a double-edged sword,\" Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said.\n\nSens. John Barrasso, R-Wyo.; John Cornyn, R-Texas; and Josh Hawley, R-Mo., all said they would also reject efforts to skirt the rule on nominee confirmation.\n\n\"I'm pretty reluctant to change the rules ...\" Hawley said. \"If we're going to change the rules, if we are going to depart from the tradition that we leave the rules as they are, then I have a whole bunch of rules I'd like to see changed so if we're going to do that, I'll have my own thoughts about what other rules we'd like to change.\"\n\nSchumer has been clear he will support it, and advance it to the Senate floor.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Tuberville once again blocks hundreds of military nominees, further digging in heels over DOD abortion policy\n\nSen. Tommy Tuberville blocked confirmation of over 300 nominees Thursday.\n\nThe Senate was gaveled out Thursday evening ahead of Veterans Day without confirming any of the more than 360 pending military nominees after Alabama Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville once again objected to the confirmation of each one due to the Department of Defense's abortion policies.\n\nThis is the second week in a row that Tuberville has been forced by other members of the body to stand on the Senate floor and object to military nominees being brought up for confirmation. This time, the effort to force confirmation of military nominees was led by Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, who over the course of more than an hour, asked the Senate to unanimously confirm each nominee one by one, only to be blocked each time by Tuberville.\n\nKaine, in floor remarks, invoked the upcoming holiday to urge Tuberville to find ways to address his concerns that don't punish non-political appointees.\n\n\"To be plain, none of these 364 have anything to do, any responsibility over the policy with which my colleague from Alabama finds significant disagreement,\" Kaine said.\n\nTuberville has been objecting to the confirmation of nominees over a Department of Defense policy that allows service members to be compensated for out-of-state travel to receive abortions. His hold has all but completely stopped military promotions nationwide for over nine months.\n\n\"This is a policy that is illegal and immoral. This is about life and it's also about the rule of law. It's about our Constitution. It's about whether we make laws at the Pentagon or whether we follow the constitution. This is also about the integrity of our military,\" Tuberville said on the floor. \"I cannot simply sit idly by while the administration injects politics in our military and spends taxpayer money on abortion.\"\n\nTuberville has objected to moving nominees as large groups, but he has said he won't prevent the Senate from moving nominees individually. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has always had the power to bring nominees up for consideration on a one-by-one basis, but he has be resistant to do so except for some high-profile nominees , citing concern about politicizing the military.\n\nKaine, following in the vein of a similar effort by Republican Sens. Joni Ernst and Dan Sullivan last week, tried to push Tuberville on this point in two separate days of floor actions. In both instances, the senators went to the Senate floor and tried to move nominees one by one, asking each time for the unanimous agreement of all 100 senators for their confirmation.\n\nThis proved to be insufficient for Tuberville, who said he wants the nominees moved through regular order.\n\nTension within the Republican conference over Tuberville's hold is beginning to bubble over. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has said repeatedly he does not endorse what Tuberville is doing, and many of his colleagues are beginning to challenge his move publicly.\n\nEarlier this week, Senate Republicans held a special conference to discuss possible off ramps with Tuberville. He left saying he'd take time to consider which of those options might appeal to him.\n\nRepublican senators, during the closed-door meeting, suggested Tuberville allow a select number of nominees to be cleared expeditiously, go to court to litigate his concerns, or wait on the upcoming National Defense Authorization Act to see whether the issue could be remedied legislatively, among a variety of other options.\n\nBut Tuberville's objections on the floor Thursday made clear he hasn't yet decided whether he's considering any of these alternatives.\n\n\"I'm going to keep my holds in place. If senators want to vote on these nominees one at a time, I'm all for it. But I will keep my holds in place until the Pentagon allows me the opportunity to negotiate this change of law,\" Tuberville said on the floor Thursday.\n\nKaine, following Tuberville's block of his 364 individual nomination requests, left the floor predicting that Tuberville will soon be forced to back down.\n\n\"It's bad internally and it sends a horrible message,\" Kaine said. \"I think we're getting near the place where the ice will break on this.\"\n\nThere is some evidence to suggest that he could be right. The Senate Rules committee is setting the stage for a Tuesday meeting to consider a resolution that would allow the Senate to temporarily circumvent Tuberville's hold. It's not clear whether that resolution would get enough Republican support, despite the growing frustration on both sides of the aisle.\n\nABC News' Mariam Khan contributed tot his report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Tommy Tuberville reverses his claim that white nationalists are unfairly labeled racist\n\n\"I'm not sure exactly what he was trying to say,\" a Republican colleague said.\n\nAlabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville on Tuesday said, simply and for the first time, that \"white nationalists are racists.\"\n\nThat remark to reporters marked a reversal from days of controversial comments to the contrary, which had drawn criticism from Democratic leaders and head-scratching from some of Tuberville's Republican colleagues.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, the senator told ABC News that white nationalists shouldn't all be labeled as \"racist\" while also insisting he opposes racism.\n\nTuberville, a former college football coach first elected in 2020 , had been pressed on his stance by ABC's Senior Congressional Correspondent Rachel Scott, who asked him, \"Can you explain why you continue to insist that white nationalists are American?\"\n\nScott was referring to commets Tuberville made first in May and then again earlier this week, after he was initially asked about military readiness and whether white nationalists should be able to serve.\n\n\"Listen, I'm totally against racism. And if Democrats want to say that white nationalists are racist, I'm totally against that, too,\" he told Scott on Tuesday, hours before changing his view.\n\n\"But that's not a Democratic definition,\" Scott said.\n\n\"Well that's your definition. My definition is racism is bad,\" Tuberville responded.\n\nScott followed up to say that the definition of a white nationalist is someone believing \"the white race is superior to all other races\" and asked, \"Do you believe that white nationalists are racist?\"\n\n\"Yes, if that's what a racist is, yes,\" he said.\n\nThe Associated Press defines the term as \"a subset of racist beliefs that calls for a separate territory and/or enhanced legal rights and protections for white people\" -- that is, a kind of nationalism defined by separating or excluding people by race.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Tuesday quickly denounced Tuberville's position.\n\n\"For the senator from Alabama to obscure the racist nature of white nationalism is indeed very, very dangerous,\" Schumer said. \"His words have power and carry weight with the fringe of his constituency -- just the fringe, but if that fringe listens to him, excusing ... white nationalism, he is fanning the flames of bigotry and intolerance.\"\n\n\"I urge my Republican colleagues to impress upon the senator from Alabama the destructive impact of his words and urge him to apologize,\" Schumer said.\n\nTuberville has repeatedly challenged the label of \"white nationalism,\" suggesting in interviews that he feels it is unfairly applied by Democrats and that the military, in particular, is wrongly focused on removing white nationalists from their ranks .\n\nDuring a local radio interview in May , Tuberville -- who has been blocking certain military nominations over his objections to a Pentagon policy on service member abortion access -- was asked about how that could affect military readiness.\n\nWhen he criticized \"Democrats ... saying we need to get out the white extremists, the white nationalists,\" he was then asked, \"Do you believe they should allow white nationalists in the military?\"\n\n\"Well, they call them that. I call them Americans,\" he said.\n\nHe went on to condemn \"extremists\" who overran the Capitol during Jan. 6 but also defended those people whom he said did not actually enter the complex and \"were true Americans that believe in this country.\"\n\nHe criticized a subsequent effort by the military to examine extremism in the ranks . Multiple active-duty service members and veterans have been convicted and sentenced for involvement in Jan. 6.\n\n\"Saying we're going to run out the white nationalists, people that don't believe how we believe .... that's not how we do it in this country,\" Tuberville said in May.\n\nHe later said on CNN that the point he was trying to make was narrower: \"Democrats portray all MAGA Republicans as white nationalists. That's not true, we got a lot of great people in the military that are MAGAs -- that's what I was talking about.\"\n\nIn a Monday appearance on CNN , Tuberville said there could be conflicting views on white nationalism.\n\n\"My opinion of a white nationalist, if someone wants to call them white nationalist, to me is an American,\" he said.\n\nBut he also said, \"If people think a white nationalist is a racist, I agree with that.\"\n\nSenate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., told ABC News on Tuesday that while he did not see the Tuberville appearance on CNN, he made clear that white nationalism has no home in the Republican Party.\n\n\"I'm not sure exactly what he was trying to say there, but ... I would just say there's no place for white nationalism in our party and I think that's kind of full stop,\" Thune said, before Tuberville reversed himself.\n\n\"I just think when you're throwing around terms like that, you have to be careful and cautious,\" Thune said, adding, \"We are not a racist country. We are not a racist party.\"\n\nThune did not commit to speaking to Tuberville directly about his comments, saying it was possible the Alabama lawmaker said \"probably something different than how it perhaps is being interpreted.\"\n\n\"Hopefully we'll get a better understanding of what it was he was trying to communicate,\" Thune said. \"But again, I just would say emphatically there's no place for that in the party.\"\n\nAsked about Schumer's call for Tuberville to apologize, Thune said that was about politics: \"It's playing right into Schumer's wheelhouse.\"\n\nTuberville, asked about Schumer, told reporters: \"He needs to apologize.\"\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, at his weekly press conference, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was asked to weigh in on Tuberville and said, \"White supremacy is simply unacceptable in the military and in our home country.\"\n\nMcConnell was not asked to respond to Tuberville's ongoing hold on military nominees, though he has said in the past that he opposes Tuberville's approach.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., said Americans will \"have to suck it up\" as President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency lay off hundreds of thousands of federal workers.\n\n\"There's going to be some tough times,\" Tuberville told ABC News' Diane Macedo when asked about DOGE's impact. \"We have to cut the fat out of out of spending in this country.\"\n\nTuberville also addressed Trump's tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, saying that \"there's going to be a little bit of pain\" as the move threatens to drive up prices on groceries, gas and more. \"But at the end of the day, if we don't do this, it's going to be much, much worse.\"\n\nHe also voiced his support for Trump's pause on all U.S. military aid to Ukraine, saying he hasn't \"voted for any money to go to it because Ukraine can't beat Russia.\"\n\n-ABC News' Jim Vojtech and David Merrell\n\nPresident Donald Trump will meet with a group of House Republican hard-liners Wednesday at 2 p.m. at the White House to discuss a path forward on government funding as the March 14 shutdown deadline approaches, two congressional sources and one White House official told ABC News.\n\nTrump and top GOP leaders have endorsed a \"clean\" short-term bill to fund the government until the end of September 2025. However, hard-liners typically despise continuing resolutions, and 34 opposed the short-term measure that's currently funding the government.\n\n-ABC News' Lauren Peller, Hannah Demissie and Katherine Faulders\n\nThe United States and Ukraine could sign the minerals deal as soon as Tuesday, according to two sources briefed on the discussions.\n\nThe deal was originally expected to be signed Friday at the White House, but talks quickly went downhill, and Trump kicked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy out of the White House without completing the agreement.\n\nSources caution that nothing is final. However, Trump has indicated to top advisers he would like to get the deal done before his joint address to Congress.\n\n-ABC News' Katherine Faulders and Molly Nagle\n\nSenate Democrats blasted President Donald Trump's first month in office ahead of his address to a joint session of Congress, gathering for a news conference on Tuesday while holding up photos of the guests they're bringing to the speech, including fired bureaucrats and others who have been negatively affected by the White House's moves to slash the federal workforce.\n\n\"We think one of the best ways to let the American people know how horrible Donald Trump's first 30 days have been is to bring those who have been affected, the victims of his malevolence, of his desire, the tax breaks for the billionaires and make Americans pay for it,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on the Senate steps.\n\n\"Americans who voted for the president didn't sign up for this. They wanted lower costs. ... What is the State of the Union, we ask? Chaos is up, corruption is up, and costs are up for regular people,\" Sen.

Tommy Tuberville said Hegseth would be \"great\" in the position.\n\nFollowing his meeting Monday with Secretary of Defense nominee Pete Hegseth, Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville told reporters Hegseth would be \"great\" for the position.\n\nTuberville said he didn't talk with Hegseth about his \"personal\" life on Monday, but later clarified that they indeed spoke on the phone about the misconduct allegations against Hegseth.\n\n\"I'm gonna leave the personal stuff between y'all and him whenever he has an opportunity to sit down with you and explain, you know, the allegations that you're all pushing out,\" Tuberville told reporters.\n\nIn 2017, Hegseth paid a settlement agreement to a woman who accused him of sexual assault, Tim Parlatore, an attorney for Hegseth, previously confirmed. Parlatore claimed Hegseth was the victim of \"blackmail\" and \"false claims of sexual assault,\" and said he paid the settlement only because he feared his career would suffer if her allegations were made public.\n\nAccording to a 22-page police report obtained by ABC News, Hegseth's accuser told police that he took her phone and blocked her from leaving his hotel room on the night of the incident.\n\nOn Sunday, the New Yorker published an investigation into Hegseth that alleged that \"a trail of documents, corroborated by the accounts of former colleagues, indicates that Hegseth was forced to step down by both of the two nonprofit advocacy groups that he ran -- Veterans for Freedom and Concerned Veterans for America -- in the face of serious allegations of financial mismanagement, sexual impropriety, and personal misconduct.\"\n\nThe New York Times published an email Friday that Hegseth's mother, Penelope Hegseth, sent him in 2018, saying he had routinely mistreated women for years. Penelope Hegseth confirmed the contents of the email to the New York Times in a phone interview, but said in the interview to the Times that she regretted her original sentiments expressed in the email and sent her son an immediate follow-up email expressing regret for what she had said.\n\nABC News has not independently confirmed the New Yorker or New York Times' reporting.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after their meeting, Tuberville praised Hegseth and sidestepped questions about his alleged pattern of misconduct.\n\n\"I've known him for a while. Pete's the type of guy that he's going to work. He's got a great work ethic. He's very, very smart. He understands the business side as well as the military side.\" Tuberville said. \"He's actually fought in wars. He is a good age too. Somebody that can relate to the young men and women that we need to recruit in the military.\"\n\nAsked if any of the allegations in the New Yorker article concerned him, Tuberville left the explanation up to Hegseth.\n\n\"Well, I'm gonna leave that to his explanation of all that. I can't comment on that,\" he said. \"Obviously, if it's to a certain degree, people are not going to vote to confirm it, but what I know when I talk to him about what I've read, what I've studied and been around him, I'll vote for him.\"\n\nAs Tuberville took question after question on Hegseth's allegations, he was asked if Hegseth needed to defend himself forcefully and provide an explanation to the American people.\n\n\"That's up to him,\" Tuberville said. \"Eventually he's gonna have to come out and start visiting with the media. I think, right now, his number one objective is to go out and and sell himself to you know, at least 51 or 52 Senators. That's the job he needs to do to get confirmed.\"\n\nTuberville mentioned a dozen of senators are meeting with Hegseth as a group Monday night, but he did not elaborate further.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Everybody else is completely released from me,\" Tuberville said. \"Other than that, it's over.\"\n\nMajority Leader Chuck Schumer called the confirmation of nominees \"good news.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, resolving this impasse took too long, risking our national security and throwing the lives of so many military families into discombobulation. I am glad this pointless and gravely damaging ordeal has finally, finally ended,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor.\n\nTuberville had been single-handedly holding up military nominees in protest of a Department of Defense policy that compensates service members for out-of-state travel to obtain abortions.\n\nSenior military officials, the White House and some Republicans have slammed Tuberville over his obstruction, stating it was undermining the country's military readiness.\n\nWhile his blockade yielded no change at the Pentagon, Tuberville said Tuesday has no regrets about the fight that he said he put up on behalf of the American taxpayer.\n\n\"We fought hard. We did the right thing for the unborn and for our military, fighting back against executive overreach and an abortion policy that's not legal,\" he argued. \"I think we opened their eyes a little bit. We didn't get the win that we wanted, we still got a bad policy, but we're proud to stand up for the taxpayers of this country.\"\n\nThe Pentagon welcomed Tuberville's decision, with spokesman Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder telling reporters that \"certainly we're encouraged by the news.\"\n\n\"We'll continue to stay engaged with Sen. Tuberville in the Senate directly to urge that all the holds on all our general flag officer nominations be lifted, to include those nominated for four-star,\" Ryder said.\n\nAsked what Tuberville had accomplished with his hold, Ryder referred questions back to the senator's office.\n\nTuberville's decision to back off his hold came as the Senate was preparing to vote on a resolution that would have allowed the chamber to side-step his blockade. While many Republicans were reluctant to vote to approve such a modification to the Senate rules, mounting frustration over the impasse meant Tuberville may well have been rolled by his own colleagues.\n\nTuberville had objected to the way issues regarding the Pentagon abortion policy were handled regarding the pending National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nThe House and Senate versions of the massive policy bill are currently being reconciled behind the scenes, and Tuberville took issue with what he said was a move to prevent the full conference of lawmakers from debating the Pentagon policy rule. He blamed Schumer for that.\n\nABC News' Mariam Khan and Luis Martinez contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Tuberville said he is \"100% behind\" Trump's remarks.\n\nSome of former President Donald Trump's closest Senate allies were out in force on Monday defending his comments over the weekend that even further call into question Trump's commitments to the United States' NATO allies.\n\nMultiple Republican senators backed Trump's remarks on Saturday that he'd \"encourage\" Russia to \"do whatever the hell they want\" to NATO-aligned countries that don't meet their financial obligations to the alliance.\n\nTrump's remarks echo his long-standing criticism of the role the U.S. plays in providing security for other countries -- including major allies. The former president's comments also come as he attempts to squash a foreign aid bill in the Senate that would provide billions of dollars more in support to Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan.\n\nSen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., a close Trump ally, said he's \"100% behind him\" in his push to get NATO countries to pay more money toward their self-defense.\n\nAsked how allied countries should feel about a potential invasion from Russia after Trump's remarks, Tuberville doubled down.\n\n\"I would be worried. I would be very worried. Especially if they don't have 2% of their GDP in defense. I mean you've got to be able to protect yourself -- we can't protect everybody,\" Tuberville said to ABC News. \"It's their country, they've got to defend it. We would love to help, but if you're not going to defend your own country, why should our taxpayers defend it for them?\"\n\nSen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., said allied nations that are concerned about Trump's comments need to \"get over it.\"\n\n\"They need to stand up and be tough. We need to secure our own border first. We need to take care of things here at home first. When we secure our own border and we take care of home, then great, let's help other people as well,\" Marshall said.\n\nMarshall said it was important not to \"overreact\" to Trump's comments.\n\nSen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, joined Marshall in saying Trump's remarks ought to be taken \"seriously, but not literally.\"\n\nBut Cornyn did add that he believes the United States should remain committed to the alliance.\n\n\"The message should be that the United States will live up to its treaty obligations no matter who is president,\" Cornyn said.\n\nSome Senate Republicans had more aggressive rebukes for Trump.\n\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., called it a \"mistake\" for Trump to so pointedly encourage Russia to have its way with other countries, even as he backed calls for NATO nations to meet their financial obligations.\n\n\"So I think it was very important what Trump was saying that they need to pay their fair share and they need to pay their way,\" Paul said. \"I think it was a mistake to say he would encourage Russia to attack them. I think that was a careless remark and shouldn't have been said.\"\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said on Sunday that Trump's comments were \"uncalled for.\"\n\nWhile NATO allies need to uphold their end of the bargain, Murkowski said, there's no need to be suggesting that the United States might throw its NATO allies \"to the Russian wolves.\"\n\nSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said on Sunday that he believes Trump often makes comments to \"elicit media and applause and outrage\" with \"no intent\" of action. But whatever his motives, casting doubt on the United States' obligation to its commitments could have a cost, said Romney -- an outspoken critic of Trump.\n\n\"Even if he did it just to get a rise from the audience and the media and the world at large, it has dangerous implications because people in other nations read it with concern and make their calculations accordingly -- and that has an impact in our standing in the world,\" Romney said on Sunday. \"We're going to lose friends if we go around saying that we're not going to protect them under the obligations we have under NATO.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Pressure on Tuberville intensifies over hold on military nominations\n\nThe impasse created by GOP Sen. Tommy Tuberville's hold on military nominations is raising the stakes of the Senate's final week in session as lawmakers are working frantically behind the scenes to try and find a solution that would get the Alabama senator to back off his slow walking of more than 270 military promotions.\n\nSo far, there is no end in sight to the stalemate.\n\n\"I'm taking all the fire from the other side, but I'm fine with it. I mean, I knew that was gonna happen. I knew it was gonna be tough, but I'm doing it for the right reasons,\" Tuberville told CNN. The Republican senator is objecting to the Pentagon's policy of reimbursing military service members and their families for travel to obtain abortion care.\n\nOn Tuesday, Tuberville floated one potential way to move nominations more quickly through the Senate, telling CNN he'd be open to limiting debate time on each individual nominee. He still would want to bring nominees up for a vote one at a time though. That would still take considerable time and would likely still be seen by Democrats as politicizing the military.\n\n\"There should be some kind of conversation about how can we get this done if you are not going to change the policy back or not going to vote on the policy, let's worry about the nominees,\" Tuberville told CNN.\n\n\"You can cut back on the hours. We can give back time. You can do things like that. We can make it easy, but it would have to be voted on,\" he said.\n\nSenate leaders are hoping to wrap up consideration of the National Defense Authorization Act this week, a bill leaders have long viewed as a natural inflection point to get Tuberville to back off his holds.\n\nWith the bill on the floor, leaders have options to offer Tuberville amendment votes and senators are hoping to put the issue behind them before the August recess, when many military families typically look to move . But so far the off ramps presented to Tuberville have not been enough to end the impasse, and a briefing from Defense Department officials last week in the Senate Armed Services Committee didn't convince the Alabama senator that the policy was on firm legal ground, nor did it convince him his holds were having a real impact on readiness.\n\nIn the meantime, public pressure on the Alabama Republican over his stand is growing.\n\nActive-duty military spouses hand delivered a petition to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Tuberville on Monday signed by hundreds of military family members who are \"deeply concerned and personally impacted by Senator Tuberville blocking confirmation of senior military leaders.\"\n\nRelated article Biden slams Tuberville's block of military promotions as 'irresponsible' and 'jeopardizing US security'\n\nResponding to the petition, a spokesperson for Tuberville told CNN, \"Coach honors, and is grateful for, the service of all of our heroes in uniform. That is why he is working to get politics out of the military using the tools he has as a United States Senator, including his hold.\" Tuberville's office also noted that the holds only apply to generals and flag officers.\n\nKate Marsh Lord - communications director for Secure Families Initiative which spearheaded the petition - told CNN's Kaitlan Collins on \"The Source\" Tuesday night that Tuberville's \"thank you\" to service members was \"empty.\"\n\n\"He's not showing gratitude or respect for the military members in office, or who are serving now,\" she said. \"Military folks are pragmatic and patriotic people. They serve a cause greater than themselves, and I would ask the senator to do the same.\"\n\nAs for how this will affect military families looking to move, Lord, whose husband has served in the Air Force for 23 years, said the \"military is a family business. We're all serving. We're all making sacrifices.\"\n\n\"My family moved this summer,\" she said. \"As soon as we find out where we're going, we spend hours researching the new location, looking into schools, looking into where to live, and then we try and do the best that we can to adjust to a new place to get our kids enrolled in school; to find them new sports clubs or find them new ways to make friends and build community - and he's really putting that on hold for all of these families who are being held up for his political gamesmanship.\"\n\nGOP leadership and fellow lawmakers trying to entice Tuberville to back off are treading carefully, knowing that Tuberville is exercising a power that rank-and-file members want to protect for the future while also recognizing that a long-term standoff with the military could have implications on readiness and recruitment .\n\n\"I think there are lots of permutations of options that have been batted around and discussed and you know, I think he wants to get an outcome and I agree with him. I think the military overstepped their bounds,\" Senate Republican Whip John Thune said. \"But, you know, at the same time, we (have) got to have people in positions and particularly positions that are critical to our vital national security interests, and so right now we're at loggerheads on that, and I don't know exactly at the moment, what the exit plan is, but there are folks who I know he's interacting with talking to our members.\"\n\nDemocratic senators on the Senate Armed Services Committee sent a letter on Monday to McConnell pressing him to pressure Tuberville to drop his holds.\n\n\"As the leader of the Republican Conference, we count on you to hold your colleagues accountable when they recklessly cross boundaries and upend Senatorial order. Senator Tuberville's continuation of this stalemate is reckless, dangerous, and must end,\" they wrote.\n\n\"This has gone on way too long, and it's having an impact on our national security. Senator Tuberville professes to understand or know a lot about the military,\" Sen. Mark Kelly, a Democrat from Arizona, who signed the letter, said. \"My experience is he does not and he does not seem to understand what this is doing to our forces ... it has a cascading effect. It's not just about our admirals and generals anymore. There are people that have to move into those jobs beneath them. It's affecting families. It's affecting our readiness. And it needs to come to some sort of conclusion here.\"\n\nTuberville's hold cannot ultimately stop Pentagon nominees from being approved, but moving through dozens of military promotions, which are typically so uncontroversial that they can be approved with a simple agreement, would take months. It would consume the Senate floor and paralyze the body from being able to take up almost any other action, aides say. Still, one option is Schumer could keep the Senate in session to ramp up pressure on Tuberville.\n\nSchumer did not shut the door on keeping the Senate in session during recess to process the nominations, when asked about it last week. But even keeping the Senate in session around the clock for a month isn't guaranteed to get Tuberville to back off, either.\n\nBehind the scenes, small groups of bipartisan members have been trying to brainstorm a potential path forward.\n\nSome members are looking at potential ways to rein in the Defense Department policy so that it is not as far reaching hoping that could potentially satisfy Tuberville, but it's not clear DOD would be open to any restrictions.\n\n\"There's small groups of us that have been working to find a path forward that that responds to the concerns that the senator has, but also allows us to move forward with the votes of the nominees,\" said Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota. \"We think there may be some middle ground. We'll find out.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN's Clare Foran and Haley Talbot contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

      "text": "Here's what Sen. Tommy Tuberville actually said about White nationalists\n\nA version of this story appears in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here .\n\nSen. Tommy Tuberville, the Alabama Republican, does not consider himself to be a racist - which is an important place to start from since you're about to hear quite a bit about his apparent defense of White nationalists, who he suggested Monday might not be racist either.\n\nBy Tuesday, Tuberville had backtracked, telling reporters on Capitol Hill - but off camera - that, indeed, \"White nationalists are racists.\"\n\nHis Tuesday cleanup notwithstanding, it's worth taking a closer look at Tuberville's full exchange with CNN's Kaitlan Collins on her show, \"The Source,\" because it is a window into the thoughts and motivations of a US senator who is currently holding up promotions at the Pentagon for hundreds of senior leaders.\n\nThat separate, solo obstruction has left the US Marine Corps without a Senate-approved commandant for the first time in more than a century.\n\nThe Monday CNN interview was an incredible exchange, which began as an opportunity for Tuberville to explain his Pentagon obstruction as a protest of Biden administration abortion policy. More on that below.\n\nIn the White nationalism portion of the interview, Tuberville was being asked to explain comments he made to an Alabama radio station back in May, when he was asked if he thought White nationalists should be allowed to serve in the military.\n\n\"Well, they call them that,\" Tuberville said back then of people who oppose White nationalists. \"I call them Americans.\"\n\nRELATED: Who are White nationalists and what do they want?\n\nFactually, it's true that there are Americans who are White nationalists. It's also true that there have been warnings from the Pentagon about White nationalists serving in the military.\n\nPolitically, it caused a moderate kerfuffle in May when Tuberville seemed to be trying to stand up for White nationalists in the military, although his office later said he was misunderstood.\n\nHis comments to Collins, when she asked him to explain on Monday, went so much further.\n\n\"First of all, I'm totally against any type of racism, OK?\" he said, offering up his 40-year football coaching resume when he was \"around more minorities than anybody up here on this Hill,\" as evidence.\n\nHis complaint, he said, is that after the January 6, 2021, insurrection, he did not like that Democrats in general and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in particular were referring to people as racist, nationalist and White nationalist.\n\nWe should note here that there were multiple photos from inside the Capitol on January 6 that showed people displaying Confederate flags and that people with ties to extremist groups like the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers have been found guilty of seditious conspiracy against the government.\n\n\"White nationalists is just another word that they want to use, other than racism,\" Tuberville told Collins.\n\nBelow are more portions of the transcript, which you can read in full here .\n\nTUBERVILLE: I'm totally against anything to do with racism. But the thing about being a White nationalist is just a cover word, for the Democrats, now, where they can use it, to try to make people mad across the country. Identity politics. I'm totally against that. But I'm for the American people. I'm for military. I'm for Christian, conservatives, Democrats, whoever wants to be in the military, to fight for this country, to protect this country. That's what it's all about.\n\nAnd the interview went on:\n\nCOLLINS: But just to be clear, you agree that White nationalists should not be serving in the US military? Is that what you're saying?\n\nTUBERVILLE: If people think that a White nationalist is racist? I agree with that. I would agree they shouldn't.\n\nCOLLINS: But a White nationalist is someone who believes that the White race is superior to other races.\n\nTUBERVILLE: Well, that's some people's opinion. And I don't think. I mean a lot -\n\nCOLLINS: It's not opinion.\n\nTUBERVILLE: Pardon?\n\nCOLLINS: What's your opinion?\n\nTUBERVILLE: My opinion of a White nationalist, if somebody wants to call them a White nationalist, to me, is an American. It's an American. Now, if that White nationalist is a racist, I'm totally against anything that they want to do, because I am 110% against racism.\n\nBut I want somebody that's in our military, that's strong, that believes in this country, that's an American that will fight along anybody, whether it's a man, or woman, Black or White, red. It doesn't make any difference.\n\nAnd so, I'm totally against identity politics. I think it's ruining this country. And I think that Democrats ought to be ashamed for how they're doing this, because it's dividing this country, and it's making this country weaker every day.\n\nCOLLINS: But that's not identity politics. You said a White nationalist is an American.\n\nTUBERVILLE: It is identity politics.\n\nCOLLINS: You said a White nationalist is an American. But a White nationalist is someone who believes horrific things. You don't - do you really think that's someone who should be serving in the military?\n\nTUBERVILLE: Well, that's just a name that it's been given.\n\nCOLLINS: It's not. It's a real -\n\nTUBERVILLE: I mean, listen?\n\nCOLLINS: It's a real definition. There's real concerns about extremism.\n\nTUBERVILLE: So, if you're going to do away with most White people in this country, out of the military, we got huge problems.\n\nLet's pause here. Tuberville seems to be suggesting that all White people could be removed from the military if White nationalists were removed from the military.\n\nIn the most generous possible viewing of this interview for Tuberville, this comment perhaps could be read as suggesting he does not understand what a White nationalist is - essentially a euphemism for a version of White supremacy.\n\nIt is, perhaps, possible that this man is rather separating the word \"White\" from the word \"nationalist.\" Only then - if you did not understand that combining the two terms creates an inherently racist outlook - could you argue that a White nationalist is not a racist and that removing White nationalists from the military would remove all White people from the military.\n\nHowever, Tuberville is not just any 68-year-old former football coach. He's the senator elected by the people of Alabama.\n\nTuberville has previously made comments that required some explanation, such as when he seemed to not know the three branches of US government . He has also made racially charged statements , such as when he declared, incorrectly, at a political rally for former President Donald Trump that Democrats want reparations for the descendants of slaves in order to give money to criminals.\n\nCollins tried to explain the difference between White and White nationalism during their exchange.\n\nCOLLINS: It's not people who are White. It's White nationalists.\n\nTUBERVILLE: That have a few probably different beliefs.\n\nCOLLINS: You see the distinction, right?\n\nTUBERVILLE: That have different beliefs. Now, if racism is one of those beliefs? I'm totally against it. I am totally against racism.\n\nCOLLINS: But that is a White -\n\nTUBERVILLE: But there's a lot of people that believe in different things.\n\nCOLLINS: A White nationalist is racist, Senator.\n\nTUBERVILLE: Well, that's your opinion. That's your opinion. But if it's racism?\n\nCOLLINS: It's not an opinion.\n\nTUBERVILLE: If it's racism? I'm totally against it. I am totally against any type of race - any type of racism. I don't care what it's in.\n\nTuberville wasn't just questioning whether White nationalists are racist. He's also embarked on a one-man effort to obstruct promotions at the Pentagon.\n\nHis gripe is that the Biden administration, now that access to abortion is limited in much of the country, wants to pay for time off and travel for service members who need to travel to obtain one.\n\nRelated article Pentagon seeks to increase pressure on Tuberville to break hold on military nominations\n\nThis is not a position where Tuberville is leading a group. He's doing it on his own, against the wishes of Republican leaders, and he's not backing down.\n\n\"I'm a senator. I can hold any confirmation I want,\" he told Collins, complaining that neither the White House nor Pentagon has reached out to debate the policy with him.\n\nHe fears it will lead to a rash of new abortions, and while he admits that the abortion care is not taxpayer funded under the Pentagon's policy, he feels supporting the service members stationed in states with abortion restrictions will lead to a rash of abortions in the military.\n\n\"I'm not trying to be hardheaded, about this,\" Tuberville told Collins. \"I just want some conversation, and get a reasonable explanation, of why we're doing this.\"\n\nWhy, exactly, should one senator get to hold up nominations in this way?\n\nIt's not in the Constitution or in law, but rather an informal custom of \"holds\" in the Senate that's only been around since the 1950s.\n\nDemocrats, it should be noted, are more than happy to complain about Tuberville , but they haven't exactly moved to end the practices by which he's stopped things up. Perhaps that's because it has elevated Tuberville to be a voice of the GOP and placed other Republicans in the position of talking about obstruction and White nationalism rather than things they'd rather be talking about.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Democrats blast Tuberville hold during Joint Staff Chairman nominee hearing\n\nThroughout the confirmation hearing for the most senior US military officer, Democratic senators and the nominee alike spoke out against an ongoing hold on military nominations, saying it is hurting military families and could discourage officers from staying in uniform.\n\n\"We will lose talent because of those challenges,\" Air Force Gen. C.Q. Brown, who has been nominated to be the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Tuesday. \"The spouse network is alive and well, and the spouses will compare notes and you know, the member may want to serve but the spouses and the families get a huge vote.\"\n\nBrown was speaking at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, which is a routine step in the nomination process despite his confirmation being stalled alongside more than 200 other general and flag officers. The nominations hold is being led by Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, who has used the blockade as a way to protest new Pentagon policies on reproductive health care, which among other things included a travel allowance for service members who must go out of state to receive an abortion.\n\nTuberville, who is also a member of the Armed Services Committee, has vowed he would not back off the hold, despite outcries from military leaders and lawmakers alike. Tuberville told CNN's Kaitlan Collins on \"The Source\" Monday night that when lawmakers are in the minority party in the Senate, \"the only power we have is to put a hold on something.\" Tuberville in that interview doubled down on his previous comments on White nationalism and said it was an \"opinion\" that White nationalists are racist.\n\nIn Tuesday's hearing, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia condemned Tuberville's approach as \"disrespecting and punishing\" uniformed officers who \"had nothing to do with\" the policy Tuberville disagrees with. Kaine said that while people volunteer to serve in the military \"knowing that their lives could be at risk,\" they may decide it's something they're not willing to do because of the hold.\n\n\"[I]f they think not only will my life be at risk, but do I want to run the risk that a member of the Senate being unhappy with a policy I had nothing to do with may choose to block my career? That might be a risk that people might choose not to undertake,\" he said. \"That might be the kind of thing that might make them decide if my article one branch is not going to respect the service that I have given this country including deployments overseas, maybe I should look for a line of work where I will be respected.\"\n\nDemocratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada called the hold \"outrageous\" and told Brown she was \"deeply concerned\" that his nomination was being held up.\n\n\"Enough is enough,\" she said. \"We need to fill these critical roles, and I would like to see you have a quick confirmation.\"\n\nAt the start of the hearing, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut and also a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters that Republican lawmakers \"ought to be telling Sen. Tommy Tuberville this irrational obstructionist blocking of confirmations is harming our national interest.\"\n\nBrown echoed similar concerns that the hold would impact readiness of the military by putting people with less experience into command positions because those nominated to take command can't be confirmed. The deputy commanders who would temporarily take over in many cases throughout the military are \"strong,\" he said, but \"at the same time, they don't have the same level of experience.\"\n\nTuberville met Monday afternoon with Armed Services Committee Chairman Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island, to discuss his holds, a Democratic aide familiar with the process told CNN. The two men met shortly before Reed went to the Senate floor to ask for quick approval of a new leader for the Marine Corps. The aide told CNN, however, there was no resolution. Several members of the committee have now tried to talk with Tuberville about his holds, but he remains unmoved.\n\nIn his questioning of Brown, Tuberville did not mention his hold, instead focusing on the number of personnel in the joint staff - asking Brown if he has suggestions \"on where we could look to cut staff or budget ... and not cut back on efficiency\" - and recruiting challenges. Recruiting \"is in a tailspin in most areas,\" Tuberville said.\n\n\"We've got to do better with salaries, incentives, all those things to get our young men and women involved in interest in our military ... But unless we have the people that actually does the job on the ground, and in the planes, and on the sea, we're gonna have huge problems because we live in a dangerous world. So thank you for taking this on, it's going to be a hard job and any way we can help you, we're here to help,\" Tuberville said.\n\nJust minutes later, Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts lambasted Tuberville's offer to help.\n\n\"I heard the senator say as he completed his questions that if there was anything he could do to help you in your actions and help the service, that he would be glad to do it,\" Warren said. \"What he could do to help is lift this stay before it does more damage to our country.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN's Lauren Fox and Michael Conte contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Tommy Tuberville's Republican colleagues decry his military holds on the Senate floor\n\nFollow:\n\nRepublican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska was joined by his GOP colleagues Joni Ernst of Iowa, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Todd Young of Indiana and Mitt Romney of Utah in the chamber Wednesday night in an attempt to pass 115 top military nominees delayed by fellow Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville's hold on military promotions over Pentagon abortion policy.\n\nOver the course of more than four hours, these Republican senators read out nominees' resumes and argued that Tuberville's hold harms military readiness, punishes the officers who are not responsible for the Pentagon's policy and sets a dangerous precedent in the US Senate - forcing the Alabama Republican to individually object to 61 nominations.\n\n\"That'll be 61 tonight, and Sen. Ernst and I, and I know a lot of our other colleagues want to join us, we're going to keep coming down here,\" said Sullivan.\n\n\"My message to our generals and admirals who are being held up - hang in there. Some of us have your back. We have your back. We'll be coming here every night to try and get you guys confirmed,\" he added.\n\nSullivan argued earlier Wednesday night that Tuberville's holds are \"hugely disruptive to readiness,\" during a dangerous moment in global relations.\n\n\"As a member of the Armed Services committee, as a US Marine Corps colonel, I know, we all know here in the Senate, America needs to have our best players, our most combat-capable leaders on the field. And right now, that's not happening. It needs to change,\" Sullivan said.\n\nTuberville has been holding up military promotions since February because of a Department of Defense policy that reimburses travel costs for military members requiring reproductive care outside of the state in which they are stationed. The department enacted the policy after the reversal of Roe v. Wade last year overturned the constitutional right to an abortion and left the issue to individual states.\n\nSullivan described himself Wednesday as \"as pro-life as they come,\" adding \"I strongly disagree\" with Pentagon policy, and has been pushing for Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to bring the nominees up individually.\n\n\"But I also firmly believe that one of our most core, basic principles, certainly as Republicans, which I think in many ways distinguishes us from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, is our serious focus on national security, readiness, a strong military and taking care of our troops and their families,\" he added.\n\nHe pushed back on Tuberville's argument that the top nominees are not as essential for readiness, and that some of them are leftist.\n\n\"The idea that some of these officers are supposedly 'woke' or desk jockeys is ridiculous,\" Sullivan said.\n\n\"I've worked closely with Sen. Tuberville for months, always defending his holds, always looking for compromise, the one we are working on now,\" he added. \"But we haven't made progress, and the world's a dangerous place.\"\n\nTuberville argued that he is not harming readiness.\n\n\"I have to respectfully disagree with my colleagues about the effect of my hold on readiness. My hold is not affecting readiness,\" Tuberville said and insisted he will continue his hold \"until the Pentagon follows the law or the Democrats change the law.\"\n\nGraham disputed Tuberville's point.\n\n\"No matter whether you believe it or not, Sen. Tuberville, this is doing great damage to our military,\" he said.\n\nSenators also pushed back on Tuberville's tactics, arguing that these military nominees have no control over the Pentagon's policy on reproductive care.\n\nGraham, when making his request for several nominees to be confirmed, added, \"why would you punish them for something they've got nothing to do with?\"\n\nTuberville argued that his tactics are not out of line. \"Every day this continues is a day that Democrats think abortion is more important than the nomination, and our miliary,\" he said. \"I support many of these nominees, and I agree that these are very, very important jobs. But we could have been voting on these nominees the entire nine months.\"\n\nErnst, a former member of the military herself, noted that she is part of a military family and she is \"proudly, adamantly, and unabashedly pro-life.\" However, she also called on Tuberville to lift his holds.\n\n\"We have done the best that we can to honor the requests of a fellow senator, that these nominations be brought to the floor and voted on individually. And I really respect men of their word. I do not respect men who do not honor their word,\" she said, adding that each of the nominees brought forward \"have been denied an opportunity to move forward.\"\n\nSullivan said that \"there is growing bitterness within the military\" because \"their careers are being punished over a policy dispute they had nothing to do with and no power to resolve.\"\n\nYoung highlighted the conflicts in Ukraine and Israel, as well as concerns for Taiwan while calling for Tuberville to lift his hold. \"We need a fully staffed, fully competent, fully engaged and focused security establishment,\" Young said.\n\n\"I'm fervently, I am passionately, I am unapologetically pro-life in conviction and in deed. My reputation is untarnished and it's unambiguous in that regard,\" added Young. \"And to hold responsible effectively 300 nominated patriots who ought to be pinning on a star or another star right now, hold them professionally responsible for this and by extension to undermine the safety and security of the American people during this perilous time right now, just doesn't make any sense to me.\"\n\nSome senators argued that long-term, blanket holds set a poor precedent in the Senate that would lead to increased gridlock and politicization of the military.\n\n\"Everybody in this body could find an issue with any administration they don't agree with, and what we're going to do is Pandora's box,\" Graham said.\n\nRomney called Tuberville's hold \"an abuse of the powers we have as senators.\"\n\n\"I rise out of great concern for our military, for its readiness at a time of great peril, but also out of concern for the men and women who are being held up, and whose careers and prospects and families and plans are being interrupted by the virtue of the decision of, in this case, two people, one Secretary Austin and the other is Sen. Tuberville to take intractable positions,\" Romney said. \"And it's simply, in my opinion, an abuse of the powers we have as senators to say if there's something we vehemently disagree with, that we're going to use that power to hold up the promotion of over 350 men and women in our military.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Pentagon seeks to increase pressure on Tuberville to break hold on military nominations\n\nThe Pentagon is seeking to increase pressure on Sen. Tommy Tuberville in an attempt to break the Alabama Republican's one-man hold on hundreds of senior military nominations.\n\nThe effort includes back-channel conversations with Congress and members of the key oversight committees, but also a public campaign to increase awareness of the effects of the holds on the military and its families.\n\n\"Hill leadership knows this is a problem,\" a Defense official told CNN.\n\nAs of July 7, Tuberville's hold was impacting 265 senior military officers. An internal assessment put together by the Pentagon and obtained by CNN says the holds affect the families of 84 officers awaiting confirmation, including officers who have paid out of pocket to move their families, military spouses who have left their jobs anticipating new assignments, and children unable to enroll in new schools.\n\nThe Pentagon's deputy press secretary, Sabrina Singh, highlighted several of these examples at a press briefing Monday.\n\n\"This is having an incredible impact not just to our general and flag officers but to our families,\" Singh said, \"and we certainly urge Senator Tuberville to lift these holds.\"\n\nThe assessment has been shared with lawmakers and is expected to be updated weekly as the number of holds grows. By the end of the year, Defense officials expect more than 600 senior officers to be up for nomination, including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and other top military leaders.\n\nPublicizing the assessment and the effects the holds have on military families is a way of generating awareness of the blocked nominations, the defense official said, and the military services are compiling the increasing the numbers.\n\n\"We obviously keep up the pressure, because we don't want anyone to forget about it,\" the Defense official said.\n\nSpeaking with CNN's Kaitlan Collins on Monday, Tuberville insisted he is not blocking confirmations and that the Senate had plenty of time to take up the nominees.\n\n\"I'm just stopping them from confirming hundreds at a time,\" Tuberville said. \"They can confirm as many as they want, during the day. We're just sitting around, twiddling our thumbs most of the time during the week and should be confirming people.\"\n\nThough Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has only spoken once with Tuberville, the senator said, the Pentagon's legislative affairs team has been in regular contact with the Hill and the Senate Armed Services Committee, where the nominations are stalled. Tuberville has not backed down from maintaining his block on nominations as he protests the Defense Department's reproductive health policies, claiming there is no impact on national security and no risk to US military readiness.\n\n\"I'm not gonna change my approach,\" Tuberville said Monday.\n\nInstead, Defense officials are trying to get Republican senators to put pressure on Tuberville to lift his holds. Sen. Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said Tuesday that \"We need these officers in place.\" Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate minority leader, has said in the past that Tuberville's hold \"is not the best way to go about it.\"\n\nBut the criticism has done little to shift Tuberville's position.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a US Army veteran who sits on the Armed Services Committee, told CNN's Anderson Cooper on \"AC360\" that while she wishes more of her Republican colleagues would speak up, it may not push Tuberville off of his stance.\n\n\"Now listen, Republican leader McConnell has spoken up and said that he does not support this, so I don't think you can have a more influential Republican than the leader of their own caucus in the Senate, and yet [Tuberville] has rejected that,\" she said.\n\nThe Illinois Democrat added that \"at a time when we have troops who are in harm's way defending and protecting our nation, to not have a commandant of the Marine Corps who can exercise his full duties of commandant is destructive to this nation's national security, and it all is laid at Sen. Tuberville's feet.\"\n\nRelated article Republican block leaves major branch of US military without a confirmed leader for first time in over a century\n\nThe hold disrupts what is typically a routine process of confirming hundreds of military nominations at once known as unanimous consent. With Tuberville's hold in place, the Senate would need to take each nomination to the floor for an individual vote, which could take months and hundreds of hours of floor time to complete.\n\n\"It's a Senate question, and it's really a Republican question,\" the Defense official told CNN.\n\nGen. Charles Q. Brown, whose nomination to be the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is on hold, was asked about the effects of the holds repeatedly in his confirmation hearing Tuesday. Brown spoke about the impacts on military readiness and retention, as well as the cascading effects on junior officers who can't get promoted because of a blocked spot.\n\n\"The area that hits us, I think that we do need to think about is how it impacts our families, because it has an impact not just for the senior officer, but you know, all their staff and all those below them it has an impact,\" Brown said in response to a question from Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\nOn Monday, Austin reiterated those concerns at the relinquishment of command ceremony for Gen. David Berger, the Marine Corps Commandant. Berger's nominated successor, Gen. Eric Smith, has not yet been confirmed alongside the more than 200 other military officers stalled in Tuberville's hold.\n\nAustin said Monday that smooth transitions of leadership \"are central to the defense of the United States,\" and crucial \"for our military readiness\" and \"our military families.\"\n\n\"[O]ur military families give up so much to support those who serve. So they shouldn't be weighed down with any extra uncertainty,\" Austin said. \"We have a sacred duty to do right by those who volunteer to wear the cloth of our nation. And I remain confident that all Americans can come together to agree on that basic obligation to those who keep us safe. I am also confident that the United States Senate will meet its responsibilities.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nCNN's Jack Forrest contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Tuberville signals new willingness to cut a deal amid GOP tensions over Pentagon blockade\n\nFollow:\n\nSen. Tommy Tuberville for the first time began to crack the door open to a deal that would lift his one-man blockade stalling more than 450 military nominees over his demand that the Pentagon eliminate its abortion policy.\n\nBut it's still uncertain whether the issue will get resolved - and some of the new options the Alabama Republican is considering would likely prompt Democratic opposition. Tuberville said after an hour-long meeting with GOP senators Tuesday he would engage in talks with other Republican senators and a Pentagon official over the next day to see if a compromise can be reached.\n\nUntil then, he said, he's not backing down.\n\n\"I'm still dug in,\" Tuberville told CNN. \"I'm standing up for the unborn,\" he added, but he noted: \"There's going to have to be some give-and-take here as we go through this, because there's 450 out there that haven't had a promotion.\"\n\nAmong the ideas under consideration: Filing a lawsuit against the Pentagon to invalidate the policy that provides reimbursements for military personnel traveling out of state for reproductive services including abortions, include provisions to scrap the Pentagon policy in the annual defense authorization bill and move forward with some of the key nominees who need to fill some of the most urgent vacancies.\n\nBut the Democratic-led Senate and the White House would almost certainly revolt against including anti-abortion provisions in the annual defense policy bill, something Tuberville dismissed.\n\n\"If it stays in there and the Senate passes it, he'll sign it or we won't have an NDAA,\" Tuberville said of the National Defense Authorization Act, calling it a \"bargaining chip.\"\n\nTuberville's comments come amid a growing pressure campaign from Republicans who have gone public with their concerns that the Alabama senator's stand is hurting military readiness and undermining national security. And as GOP senators have threatened to cut a deal with Democrats on a temporary change in Senate procedures to work around Tuberville and approve the nominees as a bloc, Tuberville has signaled a new willingness to reach his own accord and try to extract some concessions.\n\nThe shift comes as Tuberville for months has said he would only back off his blockade if the Pentagon eliminated its policy unless Congress passed legislation to formally authorize it.\n\nBut on Tuesday, he suggested he was open to the possibility of dropping his hold without the Pentagon removing its policy.\n\n\"Well that just depends on some of their actions and how they answer some of the questions that I'm gonna ask them,\" Tuberville said of the Pentagon. \"But no, I'm not willing to drop them right now, no.\"\n\nTuberville said he would meet with a Pentagon official - whom he declined to name - in the next 24 hours. And then he would engage in talks with several GOP senators - namely Dan Sullivan of Alaska, Joni Ernst of Iowa, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin - to see if they can agree to a plan.\n\nBut he continued to dismiss arguments from Republicans and military leaders that his stand is having drastic national security implications in the United States.\n\n\"I've talked to people in the Pentagon and that's just recently been out of the Pentagon and I'm not worried about that part. I'm really not,\" Tuberville said of military readiness. \"I worry about people. OK, I worry about the people in the military because they're somebody that I deeply care about because I'm a military brat.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

      "text": "Opinion: With his ignorance, Tommy Tuberville just gave poets an incredible compliment\n\nEditor's Note: Tess Taylor is the author of five collections of poetry, including \"Work & Days\" and \"Rift Zone.\" She is the editor of the new book \"Leaning Toward Light: Poems for Gardens & the Hands That Tend Them .\" The views expressed here are her own. Read more opinion on CNN.\n\nThis week, US Sen. Tommy Tuberville gave poets a wonderful compliment.  It is imperative to root out \"wokeness,\" he claimed in an interview on Fox News Wednesday, adding that the world (and the US military) are falling apart because \"we've got people doing poems on aircraft carriers over the loudspeaker.\"\n\nFrom where I am, traveling the country on book tour, reading poems which I hope will spark a seed of joy or empathy in people I meet, I had to laugh. After all, Tuberville, who's also famous for mucking with the work of military confirmations , enjoys his own bombast.  He didn't mean to compliment poets!  But, in sounding the alarm about how our poor Navy recruits are falling victim to the siren song of poetry, he reminded us that poetry is powerful:  It can wake us up in dark spaces. It can call us to ourselves even (and especially)  on Navy aircraft carriers.\n\nTuberville, of course, also revealed his ignorance about the history of the US military, about the inner lives of soldiers and about what poems really do.  For context: Reading and writing poetry while at war has been long considered an urgent, humanizing and patriotic act.\n\nSome of the best poems in our literature are the poems of WWI's trenches, including those by Robert Frost's friend, Edward Thomas, who gave his life in the English infantry.  Some of America's best books have been sent alongside American soldiers into battle. Between 1943 and 1947-as US military of all stripes were fighting fascism, facing down terrifying missions worldwide-the Council of Books in Wartime sent a dazzling 123 million books to soldiers, in carefully designed editions light enough to fit in a soldier's pocket. The books included bestsellers, classics, books by Ernest Hemingway and Katherine Anne Porter and the reprinted edition of \"A Boy's Will\" - by none other than Frost.\n\nThree military leaders make rare joint appearance to demand action from senator\n\n\"Books Are Weapons in the War of Ideas,\" read a poster that circulated widely at the time. The American idea - the patriotic idea - was that having ideas, savoring them, using them to cultivate and feel one's own humanity, was restorative human work, necessary for anyone who was going to put their life on the line. This was the work of freedom, and this freedom - of thought and spirit - made life worth fighting for.\n\nSo reading poetry while deployed is not new, nor is it, as Tuberville said, \"insane.\" It is, in fact, a way of helping anyone going to war locate the deep sanity from which any of us take moral action at all. Perhaps, ultimately, that's what Tuberville fears about it.\n\nIt's not really about the content of the poetry. The poems sent along with WWII soldiers include Frost's \" Mending Wall ,\" an old chestnut about borders and barriers and laying stone. If it's about battle, or politics, or identity, the reference is slant . A WWI masterpiece, Edward Thomas's poem \" As The Team's Head Brass \" holds the tragedy of war as a charged offstage character which is nonetheless transforming life at home.  More recent poems, like Brian Turner's magnificent \" Here, Bullet \" capture the texture of warfare, bear witness to it for other soldiers and for those left behind.\n\nHere's what poets know and Tuberville fears: that poems can reroute us, dig deep in us, help us turn over some stones in our own soul. Poetry helps us declare our inner lives.  Perhaps that is what Tuberville finds most dangerous about it. Personally, I find that danger charged and thrilling. Let us all risk this danger far more often.\n\nOpinion: 'Just read, and read more' - a groundbreaking poet's advice\n\nAs I wrote this article, I called Turner, a poet who served in the second infantry division in Iraq from 2003 to 2004 to ask him what he thought about Tuberville's comments. Beyond being full of \"ignorance\" Turner told me, he thought Tuberville's was a comment \"borne of a fear of humanity or tenderness.\" He's \"using it as a wedge, but he has no idea what it's like to be a service member,\" Turner told me.\n\nThe second infantry in Iraq was full of poetry: Turner remembers both a lieutenant in his platoon who read poetry and the open poetry nights at a large base north of Baghdad. Turner, already a published poet before his deployment, wrote in his notebook between missions. When he wrote \"Here, Bullet,\" he carried it in a plastic bag in a Velcro pocket in his uniform, so that it would be on his person in case he died. \"If I'd been killed it would have been what they found on my body,\" he told me.\n\nThe poem \"was a way of being in conversation with the closeness of both beauty and possibility of death,\" Turner said. Writing poetry was for him also about \"remembering beauty\" and\" knowing that even as I was fighting, I am really in love with the world.\" Soldiers are not robots, Turner told me. \"We are human beings in an impossible situation. And we come home and we play guitar, we do the things that reconnect to ourselves.\"\n\n\"Tuberville thinks that poetry is a weakness, but it's actually a strength,\" he said. \"Knowing our feelings, knowing that we care for people, knowing that we care about the world is fundamental to knowing what we want to do with our lives, what we want to protect with them.\"\n\nIn the years since, Turner said he has visited all of the US's military academies repeatedly, to be part of a conversation with the future officer corps. \"These are people who are working to deepen their imaginations to prepare for the experiences that they are going to have.\" At West Point or Annapolis, he loves to hear the young soldiers he meets talk about \"The Iliad.\" \"They are deeply engaged with questions of life and death and they need these poems,\" he said. \"Poetry is a tool we have to deal with the inexpressible.  It's one of the ways we ground ourselves.\"\n\nMaybe it's this grounding that Tuberville fears most. What do those poems on aircraft carriers do? What is their real danger? \"No poem ever stopped a tank,\" said Seamus Heaney, the Nobel Prize-winning poet from Northern Ireland who knew a thing or two about living through a deadening tide of ongoing violence.  In that sense, Heaney argued that \"poetry was useless.\" But he also knew that poetry and the imaginative arts \"verify our singularity, they strike and stake out the ore of self / that lies at the base of every individuated life.\"\n\nWhich is to say, poems resound inside us, they help us excavate the glinting mettle of our inner lives, the deepest stuff of which we are made. If this is being woke, let's keep waking and waking and waking up.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved. CNN Sans TM & © 2016 Cable News Network."

Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., appeared to struggle to answer questions on Thursday related to a ruling by his state's Supreme Court last week that embryos are considered children.\n\n\"Yeah, I was all for it,\" Tuberville told reporters at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday when asked about the Alabama Supreme Court's Friday ruling that embryos created through in vitro fertilization are considered children under state law.\n\n\"We need to have more kids. We need to have an opportunity to do that, and I thought this was the right thing to do,\" Tuberville said.\n\nPressed by NBC News about whether he was concerned about how the ruling could impact people who are trying to have kids through IVF, Tuberville sidestepped the question.\n\n\"Well, that's, that's for another conversation. I think the big thing is right now, you protect - you go back to the situation and try to work it out to where it's best for everybody. I mean, that's what - that's what the whole abortion issue is about,\" he said.\n\nThe Alabama lawmaker, who noted that he had not seen the ruling, appeared to struggle to explain how the decision, which threatens to limit access to IVF treatment , would help more people have children.\n\n\"It's about the same direction, but I agree, but people need to have access. People need to have - we need more kids, we need the people to have the opportunity to have kids,\" he said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Thursday blasted the court's ruling, describing it as \"outrageous and unacceptable\" and saying it put at risk fertility treatment for those \"who are desperately trying to get pregnant.\"\n\nSome Republicans on Capitol Hill have suggested state law should be adjusted to accommodate families who want to have children.\n\n\"I think they should modify the law because, you know, the courts are just there, representing what the law is,\" Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., told \"Meet the Press NOW\" on Thursday. \"We want moms and dads to have children if they want to have children.\"\n\nTuberville made headlines last year when he held up military nominations for months in protest of a Defense Department policy permitting reimbursement for service members' abortion-related travel expenses. The Alabama Republican, who said in November that voting to circumvent his holds would be \"suicide for some\" Republicans because \"you're either pro-life or you're not,\" ended that hold in December. The Senate then confirmed a backlog of hundreds of military nominees.\n\nDasha Burns is a correspondent for NBC News.\n\nAbigail Brooks is a producer for NBC News.\n\nZoë Richards is a politics reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Tommy Tuberville , R-Ala., announced he would drop the bulk of his holds, ending a monthslong campaign.\n\nTuberville told reporters earlier Tuesday that he had lifted his hold on all military promotions at three-star rank and below, amounting to over 425 promotions.\n\n\"I'm releasing everybody. I still got a hold on, I think, 11 four-star generals. Everybody else is completely released from me.\" Tuberville told reporters. \"But other than that, it's over.\"\n\nHours later, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., took to the Senate floor to confirm all 425 of those nominees unanimously, saying members of the military and their families \"can breathe a sigh of relief.\"\n\nHe then took aim at Tuberville for his 10-month hold, saying it risked national security while putting military families through a \"pointless and gravely damaging ordeal.\" Schumer went on to warn other senators against pursuing a similar tactic in the future.\n\n\"Let this incident be a warning,\" Schumer said, \"No one - no one - should attempt this in the Senate again. The senior senator from Alabama has nothing to show for his 10 months of delay.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden said in a statement Tuesday that the \"confirmations are long overdue, and should never have been held up in the first place.\"\n\n\"In the end, this was all pointless,\" Biden said, adding that \"Tuberville, and the Republicans who stood with him, needlessly hurt hundreds of servicemembers and military families and threatened our national security - all to push a partisan agenda. I hope no one forgets what he did.\"\n\nTuberville had been holding up military nominations in protest of the Defense Department's policy that allows service members to be reimburse d for travel costs related to getting abortions. The policy is still in place.\n\nSchumer said the Senate \"will work to confirm the rest of the nominees\" whom Tuberville is blocking \"soon.\" It's not clear whether the Senate will process those one by one in the coming weeks or whether Democrats will push to do them as a group.\n\nTuberville had signaled last week that he might drop some of his holds \"very soon,\" as pressure from members of both parties mounted. He didn't specify at the time how many promotions he would let through but said he wanted to get as many people as possible through \"in the next week or so\" and wouldn't decide based on \"levels\" of rankings.\n\n\"I know these people, you know, need to be promoted,\" he said last week.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Tuberville announced a news conference about the holds for 1:40 p.m. ET and then canceled it with giving a reason.\n\nSome of the military nominees Tuberville had blocked for months include d top officers who would command U.S. forces in the Middle East . Since Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7, the Pentagon has moved aircraft and military carriers into the region to help assist and support Israel .\n\nTuberville drew criticism from members of his own party. A group of Republican senators tried multiple times on the Senate floor to confirm military nominees, but every time, Tuberville blocked them. Schumer thanked that group in his remarks Tuesday afternoon.\n\nGOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley had also denounced Tuberville 's effort , saying in August that his blockade was having a detrimental effect on service members, as well as military readiness.\n\nTop military leaders, including Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, warned for months about the consequences of Tuberville's hold, including the possibility of losing talent .\n\nSchumer said last week that he would bring to the floor a Democratic resolution to bypass Tuberville's holds , but it wasn't clear whether he'd have the votes to pass it.\n\nAs frustrations with Tuberville built within his own party, Senate Republicans last week began to express optimism that he would come to a resolution on his blockade before members left for the new year.\n\n\"I was involved in a lot of conversations over the weekend on this subject, and I think that I'm hopeful,\" Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters Tuesday morning. \"I'm hopeful that today, we're going to - keep your fingers crossed, we'll see, I hope we have a breakthrough, but time will tell.\"\n\nKate Santaliz is an associate producer for NBC News' Capitol Hill team.\n\nFrank Thorp V is a producer and off-air reporter covering Congress for NBC News, managing coverage of the Senate.\n\nRebecca Shabad is a politics reporter for NBC News based in Washington.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., said he isn't backing down on his monthslong blockade on hundreds of military promotions, even amid Hamas' deadly attack on Israel , a close U.S ally.\n\n\"The Pentagon clearly thinks forcing taxpayers to facilitate abortion is more important than confirming their top nominees without a vote. They could end this situation TODAY by dropping their illegal and immoral policy and get everyone confirmed rapidly, but they refuse,\" Tuberville spokesperson Steve Stafford said in a statement to NBC News. \"If the Biden administration wants their nominees confirmed then Senate Democrats can do what Coach just did in September and file a cloture petition to force a vote.\"\n\nThe news was first reported by Politico . \"Coach\" refers to Tuberville's past as a college football coach.\n\nHundreds have died in the ongoing battle Hamas launched against Israel over the weekend, with Hamas fighters having also taken a number of civilians and soldiers hostage. The State Department is working to verify reports that Americans were killed and taken hostage, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday on NBC News' \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nThe Biden administration has stated its support for Israel. As the conflict stretched into day two, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced Sunday that the U.S. military is moving an aircraft carrier strike group and military aircraft closer to Israel as a show of support and that it will also supply Israel with munitions and other military supplies as soon as possible.\n\nTuberville's blockade has put a hold on at least 300 military nominees, including top officers who would command forces in the Middle East. He said his effort is in protest of the Defense Department policy that gives time off and reimbursements for service members and their family members seeking abortions out of state.\n\nDemocrats and the White House have condemned Tuberville's use of a procedural tactic to clog up the confirmation of military officials as a threat to the military's preparedness. He can't actually block the Senate from processing any promotion, but his hold has dramatically slowed a process that typically proceeds without votes.\n\nTuberville and some Republicans have argued that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., could call each of the hundreds of nominations for individual votes - a process that would take hundreds of hours of floor time for each one.\n\nThe Senate last month used that tactic to confirm its first military nominees in months - Air Force Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr. as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the nation's top military officer; Gen. Randy George as Army chief of staff; and Gen. Eric Smith as commandant of the Marine Corps.\n\nBrown's confirmation vote came four months after President Joe Biden nominated him. Brown is set to succeed Army Gen. Mark Milley, whose term ends this month.\n\nTo expedite the process and confirm the nominees en bloc would require unanimous consent from all 100 senators - something that won't exist unless and until Tuberville lifts his hold over the Defense Department's abortion policy.\n\nAnother option the Senate could use to get around Tuberville's blockade, in theory, is to vote to change the rules and make a one-time exception. That would require two-thirds of the Senate, or 67 votes, and it's unclear whether that would happen.\n\nSchumer's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nJulie Tsirkin is a correspondent covering Capitol Hill.\n\nSummer Concepcion is a politics reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Tommy Tuberville has spent months blocking promotions at the Pentagon in protest to a new abortion policy but Wednesday seemed poised to try to force the Senate to vote on a key nominee - an effort to flip pressure onto Democrats after criticism from them and members of his own party .\n\nTuberville sought to force the Senate to confirm Gen. Eric Smith's promotion to Marine Corps commandant on Wednesday afternoon, a Senate aide with knowledge of the plan told NBC News - implementing a combination of procedural and political gymnastics as Democrats and the White House paint his hold as endangering military readiness.\n\n\"Let's go. It's time to vote,\" Tuberville posted on X Wednesday morning, captioning a photo of him signing a document known as a cloture petition.\n\nSmith is currently serving in an acting capacity due to Tuberville's blockade, leaving the Pentagon operating without a Senate-confirmed commandant for the first time in over 150 years .\n\nBut before Tuberville could act, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer took to the floor to start the process of voting on three nominees - a move that appeared to try to blunt the Republican efforts.\n\n\"Senator Tuberville is essentially trying to make himself the gatekeeper of which officers are promoted and who sits and waits,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor. \"Instead of just getting out of the way and allowing the Senate to approve the promotions that these decorated military officers deserve the senator from Alabama, unfortunately and wrongly is using them as pawns.\"\n\nTuberville's push to force the vote would seem to be at odds with the fact that he has been the one stopping confirmations, a blockade he said he would lift if the Pentagon reverses a policy meant to help military members access abortions if they have been stationed in a state that prohibits them.\n\nThe Alabama Republican on Tuesday said he doesn't plan to lift his holds unless the Pentagon policy, which pays travel expenses for servicemembers who need to go out of state to have an abortion, is changed. \"I'm not changing my mind,\" he stressed.\n\nThe delays have irked Democrats and Republicans and become a White House talking point, which aims to paint congressional Republicans as unreasonable and unfit, or unwilling, to govern.\n\nTuberville and some members of his party have argued that if Democrats are so concerned about the national security risk, Schumer can call each of the hundreds of nominees up for a vote individually (normally, nominees would be approved in packages).\n\nTuberville cast Schumer's move to bring up three nominees as a win, saying he won't object to considering them.\n\n\"It's about time,\" he said. \"I've been calling for that for months. ... I'm all for it. Individually, let's get them done.\"\n\n\"As long as we go through regular order, I'm good with it,\" Tuberville continued. \"I've been saying that for months. Now ... we've called them out, they blinked.\"\n\nApproving one by one would take up a significant amount of the Senate's time - amid a government funding fight and other key deadlines. Democrats have declined to vote on individual promotions on principal, as well, arguing that it would be ceding to Tuberville's demands.\n\nBut because Democrats won't hold individual votes, Republicans think they can turn the political pressure off the GOP and that forcing a vote on Smith's promotion will ultimately make Democrats look bad.\n\nSchumer seemed to seek to blunt that strategy when he started the process on Wednesday to vote on Smith as well as Gen. CQ Brown to be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Gen. Randy George to be Chief of Staff of the Army.\n\nTuberville secured 16 signatures on the petition to force a vote, the source detailed, utilizing a rarely invoked procedural tool .\n\nRepublican Sens. Rand Paul, of Kentucky; Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina; John Kennedy, of Louisiana; and Marco Rubio, of Florida, told NBC News on Tuesday they signed the petition. Republican Sens. JD Vance, of Ohio; Marsha Blackburn, of Tennessee; Eric Schmitt, of Missouri; and Ted Budd, of North Carolina also signed onto the cloture petition, their respective spokespeople confirmed. No member of Senate leadership signed the petition, according to the source with knowledge of the petition.\n\nSchumer dismissed Tuberville's efforts as avoiding the real problem.\n\n\"This is a problem created by Republicans, and it's up to them to solve,\" Schumer said at a recent press conference.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has criticized Tuberville's holds in the past, even calling them \"a mistake.\"\n\nLiz Brown-Kaiser covers Capitol Hill for NBC News.\n\nFrank Thorp V is a producer and off-air reporter covering Congress for NBC News, managing coverage of the Senate.\n\nKate Santaliz is an associate producer for NBC News' Capitol Hill team.\n\nJulie Tsirkin is a correspondent covering Capitol Hill.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Senate Democrats and independent Sen.

We've done it the right way. And at the end of the day, I know these people, you know, need to be promoted,\" Tuberville said. \"They have not done anything wrong. But it's the only way that we've been able to get the attention of the Democrats.\"\n\nTuberville's blockade has held up at least 350 military nominees thus far. He said his move is in protest of a Defense Department policy that allows time off and reimbursements for service members and their family members seeking abortions out of state.\n\nTuberville on Thursday also said that language to change the Defense Department's abortion travel policy was stripped from the National Defense Authorization Act, an annual must-pass defense policy bill, one of the possible resolutions to his blockade he said he was counting on. Without the NDAA, Tuberville indicated that his next step may be to drop some of his holds.\n\nThe Pentagon abortion policy has sparked debate among congressional lawmakers and has emerged as a major focal point of negotiations on the NDAA. The GOP-led House passed its version of the legislation in July after adding an amendment that would force the Defense Department to rescind the policy. However, the Democratic-led Senate passed its own version of the NDAA weeks later, after it averted floor votes on amendments related to abortion access and transgender health care in the military.\n\nTuberville and some Republicans have argued that Schumer could instead call each of the hundreds of military nominations in limbo for individual votes - a process that could take up hundreds of hours of floor time for each vote.\n\nThe Senate in September confirmed its first military nominees in months using that tactic - Air Force Gen.

Eric Smith, was hospitalized due to a medical emergency on Sunday.\n\nSen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., facing fresh attacks over his military holds , is trying to force a floor vote on the nomination, while Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., privately told Democrats he'll bring up the nomination along with two others this week, a Senate source said.\n\nTuberville told reporters Tuesday that Smith's unexpected health issues have caused him to reconsider his hold on the nomination of Lt. Gen. Christopher Mahoney to be the Marine Corps' assistant commandant.\n\n\"Just on that one,\" Tuberville said, adding he won't lift his blockade of hundreds of other senior military promotions until the Pentagon reverses its new abortion policy .\n\n\"If they move the policy back, then we'll drop 'em all,\" the senator said.\n\nMahoney's nomination was submitted in July, and he most likely would already have been confirmed if not for Tuberville's hold, which he put in place in protest of the Defense Department's policy of reimbursing service members for travel expenses if they go to another state for an abortion.\n\nTuberville's tactic to try to force a vote on Mahoney, called filing a cloture petition, is rarely used by the minority, given it's almost always the prerogative of the majority leader, Schumer, to decide what goes to the floor and when. Tuberville used this same tactic in September to force Schumer into bringing up votes on members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nBut Tuberville confirmed Tuesday that he had secured the 16 signatures needed to force the procedural vote on Mahoney's nomination. And he suggested that Schumer now may decide to bring the nomination up himself in an effort to avoid the precedent of the minority taking over the floor.\n\n\"Schumer will take it to himself to bring him up and try to take credit for it,\" Tuberville said. \"I'm sure he's going to point at me of holding everything back.\"\n\nDuring a closed-door lunch, Schumer told rank-and-file Democrats that he plans to file cloture Tuesday on three top military nominations, including the Marine Corps' assistant commandant, the Senate source said.\n\nThe Middle East \"crisis that we have makes it even more apparent that Republicans themselves should get Tuberville to back off what he is doing now more than ever,\" Schumer told reporters after the lunch. \"What happened with the Marine Corps commandant shows just the reason we should - we don't know who the next person is who might get ill or whatever.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., also reiterated his opposition to Tuberville's military holds.\n\n\"I'm sure you remember that I said this was a bad idea quite a while ago. I still think it's a bad idea and particularly applied to people who don't make policy,\" McConnell told reporters. \"And so I have been among those trying to convince Sen. Tuberville to express his opposition some other way, by people who actually make policy as opposed to our military heroes.\"\n\nAt an event on Friday, Smith said that, because of the holds, he was filling the roles of both the Marine Corps commandant and assistant commandant - \"two full-time jobs filled by one person,\" he said, pointing to himself.\n\n\"I am still doing both of those jobs and using my staff the best I can to fill in where the assistant commandant would normally be full time,\" Smith said at the Military Reporters and Editors Conference , \"because I simply can't be at two places at once.\"\n\nTwo days later, Smith suffered an apparent heart attack, according to multiple news outlets . The Marine Corps said Lt. Gen. Karsten Heckl, a three-star general, was stepping in to perform the duties of commandant.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the Armed Services Committee, said that Smith's medical absence could be a lengthy one and that it underscores the dangers of Tuberville's holds.\n\n\"My heart and thoughts are with Gen. Smith and I hope for his speedy recovery, but there is the possibility that he may not be returning for a while. And the potential as well for an absence in the commandant position just re-emphasizes how the Tuberville hold is a desperate threat to our national security,\" Blumenthal told reporters.\n\n\"So I'm just really frustrated and angry that this hold is continuing,\" he said, adding that he is pushing for the Senate to take up a temporary workaround to Tuberville's holds.\n\nTuberville's holds on more than 300 high-level military promotions do not prohibit them from being taken up for a vote. It just dramatically slows down the process for each and every nominee he's put a hold on.\n\nDemocrats have largely dismissed calls from Republicans to consider the promotions one by one, saying that they should be done in batches, and that doing them individually is not tenable.\n\nFrank Thorp V is a producer and off-air reporter covering Congress for NBC News, managing coverage of the Senate.\n\nScott Wong is a senior congressional reporter for NBC News.\n\nLori Rampani is an intern for NBC News based in Washington, D.C.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Tommy Tuberville in his home state of Alabama for a campaign event Friday, as the Pentagon deals with the effects of Tuberville's months-long hold on military promotions.\n\nTrump has remained silent on the issue, and neither Tuberville nor supporters in attendance seemed concerned about the military confirmation hold at the state party event. It wasn't mentioned once in Tuberville's introduction of the former president, nor did it come up in Trump's 40-minute-plus remarks.\n\nEven some Republican voters at the Alabama GOP Summer Dinner who didn't agree with the blockade were more focused on party loyalty than Tuberville's maneuver, which is currently stalling over 300 military promotions. The move has currently left the Army and Marine Corps without confirmed leaders for the first time in American history.\n\n\"If he supported President Trump, I support him. And I might disagree with some other legislation he has,\" said Brandt Wiggins, a junior at the University of Alabama.  \"If he's backing Trump and Trump's backing him, Trump needs loyalists.\"\n\nSecretary of Defense Lloyd Austin provided guidance for the first time Friday on a Pentagon leadership role reshuffle due to Tuberville's maneuver, CNN reported .\n\nThe Alabama senator's months-long hold on military nominations is tied to his efforts to get the Pentagon to drop its abortion travel policy, which provides paid leave for female service members to seek reproductive health care services. The campaign is raising concerns about military readiness and potentially putting some military families in limbo about their next steps.\n\nLawmakers in both parties have pushed back against Tuberville's methods, but the senator shows little signs of relenting. He has said he won't drop his holds until a vote on the Pentagon policy comes to the Senate floor.\n\nAlthough Trump has remained quiet on Tuberville's military holds, other GOP presidential contenders, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, have recently voiced support for the blockade.\n\n\"They are funding abortion tourism, which is not an appropriate thing for the military to be doing,\" DeSantis said. \"So I think our Republicans in the Congress should just take a stand on this. The [Pentagon] should stand down.\"\n\nTrump endorsed Tuberville for Senate in 2020 against his former attorney general, Jeff Sessions. Ever since, the two have shown staunch support for each other.\n\nTrump also on Friday swept all six endorsements from the Alabama Republican congressional delegation.\n\nJake Traylor is a 2024 NBC News campaign embed.\n\nKate Santaliz is an associate producer for NBC News' Capitol Hill team.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona would use a Senate tool to bypass Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., who for months has prevented a quick vote on more than 300 top-level military promotions in protest of the Defense Department's abortion travel policy.\n\nThe measure - spearheaded by Democratic Sens. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Sinema - is not technically a rules change. Instead, it's a temporary process change that would only be in effect through the end of next year. It also includes an exception for members of the joint chiefs and combatant commanders, positions which typically involve individual floor votes in the Senate due to their importance.\n\n\"This is a suspension of the rules technically,\" Reed, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, told NBC News. \"We have to move forward,\" he added, noting that military personnel were being left \"in limbo\" amid the Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nThe proposed resolution comes as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has pressed to advance a vote on three of President Joe Biden's nominees, including the Marine Corps' second-in-command, Lt. Gen. Christopher Mahoney, the chief of naval operations and the Air Force chief of staff.\n\nSchumer called Mahoney's appointment \"urgent,\" after the Marine Corps' commandant, Gen. Eric Smith, was hospitalized due to a medical emergency over the weekend.\n\nOn Wednesday, Schumer told reporters he will call for moving forward with Reed's resolution.\n\n\"What happened with the Marine commandant just showed many people how dangerous what Tuberville is doing is. And so, I will call for a resolution on the floor to allow us to vote on all these people at once,\" Schumer said.\n\nThe resolution would have to go through the Senate Rules Committee. It would also require 60 votes to pass on the Senate floor. No Senate Republicans have come out and said explicitly that they would support such a move.\n\n\"I don't want to, let's just put it like that,\" Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, told NBC News on Wednesday. \"I do not want to, and I think that we need to take every avenue possible to avoid it. And then let's take every avenue first and then we'll debate the next move.\"\n\nSen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, told reporters that military personnel were \"being punished over policies that they they have no hand in.\"\n\nSullivan, a former Marine, added that \"even if they got confirmed\" they \"would have no ability to change\" those policies.\n\n\"That these guys are woke? It's bull----. Such bull----,\" he said. \"These are warriors.\"\n\nIn a notable intraparty escalation, Republicans on Wednesday went to the floor for the first time to try and unanimously approve a group of high-level military promotions, a tactic that Tuberville has objected to. The move mirrors attempts Senate Democrats have made in past months to try and do the same, and marks a significant shift for Tuberville's Republican colleagues who, until Wednesday, had not publicly rebuffed his holds on the Senate floor.\n\n\"One of the things that I can't understand is if you require our military to be subordinate to the people above them in the civilian world, why would you punish them for something they've got nothing to do with,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on the Senate floor before attempting to confirm a promotion for Maj. Gen. Laura Lenderman.\n\nTuberville objected to the attempt, saying, \"If senators want to vote on these nominees one by one, I'm all in. I'm happy to do that. But I will keep my hold in place until the Pentagon follows the law or the Democrats change the law.\"\n\n\"You've just denied this lady a promotion. You did that,\" Graham responded.\n\nThe floor fight between Tuberville and his GOP colleagues lasted about four-and-a-half hours, with Tuberville objecting to each of the 60 military nominations brought to the floor.\n\nTuberville, who tried to force a vote on Mahoney , said Republicans voting to circumvent his holds would be \"suicide for some of them.\"\n\n\"They've gotta vote for their constituents, they don't vote for themselves,\" Tuberville told NBC News before the floor fight. \"See, I don't understand that. I mean, you're either pro-life or you're not, and so if they vote against this it's gonna be suicide for some of them. Let them do it.\"\n\nThe change to the procedures for the military promotions sought by Senate Democrats would need the support of nine Senate Republicans if all 51 senators who align with Democrats support it. Some Republicans are skittish on changing the rules, even if they support the end result.\n\n\"I'm always really circumspect about changing the rules here for a specific situation,\" Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, told NBC News.\n\nMurkowski said that a \"failure\" to process the nominations bears an impact on national security and preparedness.\n\n\"I think it impacts morale,\" she added. \"And at a time when we call on our military to do so much, I don't want to unduly degrade their situation. So I'd like to see a resolve to this.\"\n\nTuberville's holds do not prohibit the promotions from being taken up for a vote, but it slows down the process significantly for each of the nominees.\n\nDemocrats have largely dismissed calls from Republicans to consider the promotions one-by-one, arguing that such a process is untenable and that the Senate should follow what has been a customary process of approving the promotions in batches.\n\nFrank Thorp V is a producer and off-air reporter covering Congress for NBC News, managing coverage of the Senate.\n\nJulie Tsirkin is a correspondent covering Capitol Hill.\n\nKate Santaliz is an associate producer for NBC News' Capitol Hill team.\n\nZoë Richards is a politics reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Tommy Tuberville âone hundred percentâ backs Alabama embryo decision\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nOXON HILL, Md. â Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala. endorsed his state Supreme Courtâs ruling that fertilized embryos are children, telling Semafor that the justices were âone hundred percentâ correct in a decision that had paused the use of in vitro fertilization.\n\nâWeâre talking about life, and when it comes to anything to do with life, weâve got to protect it,â Tuberville told Semafor before speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\nIn the case, decided last week, Alabamaâs Supreme Court determined that the accidental destruction of fertilized embryos violated the state Wrongful Death Act. âThatâs a situation that you never would really think about,â Tuberville said, âbut when you start hearing about that, youâve got to say â wait a minute. That canât be happening.â\n\nTuberville, who led a months-long blockade of military nominees in an attempt to change a Biden administration abortion policy, said that the IVF issue should be decided by states; he did not see an obvious federal policy response. Asked about the effect the decision was having on women who had begun to go IVF treatment in Alabama, he demurred.\n\nâI donât know enough about how that works,â Tuberville said. âI just know the reasoning for a lot of it, and itâs just unfortunate.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nFew Republicans have stuck their necks out on the Alabama decision, which cited the Old Testament as it found a right to life for embryos that are often discarded. On Wednesday, after Nikki Haley told NBC News that she agreed with the decision â âEmbryos, to me, are babiesâ â the Trump campaign had no reaction.\n\nThatâs of a piece with how Trump has handled issues around abortion, in the first presidential election since Roe v. Wade was overturned. In public, heâs promised vaguely that heâll come up with a popular position; in private , according to the New York Times, heâs said that he might back a 16-week limit. But he has not discussed the Alabama case, and in his only interview since the decision was handed down on Feb. 16 â a Fox News town hall in South Carolina â he wasnât asked about it.\n\nBanning a widely used fertility treatment is a complicated issue for the anti-abortion movement and rarely talked about or prioritized in political campaigns. One of the few Republicans openly endorsing the Alabama courtâs reasoning is a home state senator with no serious threat to reelection. The National Republican Senatorial Committee told Playbook after the ruling that none of its candidates endorse banning IVF.\n\nIn Politico , Matt Berg recaps reactions to the Alabama decision from Republican governors, who gathered in D.C. on Thursday for media interviews. âYou have a lot of people out there in this country that they wouldnât have children if it werenât for that,â said Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nâWhite nationalists are racists,â Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala. said on Tuesday afternoon after a months-long saga in which he pointedly refused to say just that.\n\nTuberville became the center of a spectacle on Capitol Hill that morning as the former football coach continued to dispute whether white nationalists were racist, drawing rebukes from members of both parties.\n\nThe story began with a May public radio interview in which he said the Pentagon was playing politics with the military by preventing white nationalists from joining the American armed forces. âWell, they call them that,â he said. âI call them Americans.â\n\nIn a CNN interview on Monday night, Tuberville was asked to clarify the remarks and said he rejected racism. But he later suggested that white nationalists werenât by definition racists, despite many repeated attempts by CNNâs Kaitlan Collins to explain the meaning of the term. âWell, thatâs your opinion,â he said.\n\nA day later, he only dug in. âIâm totally against racism,â he told reporters. âIf the Democrats want to say that white nationalists are racists, Iâm totally against that, too.â\n\nSenators on both sides of the aisle denounced the comments, including Tubervilleâs fellow senator from Alabama. âWhite supremacy and racism have absolutely no place in our country, period,â Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., told reporters. âThe end.â\n\nSen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., called on Tuberville to apologize. âWhite nationalism is racism, by definition,â he told reporters. âItâs not a matter of opinion. For the senator to play games with this is dangerous stuff. He should apologize and change course.â\n\nBoth Senate leaders addressed his remarks: Majority Leader Chuck Schumer denounced them in a floor speech while Minority Leader Mitch McConnell rejected Tubervilleâs position at his weekly presser.\n\nâWhite supremacy is simply unacceptable in our military and in our entire country,â McConnell said.\n\nIn this article:\n\nWhite nationalists are racist. Itâs pretty simple. You can read more about the kinds of cases the military is concerned about in a 2020 report drafted under the Trump administration, which highlighted servicemembers with direct affiliations to neo-Nazi groups or who participated in the deadly 2017 Charlottesville march.\n\nTubervilleâs comments on the topic have been confusing as well as shocking, and at points raised questions about whether he actually understood that the term âwhite nationalistâ is a phrase specifically used to describe individuals who believe in domination by the white race, rather than patriotic white people in general.\n\nâIf youâre gonna do away with most white people in this country out of the military weâre going to have huge problems,â he told Collins at one point in their interview.\n\nFew Republicans were eager to defend Tuberville, and those who did attached copious caveats.\n\nâIf youâre asking me do I think white nationalism is a good thing? No. Do I think that we ought to be encouraging white nationalists in the military? No,â GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri told Semafor, who said that Tuberville has discussed the issue in Senate GOP lunches. âNow what I think Tommy is saying â Okay, you have to ask him â but hereâs what he said to me is that he thinks that what the military bureaucracy is doing is theyâre labeling people in the military who are good, patriotic, probably Trump supporters, theyâre labeling them as white nationalists and he disagrees with that. That to me, thatâs a whole different deal.â\n\nTubervilleâs concession Tuesday came as an apparent relief to some members of his party. âI think Senator Tuberville has indicated that he meant no white supremacy element to his comment or anything of a racial nature,â Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah told Semafor. âAnd Iâm sure thatâs the case for the rest of us. So a miscommunication.â\n\nTuberville has been accused of racism in the past. Last fall, he made remarks at a rally criticizing Democratic policies on crime that appeared to equate descendants of enslaved Black Americans to criminals.\n\nâThey want crime,â he said. âThey want crime because they want to take over what you got. They want to control what you have. They want reparation because they think that people that do the crime are owed that. Bullshit! They are not owed that.â\n\nTuberville said later he was not referring to âreparationsâ as in proposals to compensate Black Americans for past slavery and discrimination. âTo me, reparation means that people think they deserve something,â he told Insider . âIt has nothing to do with slavery or anything like that.â\n\nThis is only the latest in a handful of recent controversies involving Republican members of Congress and white nationalism.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. defended speaking at a white nationalist conference in 2022 organized by Nick Fuentes, a Nazi sympathizer who also dined with Donald Trump last year. âIâm not inviting anybody into my home or my personal life or befriending them,â she told Semafor . âI want to spread the right message to anyone thatâs willing to listen to me.â Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz. attended the event in 2021 and recorded a video message in 2022, the second time saying he was not aware of the footageâs intended use.\n\nIn 2019, Speaker Kevin McCarthy effectively kicked former Rep. Steve King out of the GOP conference after he asked : âWhite nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization â how did that language become offensive?â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Why three senators may leave Washington to run for governor\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nAs Michael Bennet weighs whether to run for governor, his fellow Colorado Democratic senator is offering some advice.\n\nâHe could win,â John Hickenlooper told Semafor, and âcould be a greatâ chief executive of their state. Hickenlooper has also warned Bennet that being a governor is âmore granularâ than being a senator, and that âI think he might be bored.â\n\nHickenlooper speaks from experience, having served two terms in the job Bennet is now considering a bid for. And if Bennet decides to leave Congress to seek his home stateâs governorship, he might not be alone.\n\nTwo Republican senators, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, are also eyeing gubernatorial campaigns in 2026 â Blackburn appears ready to launch her campaign any day now. After former Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., gave up a safe seat last year to run for governor, the long-running governor-to-Senate pipeline may be starting to reverse.\n\nItâs a reasonable time for senators to reassess their power, with Trump strong-arming Congress in his second term as the ideological middle of both parties shrinks. Governors, by contrast, deal with constituentsâ daily lives in a way that can feel more gratifying than the Senateâs arcane fights over legislative processes.\n\nIn evaluating whether to leave the Senate, Braun reasoned it would take too long to accomplish the big things he wanted to do. Asked this week which job is superior, an aide to the governor said Braun âcertainly likes this one better.â\n\nAs for his future plans, the third-term Bennet would only say heâs âthinking about where I can be the most help to Colorado and make the biggest difference for Colorado.â\n\nCongress is also objectively harder to navigate from the party out of power, a condition Bennet is now looking at for at least two years (and maybe more; both Tuberville and Blackburn exited minority-party status just weeks ago).\n\nTuberville was candid about his experience in the Senate so far.\n\nâI was sick of the first four years,â Tuberville told Semafor. He said being in the majority is a âlot betterâ and said âwherever I can help people in Alabama the most is what Iâm going to do. I could go either way.â\n\nWhile none of the three have made official decisions yet, Blackburn sounds the closest to jumping in.\n\nâIâm finalizing my plans to run for governor and will be the strongest conservative candidate in the race,â Blackburn told Semafor. âThis is our time to prove what conservative leadership can do as power for education, regulation, health care and benefits return to the states. This is the time for Tennessee to be Americaâs conservative leader.â\n\nEven if the trio leaves the Senate for governorships, the trend will still cut against them. A dozen former governors are serving in the Senate, with just three former senators serving as governor. Two of them lost Senate seats before winning governorships.\n\nIn this article:\n\nSenators often consider gubernatorial runs. They rarely follow through.\n\nSens. John Kennedy, R-La., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, both kicked the tires on the idea. So did former Sen. Joe Manchin, I-W.Va, who had already served as governor. Just recently, Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., looked at a gubernatorial race before concluding his seniority and influence was more impactful in D.C.\n\nâI realize what a privileged place I have here, to be able to do good things for the state of New Mexico. And itâs not a state where your senator doesnât matter. Itâs a state where it really matters,â Heinrich said after deciding he wanted to stay in the Senate.\n\nStill, the Senate can be a tough place for people with ambition but no room to move up. Bennet still isnât in line to chair a top committee and is not in party leadership. He already ran for president and chaired the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nSo Hickenlooper gets where Bennetâs coming from.\n\nâHe understands what this building deals with at a deeper level than almost any other senator. So heâd have to be pretty frustrated and unhappy, and he clearly is,â Hickenlooper said.\n\nFor the two Republican senators, it could also boil down to what Trump wants. Tuberville said he plans to talk to the president before making his decision â which is slightly more weighty than Blackburnâs and Bennetâs, because his Senate term is also up next year.\n\nAlabama Lt. Gov. Will Ainsworth may also run for governor, even if Tuberville does too. A Trump endorsement for Tuberville would probably be decisive in any primary, though his fellow Alabama Sen. Katie Britt said a departure from Congress would âbe completely his choice.â\n\nUnlike Tuberville, both Bennet and Blackburn could run with no immediate risk to their Senate seats, which are up in 2028 and 2030, respectively. Blackburn seems to be on a collision course with Rep. John Rose, R-Tenn., whoâs made no secret of his gubernatorial aspirations â and a Trump endorsement could also change those dynamics.\n\nâSheâll decide whatâs best for her and whatâs best for the state,â said Sen.

And Tuberville sounds legitimately undecided.\n\nNo matter what they choose, I am not surprised that people are itching to get out of the Senate â itâs not exactly a bastion of dealmaking at the moment.

Abigail Spanberger, D-Va. says her vet-heavy district is fuming over Sen. Tommy Tubervilleâs âoutrageousâ hold on hundreds of military promotions in protest of a Pentagon abortion policy.\n\nSpanberger, whose district includes the Marine Corps Base Quantico, said Tubervilleâs blockade has come up at town halls and veterans events over the recess period. âIn the event that he would better understand it in a football analogy: If we were to take his quarterback and his entire offensive line off the football field, would he still be ready to win games?â she told Semafor.\n\nTuberville spokesman Steven Stafford dismissed the notion that the hold impacts national security. âThe analogy doesnât work because acting officials are in all these roles. No jobs are open. We still have an offensive line, and in many places theyâre the same people who have been nominated to fill the role permanently,â he told Semafor.\n\nSpanberger described one constituent who told her he was supposed to be transferred to another base but was stuck on desk duty due to the promotion blockade.\n\nâHeâs telling me, I think Iâm just going to sit at the Pentagon until this is done,â she said.\n\nTuberville has single handedly prevented the quick confirmation of military promotions over the Pentagonâs policy of paying for the travel costs of service members who travel to get abortions â with no end in sight. Heâs demanded the Pentagon rescind the policy and the Senate instead vote on equivalent legislation. âIt has to go through Congress,â Tuberville told NewsNationâs Leland Vittert earlier this week.\n\nThe secretaries of the Army, Navy and Air Force accused him of âputting our national security at riskâ in a joint op-ed this week, saying the hold was causing disruption and financial harm for officers caught in limbo and their families, some of whom were forced to maintain two residences in the interim.\n\nSpanberger said the Pentagon should not change its policy, arguing doing so would set a bad precedent. But she acknowledged that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer may ultimately need to start putting nominations on the floor one at a time for votes, even at the cost of valuable floor time. âNo, itâs not ideal; Yes, itâs unprecedented,â she said.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Senate Republicans give Houseâs debt ceiling plan cold shoulder\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nSenate Republicans are raising grave doubts about House Republicansâ plan to raise the debt ceiling as part of a massive tax cuts and border spending bill, a dynamic that could lead to a protracted negotiation with Democrats over avoiding a default.\n\nWith roughly two or three months before the US could breach the debt ceiling, the House is trying to raise it by $4 trillion as part of a party-line tax cut bill. However, Senate Majority Leader John Thune has repeatedly told his members he doesnât believe it can win the 50 Republican votes needed to clear the chamber, according to multiple sources familiar with party meetings.\n\nSen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., warned that tying the debt ceiling to tax cuts âmight just sabotage the whole bill.â And Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., recounted telling GOP leaders that âIâll vote for the tax cuts and to make them permanent, I donât support raising the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.â\n\nâThereâs a lot of angst generally about using reconciliation for debt ceiling for a variety of reasons. I think thatâs gonna be hard to do,â said another Republican senator, granted anonymity to speak freely. âYou gotta rely on Republican votes and Republican votes alone. And there is so much bound up in that that I donât see reconciliation as a likely vehicle for raising the debt ceiling.â\n\nAs Republicans try to wrap up a messy campaign to simply fund the government past Friday, they are now preparing to confront an even more consequential deadline. And it all comes as stock markets are down, economic uncertainty is up and everyone is watching President Donald Trumpâs tariff regime. Most lawmakers think the debt ceiling will need to be raised sometime around May or June.\n\nMarkets pay even closer attention to the debt ceiling than government funding deadlines; getting too close to a breach can harm the countryâs credit rating. Trump sought to avoid this whole fight last December when he asked for Congress to end the debt ceiling altogether before he became president, a request that came too late.\n\nNow the two chambers are in a standoff, stuck between two tough choices: Negotiate with Democrats and potentially offer them concessions on federal spending â or try to go it alone and make a whole bunch of Republicans who have never voted for a debt ceiling increase walk the plank, while potentially tying that uncertain vote to the meat of Trumpâs agenda.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson and Trump already convinced House Republicans to support a budget setting up a $4 trillion debt ceiling increase. Actually enacting it across the Capitol will prove much more difficult.\n\nâThatâs certainly what the President wants. Now, you know, weâre dealing with the Senate,â said Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Mo. âAll things are on the table right now because weâre obviously having to deal with what they can pass and, more importantly, what we can pass.â\n\nSome GOP senators and aides say the budget reconciliation option could be a useful backup plan if talks with Democrats arenât going anywhere. Notably, though, doing it through the complex party-line process requires Congress to raise the debt ceiling to a specific number, instead of suspending it for a period of months or years. That makes conservatives even more skeptical.\n\nIn this article:\n\nSome Republicans, like Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., want to get rid of the debt ceiling altogether to avoid this exercise every few years. Some progressive Democrats would be OK with that, too.\n\nBut Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who routinely votes to advance debt ceiling increases past a filibuster, disagrees. âI donât want to do away with the debt ceiling,â she said.\n\nThere are plenty of creative ideas about how to deal with the debt ceiling, which some lawmakers see as a crucial leverage point and others see as an anachronistic headache. In 2021, Democrats and Republicans slipped in a one-time filibuster exemption to allow the debt ceiling to increase. In 2023, House Republicans capped some spending as a condition of raising the limit.\n\nA staunch fiscal conservative, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., told Semafor he could get behind a debt ceiling lift as part of a budget reconciliation package. But he warned that it would need to contain more substantial cuts than the $1.5 trillion over 10 years the Houseâs budget currently calls for.\n\nâWhat President Trump needs to do is he needs to get serious about spending. The House has to get serious about spending,â Johnson said. âA lot of us who have never voted for increasing the debt ceiling are on the record saying we will, if we have a sufficient spending reduction.â\n\nDemocrats are similarly doubtful that House Republicans will be able to do everything they want on taxes, the border and spending cuts while simultaneously raising the debt ceiling on a short turnaround. Asked if he anticipated a bipartisan negotiation this year, Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., said: âI think thereâs a good chance.â\n\nâThe more you make their cuts specific, the harder itâs going to be. Dealing with SALT, cuts to Medicaid, thereâs just a lot of mines that they could easily step on â and debt ceiling is one of those,â Himes said.\n\nWe read a lot of the same coverage you do, and government shutdown deadlines are always treated as major fire drills. Yet Congress tips over that cliff every few years, and though thereâs often some economic fallout, a debt ceiling crisis is plainly worse.\n\nThatâs why a lot of the senators and House members weâve been talking to the last few months routinely point to the debt ceiling as the central challenge for lawmakers during Trumpâs second term. As Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., put it in February to one of us: âYou look back a year from now â if Iâm wrong, Iâll certainly admit it â but I think the debt ceiling, so long as we canât address it in reconciliation, is going to be our toughest issue.â\n\nThereâs not a ton to be gained by raising the debt ceiling, but failure to do so could cripple the economy â and Trumpâs agenda. This is the big fight, and itâs already playing out across the Republican-controlled Congress.\n\nThe support for a stopgap spending bill â something conservatives usually hate â among House Republicans is making some lawmakers optimistic about the prospects of dealing with the debt ceiling on the GOP side.\n\nâA lot of it is going to be trust in the Trump administrationâs willingness and ability to go and curb spending,â said Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Mich. âItâs the exact debate thatâs happening right now: People who have never voted for a CR, saying, âWell, Iâm willing to do so because of â¦ what the presidentâs done.ââ\n\nHouse Budget Chair Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, is arguing to Senate leaders that marrying the House budgetâs proposed cuts with a debt ceiling increase is what got the whole thing to pass the chamber. Itâs a reminder that the Houseâs narrow margins have to be a consideration for the Senate, as well.\n\nâPeople were willing to raise the debt limit on account of the fiscal reforms,â Arrington said. âThatâs why I would encourage them to take the framework as it is; donât screw up the balance of nature in the universe over here on account of making any material changes to that.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Trumpâs Labor pick will need unusual help to get confirmed\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nLori Chavez-DeRemer is going to need help from Rand Paul, Democrats, or both if she wants to become Donald Trumpâs labor secretary. Sheâs about to get a preview of how hard that may be.\n\nThe former Republican congresswoman is already boxed in ahead of her confirmation hearing this week before the Senateâs Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. She has more bipartisan appeal than most other Trump nominees, but the committeeâs membership and growing Democratic outrage at Trump are complicating her path to the Cabinet.\n\nPaul, R-Ky., is a senior committee member and Chavez-DeRemer opponent for now, citing her support of the pro-union PRO Act while she served in the House. Sheâs finding fewer Democratic fans than she might have hoped for, too, as the party protests Trumpâs moves to unilaterally dismantle huge portions of the federal government.\n\nâYou can do the numbers,â Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., who chairs the committee overseeing her nomination, told Semafor. âWe need a majority. We need somebody else to vote if Randâs going to vote negative â¦ Rand is a chair of the right-to-work caucus. So once he establishes something, itâs hard to move him off.â\n\nCassidy said heâll try to sway Paul on Chavez-DeRemer, but Democratic support may be an easier path. The committeeâs 11 Democrats include several with bipartisan inclinations, and Chavez-DeRemer will have to convince some of them that sheâll stand up for the Labor Department even if Trump comes for it â one of the last flashpoints left as Trump stocks his adviser ranks with loyalists.\n\nSome Democrats on the committee are already against her. Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., said he had a âgood conversationâ with Chavez-DeRemer but questioned whether anyone at the administration would listen to the labor secretary. His bottom line: âIâm not supporting nominees as long as the lawlessness continues.â\n\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., was even more blunt: âIâm a hard no on her. And itâs not a protest vote. Itâs about her character and commitment to the Constitution. She didnât bow out of this job when she found out Trump was going to force her to act illegally.â\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, the top Democrat on the committee, and former chair Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., both said theyâll wait for the hearing before commenting. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., said sheâs not ruling out a yes vote just yet: âIâll give her a fair shake.â\n\nAsked about Democrats souring on all Trump nominations as he steamrolls over Congress, she said: âThere are folks with sentiment. I try to view each nominee through the lens of whether they will help or hurt Wisconsin.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nTrumpâs trio of most controversial nominees took a different path than Chavez-DeRemer. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, intelligence director Tulsi Gabbard and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. all relied on GOP muscle to overcome unanimous Democratic resistance in both committee and the floor.\n\nSen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who does not serve on the labor committee, told Semafor heâll support Chavez-DeRemer, which means she could lose four Republicans and still be confirmed on the floor. She does not yet have a Democratic supporter on the committee, but Republicans are warming to her.\n\nâIâll support her,â said Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan. âI love it that weâre bringing a little different voice than most Republican administrations would have.â\n\nEven Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., who introduced a national-right-to-work bill with Paul, said he could be swayed by her hearing if she emphasizes sheâs âpro-right-to-work.â Tuberville predicted âsheâll be fineâ as long as her hearing goes well.\n\nâI hope sheâs not in trouble. If Republicans vote against her, I think that that will signal that the moment of cooperation between Senate Republicans and the White House is over,â said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., one of the partyâs most pro-labor members. âOnce you have a break on one, youâre going to get a break on all the other stuff too,â\n\nIf Chavez-DeRemer were to lose another committee Republican beyond Paul, it could be a big problem. Nominees can move to the floor with a non-favorable recommendation in the Senate, but itâs rare. Republicans were able to avoid that outcome on Gabbard, even as they weighed it as a back-up option.\n\nFetterman voted against several of Trumpâs nominees. But Chavez-DeRemer seems like a slam dunk for him.\n\nâIs she controversial now? She was very pro-labor and supported the Pro Act, and I plan to vote yes, until they find a way that sheâs controversial and turn it into more drama,â he told Semafor.\n\nRand Paul can be hard to move, but Iâm skeptical Chavez-DeRemer will be bottled up even if he holds firm against her. Recall that Paul flipped his vote on Mike Pompeo to be secretary of state in the Foreign Relations Committee back in 2018 â a vote that also included a âpresentâ vote from Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., to help things along.\n\nBottom line: Chavez-DeRemer is the type of nominee who would sail through under normal circumstances. Democrats see Trumpâs first few weeks as anything but that, yet itâs also hard to imagine any Chavez-DeRemer replacement being an improvement in their eyes.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Top Republicans call on Biden to resign from office as well\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, President Joe Biden announced, after weeks of pressure from his party, that he would be dropping out of the presidential race. For Republicans, thatâs not enough: They want him to resign from the presidency, too.\n\nâIf Joe Biden is not fit to run for President, he is not fit to serve as President,â House Speaker Mike Johnson tweeted . âHe must resign the office immediately.â\n\nTrump campaign managerâs Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles echoed the call in a statement calling Biden âa national security threat in great cognitive decline.â\n\nâJoe Biden cannot take himself out of a campaign for President because he is too mentally incompetent and still remain in the White House,â the two wrote.\n\nItâs quickly become a widespread call among Republicans, with the argument being that if Biden is incapable of running for re-election, heâs also not fit to continue serving as president.\n\nSteve Daines, chairman of the NRSC, argued that if Biden âis no longer capable of running for re-election, he is no longer capable of serving as President.â Sen. Rick Scott , Sarah Huckabee Sanders , Elise Stefanik , Tommy Tuberville , Jim Banks , and others echoed the messaging.\n\nThere were some exceptions. Rep. Mike Lawler, running in a swing seat in New York, stopped short of a call to resign. And Sen. Mitt Romney, a longtime Trump critic, praised Bidenâs decision while thanking him for his work on bipartisan initiatives together.\n\nâOthers will judge his presidency,â Romney said. âHowever, having worked with him these past few years, I respect President Biden. His decision to withdraw from the race was right and is in the best interest of the country.â\n\nSen. Joe Manchin, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, said on Sunday that he had â all the confidence in the world â in Bidenâs ability to remain president during a CBS News interview in which he also called on Biden to drop out of the race. He argued Biden would be able to devote his full focus to the job, rather than have his attention divided by campaigning.\n\nIn this article:\n\nThis argument has been quietly brewing within the Republican Party for weeks â at last weekâs RNC Convention, I heard countless discussions about the Biden debacle, and whether he was fit to keep serving. The consensus was always the same: If he dropped out, it was an indication that he wasnât capable of continuing for even six more months and Democrats should be forced to make the case otherwise.\n\nTo be clear, team Trump started off this drama with the belief that Biden wouldnât step down. And, in many ways, they didnât want him to, seeing a politically wounded, elderly candidate whose own party had lost faith in him as an easy opponent to defeat.\n\nBut, as the reality that Biden might actually step down soaked in, the Trump campaign decided to take it in stride. They trolled Democrats with quotes about an attempted âcoupâ by party leaders âÂ a not-so-subtle riff on the criticisms Trump received for trying to overturn the 2020 election âÂ while boasting that Kamala Harris would be even easier to defeat.\n\nAfter Biden made his announcement, the Trump campaign worked quickly to tie Harris to Biden. It was a continuation of the messaging theyâd been floating over the past week â at the RNC Convention, for example, LaCivita pointed out how theyâd attack her as âthe border tsarâ who was tasked with presiding over immigration.\n\nâKamala Harris is just as much of a joke as Biden is. Harris will be even WORSE for the people of our Nation than Joe Biden,â he wrote, alongside Wiles, on Sunday.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Republican senators giving âundefinedâ Gabbard a chance on Syria\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nRepublican senators have lots of questions about Tulsi Gabbardâs record on Syria. That doesnât mean those views are disqualifying for her push to join Donald Trumpâs administration.\n\nGabbard is stepping up her confirmation push this week on the Hill, taking meetings with senators that coincide with the fall of Bashar al-Assadâs regime in Syria. In 2017, the former Hawaii congresswoman Gabbard met with Assad; two years later, she said he is ânot the enemy of the United States.â\n\nThose views are drawing heightened scrutiny after Assadâs ouster from power over the weekend, piquing the interest of Republicans whose votes she needs to become Trumpâs director of national intelligence.\n\nâTo a lot of people, and I would put myself in that position, sheâs too undefined to really form an opinion [on], so she needs to get outâ and meet with more senators, said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., a member of party leadership.\n\nâSheâs quoted as saying, â[Assadâs] not an enemy of the U.S.â Letâs flesh that out. I will reserve opinion untilâ meeting with her, Capito added.\n\nGabbard is just beginning to make the rounds in the Senate, earning the support of some Republicans and plaudits from Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa. While she still has a lot of work to do to win 50 votes, she has not taken on as much public flak as other Trump nominees â defense secretary nominee Pete Hegseth and former attorney general pick Matt Gaetz in particular.\n\nA onetime Democratic congresswoman and military veteran with a doveish view on foreign policy, Gabbard also faces questions about her sympathetic views toward Russia, whose leader Vladimir Putin is a longtime Assad ally. But given the timing of her confirmation push, Syria is front and center.\n\nNotably, Gabbard aligned her view of Syria with Trumpâs on Monday. In a statement released by the president-electâs transition, she said she âwholeheartedlyâ agrees with Trumpâs anti-interventionist position on Syria; the transition said the two are in âlockstep.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nSen. John Kennedy, R-La., who is also meeting with Gabbard this week, said that heâs going to discuss Syria in depth with Gabbard but doesnât expect anyone to make policy other than Trump. And that means if Gabbardâs views clash with those of some Republicans, thatâs OK.\n\nâForeign policy, based on what Iâve seen so far, is going to be set by one person, President Trump. And I donât think his nominees for any position are going to have the latitude that they think they might have,â Kennedy said. âI donât know the context in which she said these things. I mean, foreign policy is complex and itâs nuanced.â\n\nSen. John Cornyn, R-Texas â a member of the Intelligence Committee, which will review her nomination â said he plans to ask her directly about Syria during their forthcoming meeting.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis is even more deferential. Since heâs not on the Intelligence panel, Tillis said the Syria issue is going to be left to its members, who are âeither going to draw a conclusion that itâs an issue, or not.â\n\nThough heâs a big Ukraine supporter, Tillis didnât seem bothered by her views there on Russiaâs war against Kyiv: âSheâs not the president. Thatâs a discussion I need to have with the president. Sheâs not setting policy, sheâs aggregating intelligence information.â\n\nTwo Trump-aligned senators said Gabbardâs past interactions and comments with Assad are being over-interpreted by her skeptics.\n\nSen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., said senators meet with foreign leaders of all stripes all the time: âThey make way too much about this stuff.â\n\nAnd Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., criticized those who have suggested sheâs a tool of authoritarian governments.\n\nâMaybe the worst parlor game in this town is, if you disagree with peopleâs policy positions, you refer to them as a Russian asset. I think itâs totally unfair. Itâs a slur to her,â Schmitt told Semafor. âSheâs going to be asked a lot of those questions, but I think sheâs a good fit.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Sen.-elect Tommy Tuberville botches history facts, including three branches of government\n\nWASHINGTON - Incoming Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R- Ala., botched several basic historical facts during a recent interview - such as misidentifying the three branches of government.\n\nTuberville, the former Auburn football coach who won his Senate race on Nov. 3 by defeating incumbent Democratic Sen. Doug Jones, did an interview on Thursday with The Alabama Daily News after he attended orientation in D.C. for new senators.\n\nHe was asked whether he thought the GOP could utilize their potential majority in the Senate to pass legislation as Democrats will control the House of Representatives and the White House. This prompted Tuberville to answer he doesn't care \"if you're a Republican or Democrat\" and that he's been given a mandate to help people.\n\n\"Our government wasn't set up for one group to have all three branches of government - wasn't set up that way,\" Tuberville continued, saying incorrectly: \"You know, the House, the Senate, and the executive.\"\n\nElection updates: Trump singles out New York for vaccine criticism in first remarks in days\n\nThose are not the three branches of government. As laid out in the Constitution , the three branches of the federal government are: the legislative, which includes both the Senate and House; the executive, which includes the presidency, and the judicial, which includes the Supreme Court.\n\nThat wasn't the only historical flub in the interview.\n\nTuberville also misidentified what America fought against in World War II. When asked about the biggest takeaways from the election, Tuberville stated he was concerned that President-elect Joe Biden had promoted a vision that Tuberville claimed \"leads more to a socialist type of government.\"\n\n\"That's concerning to me, that we're to the point now where we've got almost half the country voting for something that this country wasn't built on,\" Tuberville said. \"I tell people, my dad fought 76 years ago in Europe to free Europe of socialism.\"\n\nHowever, World War II was a global battle against fascism, and, in fact, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, known as the U.S.S.R. or Soviet Union , fought alongside the United States as part of the Allied powers.\n\nBackstory: We investigated claims of voter fraud in the election. Here's what we found.\n\nAdditionally, Biden is a mainstream, centrist Democrat and does not identify with socialism.\n\nTuberville also inaccurately said that former Vice President Al Gore, who was the Democratic presidential nominee in 2000, was called the president-elect for 30 days during the infamous legal battle over a recount in Florida.\n\nNeither Gore nor Republican nominee George W. Bush were considered the president-elect during that process , as neither were determined to have clearly won enough votes to secure the presidency.\n\nTuberville also asserted that he plans to use his new Senate office to fundraise for the two Republican senators from Georgia who are now facing crucial runoff elections that will determine control of Senate.\n\nPolitical fundraising out of a federal office building, and using official federal resources for campaign purposes, is barred by Senate ethics rules."

      "text": "We knew Tommy Tuberville was incompetent, but insulting leader of the Marines is galling\n\nTommy Tuberville's incompetence would be laughable if it wasn't so dangerous. And, now, offensive.\n\nNot content with hamstringing the military by holding up promotions, the Republican senator from Alabama has stooped to insulting high-ranking officers, too, having the audacity to liken the stress a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff faces with what he endured as a college football coach.\n\nYou read that right. Tuberville thinks working 18 hours a day drawing up defensive schemes and mucking up his offensive coordinator's game plan is comparable to the 18-plus hours a day Gen. Eric Smith was working to protect the United States, our allies and, most importantly, the young men and women who serve.\n\nSmith, who is both the No. 1 and No. 2 person at the U.S. Marine Corps because of Tuberville's performative antics, was hospitalized Sunday after an apparent heart attack .\n\n\"He's got 2,000 people who work for him, OK? And somebody said he's working 18 hours a day. Jack Reed blamed me for his heart attack,\" Tuberville said Thursday, referring to the Rhode Island senator who, unlike Tuberville, knows a little about the demands of military service after being a platoon leader, company commander and battalion officer during eight years of active duty in the U.S. Army.\n\n\"Come on, give me a break,\" Tuberville continued. \"This guy's going to work 18, 20 hours a day no matter what. That's what we do. You know, I did that for years because you've got to get the job done.\"\n\nAh yes. The life-and-death decisions Smith has to make are exactly the same as what Tuberville faced when he had third-and-eight in the red zone and was trailing by five. Or needed to hire a new running backs coach.\n\nYep. Exactly the same.\n\nTuberville's arrogance in comparing his former job to that of Smith's doesn't come as a surprise, sadly. This is someone who had the hubris to think he was up to the task of being a U.S. Senator despite no previous record of public service. And no, being a football coach at a public university doesn't count, even in SEC country.\n\nIt was obvious Tuberville neither understood the gravity of his new position nor cared to try when, shortly after he was elected, he described the three branches of government as \"the House, the Senate and the executive.\" They are, as any third-grader can tell you, the legislative, judicial and executive.\n\nHad Tuberville simply cast the occasional vote and collected his $174,000 salary - \"every dime\" of which he once promised to donate to veterans, mind you, but apparently has not - his presence in the Senate still would have been an embarrassment. But it wouldn't have been catastrophic.\n\nWhich is what it's become.\n\nSince February, Tuberville has blocked almost all officer promotions to protest the Pentagon's policy of allowing service members to receive reimbursement if they travel out-of-state for abortion care. Aside from his \"pro-life\" status being a farce - he's on-record as being against Medicare for all and supporting the death penalty, among other things - Tuberville's histrionics are the equivalent of using a blowtorch to light a campfire.\n\nThe officers he is blocking are not the authors of this policy, the White House is. If Tuberville has a problem with it, he should take it up with the Biden Administration.\n\nBut that wouldn't get him the headlines and MAGA adulation he craves.\n\n\"I cannot simply sit idly by while the Biden Administration injects politics in our military,\" Tuberville said Wednesday night, the irony of his statement apparently lost on him.\n\nBy blocking appointments, both as a group and individually, the man who likes to claim \"there is no one more military\" is actively undermining the readiness of our armed forces at a time when wars are raging in both Ukraine and Israel.\n\nDon't take my word for it. In an op-ed in the Washington Post in September, the secretaries of the Army, Navy and Air Force said the United States' traditional military superiority was being \"actively eroded\" by Tuberville's stunt.\n\n\"It is putting our national security at risk,\" the secretaries wrote.\n\n\"These jobs - and dozens of others across the force - are being performed by acting officials without the full range of legal authorities necessary to make the decisions that will sustain the United States' military edge,\" they added.\n\nEven Tuberville's fellow GOP senators are fed up with his clown show.\n\nIn stunning condemnations on the Senate floor on Wednesday night, Sens. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, blasted Tuberville and his holds , telling him in no uncertain terms that he was damaging the military.\n\n\"Again my colleague, 'Oh, no readiness problem.' That's such baloney. Baloney. And everybody knows it. You spend one day in the military, you know it,\" said Sullivan, who has been on either active or reserve duty with the U.S. Marine Corps since 1993.\n\nAs a Marine Corps Reserve colonel, Sullivan is one of those \"2,000 people\" who works for Smith, the Marine Corps Commandant. Seems he would know better than Tuberville how difficult, and important, these jobs are.\n\n\"We are going to look back at this episode and just be stunned at what a national-security suicide mission this became,\" Sullivan said.\n\nThat's what you get, though, when you elect someone who doesn't understand the military and respects it even less. That's what you get when you elect a football coach to do a Senator's job.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on social media @nrarmour."

      "text": "Senator Tommy Tuberville paving the way for Pete Hegseth | PERRY O. HOOPER JR.\n\nWhen Senator Tommy Tuberville was elected, the Biden woke agenda was being implemented in all facets of government. He chose to target the department where it was doing the most harm: the Department of Defense. Coach Tuberville comes from a family with strong military ties, including his father, whose stories about his service in World War II played a significant role in shaping Tuberville's values during his formative years. As a football coach, he often emphasized the importance of sacrifice and discipline, drawing clear parallels to the principles of military service.\n\nIn a world increasingly swamped by woke ideology, there were still a few brave leaders willing to stand their ground. Tuberville is one of those warriors - a true patriot - and he did what so few in Washington had the guts to do: he said no to the relentless march of radicalism within our armed services. Tuberville's stand against the Pentagon's abortion policy wasn't just a symbolic gesture; it was a principled stand against a left-wing, progressive agenda that had no place in the world's most powerful military force. And it put the spotlight on the kind of leadership we needed at the top, the kind of leadership Pete Hegseth will bring as Secretary of Defense.\n\nSenator Tuberville, President Trump's biggest supporter in the Senate, endured months of abuse as he stood alone against the assault from the left. He refused to back down, even when faced with relentless pressure from the media, political elites, and the Biden administration. His courageous block on military nominations ruffled a lot of feathers in D.C., but that was exactly the kind of disruption that was needed to return the military to its real mission: defending freedom.\n\nLet's be clear about what we're talking about here. The Department of Defense, under the Biden administration, has been more focused on pushing woke social agendas than preparing our troops for the next global conflict. Currently, because of this they are nowhere close to meeting their recruiting goals. They introduced policies to promote the administration's woke leftist woke agenda - policies that made no sense for the mission of our warfighters. Defending our nation is the core focus of the military, not serving as a laboratory for leftist social engineering. Senator Tuberville knows this, and he would not let the Pentagon's political ambitions slide under the radar. His courageous actions opened the door for real change - and there was no better choice to capitalize on that opportunity than Pete Hegseth.\n\nHegseth is a combat veteran who like Senator Tuberville is not afraid to call out this nonsense. He's got the battlefield experience, he's got the no-nonsense approach to leadership, and most importantly, he knows that our military's job is to destroy the enemy, not attend woke seminars. We need someone who will take the fight against the enemy, not turn our military into a social experiment designed by ivory tower bureaucrats.\n\nWith Tuberville taking a stand and refusing to rubber-stamp military promotions until sanity prevailed, he made it abundantly clear that the military was no place for the culture war games of the left. It was a move that drew criticism from predictable corners - the media elite, the Washington establishment, and of course, those who seemed to think the military should be just another arm of progressive activism. But make no mistake, Tuberville held the line, and in doing so, he paved the way for someone like Hegseth to take the reins and return the focus to where it belonged: warfighting excellence and patriotic service.\n\nThis wasn't just about a single policy or a single nomination; this was about the future of America's defense. Did we want a woke military more concerned with diversity quotas and taxpayer-funded abortions, or do we want a lethal, prepared fighting force ready to take on any threat? Tuberville knew where he stood, and Hegseth's appointment will bring us one step closer to reclaiming our military from the progressive radicals who had hijacked it. It was time to get back to basics, to get back to what mattered - and thank God we still had leaders like Senator Tuberville willing to fight the fight. Let's hope that Pete Hegseth is next up to carry that torch.\n\nPerry O. Hooper Jr. is a former Alabama state representative and the founder of Let the People Speak."

Chiefs QB appears to set record straight\n\nKansas City Chiefs star quarterback Patrick Mahomes appeared to set the record straight Thursday about his relationship with Sen. Tommy Tuberville .\n\nOr lack thereof.\n\nThis has become a growing issue this week as Mahomes prepares for his third straight Super Bowl on Sunday in New Orleans.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Donald Trump praised Tuberville, his Republican ally, as a \"great coach.\" Then Trump related a story that made it sound like Tuberville was Mahomes' coach in college, at Texas Tech, despite the fact Tuberville wasn't.\n\nTuberville twice this week also claimed to have recruited Mahomes to Texas Tech, even if he never coached him. He even said he got to be \"very good friends with him.\" But Mahomes said Thursday he doesn't even remember meeting Tuberville.\n\n\"He did not recruit me at the time,\" Mahomes said after being asked about it in a news conference . \"So, I don't remember if I ever got to meet him or not.\"\n\nIs Tuberville making this up or mixed up? Why would he lie if he knew Mahomes might dispute him? Or could it be that Mahomes doesn't remember some brief encounter with Tuberville that could be described as \"recruiting\" him more than 12 years ago?\n\nThis is not a new controversy, either. Two years ago, Tuberville claimed in an interview that he recruited Mahomes at Tech . This claim was disputed then, too, by the Cover 3 college football podcast, which broke down why it appeared to be \"B.S.\"\n\nTuberville left his job at Texas Tech in December 2012, nearly two years before Mahomes played his first season there in 2014.\n\nTrump still told the following story Wednesday, with Tuberville looking on , at a signing ceremony for an executive order banning transgender student-athletes from women's sports. Tuberville had supported this ban.\n\n\"You know, his quarterback was named Mahomes,\" Trump said of Tuberville. \"He was a great college coach. And I said, 'How good was he?' He said, 'You don't wanna know how good. He made me into a great coach.' He's a pretty good quarterback, right?\"\n\n\"Very good,\" Tuberville replied.\n\n\"Yeah, he was very good,\" Trump said. \"And he's a good guy, too.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Tuberville posted a message on the social media site X that included a video of his appearance Monday on \"The Megyn Kelly Show.\" Tuberville appeared to be trying to clarify his relationship with Mahomes after Trump's remarks on Wednesday. He claimed he recruited Mahomes to Tech.\n\n\"As a coach, you start recruiting and working with players years before they get to college,\" Tuberville wrote on X Thursday. \"Patrick Mahomes was one of the best players I ever had the opportunity to recruit and get to know. Looking forward to cheering him on this weekend when I join President Trump at the Super Bowl.\"\n\nIn a separate video he shared of his interview with Kelly (posted by her show on Monday ), Kelly also asked Tuberville if he's rooting for the Chiefs in the Super Bowl \"since you used to coach Patrick Mahomes.\"\n\n\"Well, I never even coached him,\" Tuberville told Kelly. \"What happened is I recruited him. And then I left and went to another school. But I've got to be very good friends with him. He's not just a good athlete. He's a very good example for a lot of our young youth across this country.\"\n\nMahomes refuted this notion Thursday in an interview with reporters, though it's not clear he's been following what Tuberville and Trump claimed about him this week. He was simply responding to a question about his relationship with Tuberville.\n\nTuberville left Texas Tech to become the Cincinnati coach in December 2012. Before Tech, he coached at Auburn in Alabama, where voters elected him to the U.S. Senate in 2020. Meanwhile, Kliff Kingsbury recruited and coached Mahomes at Texas Tech before he parted ways with the program after the 2018 season and moved on to a coaching career in the NFL.\n\nA representative for Tuberville didn't return a message seeking comment.\n\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer .

Trump praised him for doing so\n\nPresident Donald Trump wrongly said three-time Super Bowl champion Patrick Mahomes played for former University of Cincinnati coach and U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville , who also coached at Texas Tech University, on Wednesday while signing an executive order banning transgender student-athletes from girl's and women's sports .\n\nThe president called Tuberville, who was in attendance Wednesday, a \"great coach\" and praised him for coaching Mahomes.\n\n\"A great coach. You know, his quarterback was named Mahomes. He was a great college coach,\" Trump said, per Newsweek . \"And I said, 'How good was he?' He said, 'You don't wanna know how good.

Tuberville was coaching at the University of Cincinnati during the entirety of Mahomes' college career, leading the Bearcats from 2013 through 2016.\n\nDuring an appearance on \"The Megyn Kelly Show,\" Tuberville tried to later clarify that he didn't coach Mahomes, but he recruited him.

Tommy Tuberville seemed to make contradictory comments Thursday on his state's Supreme Court ruling that embryos are considered children, telling reporters he is \"all for\" the decision but adding, \"we need more kids.\"\n\nThe Alabama Supreme Court ruled last week that embryos created during in-vitro fertilizations are \"extrauterine children\" and legally protected like any child. The decision led some healthcare facilities throughout the state to pause infertility treatments.\n\nWhen asked by reporters at the Conservative Political Action Conference about the court's ruling, Tuberville responded: \"Yeah, I was all for it.\"\n\n\"We need to have more kids. We need to have an opportunity to do that and I thought this was the right thing to do,\" he added.\n\nReporters clarified that the ruling led to pauses of IVF treatments in some facilities in the state and asked if the lawmaker was concerned for the decision's impact on Alabamians.\n\n\"That's a hard one. It really is because again you want people to have that opportunity,\" he said, referencing having children.\n\nThe Alabama senator added that he has not seen the decision and has to look at what the court is agreeing to and not agreeing to in the ruling.\n\nHe later emphasized on Twitter , formerly X, that the overturning of Roe v. Wade allows states to make their own decisions about life and referenced the Alabama Supreme Court justices who were elected by Alabamians.\n\n\"Each and every Alabamian has the right to make their voice heard about these deeply personal issues at the ballot box. I believe every life is a gift and is worth protecting,\" he wrote.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to Tuberville's office for clarification of his comments and was referred to a statement from spokesperson Hannah Eddins provided to AL.com:\n\n\"Sen. Tuberville was emphasizing his support for life at all stages. In addition to being pro-life and believing life begins at conception, Senator Tuberville is also pro-family. He believes strong families are instrumental to our country's success. In no way was he supporting the reaction from various medical facilities to cancel IVF procedures in the wake of the Alabama Supreme Court's ruling. He supports the U.S. Supreme Court's decision overturning Roe to return decisions surrounding life back to the states, which allows constituents to have a say in these significant decisions at the ballot box.\"\n\nTuberville has been a a staunch opponent of abortion, blocking military promotions in the Senate for over 10 months in protest of the Pentagon's policy on abortion and reproductive health, which was created after the Supreme Court eliminated the constitutional right to abortion . The blockade prevented more than 400 military jobs from being filled."

Over the course of his brief political career, Senator Tuberville has struggled on a great many fronts. The stunningly ignorant Alabama Republican is perhaps best known for launching an unprecedented, 10-month blockade, preventing confirmation of U.S. military leaders, all the while failing to understand the implications of his own tactics. But that's really just the start of a larger conversation.\n\nTuberville is also known for his election denialism, his provocative rhetoric about race, his disparagements of the U.S. military, his difficulties with basic details related to civics and modern American history, and his willingness to give Russian President Vladimir Putin the benefit of the doubt. Alas, the list keeps growing.\n\nThe coach-turned-politician was struggling to share his thoughts on his state's Supreme Court ruling that embryos must be seen as people. When pressed further, asking about the implications of the ruling, most notably for families trying to have children through in vitro fertilization or IVF, Tuberville said several words, though they weren't altogether clarifying or coherent.\n\n\"Well, that's, that's for another conversation. I think the big thing is right now, you protect - you go back to the situation and try to work it out to where it's best for everybody. I mean, that's what - that's what the whole abortion issue is about,\" the GOP senator added.\n\nTuberville acknowledged that he hadn't read the ruling, and the \"Alabaman\" appeared to struggle to explain how the decision, which threatens to limit access to IVF treatment, would help more people have children. When asked about the real-world effects the state Supreme Court's decision was having on women who had begun to go IVF treatment in Alabama, Tuberville said, \"I don't know enough about how that works,\" after endorsing the court's ruling.\n\nJust so we're all clear, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled this past week that frozen embryos are actual people. As a consequence, the University of Alabama at Birmingham suspended its IVF treatments on Wednesday, and two more medical facilities followed suit a day later. For Tuberville, this isn't an obscure dispute unfolding in a state thousands of miles from his home. At issue is an important ruling in his home state, affecting many of his own constituents, which the senator doesn't seem to understand in a meaningful way.\n\nTuberville hadn't exactly earned a reputation for competence before this week. His standing is nevertheless a bit worse now.\n\nMel Shuller, Montgomery"

      "text": "This senator is holding up military appointments because of abortion policy. What could happen next.\n\nWASHINGTON - In increasingly dire terms, Pentagon and Democratic leaders warn that Sen. Tommy Tuberville, an Alabama Republican, is endangering the country by blocking generals and admirals from taking their command because of a dispute over abortion policy.\n\nTuberville - for the seventh time since February - put a hold last week on a growing list of more than 200 military leaders awaiting Senate confirmation. Such confirmations are usually little more than a formality.\n\nBut by year's end, the backlog of nominations for the military's most senior officers could include more than 650 people, including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, according to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.\n\nTuberville says Defense Department warnings lack merit. An independent researcher, though, points out that delayed confirmations have cascading effects that include postponing weapons-buying decisions.\n\n\"This indefinite hold harms America's national security and hinders the Pentagon's normal operations,\" Austin wrote to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who chairs the Armed Services committee, which deals with personnel.\n\nTuberville's office, when asked for comment, sent a list of his statements, a letter from supporters of his hold, and opinion submissions he has made on the question. In his statements, Tuberville scoffs at the notion that national security is at risk, noting that the Pentagon will simply keep officers at their current jobs until the nominations are approved.\n\n\"I'm holding the military accountable; others are holding our national security hostage by forcing their agenda where it doesn't belong,\" Tuberville said in March. \"Americans want a military focused on a national defense - and that's what I'm fighting for.\"\n\nTuberville opposes the Pentagon's abortion policy, which was enacted after t he Supreme Court eliminated the constitutional right to abortion last year . The policy allows for time off and travel expenses for reproductive health care, including abortion, for troops and their dependents in states where it is not available.\n\n\"The Biden administration has done everything possible to turn our military into just one more institution for left-wing social engineering,\" Tuberville has said.\n\nThe Pentagon does not pay for abortions unless the life of the mother is endangered or when pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, according to Navy Cdr. Nicole Schwegman, a Pentagon spokesperson. From 2016 through 2021, 91 abortions of those kind were performed at military medical treatment facilities in accordance with federal law .\n\nTuberville calls the Pentagon's policy on abortion illegal and says he'll release his hold on the nominations when Austin rescinds it.\n\nNeither side, for now, appears willing to budge. Meanwhile, the list of nominations awaiting Senate approval is growing.\n\nBut the Senate's top Republican, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, says he opposes the move by a member of his caucus. \"No, I don't support putting a hold on military nominations,\" McConnell told reporters in response to a question about Tuberville's blockade. \"I don't support that. But as to why, you'll have to ask Sen. Tuberville.\"\n\nThe Senate Armed Services Committee considers about 50,000 nominations a year for civilian and military officials at the Pentagon and the armed services. Most often nominations are approved in bunches by what is known as unanimous consent. That happened Thursday when a number of lower-ranking officers had their nominations for promotion approved by the Senate.\n\nBut senators, like Tuberville in this case, can place a \"hold\" on nominations, informing the Senate leader that they do not want a speedy vote.\n\nTuberville's office has pointed out that Democrats have employed the same tactic. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, held up nominations of more than 1,100 officers in 2020 until the Pentagon provided proof that the promotion of Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman hadn't been blocked in retaliation for testifying against former President Donald Trump during his first impeachment.\n\nDuckworth dropped her hold after about two weeks. Tuberville's began in February and remains in place.\n\nThe Senate could hold nomination hearings for each officer, Tuberville has pointed out. Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat and chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said that could take months and accused Tuberville of holding the Pentagon and Senate \"hostage.\"\n\nTuberville's hold affects military actions, officers' careers and their families, said Albert Robbert, an adjunct researcher at the nonpartisan think tank RAND Corp.\n\nOfficers compelled to stay in jobs until their successor is confirmed may not have the authority to name subordinate commanders to combat posts, for instance, or to approve acquisitions for weapons systems, according to Robbert, a retired Air Force officer.\n\nThe hold also delays officers from developing in their careers because they're stalled in their current jobs, he said. Meanwhile, nomination season coincides with the end of the school year, allowing officers to move their families to new cities before a new academic year begins.\n\n\"It can build frustration,\" Robbert said.\n\nThat's the case with Reed, who pointed out that admirals await approval to lead the Navy's fleets in the Persian Gulf to deal with Iran and in Japan to confront China. Tuberville's action, Reed said, is \"very dangerous to the national security of the United States.\"\n\n\"It has a profound effect, and every day it gets worse,\" Reed said.\n\nAustin, in his four-page letter to Warren, accused Tuberville of acting recklessly.\n\n\"Never before has one Senator prevented the Department of Defense from managing its officer corps in this manner, and letting this hold continue would set a dangerous precedent for our military, our security, and our country,\" Austin wrote.\n\nAustin has backing from seven of his predecessors, including Jim Mattis and Mark Esper, who were nominated by Trump. They co-signed a letter calling for the hold to be lifted. They noted that there are other ways to challenge Pentagon policy, such as introducing legislation.\n\n\"The blanket hold on the promotion or reassignment of these senior unifored leaders is harming military readiness and risks damaging U.S. national security,\" they wrote."

Any damage he could do was limited to a football field.\n\nThat all changed when the people of Alabama elected Tuberville to the Senate. His impact was no longer relegated to football; he was given real power, real ways to dramatically influence the lives of millions. And what has he done with that power? Right now, he's using it in ways that the Pentagon says jeopardizes America's national security and military readiness."

Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) is joining a chorus of Republican lawmakers in condemning Mahmoud Khalil , the Palestinian activist and recent Columbia University graduate who organized peaceful protests on campus last year amid Israel's ongoing war on Gaza.\n\nThe Syria-born legal U.S. resident was abducted from his university-owned apartment Saturday by federal immigration agents who didn't have a warrant or a crime to charge him with. Khalil is currently being held in a detention facility in Louisiana .\n\nWhile most conservatives who support this apparent First Amendment breach appear content with calls to deport Khalil, Tuberville told Fox Business on Wednesday that he belongs in jail - along with \"all\" the other protesters supposedly disrupting education.\n\n\"The Democrats, basically, they don't like our country anymore,\" said Tuberville . \"They just want to tear it down ... Every Democrat that we work with up here, they're gonna take this guy's side and they're gonna try to drive this narrative that he's doing the right thing.\"\n\n\"You know, we have two levels of education,\" Tuberville added. \"We have K-12 and we have higher ed. We've gotta treat both of them different, but when it comes to protesters, we gotta make sure we treat all of 'em the same: Send 'em to jail.\"\n\nImmigration agents claimed after detaining Khalil that his green card will be revoked, but his attorney Amy Greer filed a habeas corpus petition on his behalf Monday - prompting a district judge to rule against his deportation pending further legal action in his case.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who appears to call anyone belonging to his political opposition \"Palestinian\" these days, labeled Khalil a \"Radical Foreign Pro-Hamas Student\" on his Truth Social platform Monday, despite there being zero evidence to support that claim.\n\nMore than a dozen progressive lawmakers published an open letter Tuesday demanding Khalil's release , arguing that the Trump administration's \"illegal actions set a dangerous precedent\" of stifling constitutional rights \"to free speech and due process\" in America.\n\n\"Free speech is great, but hateful, hate, free speech is not what we need in these universities,\" Tuberville said Wednesday about anti-Israel protests across schools. \"And they don't need to be doing things that they're preaching from Hamas, about antisemitism.\"\n\nThe First Amendment protects free speech whether people feel a \"need\" to hear ideas they disagree with or not. Numerous journalists have further questioned if there's actual evidence that Khalil is antisemitic.\n\nOn Monday, his wife, who is eight months pregnant, made a plea for his release .\n\n\"I urge you to see Mahmoud through my eyes as a loving husband and the future father to our baby,\" she said. \"I need your help to bring Mahmoud home, so he is here beside me, holding my hand in the delivery room as we welcome our first child into this world.\"\n\nMike Johnson Can't Say What Crimes Mahmoud Khalil Committed\n\nLawyers For Mahmoud Khalil Fight To Release Him From ICE Detention\n\nIsrael Cuts Off Electricity Supply To Gaza, Threatening Access To Drinking Water"

Tommy Tuberville of Alabama agreed to lift his monthslong hold on U.S. military promotions for admirals and generals Tuesday, the Senate confirmed more than 400 of them by voice vote.\n\nThe hold had been in place since February - when the Republican senator started a personal protest against a Department of Defense policy on access to abortion. Roughly a dozen four-star officers still await confirmations, which appear likely to move forward by individual Senate votes.\n\nThe challenge ahead, analysts say, will be rebuilding trust with a U.S. military community that had been deeply affected by the political move, but that suffered largely in silence for fear of jeopardizing their loved ones' chances of moving up through the ranks.\n\nFor months, one U.S. senator blocked key military promotions over a policy dispute. The logjam has finally ended, but it left military families feeling unfairly treated and vulnerable to Washington politics.\n\nAt issue in the dispute was a Pentagon policy, adopted last year after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, that offers travel funds for troops and their dependents who seek abortions, when the procedure is no longer legal in the states where they live. Senator Tuberville blocked high-level officer promotions as a form of protest. (He argued the travel funding violates the Hyde Amendment, which largely bars the federal government from paying for abortions).\n\nThe top officer of the United States, Gen. C.Q. Brown, warned lawmakers last July that in the midst of a recruiting crisis, Senator Tuberville's block on promoting top talent could prompt dedicated officers to leave the service, in part due to nudges from their families.\n\nIn the intervening months, examples of that have come to pass, says Kathy Roth-Douquet, co-founder and chief executive officer of Blue Star Families, an advocacy group that has surveyed some 100,000 service members and their spouses since 2009.\n\nMost recently, the organization has seen an increase in the likelihood of officers saying they are considering leaving the service.\n\nThey have also become less inclined to encourage their children and other family members to serve - a particular problem given that recruits are far more likely to sign up when they are close to someone who's been in the military.\n\nThese shifts are \"frustrating and poignant,\" Ms. Roth-Douquet says, and point to a \"pervasive sense of discouragement that our military cannot afford to have.\"\n\nShe describes how some have seen their spouses, for example, quit their jobs in anticipation of a move only to find themselves staying put and unemployed. In other cases, subordinates - also affected by the holds - have sold their homes and are scrambling to find expensive temporary housing.\n\nMs. Roth-Douquet recalls one family whose high school-age child couldn't join the sports team at his prospective new school because of these delayed moves. This in turn could prevent him, and other military children, from getting recruited for college sports scholarships. Others have struggled to find care for children with disabilities, which requires advanced planning and often navigating long wait lists.\n\nAllison Jaslow, an Iraq War veteran and CEO of the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, recalls an encounter she had this summer with Senator Tuberville as she endeavored to explain these sorts of experiences to him.\n\n\"He was very dismissive. He tried to minimize the number of promotions within the larger population of the force,\" she says. \"But if you're one of those officers or one of those families, it means a lot to you. ... These are the best among us, and they were caught in the middle of a Washington political fight as punching bags.\"\n\nMany military officers and affected family members have declined to speak on the record about the issue.\n\nThis is not only because they don't want to jeopardize promotions their loved ones have worked their entire careers to achieve, but also because \"we don't want to draw attention to the fact that this makes us less safe,\" as holds have left some military units awaiting top leaders at sub-optimal readiness levels, Ms. Roth-Douquet adds.\n\nNow that the holds have largely been lifted, elected officials need to work to rebuild trust, advocates say.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

His Ole Miss roster had been battered by NCAA sanctions, so he compensated with aggressive tactics - fake punts, onside kicks, trick plays. Mr. Tuberville's reputation earned him a nickname: \"The Riverboat Gambler.\"\n\nNow, as a first-term senator from Alabama, Mr. Tuberville has taken a similar strategy.\n\nSince February, he's blocked the confirmation of hundreds of Pentagon officials, protesting a Department of Defense policy ensuring access to abortion - one the department says is necessary to retain personnel.\n\nBoth parties in Congress traditionally line up behind the military. But culture-war issues like abortion are changing that dynamic. Exhibit A: Sen. Tommy Tuberville's monthslong blockade of Pentagon confirmations.\n\nKey positions may soon lack a Senate-confirmed successor, meaning that whoever fills them will have limited authority. Those positions include more than half of the eight-member Joint Chiefs of Staff, a board of America's top military officials.\n\nThis week for the first time in more than 100 years, the Marine Corps does not have a confirmed commandant. Meanwhile, the United States is supporting Ukraine's self-defense, a renaissance in European security, and increased competition with China. It's a hard part of the game to play without a full roster, the Pentagon argues.\n\nLast night, the GOP-controlled House passed its annual military spending bill - the National Defense Authorization Act - with an amendment that would end the abortion policy Mr. Tuberville objects to. That amendment, among others, makes the current bill a nonstarter in the Democratic-controlled Senate, with its 60-vote threshold.\n\nThe military has participated in the culture wars before, on issues of race, gender, and sexuality. But a sense of political neutrality has long been a fundamental part of its mission, and both parties in Congress traditionally line up behind the military. Its authority relies on the perception that it won't become a partisan cudgel, and it is still the institution that enjoys the highest confidence among Americans.\n\nBut as the Tuberville hold and this week's House vote show, it's becoming harder for the military to stay separate from politics, especially given Republican complaints about \"wokeness.\" One amendment in the newly passed House defense bill does away with diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in the military.\n\nIn a previous generation, politics in the military used to take the form of officials riding the armed forces' coattails, says Risa Brooks, a professor who studies civilian-military politics at Marquette University. \"Now, the form it's taking is trying to use the military as a wedge issue.\"\n\nThere's a phrase for that in Washington: a political football.\n\nThe Tuberville dispute started last October. Roe v. Wade had ended in the summer, and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin released a memo on abortion . Service members stationed in states that didn't permit abortion could have their travel costs reimbursed and receive 21 days of administrative absence to end a pregnancy.\n\nThe rationale was that abortion was no longer nationally protected, and service members don't generally get to choose where they work. The department wouldn't pay for abortions, but would help facilitate them. The Department of Justice, in an October opinion , decided that the defense department was acting within its authority.\n\nThe GOP immediately objected, and on Dec. 9, Senator Tuberville wrote a letter to the secretary , pledging to hold promotions if the Department of Defense proceeded with its policy. In February, the blockade began.\n\nNo one senator can halt nominations entirely, but he can make the process so time-intensive that it would overwhelm all other work - an estimated 668 hours in total to confirm the over 250 promotions currently jammed up. By the end of the year, the number of leadership positions in limbo could be 650, according to the Pentagon.\n\nSo far, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has refused to confirm any positions individually. Instead, the New York Democrat is hoping that the traffic will clear, and is calling on senior Republicans to find an off ramp.\n\nMorgan Murphy, Mr. Tuberville's former national security adviser in the Senate, doesn't expect that to work.\n\n\"Every other senator knows that [Mr. Tuberville] is 1,000% against this abortion policy,\" he says.\n\nMr. Murphy, like his former boss, argues that Secretary Austin violated the Hyde Amendment, which bans the military from funding or performing abortions with few exceptions. The secretary of defense is a political appointee, he says. It's Congress' job to change laws.\n\n\"I think it's fair to ask questions - how does this policy not violate the Hyde Amendment?\" says Katherine  Kuzminski, a senior fellow who studies politics and the military at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.\n\nWhat Ms. Kuzminski doesn't think is fair is holding up hundreds of military personnel for a policy they had nothing to do with.\n\n\"They are being held hostage over a fight between executive branch appointees and Congress,\" she says.\n\nThis is not the first time this tactic has been used - something Mr. Murphy points out. Other senators, from Illinois Democrat Tammy Duckworth to Missouri Republican Josh Hawley, have blocked Pentagon nominees in the past few years. The difference is their blockades were temporary. Mr. Tuberville's is sticking.\n\n\"His goal posts change continuously,\" says one Democratic Senate aide, who requested anonymity to speak freely.\n\nThere appear to be only two paths forward, according to Mr. Tuberville. The Pentagon could change its policy or Congress could pass a law codifying or nullifying it.\n\nThe first is highly unlikely - lest the defense department incentivize holds like this in the future by rewarding this one. On the second front, the House version of the NDAA yesterday included an amendment striking down the policy. But it has no future in the Senate\n\nMeanwhile, Pentagon officials are fretting that some of their top officials will serve in an \"acting\" basis, meaning they can carry out their predecessor's directives but can't set new ones themselves. \"We have strong deputies, but at the same time they don't have the same level of experience going forward,\" Gen. Charles Q. Brown, nominated to lead the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee this week.\n\nGeneral Brown, like other Defense Department officials, warned that this standoff will harm military readiness at a crucial moment, and perhaps hurt retention. Many of the officers stuck in limbo have families, who now can't resettle or find schools because the promotions haven't gone through.\n\n\"Holding up this many nominations has created an unprecedented level of disruption across the military,\" writes Heidi Urben, a professor at Georgetown University and retired Army colonel, in an email.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said yesterday he was willing to meet with Mr. Tuberville if it would help resolve the hold. Secretary Austin called the senator, who didn't accept and then later called back for five minutes, according to the Democratic aide.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Top military officials voice concern.\n\nLoading...\n\nSept. 07, 2023, 12:08 p.m. ET | Washington\n\nTop defense officials are accusing Republican Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville of jeopardizing America's national security with his hold on roughly 300 military promotions, raising the stakes in a clash over abortion policy that shows no signs of easing.\n\nMr. Tuberville brushed off the criticism, vowing he will not give in. \"We're going to be in a holding pattern for a long time,\" he said, if the Pentagon refuses to end its policy of paying for travel when a servicemember goes out of state to get an abortion or other reproductive care.\n\nIt's a classic Washington standoff with rippling effects across the country, placing the lives of servicemembers effectively on hold as they await what has traditionally been routine Senate approval for their promotions.\n\nFrustration mounting, the secretaries of the Navy, Air Force, and Army wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post this week saying Mr. Tuberville's efforts were not only unfair to the military leaders and their families but also \"putting our national security at risk.\"\n\nThey noted that three military branches - the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps - have no Senate-confirmed chiefs in place. Those jobs are being performed without the full range of legal authorities necessary to make decisions that will sustain the United States' military edge, they wrote.\n\nIn a CNN interview, Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro accused Mr. Tuberville of \"playing Russian roulette with the very lives of our service members by denying them the opportunity to actually have the most experienced combat leaders in those positions to lead them in times of peace and in times of combat.\"\n\nLooking ahead, the secretaries said in their op-ed that prolonged uncertainty and political battles over military nominations \"will have a corrosive effect on the force.\"\n\n\"The generals and admirals who will be leading our forces a decade from now are colonels and captains today,\" they wrote. \"They are watching this spectacle and might conclude that their service at the highest ranks of our military is no longer valued by members of Congress or, by extension, the American public.\n\nMr. Tuberville took umbrage with the three defense secretaries. He said they should have spoken with him first \"if you're gonna run your mouth in the paper.\"\n\n\"I have not heard from any of them,\" he said.\n\nIf they were truly worried about readiness at such a dangerous time for the world \"you would think they would be calling, 'Coach, let's work this out.' Zero,\" said Mr. Tuberville, a former college football coach.\n\nHowever, there have been multiple attempts by both the department's top civilian leaders and its top uniformed personnel to try and show Mr. Tuberville how the holds are doing harm, a senior military official and defense official said.\n\nA senior military official familiar with previous meetings with Mr. Tuberville said that despite telling the senator about the real-world and personal challenges that his hold has created on servicemembers, Mr. Tuberville has not seemed willing to change his position.\n\nMr. Tuberville said that during the August break, he visited six states, and \"I didn't have one negative comment from anybody. I had questions, but I didn't have any negative comments.\"\n\nHe insisted that he would lift his hold on the military nominations only after the Pentagon rescinds the policy that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin put into place in October, after the Supreme Court ended the constitutional protections for abortion that had been in place nearly 50 years.\n\nOnce the Pentagon returns to pre-memo policies on travel reimbursement, Democratic leaders could bring up for a Senate vote whatever replacement policy they want to enact, he said.\n\n\"Move it back,\" Mr. Tuberville said of the current reimbursement policy. \"And then have them write up what they want to vote on, and I will accept whichever way it goes. The holds are off. Let's go to work.\"\n\nMr. Tuberville's blockade is unique because it affects hundreds of military nominations and promotions. Democratic leaders would have to hold roll call votes on every one to get around the hold, an unwieldy and time-consuming process in a chamber that already struggles to finish its basic business.\n\nIt's a decades-long tradition for the Senate to group military nominations and approve them by voice vote, avoiding lengthy roll calls and reserving valuable floor time for other important issues.\n\nBut, while unusual, Mr. Tuberville's office notes that lawmakers from both parties have threatened holds on military promotions over the years. What's truly unprecedented is the length of time it has gone on with Mr. Tuberville.\n\nMr. Austin has called Mr. Tuberville three times about the holds, the last time was on July 18, and the Pentagon's legislative affairs staff continues to engage with him, a defense official said on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue. Also, Defense Department staff met with Senate Armed Services Committee staff in July to go over the details of DOD's reproductive health care policy.\n\nThe Pentagon to date has not provided data on the number of servicemembers who have relied on the new policy to get access to an abortion, citing privacy issues. It emphasizes that the new policy was in response to the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, which created a situation where federal troops serving in one state may not have access to the same type of reproductive services available in others.\n\nAs many as 650 nominations could be affected by the end of the year if the impasse continues. But if Republican leaders are pressuring Mr. Tuberville to end his holds, they are not doing so publicly.\n\n\"I'm hoping that the conversations that occur this week and the conversations that Senator Tuberville has had with the military leadership will lead to a breakthrough at some point,\" said Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate.\n\nThe Pentagon said the number of promotions on hold in the Senate has reached 98 in the Air Force, 91 in the Army, 86 in the Navy, 18 in the Marines, and 8 in the Space Force.\n\nSome Republicans have suggested that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., could hold votes on some of the most critical nominations. But Mr. Schumer rejected that approach.\n\n\"The bottom line is this is a problem created by Republicans and it's up to them to solve it,\" Mr. Schumer said.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he would like for Mr. Schumer to schedule a vote on the Pentagon reimbursement policy, but if it fails, which it most assuredly would, \"it's now time to get these people promoted.\"\n\n\"I'd like to vote to rescind the policy, but I'm not going to hold the military up in perpetuity,\" Mr. Graham said.\n\nSen. Roger Wicker, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services committee, was asked if he had any recommendations or guidance for Mr. Tuberville that could resolve the impasse.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

It's a small victory for Democrats as Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville continues his holds on other military promotions over the Pentagon's abortion policy.\n\nLoading...\n\nSept. 21, 2023, 11:34 a.m. ET | Washington\n\nThe Senate on Wednesday confirmed General CQ Brown as the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, putting him in place to succeed General Mark Milley when he retires at the end of the month.\n\nGeneral Brown's confirmation on a 83-11 vote, months after President Joe Biden nominated him for the post, comes as Democrats try to maneuver around holds placed on hundreds of nominations by Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville over the Pentagon's abortion policy. The Senate is also expected to confirm General Randy George to be Army Chief of Staff and General Eric Smith as commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps this week.\n\nMr. Tuberville has been blocking the Senate from the routine process of approving military nominations in groups, frustrating Democrats who had said they would not go through the time-consuming process of bringing up individual nominations for a vote. More than 300 nominees are still stalled amid Mr. Tuberville's blockade, and confirming them one-by-one would take months.\n\nBut Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., reversed course on Wednesday and moved to force votes on Generals Brown, George, and Smith.\n\n\"Senator Tuberville is forcing us to face his obstruction head on,\" Mr. Schumer said. \"I want to make clear to my Republican colleagues  this cannot continue.\"\n\nMr. Tuberville did not object to the confirmation votes, saying he will maintain his holds but is fine with bringing up nominations individually for roll call votes.\n\nWhite House national security spokesman John Kirby said that General Brown's confirmation, along with expected votes on Generals Smith and George, is positive news. But \"we should have never been in this position,\" he said.\n\n\"While good for these three officers, it doesn't fix the problem or provide a path forward for the 316 other general and flag officers that are held up by this ridiculous hold,\" Mr. Kirby told reporters.\n\nGeneral Brown, a career fighter pilot, was the Air Force's first Black commander of the Pacific Air Forces and most recently its first Black chief of staff, making him the first African American to lead any of the military branches. His confirmation will also mark the first time the Pentagon's top two posts were held by African Americans, with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin as the top civilian leader.\n\nIn a statement late Wednesday, Mr. Austin said General Brown would be a \"tremendous leader\" as the new chairman.\n\nGeneral Brown replaces General Milley, who is retiring after four decades in military service. General Milley's four-year term as chairman ends on Sept. 30.\n\nMr. Tuberville said on Wednesday that he will continue to hold up the other nominations unless the Pentagon ends its policy of paying for travel when a service member has to go out of state to get an abortion or other reproductive care. The Biden administration instituted the policy after the Supreme Court overturned the nationwide right to an abortion and some states have limited or banned the procedure.\n\n\"Let's do one at a time or change the policy back,\" Mr. Tuberville said after Mr. Schumer put the three nominations up for a vote. \"Let's vote on it.\"\n\nIn an effort to force Mr. Tuberville's hand, Democrats had said they would not bring up the most senior nominees while the others were still stalled. \"There's an old saying in the military, leave no one behind,\" Senate Armed Services Chairman Jack Reed said in July.\n\nBut in a frustrated speech on the Senate floor, Mr. Schumer said Wednesday he was left with no other choice.\n\n\"Senator Tuberville is using them as pawns,\" Mr. Schumer said of the nominees.\n\nThe votes come as a host of military officers have spoken out about the damage of the delays for service members. While Mr. Tuberville's holds are focused on all general and flag officers, they carry career impacts on the military's younger rising officers. Until each general or admiral is confirmed, it blocks an opportunity for a more junior officer to rise.\n\nThat affects pay, retirement, lifestyle, and future assignments - and in some fields where the private sector will pay more, it becomes harder to convince those highly trained young leaders to stay.\n\n\"Senator Tuberville's continued hold on hundreds of our nation's military leaders endangers our national security and military readiness. It is well past time to confirm the over 300 other military nominees,\" Mr. Austin said, noting he would \"continue to personally engage with members of Congress in both parties until all of these well-qualified, apolitical officers are confirmed.\"\n\nMr. Tuberville said he has not talked to Mr. Austin since July about the holds.\n\nThe blockade has frustrated members on both sides of the aisle, and it is still unclear how the larger standoff will be resolved. Mr. Schumer did not say if he will put additional nominations on the floor.\n\nThe months-long holds have devolved into a convoluted procedural back and forth in recent days.\n\nMr. Tuberville claimed victory after Mr. Schumer's move - even though the Pentagon policy remains unchanged.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Mr. Tuberville will face Democrat Doug Jones in what's slated to be a competitive general election.\n\nLoading...\n\nJuly 15, 2020, 11:15 a.m. ET | Mobile, Ala. and Atlanta\n\nFormer U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions lost the Republican nomination for his old Senate seat in Alabama to former college football coach Tommy Tuberville on Tuesday, likely ending a long political career with a bitter defeat egged on by President Donald Trump.\n\nMr. Tuberville beat Mr. Sessions in Tuesday's Republican runoff as Mr. Sessions fell short in his attempted comeback for a seat he held for two decades before resigning to become Mr. Trump's attorney general in 2017.\n\nFamiliar to Alabamians from his decade as Auburn University's head football coach, Mr. Tuberville won about 60% of the vote, according to unofficial returns, and is now positioned for a robust challenge against Democratic United States Sen. Doug Jones. With Alabama's strong GOP tilt, the seat is likely Republicans' best chance for a pickup as they try to maintain their thin Senate majority amid Mr. Trump's lagging popularity nationally.\n\nMr. Sessions was wounded by Mr. Trump's criticisms after he recused himself in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign. The first U.S. senator to endorse Mr. Trump during the GOP presidential primary campaign, Mr. Sessions insisted throughout his attempted comeback and again in defeat that he was required by law to recuse because he was a potential subject and witness given his campaign ties to the president.\n\n\"Let me say this about the president and our relationship: I leave with no regrets,\" Mr. Session said on a small stage at a Mobile, Alabama, hotel, with his many grandsons looking on. \"I was honored to serve the people of Alabama and I was extraordinarily proud of the accomplishments we had as attorney general.\" Mr. Sessions repeated that he was right to step away from the investigation. \"I did the right thing and I saved the president's bacon in the process. Any other action to try to squelch an investigation in that environment would not have worked,\" he said, adding that it ultimately led to Mr. Trump's exoneration. \"I leave elected office with my integrity intact.\"\n\nMr. Sessions was gracious to Mr. Tuberville, as well, pledging he'd work to help defeat Mr. Jones. \"He is our Republican nominee,\" Mr. Sessions said. \"We must stand behind him in November.\"\n\nYet Mr. Sessions' statements of loyalty to Mr. Trump and the party have never been enough for the president, who endorsed Mr. Tuberville after Alabama's March primary. Mr. Trump declared at the time that Mr. Sessions had \"let our Country down\" and that Mr. Tuberville would be his \"true supporter.\" Mr. Trump continued the broadsides throughout the primary campaign, and he crowed Tuesday evening on Twitter shortly after The Associated Press called the race for Mr. Tuberville.\n\n\"Tommy Tuberville WON big against Jeff Sessions,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"Will be a GREAT Senator for the incredible people of Alabama.\"\n\nMr. Tuberville willingly embraced the dynamics, casting himself as an outsider and calling the former attorney general \"weak\" and \"a disaster.\" Those digs aside, Mr. Tuberville ran a risk-averse campaign, declining media interviews and Mr. Sessions' challenges to debate.\n\nIn brief remarks to supporters Tuesday night, Mr. Tuberville looked to November with a message of cultural conservatism that mixed praise for Mr. Trump with accusations that Mr. Jones wants liberal \"New York values\" in Alabama. Without specifics, Mr. Tuberville said he'd fight for \"the same God-given principles that my father and others members of the Greatest Generation fought for so many years ago.\"\n\nMr. Jones, an Alabama native and former U.S. attorney known for winning convictions of Ku Klux Klansmen who bombed a Birmingham church and killed four Black girls in 1963, signaled that he won't go down easily. Mr. Jones won a 2017 special Senate election aided considerably by Republicans' decision to nominate Roy Moore. The former Alabama chief justice was twice removed from the bench for violating judicial canons and then accused during the Senate campaign of sexually molesting or harassing multiple teenage girls decades earlier.\n\nBut Mr. Jones argued that he's made the most of his opportunity, pointing to, among other matters, his work securing aid for disaster-ravaged farmers and the families of fallen U.S. troops. \"Washington already has plenty of people who fight along partisan lines and nothing much seems to get done,\" Mr. Jones said in a statement, noting that Mr. Trump had signed some of his bills. Mr. Tuberville's runoff playbook was enough to attract voters like Montgomery County cattle farmer Bruce Alford, who said picking Mr. Tuberville was a tough decision.\n\n\"I kind of want the new blood in, a little bit of change,\" said Mr. Alford.\n\nMr. Sessions tried to remind voters of his early decision to back Mr. Trump and argued he'd be most effective in advancing Mr. Trump's agenda. When he wasn't defending his loyalty to the president, Mr. Sessions focused on his long history in office and questions about Mr. Tuberville's background. \"You know me,\" Mr. Sessions told voters days before the runoff.\n\nThat was enough to keep retired state employee Jodi McDade in Mr. Sessions' camp. She said it was possible to support both Mr. Sessions and the president who detests him.\n\n\"As much a fan of Donald Trump's as I am, he has a falling out with a lot of people that he just disagrees with,\" he said. \"He may be endorsing Tommy Tuberville today, but then they can have a falling out.\"\n\nMr. Sessions, once Alabama attorney general and a U.S. attorney under President Ronald Reagan, was elected to the Senate in 1996. That first win was hotly contested. But Mr. Sessions wouldn't be seriously challenged again in three subsequent reelection campaigns before Mr. Trump picked him as attorney general.\n\nDespite his strength at the ballot box, Mr. Sessions was never a heavyweight in the Senate, overshadowed there and back home in Alabama by Sen. Richard Shelby, the state's senior senator who was elected as a Democrat in 1986 and switched parties in 1994 after Democrats lost their majorities on Capitol Hill.\n\nWhile Mr. Shelby relished in bringing as much money back to Alabama as possible, Mr. Sessions was a budget hawk who often eschewed the back-slapping, deal-cutting ways of Washington. For years, that made him a relative outlier on Capitol Hill. Then he found a presidential candidate who said many of the same things he'd argued for years about immigration, trade, and the ways of Washington. That reality television star turned commander in chief helped raise Mr. Sessions to the pinnacle of his public life and, on Tuesday, helped bring it to an almost certain end.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

CQ Brown Jr. as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Friday, sidelining a history-making fighter pilot and respected officer as part of a campaign led by his defense secretary to rid the military of leaders who support diversity and equity in the ranks.\n\nThe ouster of Gen. Brown, only the second Black general to serve as chairman, is sure to send shock waves through the Pentagon. His 16 months in the job had been consumed with the war in Ukraine and the expanded conflict in the Middle East.\n\n\"I want to thank General Charles 'CQ' Brown for his over 40 years of service to our country, including as our current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He is a fine gentleman and an outstanding leader, and I wish a great future for him and his family,\" Mr. Trump posted on social media.\n\nBrown's public support of Black Lives Matter after the police killing of George Floyd had made him a target for the administration's campaigns against \"wokeism\" in the military. His ouster is the latest upheaval at the Pentagon, which plans to cut 5,400 civilian probationary workers starting next week and identify $50 billion in programs that could be cut next year to redirect those savings to fund Mr. Trump's priorities.\n\nMr. Trump said he's nominating retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Dan \"Razin\" Caine to be the next chairman. Lt. Gen. Caine is a career F-16 pilot who served on active duty and in the National Guard, and was most recently the associate director for military affairs at the CIA, according to his military biography.\n\nLt. Gen. Caine's military service includes combat roles in Iraq, special operations postings, and positions inside some of the Pentagon's most classified special access programs.\n\nHowever, he has not had key assignments identified in law as prerequisites for the job, including serving as either the vice chairman, a combatant commander, or a service chief. That requirement could be waived if the \"president determines such action is necessary in the national interest.\"\n\nPete Hegseth, Mr. Trump's secretary of defense, in a statement praising both Lt. Gen. Caine and Gen. Brown, announced the firings of two additional senior officers: Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti and Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force Gen. Jim Slife.\n\nAdm. Franchetti becomes the second top female military officer to be fired by the Trump administration. Mr. Trump fired Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Linda Fagan just a day after he was sworn in.\n\nA surface warfare officer, Adm. Franchetti has commanded at all levels, heading U.S. 6th Fleet and U.S. Naval Forces Korea. She was the second woman ever to be promoted to four-star admiral, and did multiple deployments, including as commander of a naval destroyer and two stints as aircraft carrier strike group commander.\n\nGen. Slife led Air Force Special Operations Command prior to becoming the service's vice chief of staff and had deployed to the Middle East and Afghanistan.\n\n\"The President and Secretary of Defense deserve to have generals they trust and the force deserves to have generals who have credibility with our elected and appointed officials,\" Gen. Slife told the Associated Press on Friday. \"While I'm disappointed to leave under these circumstances, I wouldn't want the outcome to be any different.\"\n\nMr. Trump has asserted his executive authority in a much stronger way in his second term, removing most officials from the Biden administration even though many of those positions are meant to carry over from one administration to the next.\n\nThe chairman role was established in 1949 as an adviser to the president and secretary of defense, as a way to filter all of the views of the service chiefs and more readily provide that information to the White House without the president having to reach out to each individual military branch, according to an Atlantic Council briefing written by retired Maj. Gen. Arnold Punaro. The role has no actual command authority.\n\nTrump acted despite support for Brown among key members of Congress and a seemingly friendly meeting with him in mid-December, when the two were seated next to each other for a time at the Army-Navy football game.\n\nThe firing follows days of speculation after a list of officers, including Gen. Brown, to be fired was circulated on Capitol Hill - but notably was not sent via any formal notification to either of the Republican chairmen of the House or Senate armed services committees.\n\nSen. Roger Wicker, GOP chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, didn't mention Lt. Gen. Caine's name in a statement Friday.\n\n\"I thank Chairman Brown for his decades of honorable service to our nation,\" Mr. Wicker said. \"I am confident Secretary Hegseth and President Trump will select a qualified and capable successor for the critical position of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\"\n\nCongressional Democratic leaders have cast the firings as a direct attempt to politicize the military.\n\n\"A professional, apolitical military that is subordinate to the civilian government and supportive of the Constitution rather than a political party is essential to the survival of our democracy,\" Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement late Friday. \"For the sake of our troops and the well-being of every American, elected leaders - especially Senate Republicans - must defend that enduring principle against corrosive attempts to remake the military into a partisan force.\"\n\nGen. Brown's future was called into question during the confirmation hearing for Mr. Hegseth last month. Asked if he would fire Gen. Brown, Mr. Hegseth responded, \"Every single senior officer will be reviewed based on meritocracy, standards, lethality and commitment to lawful orders they will be given.\"\n\nSecretary Hegseth had previously taken aim at Gen. Brown. \"First of all, you gotta fire, you know, you gotta fire the chairman of Joint Chiefs,\" he said flatly in a podcast in November. And in one of his books, he questioned whether Gen. Brown got the job because he was Black.\n\n\"Was it because of his skin color? Or his skill? We'll never know, but always doubt - which on its face seems unfair to CQ. But since he has made the race card one of his biggest calling cards, it doesn't really much matter,\" Mr. Hegseth wrote.\n\nAs he walked into the Pentagon on his first day as defense secretary on Jan. 27, Mr. Hegseth was asked directly if he planned to fire Gen. Brown.\n\n\"I'm standing with him right now,\" said Mr. Hegseth, patting Gen. Brown on the back. \"Look forward to working with him.\"\n\nGen. Brown, who spent Friday visiting troops at the U.S.-Mexico border, drew attention to himself for speaking out about the death of George Floyd in 2020. While he knew it was risky, he said, discussions with his wife and sons about the killing convinced him he needed to say something.\n\nAs protests roiled the nation, Gen. Brown posted a video message to the Air Force titled, \"Here's What I'm Thinking About.\" He described the pressures that came with being one of the few Black men in his unit. He recalled pushing himself \"to perform error-free\" as a pilot and officer his whole life, but still facing bias. He said he'd been questioned about his credentials, even when he wore the same flight suit and wings as every other pilot.\n\nGen. Brown's path to the chairmanship was troubled - he was among the more than 260 senior military officers whose nominations were stalled for months by Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama. But when the Senate vote was finally taken in September 2023, Brown easily was confirmed by a vote of 89-8.\n\nIt had been 30 years since Colin Powell became the first Black chairman, serving from 1989 to 1993. But while African Americans made up 17.2% of the 1.3 million active-duty service members, only 9% of officers were Black, according to a 2021 Defense Department report.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

By Defense Department mandate, they must convey less-than-lyrical details about things like commanders on duty and the status of ship systems.\n\nPoetry aboard U.S. aircraft carriers has been derided as evidence of a \"too woke\" Navy. Sailors disagree and keep up a New Year's Day tradition by writing logbook entries in verse.\n\nAn additional hurdle: Warrior-produced poetry has recently acquired a few powerful detractors. When a Navy ship hosted a spoken-word event last year, some U.S. lawmakers decried the practice as too \"woke.\"\n\n\"We've got people doing poems on aircraft carriers over the loudspeaker,\" Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama said on Fox News in September. \"It is absolutely insane the direction we're headed in our military.\"\n\nYet poetry has a storied history in the armed forces, military leaders are quick to point out. Lawmakers worrying about poetry detracting from battle skills are perhaps \"just ill-informed,\" says Samuel Cox, director of the Naval History and Heritage Command, which hosts an annual competition for the best New Year's deck log poem.\n\nU.S. forces remain \"ready to go to war if they have to. But the objective is to deter it.\" In the course of doing this, service members voluntarily endure \"considerable sacrifice in time away from home,\" Mr. Cox says. Poetry is one way \"to try and relieve the sadness, if you will, of separation.\"\n\nIt's also a potential morale-builder, he adds. \"The more good people you retain because they like being on ships - they like being at sea despite the hardships - that's what our nation needs.\"\n\nAnd sometimes poetry has been a way to process tragic losses. \" In Flanders Fields \" was written by a soldier to commemorate a battleground where a million comrades in arms were wounded and killed. Another World War I poet, Lt. Wilfred Owen, produced powerful verse while fighting on the front lines. Before he died in battle he considered:\n\nThe pity of war, the pity war distilled. Now men will go content with what we spoiled.\n\n\"They are incredibly moving and speak, in many cases, to the cost and sacrifice of war,\" says Mr. Cox, a retired rear admiral.\n\nThe winners of the Navy's New Year's deck log competition tend to summarize events of the year with a soupçon of levity.\n\nAlexis Van Pool, the history and heritage command's deck log program coordinator, recalls a funny favorite from a 2021 submission: \"They thought 2019 had been a crazy year, but 2020 said 'Hold my beer.'\"\n\nMs. Van Pool's grandfathers both served as sailors in the Pacific during World War II, and reading their ships' old deck logs gives her an \"enormous\" feeling of connection to them, she says.\n\nSuch a sense of heritage is what Lt. Artem Sherbinin drew upon when he composed his New Year's Day deck log for the U.S.S. Bunker Hill, the winner of last year's contest.\n\nThere were no takers until Lieutenant Sherbinin, the ship's navigator, jumped in. He aimed high. \"The story of Odysseus is one giant log of a long journey, you could argue,\" he says.\n\nAs he dug in, Lieutenant Sherbinin perused a bunch of old deck logs, including from ships in the Gulf of Tonkin during the Vietnam War. \"They talk about the surreal feeling of being in and around Vietnam while watching the great political turmoil of 1968 and domestic unrest\" unfold in America.\n\nLieutenant Sherbinin could identify with this, he says, having been at sea during the COVID-19 lockdowns of 2020, when George Floyd was killed and protesters took to the streets.\n\nAs he dug into his own deck log poem, the \"massive changes\" then taking place in America were \"sort of top of the mind.\"\n\nLieutenant Sherbinin also drew on the legacy of his ship, which was soon to be decommissioned, to share it, he imagined, with future sailors:\n\nIn '91 she was still young\n\nTomahawks into Saddam's Iraq she flung. Then in '06 with years of salt coating her steel Bunker Hill received new aegis upon her keel. For the next ten years she was at sea. The place a sailor ought to be From San Diego to around the Horn Her spy-1 radars tracked everything airborne. Then in '20 she faced new enemies big and small The Covid virus and not one port call. Through '21 in Pacific water she remained Keeping Chinese warships contained.\n\nThe history and heritage command particularly liked this poem \"because we got to know not just the voice of the sailor, but the whole history of the ship,\" Ms. Van Pool says.\n\nAfter Lieutenant Sherbinin's victory came notes of congratulation, including from navigators on the U.S.S. Bunker Hill in the 1980s as well as from Navy sailors from other ships back to the 1950s.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

The resolution's passage is a significant victory for President Joe Biden's agenda.\n\nLoading...\n\nAug. 11, 2021, 11:24 a.m. ET | Washington\n\nDemocrats pushed a $3.5 trillion framework for bolstering family services, health, and environment programs through the Senate early Wednesday, advancing President Joe Biden's expansive vision for reshaping federal priorities just hours after handing him a companion triumph on a hefty infrastructure package.\n\nLawmakers approved Democrats' budget resolution on a party-line 50-49 vote, a crucial step for a president and party set on training the government's fiscal might on assisting families, creating jobs, and fighting climate change. Higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations would pay for much of it. Passage came despite an avalanche of Republican amendments intended to make their rivals pay a price in next year's elections for control of Congress.\n\nHouse leaders announced their chamber will return from summer recess in two weeks to vote on the fiscal blueprint, which contemplates disbursing the $3.5 trillion over the next decade. Final congressional approval, which seems certain, would protect a subsequent bill actually enacting the outline's detailed spending and tax changes from a Republican filibuster in the 50-50 Senate, delays that would otherwise kill it.\n\nEven so, passing that follow-up legislation will be dicey with party moderates wary of the massive $3.5 trillion price tag vying with progressives demanding aggressive action. The party controls the House with just three votes to spare, while the evenly divided Senate is theirs only due to Vice President Kamala Harris tie-breaking vote. Solid GOP opposition seems guaranteed.\n\nSenate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., once a progressive voice in Congress' wilderness and now a national figure wielding legislative clout, said the measure would help children, families, the elderly and working people - and more.\n\n\"It will also, I hope, restore the faith of the American people in the belief that we can have a government that works for all of us, and not just the few,\" he said.\n\nRepublicans argued that Democrats' proposals would waste money, raise economy-wounding taxes, fuel inflation, and codify far-left dictates that would harm Americans. They were happy to use Mr. Sanders, a self-avowed democratic socialist, to try tarring all Democrats backing the measure.\n\nIf Mr. Biden and Senate Democrats want to \"outsource domestic policy to Chairman Sanders\" with a \"historically reckless taxing and spending spree,\" Republicans lack the votes to stop them, conceded Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. \"But we will debate. We will vote.\"\n\nThe Senate turned to the budget hours after it approved the other big chunk of Mr. Biden's objectives, a compromise $1 trillion bundle of transportation, water, broadband, and other infrastructure projects. That measure, passed 69-30 with McConnell among the 19 Republicans backing it, also needs House approval.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., assured progressives that Congress will pursue sweeping initiatives going beyond that infrastructure package.\n\n\"To my colleagues who are concerned that this does not do enough on climate, for families, and making corporations and the rich pay their fair share: We are moving on to a second track, which will make a generational transformation in these areas,\" Mr. Schumer said.\n\nSen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., missed the budget votes to be with his ailing wife.\n\nIn a budget ritual, senators plunged into a \"vote-a-rama,\" a nonstop parade of messaging amendments that often becomes a painful all-night ordeal. This time, the Senate held more than 40 roll calls by the time it approved the measure at around 4 a.m. EDT, more than 14 hours after the procedure began.\n\nWith the budget resolution largely advisory, the goal of most amendments was not to win but to force the other party's vulnerable senators to cast troublesome votes that can be used against them in next year's elections for congressional control.\n\nRepublicans crowed after Democrats opposed GOP amendments calling for the full-time reopening of pandemic-shuttered schools and boosting the Pentagon's budget and retaining limits on federal income tax deductions for state and local levies. They were also happy when Democrats showed support for Mr. Biden's now suspended ban on oil and gas leasing on federal lands, which Republicans said would prompt gasoline price increases.\n\nOne amendment may have boomeranged after the Senate voted 99-0 for a proposal by freshman Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., to curb federal funds for any municipalities that defund the police. That idea has been rejected by all but the most progressive Democrats, but Republicans have persistently accused them anyway of backing it.\n\nIn an animated, sardonic rejoinder, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., called Mr. Tuberville's amendment \"a gift\" that would let Democrats \"put to bed this scurrilous accusation that somebody in this great esteemed body would want to defund the police.\" He said he wanted to \"walk over there and hug my colleague.\"\n\nRepublicans claimed two narrow victories with potential implications for future votes, with West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, one of the chamber's more conservative Democrats, joining them on both nonbinding amendments.\n\nOne indicated support for health care providers who refuse to participate in abortions. The other voiced opposition to teaching critical race theory, which considers racism endemic to American institutions. There's scant evidence that it's part of public school curriculums.\n\nThe budget blueprint envisions creating new programs including tuition-free pre-kindergarten and community college, paid family leave, and a Civilian Climate Corps whose workers would tackle environmental projects. Millions of immigrants in the United States illegally would have a new chance for citizenship, and there would be financial incentives for states to adopt more labor-friendly laws.\n\nMedicare would add dental, hearing, and vision benefits, and tax credits and grants would prod utilities and industries to embrace clean energy. Child tax credits beefed up for the pandemic would be extended, along with federal subsidies for health insurance.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

      "text": "Why Senator Tommy Tuberville's NIL Comments Are A Little Misguided\n\nBy Joe Sabin\n\nBy Joe Sabin ,\n\nContributor.\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - JUNE 14: U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) speaks at a press conference on student ... More loans at the U.S. Capitol  on June 14, 2023 in Washington, DC. The Senator spoke on legislation that would curb the increasing cost of higher education and would attempt to lower the amount of debt students take on. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\n\nSenator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, a former college football coach, recently made some news with some interesting comments regarding potential future NIL legislation while speaking at an event hosted by the Monday Morning Quarterback Club in Birmingham. He suggested that the law would provide for an unspecified penalty for players breaking contracts. According to a report by Michael Casagrande at AL.com, Tuberville stated \"I'm not against players making money, but we got to have some kind of penalty for players breaking contracts.\" Per the report, Tuberville went on to say \"But my thoughts are, you know, you sign a contract on NIL, I mean you can't just up and break it. I mean you gotta ... you wanna sign a year, two-year, three-year, you got a three-year contract. If you break it, there's gotta be some kind of penalty. We'll have to go through all the rules and regulations when it comes to the commerce committee on this.\"\n\nHe later commented about players entering the transfer portal, which seemed to indicate that he believes they are breaking NIL contracts in doing so. Senator Tuberville is certainly entitled to his own feelings on the state of NIL, but his comments do not reflect a complete picture of what is happening. While most NIL contracts are private, they are typically going to base compensation off of \"deliverables\" (i.e., what the player has to do to earn the money). It's fair to say that the deliverables for most NIL contracts with booster-led collectives are largely sham benchmarks to keep the NCAA at bay, the deliverables still exist. Once a player stops meeting deliverables (either by transferring or otherwise falling short of expectations), the payments stop.\n\nFurther, there are effective remedies available through the court system to a party who feels they have been harmed because the other party breached (legal terminology for broke) their contract. Generally speaking, the non-breaching party to a contract may be entitled to expectation damages from the breaching party. Expectation damages represent what the non-breaching party could have expected to make/gain had the contract been fully carried out.\n\nExpectation damages are not easy to calculate in employment or personal service contracts, which is functionally what an NIL contract is. In these circumstances, it is common for the two parties to agree to the penalty for a breach of contract within the contract itself. These provisions are known as liquidated damages, but we see them most frequently as coaching buyouts in the sports context. While most college football fans are likely familiar with coaches continuing to get paid after they've been fired, some may not realize that when a coach leaves the school for greener pastures, the leaving coach frequently owes their former employer money. That is customarily paid by the school hiring the coach. For example, Alabama paid Washington $12 million to pay new head coach Kalen Deboer's contract \"buyout.\"\n\nTUSCALOOSA, ALABAMA - SEPTEMBER 28: Head coach Kalen DeBoer of the Alabama Crimson Tide looks on ...

Cox/Getty Images)\n\nAs one of the many US Senators without a law degree, Tuberville could be forgiven for not knowing the intricacies of contract law. However, when Tuberville was a football coach, he was a habitual contract breacher and was never penalized in any significant way. Beyond his recent comments being misguided, those who have followed the career of Coach (now Senator) Tuberville know that these comments are highly hypocritical.\n\nPerhaps Tuberville's most infamous contract breach came in 1998 when he was the head coach at Ole Miss. Rumors began swirling that Tuberville would take the job at Auburn, even though he was still under contract for the next few seasons. When probed by the media about the rumors, he said, \" They'll have to carry me out of here in a pine box .\" Two days later, Tuberville took the Auburn job.\n\nTuberville coached at Auburn with some solid success until 2008, when the team finished 5-7. Tuberville resigned from his position as head coach (thus breaching his contract) and was still paid a $5 million buyout as if he were fired. After taking a year off of coaching to be an analyst for ESPN, Tuberville was hired as the head football coach at Texas Tech. If you've been paying attention, you can probably guess he breached his contract with Texas Tech. Still, the way he did it was particularly brazen and noteworthy- by leaving recruits in the middle of dinner to accept the job at Cincinnati, never to return. He eventually resigned from Cincinnati despite still being under contract. If you're keeping score at home, that's four college head coaching jobs and a perfect four for four on Tuberville breaching his employment contracts.\n\nKNOXVILLE, TN - OCTOBER 2:  Head coach Tommy Tuberville of the Auburn Tigers looks on while facing ... More the Tennessee Volunteers at Neyland Stadium on October 2, 2004 in Knoxville, Tennessee. Auburn defeated Tennessee 34-10. (Photo by Streeter Lecka/Getty Images)\n\nTo be clear, it isn't Tuberville's fault he was never harshly penalized for breaching his contracts. The responsibility to \"penalize\" or enforce contract provisions rests with the non-breaching party. Maybe Tuberville thinks that is unfair and that penalties should be imposed by a some sort of new agency, his comments were not particularly clear. He's lucky there was no agency to enforce contracts around when he was coaching.\n\nFurther, if players are \"breaking NIL deals,\" as Tuberville alleges, they are deals they have with collectives or other third parties, not the schools themselves, as that is currently against NCAA rules ( which may change soon via the House settlement). Collectives are unlikely to sue players over breach of contract. Being known as the collective that will sue players if they enter the transfer portal would put a damper on the collective's ability to recruit top talent. Even if the House settlement comes to fruition and schools can pay their athletes directly, it's hard to imagine schools being eager to sue former players. It's not a good look.\n\nIf a booster collective felt so aggrieved by a player entering the transfer portal that it decided to pursue legal action, it would likely struggle to argue for expectation damages. Most collectives have dubious business models and profit-seeking bonafides. They are set up to funnel money to athletes and prospective athletes at that particular school. It would be difficult to convince a judge that the collective has suffered financial harm when an athlete enters the transfer portal and leaves the school that the collective supports.\n\nWhile there are no high-profile examples of athletes \"breaking contracts\" with collectives, there are high-profile cases of collectives breaking deals with athletes. Georgia quarterback Jaden Rashada has sued Florida head football coach Billy Napier and mega booster Hugh Hathcock over an NIL deal gone bad. Former UNLV quarterback Matthew Sluka left the school and entered the transfer portal over alleged non-payment of an NIL agreement. Michigan State's collective canceled its contracts with several football players in the middle of the season last year. Tuberville did not address any of these examples in his comments.\n\nIn an interview with Sportico's Daniel Libit, Tuberville respond to some of the criticism of his comments. He stated he believes coaches should be held accountable and that he does not intend to hold athletes to a different standard of commitment than coaches. He briefly discussed the buyouts that schools pay to poach a coach and how they can potentially serve as a deterrent to potential other employers. But, as Libit points out, if there is a deterring effect of buyouts (whether they be to hire coaches from another school or fire them) the schools are not showing it.\n\nThere is no doubt that Tuberville's unique background means he understands the NCAA and college football better than most senators. He can and should be an important voice in the crafting of any federal NIL legislation alongside former college athletes in the Senate John Thune and Cory Booker. He has already introduced a bill with former Democratic senator Joe Manchin and has expressed a desire to continue working on a bill with bipartisan support. That does not mean all of his ideas are good. If coaches are free to use their leverage to negotiate favorable contract terms, the athletes should be as well. The idea of imposing a statutory penalty on college athletes entering the transfer portal belongs in the same imaginary pine box it took to get Senator Tuberville to leave Ole Miss."

      "text": "Here's How Sen. Tommy Tuberville  Can Hold Up An Entire Nomination Process\n\nAs Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) makes headlines for holding up yet another Senate nomination-this time for the replacement of the Marine Corps. leader-many are left wondering how just one senator's protest can have such influence over the governmental process.\n\nFILE - Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, talks to ... More reporters at the Capitol in Washington, May 16, 2023. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File)\n\nTuberville is utilizing a senatorial hold-an informal practice in which a senator informs leadership that they don't want a particular measure or nomination to reach the floor for consideration-to prevent about 250 other military promotions and nominations, including Gen. Eric Smith's nomination to lead the Marine Corps. from moving forward.\n\nHolds in the Senate first came about as a method senators could use to convey scheduling or policy preferences to leadership, according to the Congressional Research Service , but over time they've become like \"silent filibusters.\"\n\nHolds are only applicable to Senate business with a unanimous consent requirement, but much of Senate business is conducted by unanimous consent, especially routine procedures like selecting a date to debate on the floor or approving a nomination.\n\nA hold cannot completely block a nomination, but it forces Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to follow formal processes on the Senate floor that often move much slower than a decision made by unanimous consent, and because of the current hold ups many routine processes would take months to complete because of the number of blocked nominations.\n\nWhen holds first started, the Senate allowed for them to be private between a holder and their leader, keeping it anonymous to other senators; however, after holds became more of an ill-spirited tactic, the Senate adopted rule changes allowing hold letters to be made public rather than being treated as private correspondence.\n\nThere are a number of different kinds of unofficial holds, according to the Congressional Research Service, including: informational holds requesting a senator be consulted before action is taken on a matter; choke holds that have a filibuster threat and are meant to kill or delay action; blanket holds that are filed against an entire category, like all nominations to an agency or department; Mae West holds are meant to foster negotiation and bargaining; and retaliatory holds that are often political payback.\n\nSenate holds are an informal practice, meaning the Senate majority leader could choose to bring a matter with a hold to the floor, though that's uncommon. A senator whose hold is not honored has a myriad of resources they could employ to cause gridlock, according to an article from the Congressional Review Service. Because a hold doesn't necessarily stop the nomination-but rather slows it and prolongs the approval process-a nomination can go through with a hold if the majority leader chooses to go the procedural route instead of seeking unanimous consent. The Senator who initiates the hold can also end it at any point on their own or through conversation and negotiation with their party leader. Another option would be to pass specific legislation that would allow a way around a hold-for example, CNN reported that Democrats could feasibly try to pass a law allowing military promotions to advance without Senate consent to get around Tuberville's hold, but it's not clear that would have the votes to pass.\n\n\"'The hold started out as a courtesy for senators who wanted to participate in open debate,' two Senators wrote in 1997,\" according to \"'Holds' in the Senate,\" a paper prepared by the Congressional Research Service. \"Since then, 'it has become a shield for senators who wish to avoid it.'\"\n\nSecret Senate holds weren't actually abolished until 2011 when a resolution passed 92-4 in the culmination of a 10 year, bipartisan effort to end secret holds. The updated resolution required public disclosure in The Congressional Record within two legislative days of an objection being made by any senator to Senate action on legislation or nominations."

      "text": "Crisis Looms As Tommy Tuberville's Hold On Military Promotions Enters 3rd Month\n\nBy Craig Hooper\n\nBy Craig Hooper , Senior Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Craig Hooper evaluates security threats and proposes solutions.\n\nBy Craig Hooper ,\n\nSenior Contributor.\n\nHow does Tuberville's hold impact the career prospects of junior officers aboard the USS Dewey (DDG ... More 105)?\n\nAt the Pentagon, high-level officer nominations continue to stack up as first-term Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) continues his lonely hold , halting all high-level military promotions over concerns that military policies ensuring service members' access to reproductive care may potentially facilitate abortions.\n\nAs the hold enters the third month, Tuberville's blanket block on military promotions is unprecedented, and, with no sign of Tuberville looking for a face-saving climb-down, Mitch McConnell and other Republican Party leaders must start answering for the damage this ambitious rookie legislator is deliberately inflicting upon America's military (a few hours after this article was originally published, Politico reported McConnell as saying, \"No, I don't support putting a hold on military nominations\"). In short, they, along with big Alabama employers and other defense industry stakeholders, need to school this self-styled college \"coach\" before the insurgent, self-described \" 100% MAGA \" Senator ends up doing real harm to the country.\n\nTuberville's office, after several requests for comment, responded via email after this article was originally published, claiming that there's no evidence the Senator's position has been \"destructive\" or hurt the military, and that several Republican colleagues support him, pointing towards a March 30 press release .\n\nA high-profile temporary protest action is a manageable thing, but, as the military costs of the hold inexorably rise, the risk of a national security crisis increases as well.\n\nTo address NATO concerns over increased Russian naval surface and submarine activity in the North Atlantic, the Biden Administration nominated two seasoned submariners to serve as America's next Navy submarine force commander and lead the Atlantic-facing Second Fleet. Delaying the orderly transfer of command in the Atlantic only improves Russia's ability to threaten the United States from the sea.\n\nWhile subordinates can often step in for displaced senior officers, vacancies loom for key roles. With the current Naval Reactors chief, four-star Admiral Frank Caldwell expected to retire soon, President Biden tapped Vice Admiral William Houston for the critical post, overseeing all aspects of the U.S. Navy's nuclear force. With the critical Australia/United Kingdom/U.S. (AUKUS) alliance getting underway, aiming to transfer several Virginia class nuclear attack submarines to Australia, the Nuclear Reactors role cannot go unfilled for long.\n\nBipartisan concern is growing. Seven former Secretaries of Defense, including from the Donald Trump and George W. Bush Administrations, warned in a letter that \"if this blanket hold is not lifted, nearly 80 three- and four-star commanders who are ending their terms in the coming months will not be able to be replaced.\" Detailing the \"real-world impacts on families\" of senior officers, the former Defense Secretaries blistered Tuberville's action, writing, \"we can think of few things as irresponsible and uncaring as harming the families of those who serve our nation in uniform.\"\n\nSecretary of Defense Lloyd Austin joined the chorus of concern, writing in a May 5 letter to Senator Elizabeth Warren, obtained by USNI News , that the hold, \"unprecedented in scale and scope\", poses a \"clear risk to U.S. military readiness\".\n\nNo end is in sight. In the face of Tuberville's stubborn hold, high-level military nominations continue to pile up. In the past eight days, the Administration has named six new Admirals and Generals, on track to request Senate confirmation of some 650 general and flag officers this year.\n\nTommy Tuberville thinks his holds are harmless. Are they?\n\nAs Alabama constituents begin to voice concerns and GOP Senators-including the Senate Minority Leader -begin to edge awa y from him , Tuberville is busy portraying his three-month hold as a harmless, almost symbolic stand against both the Senate's leisurely, nearly obsolete work practices as well as the Biden Administration's perceived overreach on reproductive care policy.\n\nOn 3 May, addressing Al.com readers, the Senator reassured Alabamans that nominees \"can still be confirmed-but the Senate has to actually vote. That's not too much to ask.\"\n\nBut Tuberville has a very different message for Republican partisans. On April 19, speaking on Newt's World Podcast , Tuberville admitted to his host, former House Speaker and Republican firebrand Newt Gingrich, that his hold was procedurally impossible to overcome, saying \"you're not going to be able to get them through unless we go through regular order-which would take forever.\" Tuberville knows that the Senate, via an operating agreement negotiated between the two parties, has limited time set aside for nomination votes.\n\nTuberville has begun portraying his stand as a tightly targeted effort, only hindering high-ranking officers that are well-prepared for fiscal or career disruption. After claiming that Flag and General officers earn approximately $244,000 a year in base wages and housing allowances, Tuberville quipped that senior officers have \"got plenty of grocery money. And when they do get promoted, they'll all get back pay-and they know it.\"\n\nTuberville, however, has yet to address lower-ranking officers who are paid far less-and now must wait for the hold to end to fill an open billet-a work assignment that may require a cross-country move or family disruption. A Lieutenant Junior Grade in the Navy makes, on average, $97,644.60 a year , but since Navy Captains, due to Tuberville's hold, cannot move up to become Admirals, lower-ranking officers are now stuck as well, unable to progress into an open job.\n\nWhile Tuberville, in an effort to reframe the narrative, celebrated that twelve Alabama students accepted appointments at U.S. Service Academies, the Senator did not discuss how his hold may impact the career of those future ensigns. Secretary Austin, in his letter, noted that \"extended holds increase the time from selection to promotion, which could further delay promotion timelines by 12 to 24 months. This impedes not only the current cadre of officers, but those in groups behind them as well.\"\n\nTuberville also wrote that officers denied promotion will \"retire with a pension equivalent to having $6 million in a 401k.\" Again, Tuberville had nothing to say to lower-ranking officers who may, for want of an open officer billet and the military's \"up and out\" policies, be forced to retire before they can qualify for a government pension.\n\nThe parade of contradictions and oratorical oversights suggest Tuberville's defense of his hold is either poorly thought out, or, worse, that the Senator's hold is designed to do real damage the U.S. military.\n\nWhat do former players think of Coach Tuberville's recent statements on white nationalists in the ... More U.S. military?\n\nWith the hold now extending into a third month, Tuberville's path towards a resolution remains unclear. In their letter, the former Defense Secretaries reminded Senators that, beyond damaging holds, they had several options to change policy, including \"introducing legislation, conducting oversight hearings, or amending the annual National Defense Authorization Act.\"\n\nFor his part, Tuberville has repeatedly claimed that he only wants a vote on the issue. To get it, the National Defense Authorization Act process appears to be the best way forward. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Tuberville can, essentially, force a Senate vote on the Pentagon's policy of allowing servicemembers to seek reproductive healthcare outside of states that have limited options. Such a path might allow Tuberville to, in essence, declare victory and move on.\n\nBut that may no longer be enough. While Tuberville has moved away from discussing the ratio of officers and enlisted servicemembers, he has continued to pepper any discussion of his hold with a grab-bag of unrelated military issues. He regularly claims the \"real crisis\" rests in low military recruitment numbers, and that the military should focus on building \"a strong, hard-nosed, killing machine ,\" staying away from social issues altogether.\n\nTuberville has also started lacing his hold-related interviews with concerns that the military is targeting white nationalists for removal. On the Newt's World Podcast, Tuberville said, \"Right after the January 6, two years ago the first thing that Sec Austin did was that he put everybody through a white extremism test to make sure that white nationalists weren't in our military which is the craziest thing I've ever heard in my life.\"\n\nIn a recent discussion on Alabama Public Radio , Tuberville responded to a question on if he believed the Biden administration should allow white nationalists in the military, the Senator responded \"Well, they call them that. I call them Americans.\"\n\nAs the standoff continues, Tuberville's hold on high-level military promotions is entering dangerous territory. Relations with both Russia and China are under enormous strain. At a time when the U.S. military desperately needs experienced personnel and clear, well-defined chains of command, the line between a legislator's principled protest over policy and something far, far worse is getting progressively smaller."

Molly Bohannon has been a Forbes news reporter since 2023.\n\nBy Molly Bohannon ,\n\nForbes Staff.\n\nSen.

Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, attempts to ... More elucidate remarks he made about white nationalists to reporters as he faces bipartisan backlash. Tuberville continues to hold up a slew of military appointments over his opposition to Pentagon abortion policies, which provide travel funds and support for troops and dependents who seek abortions but are based in states where they are now illegal.\n\nTuberville told reporters on Capitol Hill Tuesday afternoon that \"white nationalists are racists,\" multiple outlets are reporting, after previously insisting white nationalism couldn't be equated to racism and the term is \"a cover word for the Democrats.\"\n\nTuberville previously said white nationalists should be allowed to serve in the military, as long as they aren't racist-a statement that wrongly suggests that white nationalists aren't inherently racist-and doubled down on the claim Monday in an interview on CNN.\n\nTuberville faced criticism from both sides of the aisle Tuesday after defending his controversial comments. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) accused Tuberville of \"fanning the flames of bigotry\" and said his interpretation is \"wrong, wrong, wrong\" and \"very, very dangerous.\" When asked about Tuberville's comments, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said \"white supremacy is simply unacceptable in the military and in our whole country.\"\n\nTuberville's remarks resurfaced Monday when CNN's Kaitlan Collins asked him to explain his past defense of white nationalists in the military. In a May radio interview, Tuberville said \"they call them that, I call them Americans,\" when asked if white nationalists should be allowed to serve in the military. At the time, Tuberville was discussing his opposition to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's order for a 60-day stand down to reinforce a policy against extremism in the military. That wasn't the first time Tuberville took issue with military happenings-he has continuously refused to vote for key military appointments as an ongoing protest of a Pentagon policy that covers travel costs for military members seeking out-of-state abortions. As of Friday, 265 nominations were being held up by Tuberville's blockade, Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said Monday. Currently, the Marine Corps is without a leader since Tuberville has refused to approve Gen. Eric Smith to the role following Gen. David Berger's retirement."

Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) lifted his blockade on military nominees, allowing the Senate to ...

That blockade prevented the U.S. Army, Navy and Marines from receiving new leaders, keeping them instead operating with interim leaders . Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have objected to the blockade, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who said the blockade was \"not the way to reach the desired outcome.\" President Joe Biden also criticized Tuberville's approach in July, calling it \"irresponsible\" and arguing it \"jeopardizes U.S. security.\"\n\nTuberville's blockade still allowed the Senate to confirm military nominees on a significantly slower, individual basis.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Craig Hooper evaluates security threats and proposes solutions.\n\nBy Craig Hooper ,\n\nSenior Contributor.\n\nAn expecting Air Force family, supporting Texas-based B-1 Bombers, deserves the best possible ... More medical care for medically complex pregnancies.\n\nAngered that the Pentagon helps America's warriors and their dependents obtain reproductive care options that are unavailable in certain states, Senate \" Coach \" Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), is pushing back on America's military, rebelling against the time-honored, efficient Senate process of \"unanimous consent,\" where high level military promotions are approved in batches. His gambit puts America's military in a readiness bind, posing a real risk to national security.\n\nWith Tuberville objecting to all military and civilian nominations before the Senate, the Senate has few options than to vote on each officer promotion individually, and that, if current Senate procedures hold, will effectively bring all other Senate business to a halt.\n\nFor the Senate, the simple act of voting on military nominees-outside of all the rest of the Senate's obsolete and time-consuming parliamentarian gobbledygook-would take months. It took the Senate about 2.5 hours to vote on the confirmation of Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. If that vote stands as an example, the Senate will need 40 weeks to vote-just to vote-on the estimated 650 flag and general officers requiring Senate confirmation this year.\n\nAnd, even if the Senate starts marching through the nominations in some sort of accelerated fashion, there's no guarantee that a nomination will progress. The process of getting a Senate nomination to a floor vote is still dependent upon other \"unanimous consent\" agreements that offer Tuberville one chance after another to object, forcing clock-eating \"time outs.\"\n\nTuberville, with his obstruction, is protesting a Pentagon policy that lets America's proud service members request an administrative absence for \"non-covered reproductive health services\" for themselves-or to accompany their partners-for reproductive health services that could include abortion. The policy provides America's warriors a transportation allowance to travel to states where, as Alabama's primary newspaper delicately puts it, \"reproductive care is more expansive .\"\n\nReproductive care for the military is a significant need. One in five service members are women, and 80,000 are stationed in areas without access to non-covered reproductive healthcare.\n\nRepublican regulation of reproductive healthcare is a big deal for military personnel of all types. For the roughly 369 personnel in Kootenai County, Idaho, those working at the Navy's critical and secretive Acoustic Research Detachment, will see their reproductive care options shrink in half as Bonner General Health in Sandpoint halts obstetrical services in mid-May. Soon, their only option is to travel south, to the city of Coeur d'Alene, for care. Pregnant Air Force families based in Texas or other states that have restrictive abortion rules (like the family pictured above), shouldn't worry that, if their pregnancy became medically complicated, they would be without viable care options.\n\nMany of America's young warriors, at the start of their military career, have few options. With nearly one in four of America's active-duty warriors experiencing \" low food security \" and struggling to put food on the table for their families, the modest financial support America's soldiers get for reproductive health services is a big deal.\n\nThe \"Fat Leonard\" Scandal halted Navy promotions a decade ago, and the Navy is still feeling the ... More impacts today.\n\nWith \"up-and-out\" rules ready to force non-advancing officers into retirement, the U.S. military depends upon an efficient promotions process. By gumming up the Senate's confirmation machinery and forcing each flag or general officer promotion to go through a full Senate approval process, Tuberville risks endangering the career of hundreds of deserving officers, hurting military readiness, and harming America's national security. More than 180 general and flag officer nominations are currently pending, with some 650 general and flag officers requiring Senate confirmation by the end of the year.\n\nNow, Tuberville might be forgiven for overlooking the damage he risks inflicting upon the military by blocking the Senate's confirmation machinery. In 2013, when the Navy's \"Fat Leonard\" scandal-an investigation into bribes paid out to Naval personnel by the corrupt ship support contractor-exploded into public view, it halted promotions for any Navy officer with Pacific Ocean experience. Tuberville, suffering through the final, ignominious stop in a college football career that dropped off sharply after his successes at Auburn in the early 2000s, probably wasn't paying attention.\n\nFor the Navy, the Fat Leonard scandal was catastrophic. While Coach Tuberville took the Cincinnati University Bearcats to a dismal 1-7 record in the American Athletic Conference, investigatory holds were halting the careers of some 450 Navy officers, leading hundreds of hand-picked officers, locked into the Navy's \"up or out\" promotion practices, to leave the Navy as they lost their window of opportunity to advance.\n\nIf Tuberville's hostage-taking continues for any length of time, the Senator will end up doing more damage to the Armed Services than Leonard Glenn Francis, the instigator of the \"Fat Leonard\" scandal. In total, the \"Fat Leonard\" scandal derailed the careers of sixty admirals as the Navy reviewed their records for a hint of misconduct. Many other officers, their careers in limbo, simply left the service.\n\nA decade later, the losses still rankle, as many consider the Navy lost a generation of experienced leaders to the slow-moving investigatory logjam. With some 650 officers at risk, Tuberville is risking a real catastrophe.\n\nTo defend itself-and to reduce the temptation of other Senators to tinker with military promotions in the future-both the Pentagon and the Democratic Senate leadership should push back by, at first, talking about impacted officers and highlighting their achievements. As military leaders make the rounds through Congress for budget hearings, every question should be met with an explanation of how promotional delays will impact one worthy officer after another.\n\nThe Senate, for its part, can start by moving to promote Captain Paul Lanzilotta, the hard-working skipper of the persnickety USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78) supercarrier-showing just how hard it is to get a single deserving officer through the promotional process.\n\nThe Navy needs Captain Lanzilotta. After completing one of the toughest command tours in the Navy, Paul Lanzilotta deserves promotion. For two hard years, Captain Lanzilotta turned the troubled ship around, leading the aircraft carrier through a barrage of high-profile tests and trials . He finally got the new supercarrier certified for the ship's \"regular\" deployment, and, upon the ship's triumphant post-certification arrival in Norfolk earlier this month, Captain Lanzilotta should have been able to pin on his star and promote to rear admiral right there on the pier, surrounded by his family and crew. It was a heck of an achievement, and Lanzilotta, with his composure and get-it-done attitude, did both the Navy and Nation a great service.\n\nHe deserves better.\n\nWithout a promotion, Lanzilotta's future is uncertain. The USS Ford is set to deploy in May, backing up NATO at a critical time. Will the carrier get a new Captain before it deploys? Will Lanzilotta solider on, leading the carrier through a real-world deployment? What will the Navy officer who was tapped to serve as the USS Ford's next Captain do? Sit in purgatory and watch his career slip away? What will the families do as they sit in limbo? The Navy has yet to answer these questions, but they should, in a very public way, detail the readiness cost, career uncertainty and emotional toll Tuberville is inflicting upon America's most committed warriors.\n\nIf Tuberville continues holding up the Pentagon's orderly promotional process, both the Senate and the U.S. military have options. While the Pentagon won't collapse as quite as fast as the Tuberville-led 2008 Auburn Tigers, the Department of Defense should make it very clear-in detailed, personally-relatable ways-that Tuberville's grand-standing will have real readiness consequences. To do this, the Pentagon should be employing every available public messaging tool they have to explain the costs of Tuberville's political gamesmanship to America.\n\nPassivity or appeasement will not work. With no push-back or other public consequences, Senators will find the temptation to tinker with the Pentagon's promotional processes hard to resist. Already, several Senators have moved to support Tuberville's egregious disservice to worthy service members. According to the Washington Examiner , Senators Mike Lee (R-UT), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Deb Fischer (R-NE), John Thune (R-SD), Ted Budd (R-NC), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Steve Daines (R-MT), Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Joni Ernst (R-IA) have all signaled their support. And, now, the standoff shows every sign of dragging on indefinitely, with no plan for a resolution.\n\nThere's a reason why, when ESPN convened \"a blue-ribbon panel of 150 media members, administrators, and former players and coaches\" to elect the \"150 Greatest College Football Coaches of All Time,\" Tuberville was left off the list. For Tuberville, showy tactics trump strategy, and, rather than try and pass a law changing Pentagon practices, he has, true to form, embarked on his latest play with no real plan to win. It's why the Senate's self-described \"Coach\" might be headed for another big loss-in a costly game that only China and Russia will cheer."

Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) is pushing the Senate to quickly confirm the second-in-command appointee to the U.S. Marine Corps, after the Marines' top official collapsed over the weekend, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday-a reversal for Tuberville, who has held up hundreds of military promotions this year because of the Pentagon's abortion policy.\n\nTuberville has been blocking hundreds of military promotions this year because of a Pentagon ... More abortion policy.\n\nTuberville is urging fellow senators to confirm Lt. Gen. Christopher Mahoney, who was appointed by President Joe Biden in July, to be second-in-command at the Marine Corps, the Journal reported, citing an unnamed Senate aide.\n\nThe Alabama senator is circulating a petition that would require the support of 16 senators to push the Senate to consider Mahoney's nomination, according to the Journal.\n\nTuberville's office did not immediately respond to Forbes' request for comment.\n\nOver the weekend, U.S. Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Eric Smith suffered a medical emergency and was hospitalized, the Marine Corps said in a press release. Because Mahoney's appointment has not yet been confirmed, the next most senior office in the Marine Corps headquarters is filling in for Smith. Since the medical emergency on Sunday, the Marine Corps has not provided an update on Smith's condition.\n\nIt's unclear how much support Tuberville's reported petition has among his fellow senators, many of whom have urged him to stop holding up nominees.\n\nIf Tuberville gets enough support for the petition, Mahoney could be confirmed by the Senate as early as Thursday, according to the Journal .\n\nMahoney's nomination is one of hundreds of military appointments currently held up. Tuberville's objection surrounds a Pentagon policy that pays for members' travel expenses when they seek out-of-state abortions. For most of the year, Tuberville has blocked military nominations from being quickly approved, arguing the Pentagon policy misuses government funding. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) can still move the nominations forward through a slower process, but he has been hesitant in the past to confirm individual nominations as the Senate usually approves appointments in bulk and that would break with Senate tradition. Despite Schumer reluctance, last month, a new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was approved using this mechanism, as were a number of other military leaders including Smith.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has also expressed concern over Tuberville's holds, saying he doesn't \"support putting a hold on military nominations.\" And Biden has called Tuberville's move \"irresponsible,\" saying the senator is \"jeopardizing U.S. security.\"\n\nSenate To Vote On Key Military Confirmations Amid Tuberville Blockade ( Forbes )\n\nArmy And Marines Now Leaderless As Senator Blocks Hundreds Of Nominations-A Historic First ( Forbes )\n\nBiden Blasts Tuberville For 'Jeopardizing National Security' By Holding Up Hundreds Of Military Nominees ( Forbes )\n\nNaval Chief Retires - Leaving Navy, Army, And Marines Without Leadership Amid Tuberville's Abortion Protest ( Forbes )"

      "text": "Tommy Tuberville Hands Biden's Navy Secretary, Carlos Del Toro, New Relevance\n\nBy Craig Hooper\n\nBy Craig Hooper ,\n\nSenior Contributor.\n\nThe invigorated Secretary of the Navy talks shipyards and strategy with California Congressman John ... More Garamendi.\n\nThe months-long hold on senior military promotions by Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) has unintentionally freed Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro from an excruciating bureaucratic limbo.\n\nWith no \"confirmed\" Chief of Naval Operations to keep the Navy secretary in check, and almost every other high-level Navy leader on tenterhooks over an uncertain Senate approval process, Del Toro is busy rolling out new initiatives, demanding Navy accountability and generally making the most of his newfound bureaucratic freedom.\n\nFor a service secretary, Del Toro's decisive ascension to relevance is unprecedented.\n\nDel Toro has moved quickly. After the mid-August retirement of Admiral Michael M. Gilday, the former Chief of Naval Operations, Del Toro has raced to position President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party for some big national security wins in maritime policy.\n\nIt's no secret that Del Toro, a former ship captain and successful businessman, has chafed in the downsized Navy Secretariat post. A year ago, caught between a scandal-prone Admiralty and powerful Defense Department leaders, Del Toro cut a tragic figure , left barely able to even hire his own team to staff the Navy front office.\n\nBut now, after being unshackled from the post's bureaucratic constraints, the Navy secretary has slipped his moorings, and is racing to make up for lost time.\n\nAn unleashed SECNAV mingles with shipyard workers.\n\nFrom the moment Admiral Gilday was ceremoniously clapped out of the Pentagon, Del Toro has been on a bureaucratic rampage.\n\nWithin forty-eight hours of Gilday's retirement, Del Toro was off touring New Jersey's Bayonne Dry Dock and Repair Corporation, a New Jersey ship repair facility. He followed that visit with a trip this week to California's now-privatized Mare Island Naval Shipyard, offering a strong counterpoint to Gilday's oft-troubled efforts to develop and hold to a long-term fleet maintenance strategy .\n\nDel Toro's plans to shutter the Unmanned Task Force, founded by Admiral Gilday in September 2021, bubbled into public view within just a few weeks of Gilday's departure. The Secretary followed through, rolling out the newly-formed \"Disruptive Capabilities Office\" days ago.\n\nThree months after a beaming Admiral Gilday presided over the retirement ceremony for Rear Adm. Peter Stamatopoulos, Del Toro put the Navy's broken accountability system on full display by finally censuring Stamatopoulos and two other Admirals who had retired on Gilday's watch over failings associated with a disastrous 2021 spill at Hawaii's Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility .\n\nIn late-September, Del Toro established the Navy Department Science and Technology Board, offering the Secretary's staff a non-Navy source of high-level guidance on \"scientific, technical, manufacturing, acquisition, logistics, medicine and business management functions.\" A week later, he followed up his new focus on high-tech challenges with a visit to Ginkgo Bioworks, a well-connected bioinformatics and synthetic biology-focused company.\n\nAt Harvard University, the Navy secretary rolled out a far-reaching \" New Maritime Statecraft \" strategy that aims to go beyond naval diplomacy and meld together a \"national, whole-of-government effort to build comprehensive U.S. and allied maritime power, both commercial and naval.\"\n\nAnd, finally, earlier this week, the invigorated Del Toro even dared to tweak the nose of Republican members of Congress by announcing the next Virginia Class submarine will be the future USS San Francisco (SSN-810). On the very day former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was summarily ushered out of her Capital hideaway-with less than 24-hours of notice-Del Toro announced that Pelosi was to be the sub's sponsor.\n\nSen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala. may have done the Democrats an unintentional favor.\n\nBy refusing to confirm high-level military officers, Senator Tuberville has unintentionally put the Biden Administration in a position where it can drive maritime security policy.\n\nThe interplay between the Admiralty and the Navy Secretary is not something that gets a lot of scrutiny in Washington. But, usually, when faced with an independent-minded Navy secretary, Admirals and Department of Defense bureaucrats join forces in defenestrating the Navy's civilian leaders.\n\nIn general, the Pentagon is a more serene place when a Navy secretary is content to follow orders and do little more than show the flag at ceremonial events. The only problem is that sort of docility does little good for a Navy desperate for accountable leadership.\n\nTuberville may well be upset at giving the Biden Administration an opening to grab and run with a new maritime security strategy. But, by upending a long-standing operational dynamic at the Pentagon, Tuberville can certainly take solace in the fact that he is giving Washington an opportunity to see how America's insular and problem-riddled Navy, long accustomed to essentially running itself, responds to active and empowered civilian leadership."

But that's more the Democrats .\"\n\n\"But don't you think both sides should do the vetting?\" Raju asked.\n\n\"Well, you know, to some degree,\" the Alabama lawmaker said. \"I mean, but we have to be convinced. I mean, they should do all the background work. They should go after our nominees.\"\n\nHe added: \"Donald Trump did all the vetting they needed to do on [Secretary of Defense nominee] Pete Hegseth. And I just can't believe we have people on our side, they're saying, 'Well, I've got to look at this.'\"\n\nTuberville said that Republicans who voice concerns about Trump's nominees are \"throwing rocks at Donald Trump. They're not throwing them at Pete Hegseth, they're throwing them at Donald Trump because they're saying, 'Well, we don't believe you did the right vetting and we don't believe he can do the job.'\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" he added. \"That's not our job to do that. That's the Democrats.\"\n\nTrump's transition process has seen its share of difficulties; his first pick for attorney general, former Florida Representative Matt Gaetz , withdrew from consideration just eight days after being nominated amid a slew of sexual misconduct and drug use allegations.\n\nEarlier this week, Florida sheriff Chad Chronister, Trump's nominee to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration, withdrew from consideration three days after being tapped for the role.\n\nHegseth could be the next to go; the former Fox News host has been accused of sexual misconduct, and on Sunday, the New Yorker reported that he was intoxicated several times while he was the CEO of the Koch-backed group Concerned Veterans for America (CVA) between 2013 and 2016.\n\nAsked about the article, Hegseth told reporters that he was \"not going to dignify that with a response.\"\n\nSome Republican senators appeared to be on the fence about Hegseth even before the New Yorker 's report was published.\n\n\"Wow,\" Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski said in response to the nomination last month, according to Punchbowl News senior congressional reporter Andrew Desiderio.\n\nRepublican Senator Thom Tillis called the choice \"interesting,\" Desiderio posted on X, formerly Twitter .

He remains defiant in public and told reporters on Wednesday that Trump had told him to \"keep going, keep fighting.\"\n\nHe also told host Megyn Kelly on her podcast that he'd spoken to Trump and \"things were addressed.\" He added that Trump assured him that \"you're my guy.\"\n\nSonam Sheth is an Evening Politics Editor at Newsweek who is based in New York.

President's Joint Address Will Celebrate It | Opinion\n\nAdvocates for ideas and draws conclusions based on the interpretation of facts and data.\n\nNewsweek AI is in beta. Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nTonight, President Donald Trump will give his first joint address to Congress since his triumphant return to the White House. For the past four years, Americans endured a national nightmare under the Biden administration. Democrats opened our borders-allowing criminals, terrorists, drug dealers, and murderers to flood into our country unchecked. They canceled American energy production and forced us to rely on our foreign adversaries for energy. They wrote a blank check to Ukraine-while doing nothing to actually stop the bloodshed. They even went as far as to support men competing in women's sports. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris brought this country to the brink of destruction.\n\nThe last four years were a dumpster fire-a total disaster. \"Sleepy Joe\" was worn slap out as soon as he got up in the morning. Thinking back on it now, I really don't know how our country survived. It's a miracle that we made it through those dark days. One thing is for sure: President Trump's address will be nothing like the clown show we endured the last four years.\n\nBut today, America is ready to usher in its golden age under President Donald J. Trump. We're only a month and a half in, and President Trump is well on his way to renewing the American dream by reversing some of the Democrats' most destructive policies. Most importantly, President Trump is keeping his promises to the 77 million Americans who voted for him and his \"America First\" agenda. A recent poll showed 70 percent of Americans believe President Trump is doing what he said he would do.\n\nWe've already seen a whole lot of winning. Illegal border crossings have plummeted under the Trump administration, reaching their lowest levels in decades . Democrats' \"catch and release\" program has been replaced with detaining and deporting illegal immigrants. Since master-dealmaker President Trump first threatened tariffs, Canada and Mexico have been pulling their weight to stop the flow of illegal immigrants and deadly fentanyl into the U.S. It's about time they pony up and contribute to this so-called \"alliance.\"\n\nTwo weeks ago, the administration officially designated eight different cartel groups as foreign terrorist organizations. Did Border Czar Kamala Harris recommend any of these policies? I don't think so. She was too busy trying to keep the Left's radical agenda alive. Border security is national security, and President Trump is making the safety of U.S. citizens his top priority.\n\nPresident Trump is also hard at work restoring common-sense policies. For example, his administration announced that schools that still enforce COVID vaccine mandates will no longer receive federal funding . President Trump also signed an executive order defining gender as male and female, along with one banning men from competing in women's sports.\n\nPresident Trump is also taking action to cut wasteful spending and lower prices for hard-working Americans. Thanks to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), taxpayers are already seeing an estimated $100 billion in savings from the elimination of waste, fraud, and abuse. The administration is also getting rid of burdensome and costly regulations on everyday appliances like gas stoves , along with the ridiculous Biden-era electric vehicle mandates.\n\nThanks to President Trump's master negotiating skills, Hamas has released Israeli hostages. President Trump is actively working to facilitate peace and end the bloodshed in the Russia-Ukraine war. The U.S. is no longer funding the terrorist-sympathizing UNRWA or the corrupt and fraudulent USAID. President Trump also made it clear that our military will be focused on lethality, not woke DEI politics. And the icing on the cake was Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth reversing the Pentagon 's immoral policy allowing taxpayer dollars to fund abortion-related travel.\n\nI was particularly thrilled when President Trump signed an executive order to protect Title IX and keep men out of women's sports . But unfortunately, executive orders can be reversed. My bill, the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act , finally got a vote last night in the Senate . Every Democrat voted against it. Last week, my wife Suzanne and I welcomed our first granddaughter, Rosie Grace. Now that I'm a grandfather, I'm more motivated than ever to continue fighting to permanently keep men out of women's sports.\n\nPresident Trump is doing something rare in D.C.: delivering on his campaign promises. From cutting wasteful spending with DOGE to renaming the beautiful Gulf of America , President Trump is renewing the American dream. And he's not slowing down. Trump has brought unbelievable energy to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. He won't rest until American families, businesses, farmers, and manufacturers are winning again.\n\nWe have a long way to go if we're going to get our country back on track and truly make America great again. But we're well on our way. I look forward to hearing his address tonight and am committed to helping advance his agenda from the Senate.\n\nTommy Tuberville is the senior United States senator from Alabama, a seat he has held since 2021.

Clark, one of Lloyd Austin 's most senior advisers, as a squabble continues over why it took so long for the president to be told that his defense secretary was in intensive care at a hospital in January.\n\nClark, 58, was to be appointed the four-star commander of U.S. Army operations in the Pacific prior to Tuberville's intervention, according to the senator's spokesperson, Mallory Jaspers.\n\nIn 2023, Tuberville sparked fury in military circles after blocking hundreds of senior military promotions to protest a new Pentagon policy providing travel reimbursement for servicewomen who had to travel out of state to receive an abortion, following the overturning of Roe v. Wade . The senator ended his blockade in December after coming under intense pressure from within his own party.\n\nAustin received surgery for prostate cancer on December 22, but there were complications with the procedure that resulted in the 71-year-old defense secretary being admitted to intensive care, where he was diagnosed with bladder and urinary tract infections.\n\nAustin's team was not aware he was receiving surgery for cancer until January 2, at which point he was in intensive care, and they didn't tell the White House for another two days. Austin's hospitalization was finally revealed to the public on January 5, sparking an angry response from members of Congress who felt they should have been told sooner.\n\nIn a statement provided to The Washington Post , Jaspers said her boss was holding up Clark's promotion in direct response to his role in the controversy around Austin's health.\n\n\"Sen. Tuberville has concerns about Lt. Gen. Clark's actions during Secretary Austin's hospitalization,\" Jaspers said. \"Lt. Gen. Clark knew that Sec. Austin was incapacitated and did not tell the Commander in Chief. As a senior commissioned officer, Lt. Gen. Clark's oath requires him to notify POTUS [president of the United States] when the chain of command is compromised.\"\n\nThe incident is being investigated by the Department of Defense's inspector general and Jaspers said Tuberville is awaiting its verdict before deciding on his next steps. Jaspers told Newsweek that Tuberville had no further comment beyond his statement. Newsweek also contacted the Department of Defense press office for comment via email on Tuesday.\n\nPentagon spokesperson James Adams told The Washington Post : \"Lt. Gen. Clark is highly qualified and was nominated for this critical position because of his experience and strategic expertise. We urge the Senate to confirm all of our qualified nominees. These holds undermine our military readiness.\"\n\nIn February, Austin addressed the controversy around his hospitalization during a Pentagon press briefing, saying : \"I want to be crystal clear. We did not handle this right, and I did not handle this right. I should have told the president about my cancer diagnosis, and I also should have told my team and the American public.\"\n\nLater that month, Austin was hospitalized after suffering \"symptoms suggesting an emergent bladder issue\" but was released shortly afterward.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nJames Bickerton is a Newsweek U.S. News reporter based in London, U.K. His focus is on covering news and politics in Texas, as well as other general news across the United States.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nWith the August recess coming to an end, the House and Senate will soon reconvene to focus on passing spending bills for Fiscal Year 2025. While funding the government is vital, I believe preserving the integrity of our elections is the most pressing issue before Congress . It is imperative that we attach the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act to the upcoming continuing resolution (CR) before Americans cast their ballots this fall.\n\nI am glad to see that Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) intends to include the SAVE Act in the House version of the CR-an excellent decision. I'm calling on the Senate to follow Speaker Johnson's lead to assure the American people that their voices will be heard this November.\n\nThe SAVE Act, introduced by Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Representative Chip Roy (R-Tex.), requires people residing within our country to present proof of U.S. citizenship when registering to vote in federal elections. It's a straightforward proposition: If you are not a U.S. citizen, then you cannot vote in our nation's elections. I am a proud cosponsor of this bill, along with 22 of my Senate colleagues.\n\nThis legislation would require states to regularly take steps to ensure only U.S. citizens vote in our elections. Additionally, it would compel states to remove foreign nationals from federal voter lists, create a right of action to sue government officials who intentionally register foreign nationals, establish criminal penalties for officials who register foreign nationals, and require the Federal Election Commission to create guidelines to help state officials implement the SAVE Act's requirements.\n\nIt's a common-sense piece of legislation that would strengthen the integrity of our federal elections. Now, more than ever, it's critical that Congress pass the SAVE Act along with the CR. The inclusion of this bill will help preserve the country our Founders fought so hard to establish. Without it, America as we know it may not survive.\n\nUnsurprisingly, some Democrats and their media allies have attacked this common-sense legislation, claiming that it is already illegal for noncitizens to vote. While foreign nationals are technically prohibited from voting, no mechanism currently exists to effectively enforce that law. Unlike Speaker Johnson, I'm not an accomplished constitutional attorney. But I do know that you might as well not have laws if you don't enforce them.\n\nThe SAVE Act would solve this problem. Senate leadership knows the legislation would restore the integrity of our elections. They should push back against its critics, just like Speaker Johnson has.\n\nSenate leadership also knows that the Biden-Harris administration has opened our borders to more than 10 million illegal aliens over the last three and half years. Regardless of their motivations for being here, not one foreign national should be able to vote in our federal elections. That right is reserved solely for U.S. citizens.\n\nI appreciate the complexities of negotiating these spending bills. No one ever gets exactly what they want out of budget discussions. But this issue is simple: protect our democracy by ensuring that Americans, not foreign nationals, democratically decide what direction our country should go.\n\nIf Senate leadership truly believes our democracy is sacred, and that the SAVE Act is redundant because it's already illegal for undocumented immigrants to cast a ballot in federal elections, then passing a CR with the SAVE Act included shouldn't be an issue. If it is a problem for Democrats, they should explain to the American people what the hang-up is.\n\nThe most consequential election in our lifetime is quickly approaching. And it is arguably one of the most important elections in the history of our country. The people of this country are hurting. Now is not the time to allow our fellow citizens to question whether their voices will be heard at the polls, regardless of which party they belong to.\n\nThe SAVE Act passed the House on a bipartisan basis on July 10. I ask that Senate leadership follow Speaker Johnson's lead and renew its commitment to the American people. Secure our elections by agreeing to include the SAVE Act in the next government funding bill. The hour is late, and the time is near. The future of our republic hangs in the balance.\n\nTommy Tuberville is the senior U.S. senator from Alabama.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the writer's own.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nGovernor Tim Walz reportedly described himself as the \"anti-Tommy Tuberville\" at a fundraising event in Boston on Wednesday night.\n\nMinnesota Governor Walz has seen his profile surge since he was announced as Kamala Harris 's 2024 vice presidential running mate earlier this month.\n\nWalz previously coached football at Minnesota's Mankato West High School, where, according to the Associated Press, his team won the state championship in 1999.\n\nArkansas Senator Tuberville had an extensive career as a football head coach before entering politics, with a 159-99 record over 21 seasons, 14 of which were spent in the Southeastern Conference (SEC).\n\nWalz was quoted as saying: \"I feel like one of my roles in this now is to be the anti-Tommy Tuberville, to show that football coaches are not the dumbest people.\"\n\nHuffPost senior politics reporter Igor Bobic and NBC News Washington D.C. correspondent Yamiche Alcindor reported the incident, citing the White House press pool.\n\nWhen contacted for comment Tuberville's office directed Newsweek to an X post from the congressman in which, responding to Walz's remarks, he said : \"Speaking of an embarrassment to the Coaching profession...\n\n\" Tim Walz DESERTED his military unit when he found out they were deploying to Iraq.\n\n\"Walz had the Police ABANDON precincts while his cities burned in 2020. And Walz had tampon dispensers installed in BOYS' bathrooms. He doesn't need to worry about speaking on behalf of Coaches. #TamponTim\"\n\nNewsweek reached out to Walz and Harris's presidential campaign for comment via email on Thursday outside of regular office hours.\n\nCody Sargent, Tuberville's former press secretary, hit back at Walz on X, commenting: \"You're a former high school *assistant* coach now overseeing a massive decline in student performance as governor.\n\n\"Senator Tuberville is a 5x national Coach of the Year and 7x conference champion. So, no, Tim Walz, you're no Coach Tuberville.\"\n\nSince being selected as Harris's 2024 running mate, Walz, who spent 24 years in the Army National Guard, has been criticized by prominent Republicans over his service record .\n\nIn a post on X, Ohio Senator JD Vance , Trump's 2024 running mate, said Walz had \"lied\" about serving in a combat zone and resigning from the Minnesota National Guard shortly after his battalion was told it could be deployed to Iraq in 2005.\n\nWalz said he resigned so he could run for Congress , and according to the Minnesota National Guard, his resignation was submitted before the deployment plans were announced.\n\nA recent Big Village Caravan survey of 181 voters aged between 18 and 26 found Walz had a net favorability rating of minus 3.4 in this age group, placing him substantially behind Harris and Trump, who had positive ratings of 11.1 and 2.7 points, respectively.\n\nWalz's remark sparked a mixed reaction from X users, with one commenting : \"Tommy Tuberville was a college football head coach who won an SEC title and was AP and SEC Coach of the Year in 2004. Tim Walz was an ASSISTANT high school football coach. If anyone is dumb, it's Tim Walz for comparing his football credentials to Tuberville.\"\n\nAnother X user wrote, \"Tuberville was a collegiate HC for 21 seasons with 159-99 record. Tim Walz was an assistant HS football coach. Talk about stolen valor comparing yourself as a coach.\"\n\nDonny Ferguson, an X user from Virginia, wrote : \"1) Walz is absolutely a coach.\n\n\"2) Tuberville is a national champion who helped coach one of A&M's best seasons and beat the Longhorns by 24 in Austin.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nAlabama Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville has described the U.S. military as the weakest it has ever been during his lifetime, which he blames on wokeness being implemented under the Biden administration.\n\nSpeaking to Newsmax 's Eric Bolling, Tuberville criticized the $114 million requested by the Pentagon for its diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) programs for the fiscal year 2024. The senator also spoke of the now-repealed COVID-19 vaccine mandate for all serving service members, as another reason why the U.S. military is a complete disaster.\n\nThe comments from Tuberville, who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee but has never served in the military, have been criticized. The senator is blocking hundreds of military nominations and promotions in protest at a Pentagon policy of reimbursing travel costs for service members seeking an abortion. The policy was put in place in the wake of the Supreme Court voting to overturn Roe vs. Wade in June 2022.\n\n\"$114 million on diversity training, you've got to be kidding me,\" Tuberville said on Eric Bolling The Balance.\n\n\"We've got the weakest military that we've had in probably my lifetime,\" Tuberville added. \"Infiltrating our military is all this wokeness, and it's coming from the top, coming from Joe Biden , coming from Secretary of Defense [Lloyd] Austin. It's coming from [former Joint Chiefs Chair General Mark] Milley, who is recently gone. It's a disaster.\n\n\"They can't get anybody to join the military. They're begging people to come back that left because they didn't take the vaccine. We're in huge trouble. Our country is in huge trouble.\"\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccine mandate for military personnel was rescinded in January 2023. A CNN report in October found that 43 of the more than 8,000 U.S. service members who were discharged for refusing to be vaccinated applied to rejoin the military after the rules were lifted.\n\n\"People better wake up and see what's going on. It is a disaster. What's going on just in our country, and then you, as you brought up, Israel is a mess . The Middle East, Ukraine is a mess. We're spending money right and left,\" Tuberville added.\n\n\"It is a complete disaster that the Biden administration has self-inflicted on the American taxpayer.\" Newsweek emailed Tuberville for comment on Tuesday.\n\nAlexander Vindman is the former U.S. Army lieutenant colonel and whistleblower whose testimony led to Donald Trump's first impeachment . Vindman was one of those who condemned Tuberville's comments while noting his months-long blockade of military promotions.\n\n\"I agree with you Tuberville. The US military is weakened. But not by 'wokeness,' it is weakened by your attacks, obstruction of military promotions, & your serving our enemy's interests,\" Vindman posted on X, formerly Twitter . He shared a clip of the senator's interview. \"Despite you the US military remains the most powerful force in the world!\"\n\nAdam Kinzinger, a former Republican congressman who served in the Air Force, added: \"Tuberville is an idiot, wrong, and obviously doesn't understand the absolute lethality of the US military. Come on Alabama do better.\"\n\nTuberville's abortion protest has been met with outcry from both Democratic and GOP senators.\n\nSouth Carolina's Lindsey Graham urged the Alabama Republican to end his blanket ban of routine military promotions. He said that it is one of the \"worst self-inflicted wounds in 20 years\" in a recent speech on the Senate floor.\n\nIn a \"dear colleagues\" letter sent on Sunday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said that Democrats are taking steps to \"swiftly confirm the hundreds of highly qualified and dedicated military leaders\" currently being held up by Tuberville by the end of the year.\n\nThe move may be possible after the Democrat-controlled Senate Rule Committee voted to circumvent what Schumer said is an \"extreme and unprecedented obstruction\" from Tuberville.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nEwan Palmer is a Newsweek News Reporter based in London, U.K. His focus is reporting on US politics, and Florida news.

The Democrat's corruption trial began at Manhattan's Federal District Court on Monday, with the 70-year-old accused of plotting with his wife, Nadine Menendez, to accept bribes in exchange for legal and political favors.\n\nMenendez also allegedly assisted the Egypt and Qatar governments on U.S. policy matters during his time as chair of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\n\"As a New Jersey resident, as a constituent of yours, Senator Menendez, I have to ask, with all due respect, how f****** dumb is you?\" Stewart joked.\n\n\"Promising favors to foreign entities for little chump change on the side, it's bush league, when, as a U.S. senator, you can enrich yourself in so many different, let's call them, 'legal ways.' For instance, the stock market.\"\n\nStewart then cut to a C-SPAN segment on members of Congress ' stock portfolios. In the brief clip, an expert references a study that found the average U.S. senator \"beats\" the stock market by 12 percent, whereas the average for hedge-fund managers is 7 percent.\n\n\"If you think it's because the average U.S. senator is just so smart, this is the average U.S. senator,\" Stewart said, pointing to a photo of Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville.\n\n\"Tommy Tuberville, an ex-football coach, who doesn't know the three branches of government.

I'm kidding, they have inside information.\"\n\nStewart returned to The Daily Show in February following a nine-year hiatus. The 61-year-old is covering the run-up to the general election in November, and has been hitting out at politicians across the political spectrum.\n\nDuring last week's show, Stewart ripped into Trump over his New York criminal case, comparing the nonstop media coverage to O.J. Simpson's 1995 murder trial. The former president is facing 34 felony counts of falsifying business documents, allegedly to conceal \"hush money\" payments to Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 general election. Trump is rumored to have had an affair with the adult film star in 2006. The 77-year-old has denied the claims, along with the fraud charges.\n\nStewart has also poked fun at President Joe Biden . The Emmy winner was dubbed a \"both-sidest fraud\" by some viewers in March for his jibes about the 81-year-old's age , with Stewart dubbing this year's presidential race: \"Indecision 2024: Electile Dysfunction.\"\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nSophie is a Newsweek Pop Culture and Entertainment Reporter based in Lincoln, UK.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nSenator Tommy Tuberville could cause for his Republican colleagues to work through their summer vacation if he continues holding up hundreds of military promotions over the Department of Defense's abortion policy.\n\nSenate Leader Chuck Schumer has left open the possibility of keeping the Senate in session into the August recess amid calls from top Democrats to do so if that's what it takes to get Tuberville to give up his blockade of the promotion.\n\nBipartisan lawmakers have long worked together to approve military promotions in the Senate, but Tuberville has been blocking those promotions since February. Without Senate confirmation, more than 250 nominations have stalled.\n\nTuberville's blockade is part of his effort to demand that the Pentagon overturn its abortion policy, which provides travel expenses and paid leave for service members seeking the procedure. The Alabama Republican has faced criticisms from the White House, President Joe Biden 's nominee for chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and even top Republicans , like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Whip John Thune, who say they don't support his actions.\n\nAlthough canceling the August recess is an extreme measure, some Democratic senators have called on Schumer to use a procedural motion to force a Senate vote on keeping senators in Washington, D.C. during Congress ' annual five-week recess. This year's August recess is set to begin at the end of next week.\n\nThose calls are gaining steam now that two other Republican senators are stalling nearly three dozen nominees for U.S. ambassadors. Senators J.D. Vance and Rand Paul are blocking the confirmation of those nominees, who are almost all career Foreign Service officers and enjoy majority support, citing concerns over diversity initiatives and research into COVID-19 origins.\n\n\"We've got to be willing to stay through the August recess or through weekends in order to move these ambassadors,\" Democratic Senator Chris Murphy told Punchbowl News. He said while the public might not understand why it's critical to swiftly confirm these ambassadors, he warned that it could harm national security.\n\n\"It's not rocket science. We just have to be willing to put in the time,\" he said.\n\nBut none of those efforts seem likely to sway Tuberville into changing his mind. A spokesperson for the senator told Newsweek that he will keep his holds in place until the Pentagon rescinds its abortion policy or Democrats bring a bill on the matter to the Senate floor.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has also warned that the delay in promotions caused by Tuberville could result in a \"brain drain\" from the military.\n\n\"Military families do not know where they will live, where spouses will work, where children will go to school,\" she said on Monday.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Tuberville told the Senate floor, \"It just makes me that much stronger to hear people complain about this, knowing that deep down somewhere there's a soft part in their heart for the four to five thousand unborn babies that will never breathe life on this earth. So, the more Joe Biden attacks me, the more I'm convinced that I'm doing the right thing.\"\n\nHe has also argued that his position remains popular back in his home state and that he's been widely supported by his constituents in Alabama.\n\nSchumer has agreed to give Tuberville a standalone vote on the Pentagon's abortion policy in an attempt to convince him to stop the blockade, telling NBC News on Wednesday that if the Alabama Republican \"wants to have an affirmative vote, we would not object to it.\"\n\n\"In terms of staying [through August], our first job is to pass NDAA and then we'll see what happens and go from there,\" Schumer said.\n\nUpdate 07/20/23 2:55 pm ET This story was updated with comments from Tuberville.\n\nKatherine Fung is a Newsweek senior reporter based in New York City.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Top defense officials are accusing Republican Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville of jeopardizing America's national security with his hold on roughly 300 military promotions , raising the stakes in a clash over abortion policy that shows no signs of easing.\n\nTuberville brushed off the criticism, vowing he will not give in. \"We're going to be in a holding pattern for a long time,\" he said, if the Pentagon refuses to end its policy of paying for travel when a servicemember goes out of state to get an abortion or other reproductive care.\n\nIt's a classic Washington standoff with rippling effects across the country, placing the lives of servicemembers effectively on hold as they await what has traditionally been routine Senate approval for their promotions.\n\nFrustration mounting, the secretaries of the Navy, Air Force and Army wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post this week saying Tuberville's efforts were not only unfair to the military leaders and their families but also \"putting our national security at risk.\"\n\nThey noted that three military branches - the Army, Navy and Marine Corps - have no Senate-confirmed chiefs in place. Those jobs are being performed without the full range of legal authorities necessary to make decisions that will sustain the United States' military edge, they wrote.\n\nIn a CNN interview, Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro accused Tuberville of \"playing Russian roulette with the very lives of our servicemembers by denying them the opportunity to actually have the most experienced combat leaders in those positions to lead them in times of peace and in times of combat.\"\n\nLooking ahead, the secretaries said in their op-ed that prolonged uncertainty and political battles over military nominations \"will have a corrosive effect on the force.\"\n\n\"The generals and admirals who will be leading our forces a decade from now are colonels and captains today,\" they wrote. \"They are watching this spectacle and might conclude that their service at the highest ranks of our military is no longer valued by members of Congress or, by extension, the American public.\"\n\nTuberville took umbrage with the three defense secretaries. He said they should have spoken with him first \"if you're gonna run your mouth in the paper.\"\n\n\"I have not heard from any of them,\" he said.\n\nIf they were truly worried about readiness at such a dangerous time for the world \"you would think they would be calling, 'Coach, let's work this out.' Zero,\" said Tuberville, a former college football coach.\n\nHowever, there have been multiple attempts by both the department's top civilian leaders and its top uniformed personnel to try and show Tuberville how the holds are doing harm, a senior military official and defense official said.\n\nA senior military official familiar with previous meetings with Tuberville said that despite telling the senator about the real-world and personal challenges that his hold has created on servicemembers, Tuberville has not seemed willing to change his position.\n\nTuberville said that during the August break, he visited six states, and \"I didn't have one negative comment from anybody. I had questions, but I didn't have any negative comments.\"\n\nHe insisted that he would lift his hold on the military nominations only after the Pentagon rescinds the policy that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin put into place in October, after the Supreme Court ended the constitutional protections for abortion that had been in place nearly 50 years.\n\nOnce the Pentagon returns to pre-memo policies on travel reimbursement, Democratic leaders could bring up for a Senate vote whatever replacement policy they want to enact, he said.\n\n\"Move it back,\" Tuberville said of the current reimbursement policy. \"And then have them write up what they want to vote on, and I will accept whichever way it goes. The holds are off. Let's go to work.\"\n\nTuberville's blockade is unique because it affects hundreds of military nominations and promotions. Democratic leaders would have to hold roll call votes on every one to get around the hold, an unwieldy and time-consuming process in a chamber that already struggles to finish its basic business.\n\nIt's a decades-long tradition for the Senate to group military nominations and approve them by voice vote, avoiding lengthy roll calls and reserving valuable floor time for other important issues.\n\nBut, while unusual, Tuberville's office notes that lawmakers from both parties have threatened holds on military promotions over the years. What's truly unprecedented is the length of time it has gone on with Tuberville.\n\nAustin has called Tuberville three times about the holds, the last time was on July 18, and the Pentagon's legislative affairs staff continues to engage, a defense official said on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue. Also, Defense Department staff met with Senate Armed Services Committee staff in July to go over the details of DOD's reproductive healthcare policy.\n\nBut Steven Stafford, a spokesman for Tuberville, said there has been no contact with the Biden administration about the holds at the principal or staff level since July 18, and no further communications are planned.\n\nThe Pentagon to date has not provided data on the number of servicemembers who have relied on the new policy to get access to an abortion citing privacy issues. It emphasizes that the new policy was in response to the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, which created a situation where federal troops serving in one state may not have access to the same type of reproductive services available in others.\n\nAs many as 650 nominations could be affected by the end of the year if the impasse continues. But if Republican leaders are pressuring Tuberville to end his holds, they are not doing so publicly.\n\n\"I'm hoping that the conversations that occur this week and the conversations that Senator Tuberville has had with the military leadership will lead to a breakthrough at some point,\" said Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate.\n\nThe Pentagon said the number of promotions on hold in the Senate has reached 98 in the Air Force, 91 in the Army, 86 in the Navy, 18 in the Marines and 8 in the Space Force.\n\nSome Republicans have suggested that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., could hold votes on some of the most critical nominations. But Schumer rejected that approach.\n\n\"The bottom line is this is a problem created by Republicans and it's up to them to solve it,\" Schumer said.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he would like for Schumer to schedule a vote on the Pentagon reimbursement policy, but if it fails, which it most assuredly would, \"it's now time to get these people promoted.\"\n\n\"I'd like to vote to rescind the policy, but I'm not going to hold the military up in perpetuity,\" Graham said.\n\nSen. Roger Wicker, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services committee, was asked if he had any recommendations or guidance for Tuberville that could resolve the impasse.\n\n\"I'm out of ideas,\" Wicker said.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "A new Pentagon policy helps troops who travel to receive abortions. Republicans want to block it.\n\nEven before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade, service members struggled to get abortions. Navigating different state laws, trying to obtain leave, and figuring out travel arrangements wasn't easy.\n\n\"Having it be so difficult, the barriers I had to overcome and jump over, it reset where I thought I fit into the military,\" said Air Force Major Sharon Arana.\n\nIn 2009, Arana became pregnant while she was in officer training in Alabama. She took a test in a gas station bathroom instead of going to the base clinic, fearing that her command would learn about the pregnancy.\n\nArana and her boyfriend ultimately decided to seek a medication abortion, but couldn't get an appointment in Alabama because there were so few clinics. When they drove to Georgia, they faced another problem. The couple shelled out several hundred dollars for a hotel, medical imaging and tests, only to be told that Georgia state law required a cooling off period.\n\n\"They said, 'Well, there's a three day waiting period,'\" Arana said. \"I'm like, 'I don't have three days, I have to go back to training.' So we drove back the next day, and then I graduated that week.\"\n\nArana later underwent an abortion in New York during scheduled leave to visit her family. But had that time off not already been in place, she said she doesn't know what she would have done.\n\nThose experiences are top of mind for her now that abortion is no longer protected under federal law. Arana has been telling her story and even testified before Congress, concerned that experiences like hers will become more common.\n\n\"This is directly affecting our airmen now and our families,\" she said. \"None of us asked for any of this. We don't get to choose where we live. We don't get to choose where we're stationed.... We should be protected from a lot of this.\"\n\nArana also helped shape a new Defense Department policy that allows service members to take up to three weeks of administrative leave for abortion or fertility treatment and reimburses them for travel expenses. It gives service members more time - 20 weeks - before they have to notify commanders about their pregnancies. It also restricts health care providers from telling commanders.\n\n\"The Department has heard from service members and their families about the complexity and uncertainty they now face in accessing reproductive health care,\" said Department of Defense spokesperson Cmdr. Nicole Schwegman.\n\n\"The efforts taken by the Department on reproductive health care not only ensures that service members and their families are afforded time and flexibility to make personal and private health care decisions, but also ensures service members are able to access care regardless of where they are stationed. These policies help address the fact that service members may be forced to travel greater distances, take more time off work, and pay more out-of-pocket expenses to access reproductive health care.\"\n\nAccording to some advocates, the military has taken an important step to meet troops' health needs.\n\n\"The military hasn't really been a leader on issues of reproductive access in the past, and to see them taking seriously the needs of service members is a refreshing change, especially in the context of gender,\" said Claire McKinney, a College of William and Mary professor who studies gender, politics and reproduction.\n\nTo take leave, service members only need to identify their request to their commander as a \"non-covered reproductive health care need.\" But to get reimbursed for travel, they have to get their pregnancy confirmed through a medical provider on or off base and give details about the clinic where they sought the abortion or fertility treatment.\n\nLorry Fenner, director of government relations for the Service Women's Action Network, said the policy does a good job of balancing troops' privacy with mission requirements - but that implementing it won't be easy.\n\n\"There will be problems,\" Fenner said. \"There are commanders who will not get the word or who will disagree and do everything they can to short circuit this. Because they believe that their mission is the number one priority. But the Secretary reminds them that the health and care of their members is what gets that mission done.\"\n\nMeanwhile some Republicans are trying to block the policy.\n\nWith the Hyde Amendment and other provisions, Congress already bans the federal government from paying for abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or where the mother's life is in danger. Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama argues that paying for travel to an abortion provider violates the spirit of Hyde.\n\n\"Secretary Austin's new abortion policy is immoral and arguably illegal. If he wants to change the law, he needs to go through Congress,\" he said in remarks on the Senate floor.\n\nRepublican members of Congress say they plan to try to make the policy explicitly illegal. They've proposed legislation that would ban the Department of Defense from funding service members' travel to obtain abortions.\n\nThis story was produced by the American Homefront Project, a public media collaboration that reports on American military life and veterans.\n\nCopyright 2023 North Carolina Public Radio - WUNC.

      "text": "Sen. Tommy Tuberville's Military Holdup, Explained\n\nIs the blockade of confirmations and promotions hurting military preparedness?\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer broke through a monthslong standoff Wednesday night when he pushed through a vote on the Senate floor to confirm the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Until the vote, Gen. Mark Milley's replacement as chairman of the Joint Chiefs, as well as the top positions of the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps, had been caught in Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville's ongoing hold on military confirmations.\n\nTuberville had been blocking the moves, and is still blocking hundreds more, in protest of the Defense Department's policy of providing administrative leave and covering travel costs for service members and their dependents who must travel for access to abortion. He and other Republicans say the policy violates the Hyde Amendment , a decades-old law that bars federal funds from being used for abortions. But the Hyde Amendment doesn't preclude the federal government from funding travel to obtain an abortion, and in October the Department of Justice released a memorandum defending the legality of the Defense Department policy. In a letter to Senate Armed Services Committee ranking Republican Roger Wicker, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin reported that only 12 women, of approximately 230,000 eligible service members, have utilized the policy. Politico reported that a number of service members declined to use the policy for fear of reassignment or retribution.\n\nSince Tuberville instituted his hold in March-when the policy he is protesting went into effect-Schumer has declined to hold floor votes for the senior leadership of the Marines, Army, and Navy, though the majority leader said Wednesday floor votes will come Thursday for the top Marine Corps and Army positions too. Still, the list of Tuberville's critics has grown to include other congressional Republicans . They all say Tuberville is ultimately harming the military and national security.\n\nWhom is Tuverbille blocking?\n\nAt last count before the Senate returned from the August recess, the Pentagon estimated Tuberville's hold had blocked 301 positions, many of them for high-ranking officers. \"The Department has 83 three- and four-star nominations pending for positions already vacated or due to rotate within the next 150 days,\" the Pentagon told reporters in August. Tuberville is blocking the promotions by objecting to them being confirmed via unanimous consent-the fast-track procedure the Senate can use to pass multiple measures at once, if no senators object. Until Tuberville began his objections, it was the customary way the Senate confirmed the majority of military promotions.\n\nIn a floor speech last week, Tuberville laid blame at the feet of Senate leadership. \"If my colleagues on the left were actually worried about readiness or military families, we would be voting on these nominees today,\" he said. Schumer could bring each nominee to the floor individually to circumvent the hold-which is what he did Wednesday for Milley's replacement, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Charles Q. Brown-but doing so for the hundreds of promotions still on hold would be a mammoth task. In July, the Senate Armed Services Committee estimated getting through all of the nominees would take more than 80 days of eight-hour Senate sessions, requiring Congress to vote on routine nominations of one- and two- star service members as well as the top brass.\n\nHistorically, senior leadership positions, such as staff chiefs and chairmen of the Joint Chiefs, do receive a floor vote. Milley was confirmed as the chairman of the joint chiefs 89-1 in a roll-call vote in 2019. In 2020, when Brown was nominated by President Donald Trump to lead the Air Force, he was confirmed by a 98-0 roll-call vote. But until this Tuberville forced his hand this week with his own push to bring the top positions up for a floor vote, Schumer had refused floor votes for those positions because he thought doing so would incentivize other senators to adopt Tuberville's tactics. \"If everyone objected to everything, to get leverage for their pet priorities, it will grind this body to a halt,\" Schumer said in a speech Wednesday.\n\nHow do we define 'readiness'?\n\nTuberville's critics say his blockade on promotions and confirmations has corroded \"military readiness.\"\n\n\"Readiness\" is broadly defined as the ability \"to meet immediate contingency and war fighting challenges while preparing for future challenges.\" To measure this, the Pentagon uses the Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS), which analyzes military units in four categories: personnel, equipment on hand, supply/maintenance, and training, though the specifics of this analysis are classified.\n\nMilitary readiness is typically understood as the ability to respond to threats and provocation.  In recent decades military strategy has been directed by the War on Terror. Following the military withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, the measurement for U.S. military readiness shifted east toward China. Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine also sets it as a marker for measuring readiness. \"War with either is neither inevitable nor imminent,\" Milley said earlier this year. He argued that preparing for war may be expensive, but fighting a war is even more so. Readiness, then, functions as a deterrent.\n\nIn May 2023, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a review of military readiness from 2017 to 2021-which reported increased readiness capability for ground operations but decreased capability on the sea. GAO cites a shift from a decades-long conflict in the Middle East back toward a great power competition as a challenge for the DOD to overcome as it seeks to rebuild military stockpiles and improve training and retention.\n\nThis report does not reflect any repercussions of Tuberville's hold, and military analysts disagree to the extent to which the holds are harming military readiness.\n\n\"We keep mystifying China with our behavior,\" Peter Feaver, a civil-military relations scholar at Duke University who served on the National Security Council in both President Bill Clinton and George W. Bush's administration, tells The Dispatch. \"We are trying desperately to meet the pace and challenge of China's rapid military build up-why would we hobble ourselves this way?\" The 2022 China Military Power Report , released by the Department of Defense, called China \"the most consequential and systemic challenge to our national security and to a free and open international system.\"\n\nThe would-be commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. Eric Smith-who was set to be confirmed in a floor vote Thursday-warned of the effects of holding up promotions when he testified before the Senate in June. \"When a three-star general retires ... there will be a one-star general, a fairly new one, in charge of [a] 48,000-person Marine Expeditionary Force,\" Smith said . \"It will have an effect.\"\n\nBut Mark Cancian, a retired Marine Corps colonel and now senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, argues that the Biden administration \"exaggerates the effect on military readiness\" of Tuberville's holds. He defines readiness as \"the ability of military forces to execute the tasks they have been assigned.\" Vacant positions are not left entirely empty, he points out. Most leadership positions are filled by immediate deputies, often the same people nominated to fill the position. If Milley leaves office at the end of the month before the Senate confirms Brown, the vice chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Christopher Grady, will hold both positions. The current heads of the Navy and Army are operating as both chief and vice chief concurrently. The acting commandant of the Marines is none other than the assistant commandant.\n\nIt's a similar argument to Tuberville's , which is that no job is going undone because replacements for vacant positions are being named in an \"acting capacity.\" While functionally this means there is still someone to pick up the phone in an emergent situation, they do not have Senate approval, nor the authority to change the direction of the branch.\n\n\"They are spread more thinly, it is harder for them to do two jobs,\" Cancian explains, but not impossible. \"The forward deployed forces are fully able to conduct their combat operations.\"\n\nDoes Tuberville's hold affect morale?\n\nEarlier this month, Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro, Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall, and Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth-the civilian leaders of their respective branches-penned an op-ed alleging Tuberville's actions are \"putting our national security at risk\" not only because of the vacancies themselves, but because the armed forces risk losing talented service members if the holds continue.\n\nThe secretaries point to the costs incurred by the service members who have had their lives put on hold awaiting confirmations, which \"include scores of combat veterans who have led our troops into deadly combat with valor and distinction.\" Cancian, who is unperturbed by allegations that Tuberville's hold will affect military retention, tells The Dispatch that families \"getting ready to move, getting ready to put their kids in different schools, and now they're on hold\" is the primary detriment, as he sees it, of Tuberville's campaign. While he contends that \"military personnel are used to getting jerked around, this is just one more instance of that. It doesn't mean we like it, but we are used to it.\"\n\nFeaver disagrees. \"At this stage we are doing serious damage to our military institutions, to military readiness ... causing real harm that could have lengthy consequences,\" he says. \"It affects the quality of future leaders if the best people get out.\"\n\nEmma Rogers is a former Dispatch intern.

      "text": "Tommy Tuberville's Military Holdups Picking Up GOP Detractors\n\nAnd why don't senators ever try to sneak unanimous consent requests through the chamber?\n\nHello and good afternoon! We're trying out a new format today to match some of our other newsletters. Let us know what you think.\n\nWorld War III may be brewing in the Middle East. A conflict over Taiwan could break out with China any day. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un continues to threaten the stability of the Korean Peninsula. And, Sen. Tuberville, did you know this U.S. military officer went to Auburn?\n\nNot even that old college try could move Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, former head football coach at Auburn University, off his nine-month blockade of military promotions. Some of his fellow Republicans-Sens. Joni Ernst, Dan Sullivan, Mitt Romney, Todd Young, and Lindsey Graham-spent nearly five hours on the Senate floor Wednesday night attempting to circumvent Tuberville's hold. But the Alabama Republican would not relent , even as his colleagues described 61 officers' impressive résumés, decades in the service, and the importance of their new appointments. Sullivan and Ernst at times grew visibly angry with Tuberville during the debate, demanding that he explain himself.\n\n\"We're going to look back at this episode,\" Sullivan said on the Senate floor, \"and just be stunned at what a national security suicide mission this became.\"\n\nAs we wrote to you in this newsletter-and highlighted in a recent explainer -Tuberville has been holding up military promotions in an attempt to force the Biden administration to change its approach to abortion in the military. The Senate often uses voice votes to approve uncontroversial measures or nominations, and members frequently rely on \"unanimous consent\" requests to circumvent the chamber's drawn out processes. But any one senator can block unanimous consent requests, as Tuberville has. Concerned with abortion access for troops in states that have adopted stricter rules since the end of Roe v. Wade , the Defense Department moved earlier this year to give paid time off to service members who travel for abortion services-and reimburse their travel costs. Many Republicans see the policy as a violation of the Hyde Amendment, a longstanding ban on federal funding of abortions.\n\nIt's not clear how many service members have used the abortion travel policy, although Republican Sen. Roger Wicker said in a letter in September that he's heard that number may be roughly 12. Wicker argued if that figure is accurate, service members would not be greatly affected by rolling back the policy.\n\nTuberville hopes his pressure campaign will force the Defense Department to reverse course, and many of his Republican detractors agree with that end goal. Ernst, an Iowa Republican, said she also wants to see the abortion travel policy changed or struck down, but she thinks anti-abortion groups should challenge the Pentagon's policy in court. \"We feel it's illegal,\" she said. \"They feel it's illegal. Then do something about it.\"\n\nAccording to his GOP critics, Tuberville's tactics target the wrong people, with officers awaiting confirmation growing frustrated and disillusioned as they watch politics interfere with military readiness. Tuberville should block a Biden administration political appointee, Sullivan argued, not service members who have no say in policy.\n\nErnst is hoping to find a procedural path out of the quagmire, but senators plan to push a rule change to make it easier to get around Tuberville's hold as soon as next week. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he is setting up consideration of a plan from Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Jack Reed that would combine many of the nominations into one vote.\n\n\"Patience is wearing thin with Sen. Tuberville on both sides of the aisle,\" Schumer said in a floor speech Wednesday, pointing to a health emergency that Marine Commandant Gen. Eric Smith-whose own appointment stalled for months during Tuberville's blockade- suffered over the weekend. His reported heart attack and hospitalization, Schumer suggested, may have been tied to the strain of his workload while waiting on the Senate to confirm his assistant: It \"just showed many people how dangerous what Tuberville is doing is,\" Schumer said. The Senate approved a nominee this week to assist Smith.\n\nBut tackling each military promotion individually-with each requiring multiple floor votes and days of processing time-isn't an efficient option for the chamber. Over the summer, the Congressional Research Service estimated it would take 89 days of eight-hour Senate sessions to individually approve the more than 300 nominations Tuberville has blocked since the start of the year.\n\nTo change the rules and consider hundreds of nominees at once, Democrats would need to hit the filibuster-proof 60-vote threshold. In practical terms, that means keeping their caucus unified and picking up nine Republican votes. But it's not clear if that'll be feasible. Several leading Republicans who spoke with The Dispatch on Thursday sounded firmly opposed to the idea. Sen. Chuck Grassley said he would oppose a rules change, because he fears a \"slippery slope\" to institutional chaos. The Senate GOP conference is set to discuss the matter at a lunch meeting next week.\n\nBut at least a couple of Republican senators appear open to it. Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, for example, expressed concern that Tuberville's tactics could theoretically be deployed by a Democratic senator to seek expanded abortion access under a future Republican administration. \"If this becomes the norm, that we hold up our military promotions, we basically break down our military and exact a huge cost on the men and women who protect us,\" Romney told reporters. \"This is the wrong vehicle to be using to change policy.\"\n\nTuberville's tactics are part of a larger shift toward spectacle and grievance politics, Romney argued.\n\n\"As an institution, we've lived by a series of values and procedures that have allowed us to operate in good faith,\" he added. \"And the new politics suggests that if you want to get seen, you break the norms. You break the rules, you break the precedent in such a way that people are alarmed and are drawn to your fight. It makes money, and it gives you a lot of political power. It just happens to break down the functioning of the Senate.\"\n\nAre the rules-such as not being able to address these military promotions efficiently without Tuberville's consent-unsustainable? \"I won't go that far, but it's under strain,\" Romney, who nonetheless remains optimistic about a breakthrough, told The Dispatch.\n\nTuberville's Republican critics may face backlash, however, if they join Democrats in rewriting Senate rules. In an email obtained by Politico 's Burgess Everett, Tuberville's communications director called for conservative groups to make it clear that those who support the resolution will be primaried by conservative challengers. \"They only need nine squishes,\" he said. \"And they will get there if we don't act.\" The aide said later that the email was intended for a few close friends and didn't represent Tuberville's views, and Sen. Steve Daines, who helms the Senate GOP's campaign arm, has reportedly suggested the staffer should face repercussions for the comment.\n\nThe episode highlights how inscrutable the Senate can be as an institution. Watching Republican senators list nominees one-by-one and Tuberville rise each time to object to them, C-SPAN viewers might have wondered: Why don't senators sneak a unanimous consent request onto the floor without alerting their colleagues first?\n\nToday, senators file their requests in advance in order to alert staff, so senators who oppose a given measure can be there on time to block it. While it makes sense for governing, this principle of collegiality can take senators to absurd places: In 2018, former Sen. Richard Burr made a request on the floor to advance one of his priorities. When he saw that the colleague he thought would be there to block his request hadn't shown up, he then reluctantly objected to his own request in the spirit of courtesy.\n\nAny attempt to sneak a request through the chamber might also spark fierce debate, if history is any guide. In 1913, the chamber spent two days debating the validity of a measure that passed by unanimous consent because the senator who opposed it-although being present in the chamber at the time-was momentarily distracted and didn't object to it soon enough.\n\nThere's been one recent mishap along these lines: Sen. Marco Rubio's daylight saving time legislation passed the Senate via unanimous consent last year-taking its ardent opponents and even some of its supporters by total surprise-because of a staffing mistake. The bill never passed the House.\n\nWhile Senate Democrats are ready to change the rules, they aren't ready to embrace that kind of scorched-earth approach. Informing opponents of upcoming floor requests keeps courtesy in the chamber, Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, said. \"If you started doing that, then everybody would do it,\" he told The Dispatch . \"It's one of the ways we keep collegiality and we don't become the House of Representatives.\"\n\nHaley Wilt is a former associate editor for The Dispatch.\n\nYour membership includes the ability to share articles\n                with friends.

      "text": "Military Confirmation Gridlock Continues in the Senate\n\nPlus: Another defense policy impasse in the House, and what's next in the House's Biden family investigation.\n\nSen. Tommy Tuberville for months has been blocking military promotions and confirmations to protest Pentagon abortion policies. Senate Democrats and the White House have decried Tuberville's tactics from the beginning, but now some of Tuberville's GOP colleagues seem conflicted too .\n\nTuberville may achieve one of his goals: a vote forcing lawmakers to go on the record about codifying the policy. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Wednesday that if Tuberville \"wants to have an affirmative vote, we would not object to it.\" It's unclear whether a floor vote would dislodge his hold if the Pentagon didn't reverse the policy.\n\n\"I'm getting to the point now where the next vote we have on these nominees is going to be after we vote on a bill that will codify what they've got,\" Tuberville told reporters Thursday. \"But we got to change the policy back first before we vote\" on the nominees.\n\nThe policy at the center of the debate is the Pentagon's October decision to give servicemembers paid leave and travel reimbursement to obtain abortions if they are stationed in a state that restricts abortion access.\n\nRepublicans argued the policy ran afoul of longstanding federal law prohibiting taxpayer dollars from paying for abortions. Enter Tuberville's blanket blockade in February, taking advantage of a procedure allowing any senator to place a hold on a unanimous consent vote, stopping Senate leaders from fast-tracking approval for large slates of legislation or executive branch nominees.\n\nAbout 260 Pentagon nominations and promotions have been in limbo since February, including the Marine Corps' commandant. The Pentagon estimated the hold could affect up to 650 nominations by the year's end.\n\nTuberville's hold does not prevent lawmakers from approving each nominee individually, but that would take much more time.\n\n\"The idea that we should go through regular order and process these nominees-if we did it 24/7, it would still take many months,\" Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii, told reporters Thursday. \"If we start processing these nominees as if they're a deputy secretary, this place will do only personnel, and we'll do it poorly for the rest of the existence of the Senate.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in May came out against the tactic, but he hasn't pressured Tuberville to change course and has deflected reporters' questions.\n\nNorth Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis tells The Dispatch of a trip to Lithuania in which he met a colonel who was up for a promotion to general but couldn't advance because of the hold. Another Army officer asked Tillis, a Republican, and the bipartisan group of lawmakers on the trip to \"help us overcome\" Tuberville's hold, Punchbowl News reported .\n\n\"No daylight between him and me on the policy that we oppose,\" he said referring to the abortion policy. \"But it's just an example of people that are being swept up into it that I don't think is just a good long term strategy.\" He doesn't believe the hold is harming national security at the moment, but it could if drawn out.\n\nThe Pentagon hasn't backed down. In May, a group of former defense secretaries sent a letter to the Senate warning that the hold harmed \"military readiness and risks damaging U.S. national security.\" Military brass has also spoken on the issue, including Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall. The White House press shop-and sometimes President Joe Biden himself-has taken to criticizing Tuberville nearly every day.\n\n\"Holy smokes, if you let him, you know, negotiate this you open Pandora's Box. Every social issue then gets dragged into the military,\" Sen. John Hickenlooper, a Colorado Democrat says.\n\nBut nearly all of Tuberville's GOP colleagues on Thursday defended his right to hold confirmations, as long-standing Senate tradition, and most were quick to say they agree with his underlying concerns about the policy.\n\n\"If they would just follow the law, none of this would be happening. I don't know why they set a policy that violates the law,\" Sen. Cynthia Lummis tells The Dispatch of the Pentagon's policy.\n\n\"The best approach is that the Department of Defense, the administration, and Sen. Tuberville could come to a mutually acceptable alternative to the current status quo,\" Sen. Mike Rounds of Indiana tells The Dispatch . \"It does take the administration to recognize that maybe not everybody believes as they do that everything they did was perfect in this particular situation. Because clearly a lot of us think they really overstepped.\"\n\nRepublicans in the House of Representatives have also taken aim at the Pentagon's policy: Last week the House passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), an $886 billion defense bill that included an amendment rescinding the abortion policy. That and other measures in the bill cost the Republican majority nearly all Democratic support.\n\nThe Senate's version of the NDAA is unlikely to include any of the hard-fought priorities conservatives won in the House, setting up what may be a tricky process when it comes to merging the two versions later in the year.\n\nSen. Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican, has offered an amendment that would rescind the policy, but it's unclear whether a vote to satisfy Tuberville would be for an amendment to the NDAA or a standalone measure.\n\nSeveral Democrats told The Dispatch that while they don't mind a vote on the issue, they remained skeptical it would be a solution. Several cast the stand-off as one Republicans needed to police on their own: \"This is a Republican problem that has to be sorted by Republicans,\" Schatz said. \"There's nothing we can do about it.\"\n\nThe Senate isn't the only chamber stymying the Department of Defense. A House Republican is holding up DOD budget moves because of an argument over where the U.S. Space Command will be located.\n\nThe Defense Department can shift, or \"reprogram,\" billions of funds internally to cover budget shortfalls in certain areas but only with approval from the chairmen and ranking members of three congressional committees if the amount exceeds $10 million. Defense officials are waiting on several requests , including moving $108 million to its missile warning and satellite tracking program.\n\nRep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee (HASC), is withholding his approval until the Air Force confirms whether it will move the U.S. Space Command to Redstone Arsenal Army Base in Rogers' home state of Alabama. The command headquarters are currently located at Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado, but the Trump administration announced in January 2021 it would move headquarters to Alabama. Space Command oversees joint forces from several military branches for space-related military operations.\n\nThe Biden administration has put the relocation on hold, though a Government Accountability Office review found there was no fault with the Trump administration's decision.\n\n\"All the Air Force has got to do is make an announcement,\" Rogers told Military.com . \"I don't care what the announcement is. Make an announcement. They've had 13 months since the inspector general finished reviewing it and said there was no political interference. Make an announcement.\"\n\nHe seemed to soften his approach this week-he approved several Pentagon budget reprogramming requests affecting troop pay after the Air Force suspended some bonuses. But he is still blocking other reprogramming requests, he told Defense News Wednesday, until the Air Force makes their decision.\n\nRogers' hold is reportedly preventing Air Force members and families from relocating to new duty stations and had delayed enlistment bonuses and a college loan repayment program-all of which could hurt recruiting and exacerbate personnel shortages.\n\nA group of Democratic lawmakers from Colorado slammed the hold as \"legislative hostage-taking.\" Members of the Centennial State's delegation have been lobbying to keep the base in their state, Military.com reported .\n\nThe Air Force has not publicly announced what is causing the delay. In March, Secretary Frank Kendall told lawmakers that the department was still in the process of reviewing the location and had not made a recommendation or a decision. Kendall listed \"operational capacity and mission performance\" as one of the hold-ups.\n\n\"We should be making the decision based on the merits of the location and not based on the politics of the members,\" Rep. Seth Moulton, a Massachusetts Democrat on HASC, tells The Dispatch .\n\nRepublicans on the committee blame the Pentagon.\n\n\"Relitigating this isn't good for the Space Force,\" Rep. Don Bacon, tells The Dispatch. \"I don't think it's wise to overturn decisions once formally made.\"\n\nIn their ongoing investigation of Hunter Biden and payments made to the Biden family, congressional Republicans may next look to call in the prosecutor leading the Justice Department's probe into the president's son.\n\nIRS Special Agents Gary Shapley and Joe Ziegler appeared before the House Oversight Committee Wednesday with the message that they believe Hunter Biden received special treatment from federal investigators probing his tax payments.\n\nBoth claimed prosecutors and investigators said Biden should have been charged with a felony. Last month federal prosecutors and Biden reached a deal for him to plead guilty to misdemeanor two tax crimes and admit to owning a gun illegally.\n\nIn a hearing that sometimes turned obscene, Democrats didn't question the witnesses' credibility but argued the U.S. attorney's decision on Biden's charges was an example of prosecutorial discretion and that differences between the IRS agents and their superiors could be chalked up to misunderstandings.\n\nOne of the points of disagreement was Shapley's claim that U.S. Attorney David Weiss said he could not file charges in jurisdictions other than in Delaware. Weiss has disputed that and other claims .\n\n\"We need to be talking to U.S. Attorney Weiss,\" Rep. Byron Donalds, a member of the committee, tells The Dispatch . \"Weiss and his deputy need to answer some serious questions.\"\n\nHe believes the findings are building a case for impeaching Attorney General Merrick Garland. \"What we've heard from Merrick Garland, which was short, does not line up with what the investigative team and IRS is saying,\" Donalds said. \"So somebody's lying.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley also released a copy of a tip to the FBI alleging a scheme to bribe President Biden. The unverified tip on an FD-1023 form alleges that while then-Vice President Joe Biden was carrying out the Obama administration's policies on Ukraine, Ukrainian business leaders thought having Hunter Biden on their board would inculcate it from a wider crackdown on corruption. The FBI informant who provided secondhand information for the tip claimed that Burisma CEO Mykola Zlochevsky thought sending millions to both the senior Biden and his son would also help his company. The CEO also claimed to have recordings and text messages to back up his claims.\n\nThe claims in the tip \"have reportedly been scrutinized by the Trump Justice Department, a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney, and a full impeachment trial of the former President that centered on these very issues, and over and over again, they have been found to lack credibility,\" White House spokesperson Ian Sams said.\n\nSenate Judiciary moves SCOTUS ethics bill forward-toward a dim future\n\nHouse Passes Bill Aiming to Ease Airline Delays, Pilot Shortages\n\nLatest proposal to prohibit member stock trading adds executive branch ban\n\nGOP bolsters Robert F.

      "text": "Giuliani to Senator: 'Try to Just Slow it Down'\n\nThe president's lawyer tries to block the count of the Electoral College votes.\n\nRudy Giuliani, a lawyer and top adviser to President Donald Trump, is calling Republican lawmakers urging them to delay the electoral vote count by at least one day to allow the president and his team to present more evidence of alleged election fraud. Giuliani was making calls this evening, as late as an hour before Congress reconvened, in a desperate attempt to block the final count of Electoral College votes.\n\nAt approximately 7 p.m., Giuliani called newly sworn-in Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville, a staunch Trump ally, imploring him to stall the process. \"I want to discuss with you how they're trying to rush this hearing and how we need you, our Republican friends, to try to just slow it down so we can get these legislatures to get more information to you,\" Giuliani said in a voicemail. \"And I know they're reconvening at 8 tonight, but it ... the only strategy we can follow is to object to numerous states and raise issues so that we get ourselves into tomorrow-ideally until the end of tomorrow. I know McConnell is doing everything he can to rush it, which is kind of a kick in the head because it's one thing to oppose us, it's another thing not to give us a fair opportunity to contest it.\"\n\nGiuliani tells Tuberville that McConnell wants to narrow the objections to just three states and explains that the Trump team wants to object to 10. \"So if you could object to every state and, along with a congressman, get a hearing for every state, I know we would delay you a lot, but it would give us the opportunity to get the legislators who are very, very close to pulling their vote, particularly after what McConnell did today.\"\n\nThe problem for Giuliani? He left his message on the voicemail of another senator, who shared it with The Dispatch .\n\nIt's not clear whether Giuliani-who opens the call by referring to himself as \"the president's lawyer\"-was directed to call Tuberville by President Trump. Requests for comment to Giuliani's cell phone and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows went unanswered. One longtime Trump adviser still talking to top White House officials says Trump is in constant communication with Giuliani. Asked if such a call is something Trump would know about, he said: \"Oh, yeah, 100 percent.\"\n\nGiuliani, speaking at the rally for Trump earlier today, urged Trump supporters to keep fighting, promising that more evidence would soon come to light. \"Over the next 10 days, we get to see the machines that are crooked, the ballots that are fraudulent and we're wrong, we will be made fools of. But if we're right, a lot of them will go to jail.\"\n\nHere is the complete audio. The transcript of Giuliani's voicemail follows below.\n\nSenator Tuberville? Or I should say Coach Tuberville. This is Rudy Giuliani, the president's lawyer. I'm calling you because I want to discuss with you how they're trying to rush this hearing and how we need you, our Republican friends, to try to just slow it down so we can get these legislatures to get more information to you. And I know they're reconvening at 8 tonight, but it ...  the only strategy we can follow is to object to numerous states and raise issues so that we get ourselves into tomorrow-ideally until the end of tomorrow.\n\nI know McConnell is doing everything he can to rush it, which is kind of a kick in the head because it's one thing to oppose us, it's another thing not to give us a fair opportunity to contest it. And he wants to try to get it down to only three states that we contest. But there are 10 states that we contest, not three. So if you could object to every state and, along with a congressman, get a hearing for every state, I know we would delay you a lot, but it would give us the opportunity to get the legislators who are very, very close to pulling their vote, particularly after what McConnell did today. It angered them, because they have written letters asking that you guys adjourn and send them back the questionable ones and they'll fix them up.\n\nSo, this phone number, I'm available on all night, and it would be an honor to talk to you.

      "text": "Alabama Senate Primary Splits the GOP in DC\n\nRep. Mo Brooks, Katie Britt, and Mike Durant are vying to replace Richard Shelby. A runoff is likely.\n\nLast spring, Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks was leading the pack in the Republican primary race to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Richard Shelby. Then, for him, came a series of unfortunate events.\n\nHis downward trajectory began in August, when a crowd of his supporters booed him for suggesting they ought to move past the 2020 presidential election. Soon his two biggest Republican primary rivals-former Shelby chief of staff Katie Britt and retired Army pilot Mike Durant- caught up to him in the polls and began out-fundraising him. Brooks' waning momentum then quickly became evident to former President Donald Trump, who in late March rescinded his endorsement.\n\nWhether or not these developments will seal Brooks' fate could become clear in just a few hours, when Alabama voters head to the polls and pick their Republican nominee for the state's open U.S. Senate seat. Brooks has regained some polling ground in recent days, but the race is still tight and likely headed to a June 21 runoff, as no candidate is likely to surpass the 50 percent threshold required to win Tuesday's primary. RealClearPolitics' polling average has Britt with a slight edge over Durant and Brooks, who are neck-and-neck in the race for the second runoff spot.\n\nHigh-profile Republican lawmakers and organizations look to be just as divided as the electorate. Brooks has the National Rifle Association, the Club for Growth, and GOP Sens. Rand Paul and Ted Cruz in his corner. But he faces stiff competition from Durant, a wealthy businessman and former prisoner of war, and Britt, an attorney and former CEO of the Business Council of Alabama who has secured fundraising support from GOP Sens. Shelby, Mike Crapo, Deb Fischer, Shelley Moore Capito, Jim Inhofe, and Joni Ernst.\n\nBritt and Durant have also benefited from the McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund's (SLF) $2 million contribution in early April to Alabama's Future, a Super PAC that has spent the campaign cycle bashing Brooks in television ads.\n\n\"I thought that was very wise,\" Shelby, Britt's former boss, said in an interview Thursday of the contribution.\n\nBut the move was met with criticism from some Brooks supporters like Ted Cruz, who stumped for Brooks in Alabama this week and who nonetheless insists that Republican leaders should avoid putting a finger on the scale in competitive primary contests. \"I always think it's a mistake when leadership gets involved in primaries, and historically, it's tended to backfire more often than not,\" Cruz said in an interview last week.\n\nIn 2017, McConnell endorsed vulnerable incumbent Luther Strange in a special election for Alabama's open U.S. Senate seat, and spearheaded SLF's multi-million dollar fundraising efforts to fend off two GOP primary challengers in particular: Mo Brooks and Roy Moore, the embattled former judge who was accused of sexual misconduct. Moore won the GOP nomination but lost in the general to Democrat Doug Jones.\n\nThe Senate Minority Leader's endorsement of Strange was not lost on Brooks, who in late March pulled a page out of his 2017 Senate campaign playbook and released a 90-second ad pledging to vote against McConnell as GOP leader if he is elected.\n\nHe also cited \"McConnell's ploys\" for Trump's decision to rescind his endorsement in late March, and has sought to portray SLF's involvement in the race as evidence that Britt is McConnell's handpicked candidate, even though SLF President Steven Law insists that the donation is purely an anti-Brooks effort and not an endorsement of any other candidate.\n\n\"Katie Britt is Mitch McConnell's candidate. He's supporting her and funding every lying ad against Mo Brooks,\" the representative's Senate campaign spokesman, Will Hampson, said in a statement. \"Like in 2017, McConnell is trying to buy a RINO a Senate seat in Alabama. He hates Trump and America First candidates like Mo. Britt is bought and paid for by the Swamp. This is why President Trump will never support Katie Britt-she's Mitch McConnell's candidate. Anyone who claims to be MAGA cannot support or vote for Britt. Period.\"\n\nIn a statement last week to Yellow Hammer News , the Britt campaign condemned Washington-based super PAC attack ads against her opponents. \"I believe that all of these D.C. super PACs should stay out of our state, whether it's SLF or Club for Growth (the original Never Trump Club for China) and the Lincoln Project liberals backing my opponents,\" Britt said. Her campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment from The Dispatch.\n\nThe Republican senators who do support Britt are keenly aware of her campaign's anti-establishment rhetoric. They dodge questions about Brooks' call for McConnell's ouster and generally avoid piling on criticism of her opponents.\n\n\"I'm not focused on Mo Brooks,\" Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska said in an interview. \"I think I was the first senator to come out-woman senator-to come out in support of her. I knew her when she worked for Shelby. She's fabulous and I hope she wins.\"\n\nErnst, who has also fundraised for Britt with her leadership PAC, also said as much. \"I can't speak to Mo Brooks' campaign strategy, but what I can say is Katie, Britt has really kept a very positive attitude through the entire campaign,\" Ernst said in an interview earlier this month. \"It's hard when you see people going negative and pointing the finger at others, that then turns voters off and Katie has refused to do that.\"\n\nSome Republicans are much more willing to badmouth Brooks in private. Aside from Trump and McConnell, Brooks has also provoked the ire of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who in the aftermath of the January 6 riot condemned the Alabama congressman for telling a crowd of \"Save America March\" rally attendees to \"fight like hell\" hours before some of them stormed the U.S. Capitol, and that \"today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.\"\n\nMcCarthy and his fellow House GOP leaders didn't take those comments lightly, at least in private. \"You think the president deserves to be impeached for his comments? That's almost something that goes further than what the president said,\" McCarthy said of Brooks' rhetoric during a private phone call with his House GOP leadership colleagues, the New York Times reported .\n\nAs of the Federal Election Commission's mid-April filing deadline, Durant is leading the money race, having raked in roughly $10 million in total and $3 million on hand. Britt is a close second, having raised $6.8 million during the same time period and ending it with $2.7 million on hand. Brooks falls much further behind, having pulled in just $2.8 million in total. As of mid-April, he had roughly $677,100 on hand.\n\nRepublicans will be watching tonight's election returns closely. That includes GOP Sen. Tommy Tuberville. He hasn't made an endorsement in the primary, although he has attended fundraisers for some candidates and confirmed in an interview with The Dispatch in January that he has met with all three frontrunners. \"As I told them, I said, 'Listen, none of y'all endorsed me,' so go after it, so there' no reason for me to get involved,\" Tuberville said in reference to his 2020 U.S. Senate run in Alabama. \"Let the best man win.\"\n\nAudrey is a former reporter for The Dispatch.\n\nYour membership includes the ability to share articles\n                with friends.

The senator told reporters that Kennedy told him he would support Trump's decisions on abortion,\n\nPublished: December 17, 2024 5:27pm\n\nRepublican Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville on Tuesday claimed that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., told him that he has reached an agreement with President-elect Donald Trump on the matter of abortion, which is to leave the subject to individual states.\n\nKennedy has previously expressed support for abortion rights, while Trump has predominantly been against the procedure. Trump has, however, outlined three exceptions for abortion bans: to protect the life of the mother, in cases of rape, and incest.\n\nTuberville, who is largely pro-life, met with Kennedy on Capitol Hill on Tuesday as the Senate considers his nomination for Health and Human Services secretary. The senator told reporters that Kennedy told him he would support Trump's decisions on abortion, per The Hill.\n\n\"I just asked him, 'In the past you've been pro-abortion,' and he said, well, it's basically, he and President Trump have sat down and talked about it, and both of them came to an agreement, 'Hey, Roe-Wade is gone, it's gone to the states, let the people vote on it,\" Tuberville said.\n\n\"And that's been [my view] all along,\"  he continued. \"I'm pro-life, but I am glad the American citizens have a chance to vote in their state, and he's the same way.\"\n\nThe senator claimed that the meeting with Kennedy went well, and that it was also \"fun\" talking to the nominee about Kennedy's family. He also said the pair discussed Alabama farmers who are concerned about food safety without wanting the government to go overboard.\n\n\"He understands our farmers are in trouble, and we want to make sure that we have farmers that can make a living, and we don't lose our family farms,\" Tuberville said.\n\nFederal assistance for farmers is one of the biggest hold-ups on Congress' Continuing Resolution. Both sides want to provide aid for farmers, but the scope and structure of it are still being debated.\n\nMisty Severi is an evening news reporter for Just The News.

But Republicans would have needed nine Democrats to overcome the filibuster based on the final vote.\n\nThe legislation also comes after a New York Times poll in January found that 79% of respondents believe transgender athletes should not be competing against biological female athletes, including some Democrats.\n\nTubervillle urged Democrats last week to join his effort, highlighting the bipartisan support he's seen among voters in the swing states of Arizona and Pennsylvania.\n\n\"Almost 70% of Arizonans don't believe men should compete in girls' and women's sports. In Pennsylvania, this number rises to nearly 75%. And in Michigan, nearly 78% of voters want men out of women's sports,\" Tuberville posted on X. \"I hope my Democrat Senate colleagues from these states will LISTEN to their constituents.\"\n\nThe appeal went to moderate Democrats in the swing states, including Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman, who has voted with Republicans in the past.\n\nMisty Severi is a news reporter for Just The News. You can follow her on X for more coverage."

Tommy Tuberville dramatically scaled back his blanket hold on hundreds of military appointments Tuesday after failing to force changes to a Pentagon policy paying for service members to cross state lines to undergo an abortion.\n\nFollowing threats from his GOP colleagues that they would quash his blockade, Tuberville (R-Ala.) announced he would lift his hold on almost all nominees except four-star generals and other officers, 11 of whom remain in limbo.\n\n\"We didn't get the win that we wanted,\" he told reporters. \"We've still got the bad policy. We tried to stand up for the taxpayers.\"\n\n\"I am not going to hold the promotions of these people any longer,\" the former college football coach added.\n\nHours later, the Senate approved 425 nominations that had been stalled since February.\n\nTuberville had stalled the promotions in a bid to reverse the Pentagon policy, which reimburses military members who travel to receive any kind of reproductive care, such as in-vitro fertilization.\n\nTraditionally, the Senate rapidly advances military nominees unanimously instead of formally voting on them one by one.\n\nHowever, as a member of the Armed Services Committee, Tuberville could hold up the appointments if he chose.\n\nTuberville's allies pointed out that the Senate could vote on each nomination through regular order, as is done with presidential picks for the federal bench and other executive branch departments.\n\nSign up to get the best stories straight to your inbox.\n\nPlease provide a valid email address.\n\nBy clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy .\n\nNever miss a story.\n\nHowever, opponents of the senator's actions pointed out the tedious and time-consuming nature of the process.\n\nIn late September, the White House estimated that it would take 700 hours - nearly a month of straight work - to confirm the 300-plus outstanding nominees at the time via regular order.\n\nAt times throughout the roughly 10-month blockade, the Senate took up key picks individually, approving nominees to become chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as well as heads of the Army, Navy and Air Force.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday evening, President Biden ripped Tuberville, saying the confirmations were \"long overdue, and should never have been held up in the first place.\"\n\n\"In the end, this was all pointless,\" Biden said. \"Senator Tuberville, and the Republicans who stood with him, needlessly hurt hundreds of servicemembers and military families and threatened our national security - all to push a partisan agenda. I hope no one forgets what he did.\"\n\nPentagon spokesman Patrick Ryder told reporters the Defense Department was \"encouraged\" by Tuberville's decision, but noted nominees whose confirmation is still pending included \"key senior leadership positions to include the vice chiefs of the various services, the commander of US Pacific Fleet, the commander of Pacific Air Forces, commander of Air Combat Command, as well as the commander of United States Northern Command Cyber Command and Space Command.\"\n\n\"We have a very important mission in terms of defending this nation and anytime you add a level of uncertainty into the chain of command, it creates an unnecessary friction,\" Ryder said. \"It has an impact on readiness ... when it's unclear whether or not your senior leaders are going to be in place at the time and place they're needed, that, of course, creates unnecessary friction and does have an impact on readiness.\"\n\nTuberville's concession came after Republican senators threatened to get onboard with a rules change pitched by Democrats.\n\nUnder the proposal, which would have required 60 votes to enact, the Senate would have been able to vote on most military nominees as a bloc even without unanimous support.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) gave Tuberville until the end of the year to give way or else the resolution would be taken up.\n\nRepublicans had been reluctant to go down that road, but enough of them indicated their patience had worn thin.\n\nEarly last month, several GOP senators - such as Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Joni Ernst of Iowa - condemned the blockade in a fiery late night exchange on the Senate floor.\n\nTuberville hinted last week on CNN that the days of his hold were numbered.\n\n\"We need to get them promoted,\" Tuberville said. \"I don't know what they're gonna do with the resolution, but we're going through all of the people that are up for promotion. We will promote people in the very near future.\""

Tommy Tuberville holds up nomination votes\n\nWASHINGTON - The Marine Corps was without a Senate-confirmed commandant for the first time in 164 years Monday as Sen. Tommy Tuberville continued his monthslong blockade on Pentagon appointments in protest of military abortion access policies.\n\nNow-former Commandant Gen. David H. Berger held an unusual \"relinquishment of command\" ceremony at Marine Barracks Washington, ending his term as the corps' top officer without formally handing the position over to a successor.\n\nTypically, that happens with a \"change of command\" ceremony.\n\nBut as Tuberville (R-Ala.) refuses to relent on his boycott, Berger's would-be successor, Gen. Eric M. Smith, could only take over as acting commandant.\n\n\"We'll get one thing out of the way very quickly. If you're saying, 'What am I supposed to call you?'\" Smith said during the ceremony. \"'ACTMC' [pronounced Act-Mac]. That is my title, and one that I'm proud of.\"\n\nTuberville has single-handedly prevented hundreds of Defense Department nominations from being approved by voice vote since March in protest of new Pentagon rules that reimburse and provide paid leave to service members who travel to receive an abortion or other reproductive care, such as in vitro fertilization.\n\nThe policy was put in place after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022 .\n\nFormer and current Pentagon leaders had held out hope that Tuberville would relent at least for the confirmations of senior leaders on national security grounds, but he has refused to do so, even after Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told reporters he does not support the boycott.\n\nMonday's ceremony came just a day before the Senate takes up the next - and arguably most important - military leader confirmation hearing: that of Air Force Gen. CQ Brown, whom President Biden tapped to become the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .\n\nTuberville is again expected to block Brown's confirmation, which would leave the nation without a confirmed top officer in the military when the current chairman, Army Gen. Mark Milley, retires later this year.\n\nAfter Biden announced Brown's nomination, a bipartisan group of seven former US defense secretaries wrote Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and McConnell, urging them to \"lift the blanket hold and promptly vot[e] to confirm these uniformed nominees.\"\n\nThe signatories - William Perry, William Cohen, Robert Gates, Leon Panetta, Chuck Hagel, Jim Mattis and Mark Esper - said holding up confirmation votes \"at a time of enormous geopolitical uncertainty sends the wrong message to our adversaries and could weaken our deterrence.\"\n\nTuberville and a handful of other Republicans insist Schumer could schedule additional procedural votes to get around the blockade or hold votes to confirm individual nominees such as Brown.\n\nMembers of Senate leadership and their allies reject that idea, saying the procedural votes would be unnecessarily time-consuming and holding votes for key nominees only would validate the Alabaman's approach.\n\nDuring the Monday ceremony, current Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Senate confirmations of military leaders are \"crucial for our military readiness,\" adding that service members and their families \"shouldn't be weighed down with any extra uncertainty.\"\n\n\"Smooth and timely transitions of confirmed leadership are central to the defense of the United States and to the full strength of the most powerful fighting force in history,\" Austin said. \"Stable and orderly leadership transitions are also vital to maintaining our unmatched network of allies and partners.\"\n\nAustin also chided Tuberville's protest as an active choice to fail the armed services, though he did not mention the senator by name.\n\n\"We have a sacred duty to do right by those who volunteer to wear the cloth of our nation, and I remain confident that all Americans can come together to agree on that basic obligation to those who keep us safe,\" Austin said.\n\n\"I am also confident that the United States Senate will meet its responsibilities and I look forward to welcoming an outstanding new commandant for our Marine Corps and to adding many other distinguished senior leaders across the joint force,\" he added.\n\nAdvertisement"

Tommy Tuberville expressed skepticism over the impeachment inquiry against President Biden , though he said he would like to know the \"truth\" about Biden's financial dealings and urged the House GOP to not \"waste time.\"\n\n\"I'm not for impeachment unless it is ironclad,\" Tuberville (R-Ala.) told NBC's \"Meet the Press NOW\" Tuesday.\n\n\"As I said about President [Donald] Trump, if you're gonna come after a former president or president, let's not waste time. Let's know the truth. Let's be able to bring it out. Let the American people know.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) announced that he ordered an impeachment inquiry into the president over potential links to his family's business dealings.\n\nBiden and the White House vehemently insist that he was not involved in those overseas machinations.\n\nMcCarthy initially said he wouldn't bring forward a probe unless he had a formal House vote, but reversed himself, citing precedent from former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).\n\n\"You don't bring a vote to the floor unless you are pretty sure that you can get the amount of votes that you need,\" Tuberville argued.\n\n\"I know that wouldn't make it to anywhere over here in the Senate. That probably wouldn't even - wouldn't even let it make it to the floor. But again, this is all up to the House. We got enough problems going on right now.\"\n\nImpeachment starts in the House and ends with a trial in the Senate. In this case, the House is holding an impeachment inquiry - a fact-gathering operation - and not formally impeaching Biden yet.\n\nA handful of moderate Republicans in the lower chamber were squeamish about backing the inquiry, and that sentiment is very common in the upper chamber as well.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) demurred on the matter Tuesday.\n\n\"I don't have any advice to give to the House. They've got a totally different set of challenges,\" he said . \"So I think the best advice for the Senate is to do our job and we'll see how this plays out.\"\n\nTuberville has been in the hot seat since February over his protracted hold on military promotions, which has stymied the advancement of nearly 300 service leaders.\n\nThe Alabama senator's blockade comes in protest of a Pentagon policy of footing the bill for service members to travel to obtain an abortion.\n\nHe has faced bipartisan backlash over the gambit. At the end of the month, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley is set to vacate his post, further elevating the stakes of the holdup.\n\nBiden has nominated Air Force chief of staff Gen. Charles Q. Brown to fill the role. Should he be confirmed, Brown would be the second black man in the post, following the late Gen. Colin Powell.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Pentagon takes dig at Sen. Tommy Tuberville for holding up over 250 military promotions - including next Marine commandant\n\nWASHINGTON - The Pentagon appears to be trading in its aggression for passive-aggression, at least in domestic politics.\n\nSharp-eyed observers noticed Thursday that the Joint Chiefs of Staff hallway at DoD headquarters included an empty portrait frame reserved for the commandant of the Marine Corps.\n\nStaff removed a photo of now-former Commandant Gen. David H. Berger after his official retirement on Monday.\n\nOn the commandant's official Twitter page, the Marine Corps added a note that the position is \"currently vacant\" in the description, right next to the standard \"likes, follows, retweets, or links do not constitute endorsement.\"\n\nThe actions by the Defense Department amount to a none-too-subtle protest of Sen. Tommy Tuberville's months-long block on rapid military confirmations - which Pentagon officials say is leaving the nation's fighting force in a dangerous predicament.\n\nAs of Thursday, Tuberville is holding up roughly 260 nominations of military personnel up for promotion - all over a Defense Department policy that pays for travel when a service member or their dependent needs to go out of state to get any kind of reproductive care, such as abortion or in-vitro fertilization.\n\nThe policy, meant to ease burdens on those in the military community who are stationed in states where abortion was banned or restricted after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, was issued by the Defense Department and is not the result of congressional action.\n\nTuberville (R-Ala.) has protested the policy since March, and the backlog he's created would take roughly 27 days to clear if the Senate worked day and night on confirmations - and 84 days if the Senate spent eight hours a day doing so, according to Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Jack Reed (D-RI)\n\nPresident Biden called Tuberville's protest \"ridiculous\" on Thursday, adding that the delay presents a serious risk to national security.\n\n\"I'd be willing to talk if I thought there's any possibility of him changing his ridiculous position. He's jeopardizing US security with what he's doing,\" Biden said during a news conference in Helsinki, Finland. \"I expect the Republican Party to stand up - stand up and do something about it. It's in their power to do that.\"\n\nMany Republicans have indeed condemned Tuberville's actions, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), but the former college football coach has held firm so far.\n\nOn Thursday, both Tuberville's office and the Pentagon confirmed the senator had spoken with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin about the hold, with the two men agreeing to speak next week.\n\nThe Pentagon's public moves come after Berger held an unusual \"relinquishment of command\" ceremony at Marine Barracks Washington, ending his term as the corps' top officer without formally handing the position over to a successor.\n\nBut while Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps Eric Smith assumed Berger's duties with the turnover, he cannot formally take over the role without the Senate confirming his nomination.\n\n\"We'll get one thing out of the way very quickly. If you're saying, 'What am I supposed to call you?'\" Smith said during the ceremony. \"'ACTMC' [pronounced Act-Mac] - that is my title, and one that I'm proud of.\"\n\nWithout the confirmation, Smith is left effectively leading the nation's fierce, amphibious force without receiving benefits like personal security or living space at the commandant's official home.\n\nHe also is blocked from carrying out official - and critical - duties, such as issuing a new strategic direction for the Corps.\n\n\"I can't live in the house, can't use a security detail. I cannot write a commandant's planning guidance because I am not the commandant,\" Smith told reporters on June 29. \"That 39th commandant is to be determined by the Senate, whoever that may be.\"\n\nBut it's not just top brass that are affected; included in the 260 nominees are lower-ranking officers who are putting their lives on hold before they can assume promotions.\n\nThose troops are blocked from promotion-related raises and moves, placing their families in limbo until a resolution is found, Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh told reporters on Tuesday.\n\n\"It's not just our general and flag officers that are being impacted in our force, it is their families as well,\" she said. \"I've heard cases of two students who dis-enrolled from their current school because they were supposed to move with their family for a change-of-station move, but now they can't enroll in a new school because they don't know when they'll be able to relocate.\"\n\n\"I've heard another story of a teacher who was a teacher at the Fairfax County Public Schools in Virginia,\" she added, \"and she recently ended her contract with her previous employer but has been unable to start a new job at another school because she doesn't know when her spouse will be relocated.\"\n\nAdvertisement"

Last year, the Alabama senator mounted a blanket hold on efforts to fast-track military promotions and nominations while protesting a Pentagon abortion policy.\n\nThe majority leader chafed with Tuberville over that blockade, as did some of his fellow Republicans as well.

      "text": "Key Dems urge McConnell to rachet up pressure on Tuberville to end hold on military promotions\n\nWASHINGTON - A key group of Senate Democrats urged GOP leader Mitch McConnell on Monday to \"exercise leadership\" and get Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville to end his monthslong hold on military confirmations.\n\n\"As the leader of the Republican Conference, we count on you to hold your colleagues accountable when they recklessly cross boundaries and upend senatorial order,\" eight Dem members of the Senate Armed Forces Committee wrote to the Senate Minority Leader.\n\n\"Sen. Tuberville's continuation of this stalemate is reckless, dangerous and must end,\" they added.\n\nSince February, Tuberville (R-Ala.), a member of the Armed Forces panel, has refused to help confirm the nominations of more than 280 military officers to leadership positions in protest of the Pentagon's policies allowing leave and paid travel for women to seek reproductive care such as in-vitro fertilization and abortion.\n\nMilitary confirmations are routinely approved as a group through unanimous consent by the SASC.\n\nWithout unanimous consent, each nominee must then be considered separately by the Senate, which is an extremely drawn-out, time-consuming process - especially when it comes to hundreds of nominations.\n\nThere are 26 total members on SASC: 14 Democrats and 12 Republicans.\n\nTuberville is the sole member to refuse to approve the nominations.\n\nMcConnell has spoken out against Tuberville's balking, but the SASC Democrats urged him \"to take stronger action\" to influence the freshman senator and former Auburn University football coach to end his protest .\n\n\"It falls to you to act now, for the safety and security of our nation,\" the group wrote McConnell. \"We urge you to exercise your leadership and prevail on Senator Tuberville to end his reckless hold.\"\n\nSenior US defense officials, including Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, have said the hold-up endangers national security, since officials have left empty some of the most vital military leadership positions.\n\nFor example, the Marine Corps currently has no confirmed top leader after the retirement of commandant Gen. David Berger earlier this month.\n\nThe SASC Democrats - Sens. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Tim Kaine of Virginia, Mark Kelly of Arizona, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Angus King of Maine, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Jacky Rosen of Nevada - chided Tuberville for holding the confirmation process hostage instead of using his congressional powers to write a bill to change the Pentagon policy.\n\nThe policy, enacted by Austin after the Supreme Court ended the federal right to abortion when it reversed \"Roe v. Wade\" last summer, was not put into place by law and could be nixed by Congress if enough lawmakers were to agree.\n\n\"Although there are numerous ways to legislatively change this policy, Sen. Tuberville has failed to convince a majority of the Senate to agree with his position,\" the SASC Democrats wrote. \"He continues to try to force his personal beliefs on the women and men who volunteer to serve our country, creating unnecessary havoc and punishing service members for a policy they had no part in writing.\"\n\nThe dispute comes as the military also faces the retirement of Chief of the Joint Staff Army Gen. Mark Milley next month.\n\nShould Tuberville fail to act to help confirm nominee Air Force Gen. Charles Q.

Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) was forced to reverse course Tuesday after suggesting during a CNN interview Monday night that describing white nationalists as racists was up for debate .\n\n\"My opinion of a white nationalist, if somebody wants to call them a white nationalist, to me, is an American,\" the former college football coach told CNN's Kaitlin Collins.\n\n\"It's an American. Now, if that white nationalist is a racist, I'm totally against anything that they want to do because I am 110% against racism.\"\n\nCollins, an Alabama native, pressed Tuberville repeatedly on his comments, at one point stating that \"a white nationalist is racist.\"\n\n\"Well, that's your opinion,\" Tuberville shot back.\n\nThe jaw-dropping exchange came as Tuberville was already under fire for single-handedly blocking hundreds of nominations for Defense Department positions over the military's abortion-access policies implemented after the overturn of Roe v. Wade.\n\nTuberville later clarified that if \"people think that a white nationalist is a racist,\" he agrees that particular individual should not serve in the military.\n\nIn May, the Alabama Republican stepped into controversy by criticizing efforts to root out white supremacists in the military.\n\nAt the time, the 68-year-old posited that \"the Democrats characterize all MAGA Republicans in the military as white nationalists\" and also contended that white nationalists are \"Americans.\"\n\nTuberville was peppered with questions about the interview by the Capitol Hill press corps Tuesday and repeatedly tried to move beyond his comments from the previous night.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Tuberville relented, telling reporters that \"white nationalists are racists.\"\n\nLawmakers from both sides of the aisle blistered his remarks.\n\n\"White supremacy is simply unacceptable in the military and in our whole country,\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told reporters.\n\n\"It's hard to believe that the senator from Alabama has to be corrected again. The senator from Alabama is wrong, wrong, wrong. The definition of white nationalism is not a matter of opinion,\" Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said on the chamber floor.\n\n\"For a member of the United States Senate to speculate about what white nationalism means, as if it's some benign little thought experiment, is deeply and terribly disturbing,\" he added.\n\n\"White supremacy and racism have absolutely no place in our country. Period. The end,\" Tuberville's fellow Alabaman, Sen. Katie Britt told reporters.\n\n\"White nationalism is racism, by definition. It's not a matter of opinion. For the senator to play games with this is dangerous stuff. He should apologize and change course,\" said Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.).\n\nTuberville's hold on Pentagon nominations has left the Marine Corps without a Senate-confirmed commandant for the first time in 164 years after Gen. David H. Berger ended his tenure as the service's top officer Monday.\n\nEven some Republicans such as McConnell have voiced apprehension about their colleague's blockade. But so far, Tuberville has held firm.\n\nA rep for Tuberville did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Sen. Tommy Tuberville calls effort to rid military of white nationalists an attempt to go after 'MAGA Republicans'\n\nRepublican Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville on Thursday tried to clarify what he meant when he told a reporter that he calls white nationalists \"Americans,\" arguing that liberals consider supporters of former President Donald Trump to be white nationalists.\n\nTuberville raised eyebrows on Wednesday when he responded to WBHM reporter Richard Banks' question about whether the Biden administration \"should allow white nationalists in the military\" by saying, \"Well, they call them that. I call them Americans.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the Alabama Republican explained that since his first day in the Senate, he has observed Democrats portraying all Trump supporters as white nationalists .\n\n\"The Democrats characterize all MAGA Republicans in the military as white nationalists. Wrong, OK?\" Tuberville told reporters Thursday. \"We can't get politics in the military. This has nothing to do with extremists.\"\n\nHe added, \"My first day here was Jan. 6, [2021.] I had several senators stand up on the Senate floor saying to me, 'We got too many white nationalists around here.' What the heck is that? I mean, we all got different beliefs, you know. I'm a church of Christ. We've got Catholics, we've got different people. And we all have to make one military. We can't start distinguishing different types of people.\"\n\nWhen pressed by NBC News reporter Julie Tsirkin on whether he believes white nationalists should serve in the armed forces, Tuberville demanded that she define the term.\n\n\"What is a white nationalist?\" he asked.\n\nWhen she responded that a white nationalist \"is someone who propagates Naziism. Someone who doesn't believe Black and Brown people are equal to White people,\" Tuberville disagreed.\n\n\"Well I don't look at it like that,\" he said. \"I look at a white nationalist as a Trump Republican. That's what we're called all the time, a MAGA person.\"\n\nLater arguing that \"we should not be characterizing Trump supporters as white nationalists.\"\n\nTuberville accused Democrats of \"politicizing the military\" through their efforts to root out white nationalists in the armed forces, and argued that they should focus on \"building the military.\"\n\n\"Look at our recruiting. We're getting hammered, 15,000 down last year in Army ... something's going wrong in our military,\" he said.\n\nA Pentagon report on extremist activity in the military released in December of 2021 found that about 100 active duty and reserve service members participated in prohibited extremist activity that year - up from the \"low-double digits\" of previous years.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Tommy Tuberville weighs 2026 run for Alabama governor\n\nSen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) is seriously considering a run for Alabama governor in 2026, telling reporters he is \"50/50\" on a second term in the Senate .\n\nTuberville, first elected to the chamber in 2020, has been discussing his political future with Senate colleagues, he told the Washington Examiner on Tuesday, including members of GOP leadership and Republicans who once served as governor.\n\n\"You got to talk to people who have been there, done that,\" he said.\n\nTuberville plans to make his decision in the spring as the primary field in Alabama begins to take shape. Possible GOP contenders including Will Ainsworth, the state's lieutenant governor, and John Merrill, the former secretary of state, have said they will decide in the same time frame .\n\n\"I'm not done up here yet. I'm still thinking hard about this,\" said Tuberville, suggesting what can be accomplished with Republicans in control of Washington is weighing on his decision.\n\nRepublican leadership held a floor vote this week on his bill preventing transgender athletes from competing in women's sports, but the legislation failed 45-51 without Democratic support.\n\n\"We've got the majority now, and I'd hate to really leave it, but at the end of the day, you gotta think about what you're gonna do,\" he added.\n\nTuberville would have greater latitude as the chief executive of Alabama. Two years ago, he mounted an unsuccessful blockade of military nominees in protest of the Pentagon's abortion travel policy.\n\nHe ultimately dropped the blockade after 10 months and withering pressure from both parties.\n\nAt age 70, Tuberville may also be weighing how far he can get in a chamber that is based on seniority.\n\n\"Well, if you're the CEO of a state, you can help more in a certain amount of time,\" he said. \"I'm not going to be up here forever, even if I do stay.\"\n\n\"I mean, I want to play golf and go fishing and hunting and all those things,\" Tuberville added.\n\nTuberville's retirement from the Senate would scramble the political establishment in Alabama, where Gov. Kay Ivey (R-AL) is term-limited.\n\nThe state is reliably red, meaning his seat is likely to remain in Republican hands. He defeated Sen. Doug Jones, the last Democrat to hold the office, by 20 points in 2020.\n\nIt could, however, funnel some of the Republicans considering a run for governor into the Senate race.\n\nREPUBLICANS RESIST JOSH SHAPIRO'S 'GIMMICKY' MARIJUANA BUDGET PUSH\n\nTuberville has not yet spoken with President Donald Trump about a gubernatorial run but said he has received encouragement in his home state.\n\n\"It's encouraging that I'd have a good opportunity to win, but I also can win this one, this seat,\" he said. \"I've worked hard to get this seat so it'd be hard to, you know, give it up.\""

      "text": "Why Tommy Tuberville won't back down on stalling 250 military nominees in the Senate\n\nT he Department of Defense released a series of new policies in February that allow for time off and travel expenses for what the Pentagon classes \"reproductive healthcare,\" including abortion , for troops and their dependents in states where it is not available.\n\nThe new policies were designed in part to improve troops' access to abortion after the Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization last year, which returned the issue of abortion to states, creating a patchwork of laws across the country.\n\nSPACE RACE: THE LATEST INNOVATIONS US AGENCIES HAVE FOR EXPLORING SPACE\n\nIn an effort to pressure the Pentagon to abandon these new accommodations, one Republican senator has single-handedly held up roughly 250 promotions for all civilian, flag, and general officer nominations, as well as high-level promotions within the Pentagon.\n\nThis has set up the first major clash this Congress over abortion access.\n\nSen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) is utilizing his senatorial powers to delay promotions that need Senate confirmation and are typically approved swiftly with no controversy. The push by the Alabama senator, whose home state has six military installations with laws on the books banning abortion even in cases of rape or incest, is now dragging into its fourth month.\n\nThe college football coach turned senator believes the policy is a violation of federal law that limits federal funding of abortions to cases of rape, incest, or threats to the life of the mother. He maintains his objections also have to do with forcing taxpayers to \"fund abortions,\" and that the Pentagon policy was the equivalent of the department bypassing Congress and doing its own legislating.\n\n\"It's an illegal policy. They changed it, they can't do it, so let's go back to the original policy,\" Tuberville said on Thursday, speaking to the Washington Examiner. \"If they want to change it, let's change it here in Congress, like we are supposed to.\"\n\n\"For y'all's sake, the people of this country, we can't have them legislating from the Pentagon, making laws,\" he added.\n\nThe backlog of Pentagon nominees, which could grow to as large as 650 by the end of the year, is typically approved without objection, usually in batches. Tuberville lacks the power to block the promotions entirely - Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) can still put them up for a vote - but the hold basically forces him to do so one by one, eating up valuable floor time.\n\nSchumer has refused to take that step, believing it would signal to other senators that they can use the holds as leverage. That has left the Senate at a standstill over the promotions, with no end in sight.\n\nPentagon officials have warned it's having an effect on national security and military readiness. The White House this month also condemned the senator's strategy.\n\n\"What the senator is doing by holding these nominations, it's a threat to our national security. Period. That's what he's doing,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby this month also called on Senate Republicans to help find a path forward.\n\n\"We certainly urge and encourage other members of the Senate on the Republican side to put enough pressure on Senator Tuberville to get him to lift his hold,\" Kirby said during an interview on CNN. \"I'm grateful for the work other Republican senators have done to try to find a way through this.\"\n\nThe Alabama senator said since his hold has been in place, he has not had any conversations with Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI), the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Schumer, or the White House. He also said Thursday that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has not discussed the hold with him either, despite telling reporters last month that he does not support it.\n\nBehind the scenes, some of Tuberville's colleagues have tried to talk with him about alternatives, which could suggest Republican leadership is growing weary of the stalemate. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA), the No. 4 Republican in the Senate, introduced a bill in March that would reverse the policy and floated to Tuberville a committee vote on that measure as part of the National Defense Authorization Act. In exchange, Tuberville would drop his hold, but he hasn't been satisfied with that offer.\n\n\"Schumer is not going to bring it to the floor. So, I'm not going to drop holds, knowing it's not even going to make it out of this committee,\" Tuberville said.\n\nSen. John Cornyn (R-TX) , who formerly served as McConnell's No. 2, said he continues to have conversations with Tuberville.\n\n\"I'm talking to a number of colleagues to figure out how to make the point that Senator Tuberville wants to make, which I agree with, but find a way to allow Congress to decide the issue rather than just the Department of Defense,\" Cornyn said speaking with the Washington Examiner on Thursday.\n\n\"I think Senator Schumer has the ability to move these nominations. He just needs to file for cloture, and you know he could do maybe 10 a week if he decided that this was a priority, but he likes politics,\" Cornyn added.\n\nOther Republican members of the Senate Armed Services Committee also are placing the blame squarely on Schumer.\n\n\"There is a way forward, and it's for leader Schumer to put these nominees on the floor. Schumer has had three months to put them on the floor and take votes,\" said Sen. Deb Fischer (R-NE), a member of the panel. \"He's the one I would say that is holding up the ship.\"\n\nLast week, Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD) came to the Senate floor to ask for unanimous consent to confirm the Naval Academy superintendent nominee, but Tuberville blocked the nomination for a ninth time.\n\n\"This is the ninth time that I've come to the floor to keep my word,\" Tuberville said in response on the floor of the Senate. \"Since the last time we did this, nothing has changed. And so, my hold will remain in place.\""

Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) said there is \"no doubt\" he will not support any senator seeking to replace Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) who opposes former President Donald Trump , stressing the need for unity within the Republican Party.\n\nMcConnell announced his retirement ahead of the 2024 election cycle, in which Tuberville said the Republican Party's chances of retaking the Senate are \"looking good in a lot of areas.\" When asked about who he would like to see take on McConnell's position in 2025, he opted to keep his opinion to himself while previewing a litmus test for anyone vying for McConnell's role.\n\n\"Well, there's no doubt I'm not going to vote for anybody that's not on board with President Trump,\" Tuberville said on Fox News's Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo . \"Been there, done that, seen what's happened. We have to have strong leadership that believes in the American people, believes in our Constitution, and gets away from this deep state, emotional bureaucracy that we have in Washington, D.C. I'm looking forward to being in the majority. I've been in four years now, and I've not been in the majority at all. We've been kicked in the teeth by Sen. Schumer and the Democrats.

John Thune (R-SD) and John Cornyn (R-TX). However, he has told both he is not making a decision until after the election, citing how potential Republican newcomers could make \"a huge difference\" in the party's Senate leadership.\n\nTuberville was also asked about a possible Republican sweep in the 2024 election cycle, keeping control of the House of Representatives while retaking the White House and the Senate. While he acknowledged he does not know as much about the House as he does about the Senate, he thinks the party has \"a great chance\" at keeping control of the House while getting anywhere between 51 and 54 Senate seats next month.\n\nThe Alabama senator specifically called out Republican Senate candidate Dave McCormick's campaign in Pennsylvania, saying McCormick has been running \"a very good race.\" Tuberville also gave a shoutout to Republican Senate candidates Eric Hovde and Bernie Moreno in Wisconsin and Ohio, respectively.\n\nAhead of the election next month, Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) noted Trump has \"astonishing\" support against Vice President Kamala Harris's presidential bid. He noted how billionaire Elon Musk has been actively campaigning for Trump in Pennsylvania, suggesting that \"something very special exists there.\"\n\nTo reach out to more voters, Trump appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience to discuss a myriad of topics, including extraterrestrial life and reflecting on his biggest mistake in his presidency. Trump's appearance has quickly become one of the most popular episodes of the podcast, which itself is Spotify's most popular podcast in the United States."

      "text": "Tuberville blocks Pentagon nominee over role in Lloyd Austin's two-week absence\n\nSen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) blocked the promotion of an Army general over the role he allegedly played in keeping Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin 's hospitalization under wraps months ago.\n\nLt. Gen. Ronald P. Clark is Austin's senior military assistant who is in the running to become the four-star commander of the U.S. Army forces in the Pacific. His promotion is now stalled in the Senate after Tuberville blocked his nomination, according to a report from the Washington Post on Monday.\n\n\"Sen. Tuberville has concerns about Lt. Gen. Clark's actions during Secretary Austin's hospitalization,\" Tuberville's spokeswoman, Mallory Jaspers explained in comments to the outlet.\n\n\"Lt. Gen. Clark knew that Sec. Austin was incapacitated and did not tell the Commander in Chief. As a senior commissioned officer, Lt. Gen. Clark's oath requires him to notify POTUS when the chain of command is compromised,\" Jaspers continued.\n\nClark was one of the senior members of Austin's inner circle who became embroiled in controversy after the defense secretary was hospitalized for an operation last December.\n\nAlthough Austin underwent surgery to treat prostate cancer on Dec. 22, the public wasn't informed about the top defense official's operation until two weeks later. Clark and other top Department of Defense officials were kept in the dark about Austin's hospitalization for 11 days, even as the country's defense chief developed complications and was sent to intensive care. Austin's senior aides waited for days after learning of their boss's healthcare debacle before disclosing the affair to President Joe Biden and top White House officials on Jan. 4.\n\nAustin's secrecy sparked widespread outcry from Washington, with Biden saying his defense secretary had exhibited a lapse in judgment by not being transparent about his health prognosis and extended hospital stay.\n\nThe defense chief later apologized for his actions, telling reporters, \"I want to be crystal clear: We did not handle this right.\"\n\n\"I should have told the president about my cancer diagnosis. I should have also told my team and the American public, and I take full responsibility,\" Austin said on Feb. 1.\n\nBefore clinching his senate seat in 2021, Tuberville was the head football coach at Auburn University from 1999 to 2008. His move to stall Clark's promotion in the Senate comes after he attracted Austin's ire for similarly conducting a monthslong blockade on military confirmations over the DOD's abortion policy.\n\nThe Alabama Republican prevented the upper chamber from approving military promotions quickly en masse during the bulk of 2023. His action stemmed from concerns that the Pentagon was using taxpayer dollars to cover travel expenses for servicemembers traveling to get an abortion.\n\nTuberville claimed that a policy Austin unveiled in 2022 expanded \"taxpayer-subsided abortion in the military beyond what is currently allowed under federal law.\" Though the Alabama lawmaker allowed for voting on military nominees one by one, Austin alleged his actions \"would set a perilous precedent for our military, our security, and our country.\""

      "text": "Republicans betraying Tommy Tuberville's lonely stand expose DC's lazy corruption\n\nRepublican p oliticians like to pretend they care a whole lot about the politicization of the Pentagon , taxpayer dollars paying for abortion, and fighting the White House 's agenda. When fighting these battles bothers the Pentagon too much, they'll turn on the ones doing the fighting.\n\nThis is the case for Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) , who has been battling the Pentagon's illegal abortion policies for over a year, and for his troubles faced hours of blistering attacks from his own Republican colleagues Wednesday night. Next week, those same Republicans plan to alter Senate rules to derail his brave fight against a politicized Pentagon.\n\nTHE KIDS ARE NOT ALL RIGHT\n\nThe battle began after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade , restricting abortion in states that voted to do so. In response, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin announced his department would pay for travel and hotels, etc., for any service members seeking an abortion. By paying for everything but the procedure itself, Austin hoped to skirt a law banning taxpayer dollars from being spent on abortion. Alabama's freshman senator believed this too cute by half and announced he would block unanimous consent votes for any military general or flag officer promotions until the Pentagon relented.\n\nTuberville might not have realized this at the time, but he had picked a lonely battle. While his colleagues all pay lip service to pro-life causes, Washington veterans know the Pentagon (and whatever it wants) is sacrosanct among Washington Republicans. As conflicts around the world intensified and the list of blocked promotions grew, so did the angst of his fellow members. Their vitriol finally spilled into the open when Sens. Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Todd Young (R-IN), and Mitt Romney (R-UT) tore into Tuberville for hours, insulting his integrity and accusing him of betraying his country to the Chinese and Russians.\n\nThe Pentagon doesn't seem to actually share these fears (though they profess to). If the Pentagon honestly believed Tuberville's block was incapacitating American defense, they would end the illegal use of taxpayer dollars for abortion. Austin has calculated military readiness is less important than the administration's pro-abortion political agenda. He might even actually believe this is the case, but it's notable the military has declined to produce any data over the past year and a half supporting its claims on abortion's necessity for military readiness.\n\nIt's possible Tuberville's Republican antagonists don't even believe Tuberville is putting the country at risk - at least enough to do the work. One senator cannot truly hold up 400 promotions; he can simply object to expediting their nominations, forcing Democrats to bring the issue to the floor and vote on it. They don't want to do this. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's (D-NY) Senate rarely holds votes on Mondays, works Tuesdays and Wednesdays, then takes off Thursday afternoon. That's little more than a two-day workweek. Voting through these nominees takes about two hours, but neither Republicans nor Democrats want to do all that, so instead they attack the man making them work (or forcing the Pentagon to relent).\n\nThis gets to a more central problem. Republican politicians love to make excuses and tell their voters they can't do anything without the majority, or without a bigger majority, or sometimes even with a big majority (if it's an election year, as it so often is). More than anything, Tuberville's fight blows a hole in that useful myth, illustrating the power a single senator has to make an impact when they truly want to. He's not the first to do so; former Sens. Jim DeMint and Jesse Helms were notoriously effective at getting their way, no matter what Washington, D.C., wanted. Few politicians possess the bravery to man those lonely posts, however. It is an unpopular thing in Washington.\n\nAnd you make powerful enemies when you take a stand. There's no glory in this fight, on this earth at least. Instead, men like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) will send five senators (who aren't up for reelection next year) to publicly attack you.\n\nSometimes, even your allies will betray you. One of the five pro-life groups Tuberville's staff were working with, for example, leaked an email to Republican leadership in which Tuberville's communications director asked the pro-life groups to threaten primaries against any Republicans who voted to change the rules to stop Tuberville's hold without either holding votes or winning on the issue. The email was used to berate and embarrass the senator.\n\nAfter the email brouhaha, National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Steve Daines (R-MT) called for Tuberville to fire his communications director. Daines was the first chairman of the Senate Pro-Life Caucus. These pass for allies in Washington.\n\nBut this is how Washington, D.C., works. It's ugly. Your own team will come for you, and your friends are few, and if you stand on abortion or other unpopular topics, like border security, you don't get a cozy board position when it's all over. There's little reward for doing what Republican voters elected you to do. That's what makes Tuberville's stance so courageous.\n\nThis week, Tuberville's own party is going to try to push through a temporary rule change that will derail his stays and allow the Pentagon to go on its merry way using taxpayer dollars for abortion. He's stood strong, but if just nine Republicans side against him on the rule change, he'll be defeated. But these men and women don't like it when people know how Washington works. They'd rather cut ads about draining the swamp and then hop right back in that warm, swampy water. They can't stand to be exposed, however. Calling them out might be pro-lifers' best hope to support Tommy Tuberville, the loneliest man in Washington."

      "text": "Tommy Tuberville ends military blockade in the Senate sparked by abortion policy\n\nS en. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) is backing down on his hundreds of military holds in the Senate , he announced on Tuesday.\n\nTuberville revealed the end of the blockade to reporters after telling his colleagues in a Tuesday luncheon at the Capitol. The hold, however, will still apply to about a dozen four-star positions. Some unfilled senior leadership positions include vice chief of staff at the Army, Air Force, and naval operations.\n\nKYRSTEN SINEMA ACCUSED IN ETHICS COMPLAINT OF 'ONGOING FAILURE' TO REPORT FINANCES\n\nThe Alabama senator said he was doing so to avoid an upcoming vote on a temporary rules change that would've allowed the Senate to confirm the nominees en masse.\n\n\"We fought hard,\" Tuberville said. \"We did the right thing for the unborn and for our military, fighting back against executive overreach and an abortion policy.\"\n\nTuberville had been blocking the nominations since early March in protest of the Defense Department 's new abortion policy and has delayed more than 300 top military nominees.\n\nTuberville's office initially announced a hastily called press conference for Tuesday afternoon, presumably to unveil the change of heart, but his office canceled it minutes later because the senator decided to tell his GOP colleagues in person over lunch before the public, according to a source familiar.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) , who had previously made it clear he was not supportive of the method in which Tuberville went about the holds, said he was pleased with the Alabama senator's announcement.\n\n\"We're pleased obviously that situation was ameliorated by the recent announcement from the senator from Alabama,\" McConnell said Tuesday.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said he plans to advance the long-stalled promotions \"as soon as possible, possibly later this afternoon.\"\n\n\"One thing I would say, Sen. Tuberville, I hope no one does this again,\" Schumer said during his weekly press conference on Tuesday. \"I hope they learned the lesson of Sen. Tuberville. That is, he held out for many, many months, hurt our national security, caused discombobulation to so many military families who have been so dedicated to our country, and didn't get anything he wanted. It was a useless strategy that did not succeed.\""

      "text": "Senate Republicans Create 'Make America Healthy Again' Caucus As RFK Jr. Continues Capitol Hill Tour\n\nAuthored by Jeff Louderback via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),\n\nWhile Robert F. Kennedy Jr. continued his tour of Capitol Hill in a quest to gain backing from lawmakers, a group of Republican senators launched a new caucus to support the objectives of President-elect Donald Trump and his pick to head the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n\nThe Congressional Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) caucus was formed to cultivate partnerships with officials at the local, state, and federal levels who are interested in MAHA initiatives.\n\nOther objectives include establishing educational campaigns to promote nutritional awareness and healthier lifestyles, addressing chronic diseases, and increasing access to affordable, nutrition-rich foods.\n\nSens. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), and Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) are the founding members.\n\n\"The MAHA caucus is committed to improving health outcomes by prioritizing nutrition, providing access to affordable, nutrient-dense foods, and focusing on primary care availability to tackle the root causes of chronic diseases ,\" Marshall said in a Dec. 19 statement .\n\nMarshall is a former physician who practiced medicine for 25 years, according to the press release.\n\nHe said the caucus will promote a \"Food is Medicine\" approach and \"foster transparency, innovation, and a transformative agenda that builds a healthier, stronger nation.\"\n\nAfter running for president as a Democrat and then an independent, Kennedy suspended his campaign in August, endorsed Trump, and formed the \"Make America Healthy Again\" campaign.\n\nThe environmental lawyer and Children's Health Defense founder was nominated by Trump to serve as HHS secretary last month and immediately promised significant changes throughout the department.\n\nMultiple Republican senators have expressed agreement with Kennedy on issues such as ending what the latter described as corporate capture of health agencies and removing chemicals from the U.S. food supply.\n\nThe HHS manages 13 agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nFighting chronic disease, improving children's health, and addressing corporate influence on government agencies were vital parts of Kennedy's campaign platform when he ran for president as a Democrat and then an independent.\n\nKennedy will appear at confirmation hearings in January with the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees the HHS and is scheduled to be led by Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho).\n\nIf Kennedy is approved by that panel, the full Senate will vote on his nomination.\n\nWhen the new Senate meets in January, Republicans will hold 53 seats compared to 47 for the Democrats.\n\nAfter announcing the creation of the MAHA caucus, Marshall said he would vote to confirm Kennedy.\n\nSince Monday, Kennedy has made the rounds on Capitol Hill, visiting with Republican senators and providing insight about his views.\n\nHe has repeatedly said little will change until the influence of giant or private corporations on the FDA, the CDC, and the Department of Agriculture is addressed.\n\nAt a roundtable organized by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) in September, Kennedy said these agencies \"advance the mercantile and commercial interests of the pharmaceutical industry that has transformed them and the food industry into sock puppets for the industry they're supposed to regulate.\"\n\nHis comments about potential changes within agencies under the HHS have drawn praise from Republican lawmakers and MAHA advocates and criticism from Democrats and public health officials.\n\n\" FDA's war on public health is about to end,\" Kennedy wrote on X on Oct. 25, adding his support for raw milk, ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, foods with healing properties, and natural remedies such as sunshine.\n\nKennedy told The Epoch Times in September that he would revamp the NIH to focus on the causes of autism, autoimmune diseases, and neurodevelopment diseases instead of developing drugs and serving as an incubator for pharmaceutical products.\n\nHe has also vowed to lead efforts to remove chemicals in ultra-processed foods.\n\nMultiple times this year, Kennedy has called for a review of advertising rules for pharmaceutical companies and has urged Trump to ban pharmaceutical advertising on TV. He also believes in eliminating liability protections for drug companies.\n\nAs for vaccines, he has advocated for safety and informed consent.\n\n\" I've never been anti-vaccine. People should have choice, and that choice should be informed by the best information possible ,\" he said. \"I'm going to ensure that there are science-based safety studies available and people can make their own assessments about whether a vaccine is good for them.\"\n\nOn Dec. 17, Lummis told The Epoch Times that she was interested in exploring Kennedy's ideas and thoughts about addressing chemicals in foods.\n\nShe added that she is not concerned about his views on vaccines.\n\n\" He wants to be sure that information about them is transparent so people can make up their own minds . He's not trying to stop other people from having vaccines,\" Lummis said. \"I'm very comfortable with his position on vaccines.\"\n\nIn the Dec. 19 statement announcing the debut of the MAHA caucus, Lummis said that the group would work to improve the health of Americans and \"hold the federal agencies who have failed the American people accountable.\"\n\nScott, who is the incoming chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, voiced his support for Kennedy in the same statement.\n\n\"From the day we are born, we start aging-and my goal is that every American has the resources and information to live long, happy lives, \" Scott said.\n\n\"If you have your health, you have everything and I am looking forward to working with my fellow MAHA members and RFK Jr. to Make America Healthy Again.\"\n\nKennedy is expected to meet with more senators on Dec. 20.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "Democrats Choose Fake Women Over Real Women... Again\n\nAuthored by Matt Margolis via PJMedia.com,\n\nThe Democratic Party has once again shown us exactly where their priorities lie - and it's not with protecting women and girls.\n\nOn Monday, Senate Democrats banded together to block a common-sense bill to keep biological males from invading women's sports.\n\nThe Republican-led Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act fell short of the 60 votes needed to overcome the Democrats' filibuster. Every single Democrat who voted opposed the bill. Sens. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) and Peter Welch (D-Vt.) didn't even bother to show up. Apparently, protecting girls and women from having to compete against biological males with inherent physical advantages isn't important enough for Democrats to support.\n\nThe bill, introduced by Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-Alabama) and backed by over 40 cosponsors, would have simply codified President Trump's recent executive order into law, affirming what most Americans already know to be true-that biological sex is \"recognized based solely on a person's reproductive biology and genetics at birth.\"\n\n\"Female athletes who work extremely hard should not have their future in athletics hindered because they are forced to compete against biological males. Instead of standing up for women and girls, Democrats voted to cosign Joe Biden's attempted assault on Title IX,\" Bill Cassidy, (R-La.), the chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP), said in a statement.\n\n\"I will continue working with President Trump and my Republican colleagues to preserve Title IX, ensuring every woman and girl has the chance to succeed.\"\n\nPresident Trump ran on this issue and won in a landslide. Why? Because approximately 70% of Americans agree with him that men don't belong in women's sports or locker rooms.\n\n\"Through an amendment to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, this bill would expressly recognize what is already federal law-that it is an illegal act of discrimination for a man to participate in a federally funded athletic program or activity designated for women or girls,\" Tuberville's office said in a statement.\n\nBut instead of listening to the American people, Democrats chose to side with radical gender ideology. They'd rather force our daughters to compete against biological males who have larger hearts, lungs, muscle mass, and bone density than stand up for women's rights.\n\nDemocrats countered with the absurd argument that this issue should be left to local communities.\n\nSenator Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.) claimed, \"I, for one, trust our states, our leagues, our localities to make these decisions without interference from Congress.\"\n\nWe know that's not true. Democrats don't believe states have the right to ban men from women's sports-they simply want the fight to play out in the courts, where they know it'll be easier to dismantle state and local protections than to overturn federal law.\n\nThe hypocrisy is staggering.\n\nThe so-called party of women's rights is actively destroying them.\n\nThey preach about equality while watching girls lose scholarships, championships, and hard-earned opportunities to biological males.\n\nThey turn a blind eye as young women see their privacy and dignity (and fairness) stripped away-all in the name of a radical agenda the vast majority of Americans reject.\n\nThe American people see through this charade. Women's sports deserve protection, and Democrats have shown yet again they're too beholden to radical activists to provide it.\n\n*  *  *\n\nChoose real media over fake news with the purchase of a ZeroHedge Multitool ...\n\nSatisfaction guaranteed or your money back.\n\n*  *  *\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "\"Next Few Weeks\": FDA On Verge Of Possible Toxic Red Dye Ban Across America's Food Supply Chain\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration is considering a potential ban on a carcinogenic food dye derived from petroleum, commonly found in beverages, snacks, cereals, and candies, according to NBC News .\n\nOn Thursday, FDA Deputy Commissioner for Human Foods Jim Jones stated at the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing that his agency will finalize the decision to eliminate food dye FD&C Red No. 3, known as Red 3, from America's food supply chain .\n\n\"So, (In) Red 3, we have a petition in front of us to revoke the authorization for it, and we are hopeful that within the next few weeks , we will be acting on that petition, and a decision should be forthcoming,\" Jones said.\n\nThe FDA has stated that it has reviewed the safety of Red 3 in snacks, beverages, candy, and other foods - multiple times since its initial approval in 1969. However, the current petition calls for the additive to be reviewed again.\n\nRepublican Sen. Tommy Tuberville stated: \"Let me say this: Red 3 has been known to cause cancer in cosmetics, but we still allow it to be put in our food. . . I don't understand that.\"\n\nAccording to Food Safety News , Connecticut Democratic Rep. Rosa DeLauro and 22 Congress members asked the FDA to ban Red Dye No. 3.\n\n\"A ban on Red 3 is not only statutorily required, but it is also feasible - alternatives are widely available,\" the lawmakers wrote, adding, \" Thirty-four years of inaction is far too long . We are calling on the FDA to use its regulatory authority to ban Red 3 from our nation's food supply before the end of this Congress.\"\n\nThe letter noted that the carcinogenicity of Red 3 is very clear . The National Toxicology Program, the European Commission's Scientific Committee for Food, and the World Health Organization have all stated that petroleum-based food dye causes cancer in animals . Even California has said Red 3 causes neurobehavioral issues in children .\n\nNow that President-elect Donald J. Trump has nominated Robert F. Kennedy Jr . to lead the Department of Health and Human Services - his ability to rid the food supply chain of toxic dyes and highly processed food could soon become a reality.\n\nRecall RFK Jr. spotlighted food manufacturer Kellogg's Fruitloops cereal for children, which has \"18 or 19 ingredients\" in the US formula but only \"2 or 3\" ingredients in Canada.\n\nRFK JR: \"The nutrition department of the FDA has to go. They're not protecting our kids.\" \"Why do we have Fruit Loops in this country that have 18 or 19 ingredients and you go to Canada and it's got 2 or 3?\" pic.twitter.com/UQSgC1GU7i\n\nAmericans are just now realizing that mega-corporations have been selling them poisonous foods containing petroleum-based dyes and other harmful additives, contributing to the obesity crisis and early death .\n\nOur readers know our stance on the urgent need to eliminate toxic processed foods from diets and return to basics by sourcing from small mom-and-pop farms .

      "text": "Trump Promises To Use Recess Appointments If Needed, But What Are They?\n\nAuthored by Samantha Flom via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has wasted no time in appointing his Cabinet members since his victory in the Nov. 5 presidential election.\n\nIn keeping with his promise to shake up Washington, some of his selections have raised eyebrows and questions about their chances to survive a potential confirmation battle in the Senate. But should his nominees stall, Trump has already identified a tool for sidestepping any delays: recess appointments.\n\nBefore the election of Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) as the next majority leader, Trump said on social media that the next leader \"must agree to Recess Appointments.\"\n\nHe noted that confirmation votes can take \"two years, or more,\" because of the polarization in Congress.\n\n\"This is what they did four years ago, and we cannot let it happen again,\" he said in the Nov. 10 post. \"We need positions filled IMMEDIATELY!\"\n\nUpon Trump's inauguration, some 4,000 administration positions will need filling, including more than 1,200 that require Senate confirmation, according to the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit that assists with presidential transitions.\n\nThune told Fox News on Nov. 14 that \"all options are on the table\" for ensuring Trump's Cabinet appointments are confirmed.\n\nThe president's Cabinet consists of the top advisers and agency and department heads who are appointed to help lead the executive branch.\n\nMany of those roles require Senate confirmation, although others, such as the vice president or White House chief of staff, do not.\n\nHere's a rundown of the Cabinet confirmation process, how it has historically evolved, and the obstacles that Trump could face in getting his team confirmed.\n\nAs outlined under Article II of the U.S. Constitution, the Senate's \"advice and consent\" power gives it the authority to confirm or reject presidential appointments for Cabinet positions, ambassadorships, Supreme Court judges, and other officers of the United States.\n\nThat process starts when the Senate's executive clerk refers a nominee to relevant committees for consideration. Those committees will delve into the appointee's background and hold hearings to assess his or her qualifications. Members will then vote on how to report the nomination to the full chamber: favorably, unfavorably, no action, or without recommendation.\n\nThe full Senate will hold additional confirmation hearings and then vote on the nominee's fitness for office, with a simple majority required for approval.\n\nHistorically, only nine Cabinet nominations have been rejected by the Senate.\n\nPresident John Tyler holds the record for most rejected nominations, at four. But the most recent occurrence was in 1989, when President George H.W. Bush's appointment of John Tower, a senator from Texas, as his defense secretary was derailed by allegations of excessive drinking and sexual misconduct.\n\nA handful of other nominations or near nominations were withdrawn either by the president or the appointees themselves as it became clear that they faced an uphill battle for confirmation.\n\nThat happened several times under Trump's previous administration. In February 2017, his secretary of labor nominee, Andrew Puzder, withdrew his own name from consideration amid allegations of wage theft and sexual harassment leveled against restaurants franchised by his company.\n\nAnother notable example was Trump's nomination of Dr. Ronny Jackson, the White House physician, for secretary of veterans affairs in 2018. Jackson denied allegations of workplace misconduct but eventually withdrew his name.\n\nWhile rejections and withdrawals are rare, it is not uncommon for senators to use various legislative tactics to slow the confirmation process. In fact, in recent years, it has become an expected part of the process amid the increasing polarization of Congress.\n\nOne recent example was Sen. Tommy Tuberville's (R-Ala.) use of legislative \"holds\" to block the chamber's expeditious consideration of President Joe Biden's Defense Department nominees.\n\nFor months, Tuberville blocked hundreds of military promotions in protest of the department's decision to cover the travel expenses of service members seeking abortions. He ultimately dropped most of his holds when Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) indicated that he was preparing to bypass them and confirm hundreds of appointments at once.\n\nArticle II of the Constitution also empowers the president to fill vacancies while the chamber is in recess.\n\nThe drawback, however, is that recess appointees can serve only until the end of the Senate's next session. That means that a recess appointee could serve for, at most, close to two years.\n\nMonthslong recesses were not uncommon in Congress's early years. Recess appointments allowed the president to ensure that important roles were filled if any vacancies arose during those extended absences.\n\nIn recent years, however, increasing gridlock in Washington has prompted presidents to use recess appointments-typically mid-term-to bypass delays in the Senate confirmation process.\n\nLawmakers, in turn, have limited opportunities for such appointments through creative scheduling and by holding \"pro forma\" sessions where no legislative work is conducted.\n\nThe Supreme Court unanimously upheld that practice in 2014. The court also ruled that the Senate must be in recess for at least 10 days before the president can make unilateral appointments.\n\nAs neither chamber can recess for more than three days without the other's consent, the House also has some power over when recess appointments can be made.\n\nPresident Barack Obama was the last president to use the tool of recess appointments. He filled 32 positions in that fashion before he was sued over three appointments to the National Labor Relations Board.\n\nThe appointments in question were made during one of the Senate's pro forma sessions and were invalidated by the Supreme Court's 2014 ruling on recess appointments.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton made 139 recess appointments and President George W. Bush made 171, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n\nRead the rest here...\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "The Nuclear Energy World Awaits Trump\n\nAuthored by Nathan Worcester via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),\n\nAmerica's nuclear energy industry has something special going for it.\n\n\"Nuclear energy is one of the few issues that receives bipartisan support across the country,\" Maria Korsnick, the president and CEO of the Nuclear Energy Institute, told The Epoch Times in a statement.\n\nDemocrat-aligned billionaires like Bill Gates have invested heavily in advanced nuclear, as have Republican-aligned billionaires like John Catsimatidis. Meanwhile, sustained, large-scale opposition to nuclear power from the left has mostly dissipated, at least in the United States. Environmentalists increasingly see it as an attractive source of carbon-free baseload power.\n\nPhysicist James Walker, CEO of the microreactor firm Nano Nuclear Energy Inc., pointed out that the ADVANCE Act of 2024, key legislation for the deployment of new reactor technologies, was backed by Republicans and Democrats alike. As part of the Fire Grants and Safety Act, it gained overwhelming support from both parties in the House of Representatives, where it passed 393 to 13, and in the Senate, where it passed 88 to 2.\n\nA Nov. 12 policy blueprint from the Biden White House outlines a plan to triple the country's nuclear energy capacity over the next quarter century.\n\nIt certainly appears that the outgoing administration and Democrat-led Senate are pro-nuclear. Yet, with Donald Trump's reelection, \"there also might be additional benefit,\" Walker told The Epoch Times.\n\nHe hopes the new administration will spur domestic production of a fuel used by advanced nuclear reactors. Russia and China dominate the supply chain for that fuel, which is called high-assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU).\n\nEarlier this year, the U.S. banned the importation of Russian uranium, with any waivers set to expire by 2028. In October, the Department of Energy awarded six companies contracts for HALEU production.\n\n\" I can't see, even under the new administration, that relationship being remedied enough that we can go back to sourcing Russian weapons-grade material ,\" Walker said.\n\nAt a Nov. 21 Heritage Foundation roundtable on nuclear energy, Constellation Energy's David Brown said that American firms involved in producing low-enriched uranium, also supplied by Russia and other countries, have generally set the end of this decade as their launch date, but progress has been slow.\n\nEven amid the bipartisan push for advanced reactors, some scientists and activists worry HALEU is far more easily weaponized than low-enriched uranium, which has become more of a concern recently as the possibility of nuclear war lurches back into public discourse.\n\n\"The risk of nuclear war is currently higher than it has been since the Cuban Missile Crisis,\" Matthew Bunn, a nuclear and energy policy analyst at the Harvard Kennedy School, told The Epoch Times via email.\n\n\"The acute issue is Iran, which is now closer to the edge of a nuclear weapons capability than ever before.\"\n\nTrump's vision includes a new National Energy Council that, in his words, will cover \"all forms of American energy\" and blaze a trail to American energy dominance. Its prospective members include his pick for energy secretary, fracking innovator Chris Wright. Wright sits on the board of directors of a fission reactor company, Oklo Inc.\n\nThe council's chair, likely Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, would also be part of the National Security Council.\n\nTrump's planned Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, will be led in part by businessman Vivek Ramaswamy. During his own presidential run, Ramaswamy called to eradicate the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or NRC .\n\nHe described the agency as \"the damper on the revival of nuclear energy in the United States of America.\"\n\nSome other insiders have shared similar frustrations with the regulatory status quo.\n\n\" We need to revolutionize how we think, how we regulate ,\" said Jack Spencer, an energy and environmental policy researcher at the Heritage Foundation, during the Nov. 21 nuclear energy roundtable.\n\nDoug Bernauer, the CEO of microreactor startup Radiant Nuclear, objected to the pace of reactor licensing in a Nov. 20 post on X.\n\n\"No new nuclear reactor design has been licensed in over 50 years in the US. ... Will DOGE fix nuclear?\" Bernauer wrote.\n\nSome in the nuclear industry have reservations about DOGE.\n\nJohn Kutsch, the leader of the Thorium Energy Alliance, hopes the administration makes its cuts carefully.\n\n\" There's actual useful things the Department of Energy does ,\" he told The Epoch Times, citing the agency's role in nuclear weapons management.\n\nKutsch believes the closure of the Bureau of Mines during the 1990s was a mistake that ultimately hampered American mining. He said he doesn't want to see something similar happen again.\n\n\" We don't have critical materials readily available in this country because we can't open up a mine to save our lives ,\" he said.\n\nWalker also sounded a note of caution about possible cuts.\n\n\"Downsizing something like the NRC might not inherently make it better, because they still will need a lot of people to do a lot of work,\" the nuclear industry entrepreneur said.\n\nWalker was cheerier about the prospect of using artificial intelligence to speed up licensing of new reactor designs, at least if such an approach proves technologically feasible.\n\n\"You could probably reduce the number of people by an order of magnitude,\" he said.\n\nWalker hopes that the administration can develop a better approach to regulating advanced reactors. The current framework, he said, is adapted to the large, light-water reactors currently operating on the U.S. grid.\n\nWhile Kutsch defended some aspects of the Department of Energy, he's not happy with its approach to uranium-233, a uranium isotope that can be used in thorium-based nuclear energy production.\n\n\" This is what gets me mad about bureaucracies ,\" said Kutsch, whose organization in 2023 signed a memorandum of understanding with El Salvador.\n\nKirk Sorensen of Flibe Energy, a molten salt reactor company exploring thorium in one of its designs, described uranium-233 as \"a marvelous pre-fuel\" during the Heritage roundtable with Spencer and Brown.\n\nThe Department of Energy has started eliminating the U-233 stored at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.\n\n\"Originally created in the 1950s and 1960s for potential use in reactors, U-233 proved to be an unviable fuel source,\" the Department of Energy stated in a June post on its disposition project webpage .\n\nSorensen said the department's U-233 disposition \"should be stopped immediately.\"\n\nKutsch said much of that stored U-233 could be used in thorium-based molten salt reactors or in nuclear medicine.\n\nSen. Tommy Tuberville's (R-Ala.) proposed bill , the Thorium Energy Security Act of 2022, aimed to facilitate U-233 storage and mandate reports on China's thorium-based reactor research.

      "text": "Tuberville Is Still Taking a Stand for Babies A former football coach is preventing votes on military nominees until the DOD withdraws abortion funding.\n\nS en. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) was a fine college football coach , notable for his success at Auburn. But so far, his political record lags behind. He faces not only the abortion lobby, the Democratic establishment, and the mainstream press but also dubious conservative friends.\n\nHis latest Republican critic is presidential candidate Nikki Haley , who joined the loud chorus criticizing his attempt to hold the Pentagon accountable for apparently violating the Hyde Amendment, which bans the use of federal funds to underwrite abortion. (Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin admitted that the Department of Defense cannot provide abortions but contends that it can help pay for service members to get abortions, a dubious distinction.) Before her, columnist and radio host Hugh Hewitt made similar criticisms.\n\nApproved when Roe v. Wade was the law of the land, the amendment's principle is simple: Even if you have a legal right to terminate a pregnancy, you cannot conscript taxpayers to pay for the abortion. This hardly seemed unreasonable given the strength and depth of opposition to what amounts to the taking of innocent life . Until he became a presidential candidate for the second time, Joe Biden, a longtime Delaware senator, supported this policy , but then he surrendered to the progressive notion that true liberalism requires refusing the slightest accommodation, toleration, and respect for dissenters. Instead, the recalcitrant must be forced into line - in this case, forced to support what they abhor - all in the name of social justice and the like.\n\nThe administration applied this principle to abortion after the Supreme Court issued its opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization last year, reversing its infamous act of judicial legislation a half-century before in Roe . Hysteria enveloped the Left at the thought that a highly political issue would be returned to the political process as was intended by the Constitution. Since abortion access would now vary by state - this is, after all, what federalism is all about - the Department of Defense said it would offer leave and cover transportation expenses for military personnel to get abortions. Conveniently, the Pentagon announced its new policy in October, right before the off-year elections.\n\nIf Congress wants to change this policy, it should vote on the legislation, authorize the expenditure, and provide the money. The presidency is not an elective dictatorship. Only the legislature can approve funding. If Democrats are convinced that the public is with them, then they should make the issue a priority and run on it if they fail to win congressional approval. The abortion lobby, however, is used to having non-elected actors steal victories without putting legislators to the test. With the Democrats in charge of the executive branch and Senate, they simply claim the power to act and refuse to allow any challenge.\n\nHence Tuberville's resistance. To protest the Pentagon's legal dereliction, he has slowed the approval of senior military officers. This is a crude tool, no doubt, but he has no other effective way to hold the administration to account. Getting the Senate to hold a vote is not enough. Since the Hyde Amendment is law, Congress must affirmatively authorize the Pentagon's new policy. Requiring Congress to block current policy, the position of the president and Senate Democratic leadership would ensure the continuation of the administration's law-breaking.\n\nMoreover, contra the assumption of many, Tuberville is not preventing the Senate from voting to confirm senior military officers. Rather, he is forcing the Senate to vote to confirm senior military officers. The body typically batches together senior military promotions for approval, which requires unanimous consent. By voting no, he blocks that process, requiring each nomination to be okayed separately.\n\nWhich has thrown all the usual suspects into the usual tizzy. Since they are on the side of the angels, Tuberville obviously is the villain. Insisted Bloomberg's editors , \"Tuberville is single-handedly blocking the Pentagon from putting its best team on the field - and harming the country's security in the process.\" Biden said the senator was \"undermining the military.\"\n\nPoliticians, ever prepared to play politics with the armed forces, contend that Tuberville is threatening the readiness of the military. The abortion lobby asks how we can prepare to fight wars against Russia and China, and maybe Iran and North Korea as well, if we haven't filled every one of the vastly inflated number of general officer positions. We are meant to worry that authoritarianism may triumph over democracy and all that is good and decent in the universe if Tuberville has his way.\n\nThis is errant nonsense, of course. He responds that the Senate is free to vote, and if it did so, he would support most of the nominees. If legislative leaders are so worried about keeping up, then they could stop wasting floor time denouncing him. Wrote Tuberville :\n\nI've said all along that I will drop my hold on unanimous consent under only two conditions: Democrats can follow the law or change the law. This is not too much to ask. In practice this means that, if the Democrats want to rush through these nominations by unanimous consent, then either the Pentagon must suspend the policy memo or Congress must pass legislation authorizing the policy.\n\nRepublicans share the blame for turning claims of \"national security\" into an almost magic talisman to override everything else. However, such arguments should be seriously assessed. More often than not, they simply are not true - as in this case.\n\nMoreover, the purpose of the U.S. military is to protect America - its people and territory, most obviously. However, an important aspect of doing so is defending the country's underlying constitutional system and the rule of law. Delaying promotions might be inconvenient for DOD and unfortunate for the people involved, but, as Tuberville noted, acting officials currently fill those positions. Rather than work harder to speed the approval process, Democrats hope to use the issue for political gain. They expect to both spend public money illegally and collect votes in the upcoming election, a solid lefty twofer. Tuberville's stand has gotten in the way.\n\nExecutive branch law-breaking has become common, indeed, \"normal.\" Almost everyone sees Tuberville as the outlier. However, despite the endless obloquy tossed his way, he is performing a service for the nation - and especially the unborn lives currently at risk.\n\nDoug Bandow is a former Special Assistant to President Ronald Reagan and is the author of The Politics of Plunder: Misgovernment in Washington .

      "text": "Tuberville Stands Alone Tuberville has long faced opposition from Democrats, but now he faces friendly fire from fellow Republicans.\n\nA mericans on both sides of the aisle were outraged by reports that Hamas had slaughtered 40 babies in their initial attack against Israel last month - and rightfully so. It's hard to imagine anything more abhorrent and manifestly evil than the intentional beheading of infants, who are not only innocent but also entirely defenseless.\n\nThe outrage at Hamas's heinous murder was fully justified and fully backed by the political establishment. But when babies are killed a bit closer to home, and when they're killed on the taxpayer dime, the establishment does a 180.\n\nAlabama's Sen. Tommy Tuberville has drawn fire from all sides for holding up hundreds of military nominations in protest against the Pentagon's abortion policy. Federal law confines the Pentagon to using funds for abortion only in the cases of rape and incest. But Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has put ideology above law and order, promulgating a memo last October to establish \"access to reproductive care\" as one of his fundamental principles.\n\nCurrently, the military violates federal law by providing funds to service members so they can procure out-of-state abortions on demand - but that won't continue if Tuberville has anything to do with it. Since February, he has held up hundreds of military promotions on the grounds that the Pentagon's abortion policy is illegal.\n\nEarlier this week, several Republican senators tried to work around Tuberville's dissent, calling for unanimous consent to confirm 61 of the hundreds of nominations that have stalled since February, when Tuberville began objecting to the Pentagon's abortion policy. In every case brought before him, Tuberville voted no. (RELATED: Tuberville is Still Taking a Stand for Babies )\n\nSince the Alabama senator launched his one-man crusade to hold Austin accountable, President Joe Biden and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have criticized Tuberville's resistance. Now, a number of Tuberville's own Republican colleagues have turned on him as well.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell voiced his displeasure with Tuberville's actions months ago, telling reporters in May that he \"do[esn't] support putting a hold on military nominations.\" McConnell's lack of support is unsurprising given his habit of undermining conservative lawmakers, but this week Sens. Lindsay Graham, Mitt Romney, Dan Sullivan, and Joni Ernst joined with Democrats in denouncing Tuberville as the villain. On Wednesday, Sullivan accused him of leading a \"national security suicide mission.\"\n\nTuberville sees two paths forward: the Pentagon can start following the law, or Congress can change the law to accommodate taxpayer-funded travel so that servicewomen can get out-of-state abortions. But giving tacit approval to an illegal - and extreme - abortion policy in the name of proceduralism isn't on the table for him.\n\n\"I cannot simply sit idly by while the Biden administration injects politics in our military from the White House and spends taxpayers' dollars on abortion,\" Tuberville said .\n\nTuberville has positioned himself as a pro-life voice in the Senate, and his Republican opponents are quick to pay lip service to the GOP's pro-life position. Earlier this week, Sullivan called himself \"as pro-life as they come.\"\n\n\"But,\" Sullivan continued, \"I also firmly believe that one of our most core, basic principles ... is our serious focus on national security, readiness, a strong military, and taking care of our troops and their families.\"\n\nSullivan sees an either-or divide between opposing abortion and prioritizing national security. But he fails to see that Tuberville isn't the problem. Rather, the Democrats Sullivan is siding with are the real obstacle to moving beyond Tuberville's opposition because they are equally unwilling to rein in the military's abortion extremism or bring the issue to Congress and change the relevant federal laws. Republicans might not have a majority in the Senate, but Tuberville has shown the power that the smallest minority - one single voice - can wield.\n\nWhat's most telling is that, at the end of the day, our nation's elites are only willing to call a spade a spade when it's convenient. The slaughter of Israeli babies by Hamas is truly abhorrent, and too many leaders are unwilling to condemn the industrialized mass slaughter of American babies here in our own nation. Fortunately, Tuberville has shown that there is at least one righteous man in the Capitol. What remains to be seen is whether others will join with the Alabama senator in his call for Congress to actually take up the work of governing, or whether more establishment Republicans will slowly hemorrhage to the Democrat rank and file, showing their true colors in the process.\n\nMary Frances Myler is a writer living in Washington, D.C.

      "text": "Lloyd Austin Blames Pro-Lifers for DoD Weakness Why is the Pentagon in the abortion promotion business?\n\nD efense Secretary Lloyd Austin recently testified before Congress. He was particularly exercised over Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville's hold on 160 top military promotions in retaliation for the department's plan to cover travel expenses for abortions. Said Austin: \"Not approving the recommendations for promotions actually creates a ripple effect through the force that makes us far less ready than we need to be.\"\n\nThe Pentagon should stop making taxpayers pay for other people to get elective abortions. Then Sen. Tuberville would allow the promotions to speed through.\n\nThe Pentagon should stop making taxpayers pay for other people to get elective abortions. Then Sen. Tuberville would allow the promotions to speed through.\n\nBy the end of the year, warned Pentagon officials, Senate approval will be necessary for 650 general and flag officers - of whom 80 will be three- and four-star generals/admirals. If anyone needed evidence of military bloat, these numbers provide it.\n\nNevertheless, using promotions as leverage is an ugly tactic. However, Tuberville is seeking to stop an even worse policy, facilitating abortions for service members. \"My hold has nothing to do with the Supreme Court's decision to the access of abortion,\" explained Tuberville. \"This is about not forcing the taxpayers of this country to fund abortions.\"\n\nHe's right. Why is the Pentagon in the abortion promotion business?\n\nThe issue is not funding abortions themselves, for which federal dollars are limited to cases where the mother's life is in danger, or the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest. Rather, DoD responded to the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs by promising - last October, right before the election - to cover the leave, up to three weeks, and travel costs of personnel who wanted to go elsewhere to get an elective abortion.\n\nThe Pentagon euphemistically referred to ensuring \"reproductive health care.\" In most cases, however, abortion terminates health care. The result is a dead baby. That should be considered a sad outcome even if thought to be necessary. And the high court has decided that abortion no longer has constitutional sanction.\n\nHowever, the armed forces are essentially attempting to preserve Roe for military personnel. And President Joe Biden believes that should be just a start. He proposed forcing taxpayers to pay for travel for everyone else and encouraged private employers to get into the abortion transportation business. Never mind the moral outrage of making pro-life Americans fund other people's abortions.\n\nThe Pentagon should reflect the fundamental values of a good and moral society. The military did so in 1948, desegregating well before much of America. Promoting abortion is very different. Balancing life and liberty is no easy task, but abortion advocates cannot escape the reality that a second life is at stake, and that life cannot be dismissed as a mere inconvenience. No one can claim an unrestricted right to kill their baby, and being in the military yields no greater right to do so.\n\nIndeed, contrary to the usual media characterizations of Americans as favoring unrestricted rights, the margin between pro-life and pro-choice has always been narrow, with the former sometimes in the lead. Most people end up in a muddled middle. Many who said they favored Roe , which they treated as a political symbol rather than legal case, actually backed far more restrictions than allowed by that decision. Most Americans sensed the tragedy of the procedure even when they believed it should be allowed. Observed The American Spectator 's Ellie Gardey : \"According to a March 2022 Pew Research Center poll , only 19 percent of Americans believe abortion should be legal in all instances. In other words, 81 percent of Americans are not on board with the [administration's] abortion-on-demand messaging,\" which the Pentagon is treating as policy.\n\nIn any case, being in the military is also a trade-off. Some deployments will be more satisfying than others. As a former military brat, I learned that ugly truth early on. The armed forces have never claimed that service members would enjoy equally beneficent climates, quality schools, spousal employment opportunities, bountiful shopping choices, and convivial political environments. The military needs not provide equal legal access to abortion. Rather, service members located in restrictive states who seek an elective abortion should expect to do what anyone else in the same position must do - take personal leave and drive or fly to a more liberal area.\n\nSo how to end the Tuberville impasse? The truly irresponsible, intransigent parties are Austin and the president. The Pentagon should stop making taxpayers pay for other people to get elective abortions. Then Tuberville would allow the promotions to speed through. The political deadlock would be over. And the chief promotion problem would be America's top-heavy military.\n\nGovernment should stay out of social experimentation and engineering. The military especially should eschew such practices. Better the Pentagon avoid America's bitter culture wars, especially abortion. Give Sen. Tuberville his due: He made the armed forces confront the issue. The next move is up to DoD, and it should stop promoting abortion. Let the military concentrate on its principal duty: defending the United States.\n\nDoug Bandow is a former Special Assistant to President Ronald Reagan and is author of The Politics of Plunder: Misgovernment in Washington .

      "text": "Men in Women's Sports Is Becoming a Major Political Issue It is a flagrant attack on common sense.\n\nO f everything churning in the political soup this election cycle, biological men playing in women's sports is one of the biggest affronts to common sense and one of the easiest layups for conservatives to gain the votes of right-thinking Americans. It's up there on the \"Incomprehensible Index\" alongside the inability to define a woman.\n\nThe political needle is moving on the transgenders-in-sports issue.\n\nHowever, it is almost a religious issue for the Left. Men in women's sports is the latest battlefield in the Left's attack on traditional societal values and, arguably, the most destructive. It is an attack on the most basic human distinction - that between male and female. Allowing men to play in women's sports has become a required tenet of the Left's ideology - a prerequisite for membership in the liberal elite and a hill to die on.\n\nBut, as I said, the political needle is moving.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal , some Democratic Senate candidates in close races are getting hit hard on the issue. In Ohio, Sen. Sherrod Brown is being attacked in an ad for letting \"transgender biological men participate in women's sports.\" He voted down an amendment by Sen. Tommy Tuberville that would have stripped funding to schools that allowed men to participate in women's sports. Senate Democrat incumbents in Wisconsin and Montana are also feeling the heat. The Wall Street Journal' s editorial board writes:\n\nAn ad in Wisconsin says Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin \"voted to let biological men into women's sports.\" Republican challenger Eric Hovde gets spontaneous applause when he raises the issue at campaign events. In Montana, an ad says Sen. Jon Tester \"voted to let men compete against our girls,\" and \"those aren't Montana values.\" The proliferation of these arguments against so many Democratic incumbents suggests it's resonating with the public.\n\nAlso, Sen. Ted Cruz unveiled blistering ads that accuse his opponent, Colin Allred, of supporting biological men playing women's sports and boys using women's locker rooms.\n\nIf this issue is not a guaranteed political winner, then there is no such thing. The issue polls better than almost any other in this election cycle.\n\nGallup polling in 2023 reported that 93 percent of Republicans believe athletes should play only on teams that match their \"birth gender\" - this is up from 86 percent in 2021. Among Democrats, support for teams determined by \"birth gender\" is 48 percent - up from 41 percent. And finally, 67 percent of Independents believe \"birth gender,\" rather than \"gender identity,\" must determine which teams athletes compete on.\n\nOverall, 69 percent of Americans agree that people should play on the team that matches their biological sex, up from 62 percent in 2021, while only 26 percent of Americans are willing to allow athletes to play on teams that matched their gender identity. (LISTEN FOR MORE: The Spectator P.M. Ep. 84: Transgender Sports Concerns Surprise Democrats )\n\nRecently, on The Faulkner Focus all-women town hall , Donald Trump took advantage of this polling trend and indicated support for banning the participation of biological men in women's sports.\n\nOn the legal front, a number of college swimmers, volleyball players, and runners brought a lawsuit against the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in March. They allege that the governing body of the NCAA violated their Title IX rights by allowing men to compete against them in athletic events.\n\nThe pushback against liberal orthodoxy is happening more and more where you would most expect it - on the playing field. Collegiate swimming brought the issue to the fore in 2022 with the Lia Thomas scandal . Thomas, a biological male and a good (not great) male swimmer, transitioned and became a \"female\" champion by winning the 500-meter freestyle race at the women's NCAA championship. Since Thomas' \"triumph,\" sports like cycling, track and field, and boxing have all featured biological men winning championships in women's events.\n\nWomen's volleyball has recently been enjoying an astronomical rise in popularity - over-the-air networks and sports-only cable networks are featuring regularly scheduled matches. But transgender controversies are now plaguing it as well.\n\nFive schools have canceled women's volleyball contests against the San José State University Trojans. Although most of the schools have not given a specific reason for the cancellation, the Trojans feature a transgender player. The 6 foot, 1 inch tall outside hitter Blaire Fleming is gaining national attention for the speed with which he spikes the ball. Boise State University, University of Wyoming, Utah State University, and Southern Utah University have all opted out of contests against San José State University.\n\nJust last week, the players on the University of Nevada, Reno team voted not to compete in their Oct. 26 match against the Trojans.\n\nThe University of Nevada players did give their reason for canceling : \"We demand that our right to safety and fair competition on the court be upheld. We refuse to participate in any match that advances injustice against female athletes.\" The university, however, went to great pains to distance itself from the decision, releasing a statement saying, \"[T]he players' decision does not represent the position of the University .... [and] the University intends to move forward with the match as scheduled.\"\n\nAs odd as it seems, this is a breakthrough. Female college athletes are standing up for the integrity of women's athletics. Demanding no men on the court, on the field, in the pool, or in the ring seems like a no-brainer. But the pressure from their peers - all indoctrinated college students who exert extreme social pressure to comply with the transgender ideology - must be enormous.\n\nAdding to the social pressure is the unrelenting pressure coming from the woke world of sports journalism. Dan Zachsheske, writing at Outkick , highlights the pushback he received for asking University of South Carolina women's basketball coach Dawn Staley what she thinks of men suiting up with women basketball players. The response from the media group-think has been similar to this tweet from Lindsay Gibbs: \"Dawn Staley says trans women should be allowed to play women's sports. ... What an incredible statement of inclusivity from Dawn. Wow.\" (RELATED: Great Coach Stumbles on Transgenders in Sports )\n\nHowever, more female athletes are braving the recrimination of their peers and the liberal media by standing up for the integrity of women's sports. A high school runner in Washington State is speaking out. A high school soccer team in New Hampshire voted to cancel a match against a team with a biological boy.\n\nIn a rare turnabout, a golfer who identifies as transgender refused to compete in the women's league going forward after realizing \"that biological realities are real and competitive advantages will always exist despite what number of years you've transitioned or whatever surgeries and hormones you've done.\" The golfer followed that up by saying, \"[M]y place is not in women's sports.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal calls biological males competing in women's sports a \"sleeper issue\" in this campaign. Why such a flagrant attack on common sense - much less women - has been allowed to \"sleep\" is a testament to the lack of imagination, or courage, on the part of Republicans.\n\nLet's hope they can wake it up in time to gain significant traction in this election cycle.\n\nREAD MORE from Tom Raabe:\n\nIf Trump Wins...\n\nHarris-Walz Campaign Hires Activist to Woo Religious Voters\n\nHow a Church Fought Back Against a Liberal Takeover - And Won\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

There were some 200 people gathered in a ballroom at the Shoreham Hotel. The central attraction? That would be the-then former governor of California - Ronald Reagan.\n\nAnd it would be the future president who said this at one of those early CPACs. The Republican Party, he said - and this decidedly applies to the conservative movement and CPAC - should be raising \"a banner of no pale pastels, but bold colors which make it unmistakably clear where we stand on all of the issues troubling the people.\"\n\nThe CPAC 2023 I just returned from at National Harbor's Gaylord Hotel and Convention Center was eons away from a small cluster of conservatives applauding former Gov. Reagan. But without question, CPAC 2023 was a successful gathering of conservatives who raised that \"banner of no pale pastels, but bold colors.\"\n\nCPAC has grown from that early gathering of a couple hundred to a gathering of thousands. The speakers at CPAC 2023 were first-class serious conservatives from all over America, several right at the heart of the new GOP House majority.\n\nThey included my own Pennsylvania Rep. Scott Perry, the head of the House Freedom Caucus. There was Ohio's Jim Jordan, the new chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and Wyoming's Harriet Hageman - she who primaried the Jan. 6 Committee's \"Republican\" Liz Cheney (and defeated her by 40 points.)\n\nFrom the Senate side were GOP stars Ted Cruz (TX), John Kennedy (LA), Rick Scott (FL), Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty (TN), as well as Tommy Tuberville (AL), Ohio's J.D. Vance, Indiana's Mike Braun, and Missouri's Eric Schmidt.\n\nMedia stars included Donald Trump Jr., Kimberly Guilfoyle, and Lara Trump, with Newsmax 's CEO, Chris Ruddy, being interviewed by Mercedes Schlapp. Also Fox and talk radio's Mark Levin and Julie Levin, the War Room 's Steve Bannon, radio's Todd Starnes and Larry O'Connor, podcaster Ben Ferguson and Truth Social's Devin Nunes. Also on board was Sara Carter of the Sara Carter Show and a frequent Hannity contributor on Fox. So too did Candace Owens of the Daily Wire have a starring role.\n\nAnd, not to be forgotten, there was Arizona's Kari Lake - who won the straw poll for vice president - and presidential candidate Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and UN ambassador, as well as another presidential candidate, entrepreneur and activist Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nThere were more stars - plenty. And that's well before the biggest star - former President Donald Trump - appeared. All of these people played well to the thousands of seriously energized attendees.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the media is no fan of CPAC. So they filled their columns and broadcasts with bogus stories about a \"low-energy,\" \"not-well-attended\" gathering that was \"sad\" and \"desolate.\" And there were personal attacks in the media on CPAC chair Matt Schlapp and his wife, Mercedes, both stars in their own right.\n\nAs someone who was there from first to last, these pieces from the liberal media on CPAC 2023 are nothing but - to be polite - bunk. Sheer bunk.\n\nAnyone with a working knowledge of the history of the conservative movement is well aware that the Schlapps are not the first conservatives to be targeted in this fashion. Nor will they be the last.\n\nBefore CPAC came to be in the 1970s with the staunch support of Ronald Reagan, the favorite media target was then-Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater, the decidedly conservative 1964 GOP presidential nominee.\n\nHere are two examples of how the game the media is now playing with the Schlapps was played with Goldwater.\n\nIn 1963, Goldwater was approached by CBS's Eric Sevareid and CBS News President Fred Friendly to, in Goldwater's words, \"produce an hour-long documentary on the conservative revolution in America.\" The proposed title: The Conservative Revival .\n\nA reluctant Goldwater, viewing CBS as filled with liberal bias, decided to take a chance and do it. In his memoirs, Goldwater described what happened next:\n\nSevareid interviewed me in my office for two and a half hours. (Goldwater aide) Tony Smith was present. The interview went downhill shortly after the start, when Sevareid asked in these general terms: Senator, you don't have a college degree; do you regard this as an impediment to your ambition? I replied that I wasn't a Phi Beta Kappa but had extensive military, business, and political experience that rounded out my general knowledge.\n\nThe questions got meaner and nastier as we went along. They suggested I was an accomplice of the John Birch Society and similar groups. Tony stood up at one point and was about to ask if the interview should be halted. He was very angry. I shook my head and he sat down. I'd given them my word, and I would keep it. I expected them to do the same.\n\nA CBS camera crew followed me around for a month or so and took what seemed to be several hundred thousand feet of film. One day CBS called our office to alert us that the long-awaited documentary was about to appear. It was to be called Thunder on the Right and would report on the John Birch Society, the Minuteman, and other far-right activists. The program turned out to be an attack on these groups, not a documentary on the conservative revival. The only part of my long interview with Sevareid that was used was a single answer on the John Birch Society. The selection and editing of the film attempted to link me directly with the group. After the narration blasted the Birchers, Barry Goldwater suddenly appeared saying the society was not violating the Constitution. Yet we had long opposed the views of the Birchers and similar groups. In view of their conduct I would never again accept the word of Friendly or Sevareid.\n\nNext up was this from Goldwater on how CBS operated. During the week of Goldwater's actual nomination at the 1964 Republican Convention, CBS correspondent Daniel Schorr filed a report from Munich, Germany. Schorr said: \"It looks as though Senator Goldwater, if nominated, will be starting his campaign here in Bavaria, center of Germany's right-wing.\"\n\nSchorr went on to say that Goldwater would be visiting: \"Berchtesgaden, Hitler's onetime stamping ground.... Thus there are signs that the American and German right wings are going up.\"\n\nGoldwater wrote of this: \"The CBS broadcast was false, and Schorr's was the most irresponsible reporting I've witnessed in my life. The New York Times followed with an untrue account of its own.\"\n\nAnd where was Goldwater headed following his nomination? Home to Arizona to rest up for the campaign ahead.\n\nTime after time, these kind of incidents pop up with the liberal media's treatment of prominent conservatives. The tip-off to just how predictable this ridiculous media coverage of CPAC 2023 would be was that the personal attacks on CPAC chairman Matt Schlapp and his wife, Mercedes, launched before CPACers even arrived.\n\nSpeaking to Newsmax 's Chris Salcedo on Chris' namesake, popular, Newsmax TV show, Matt Schlapp said this: \"My wife and I have been victims of the left-wing media. They go after you. They try to destroy you. They try to destroy any conservative leader. They're trying to destroy moms and dads. They're trying to destroy Newsmax.\"\n\nExactly.\n\nThe difference between the first CPACs in the 1970s and CPAC 2023 is that conservatives, whether they were there for this CPAC or were somewhere else in America unable to attend - understand the media.\n\nA perfect description of today's media came in a CPAC panel that featured the Media Research Center's L. Brent Bozell III. Said Brent: \"When we started in 1987, we went after this thing called liberal media bias. It doesn't exist anymore. We're not talking about a liberal media, you are talking about a media that could care less about the news. They don't report the news. They're weaponized. They're Marxist! Many of them are Marxist.\"\n\nExactly.\n\nNeedless to say, former President Trump was indeed the star of this CPAC. The annual CPAC straw poll announced that Trump had won the poll for the favorite in 2024, with 62 percent to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' 20 percent. Which is to say, the 2024 campaign is now on - and Trump, with his vision for the future - which he outlined in detail at CPAC - is in the lead.\n\nBut without question, regardless of the predictably negative headlines from the anti-conservative press directed at both CPAC and Trump, CPAC 2023 was a great success. And Trump was a huge success.\n\nCPAC 2023 was that success because of the endless hard work and vision of Matt and Mercedes Schlapp, CPAC Vice Chair Charlie Gerow, and a cast of hardworking conservatives who put on this success.\n\nAnd, it should be noted, under this leadership team, CPAC is expanding the conservative movement around the globe - to far-off places like Hungary, Mexico, Japan, Australia, Brazil, and Israel.\n\nWhich is another way of saying a decidedly energized conservative future awaits. And as I saw firsthand at CPAC 2023, conservatives have their sleeves rolled up and are ready to get back to work.\n\nSomewhere President Reagan is smiling.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "Just How Sleazy Is the Democrat Party? Take a Look at Nevada. Democrats are hell-bent on rigging the vote.\n\nI n a couple of columns earlier this spring, I noted that the modern Democrat Party has willingly - gleefully, in fact - cast itself as the villain in this year's election cycle. Everything about the Democrats' actions sends up red flags to average Americans on this score.\n\nBut I probably should have remembered, as I do now, the excellent line from the great Michael Walsh.\n\nWalsh, writing years ago at National Review under the pen name David Kahane, offered that the Democrats were a criminal organization masquerading as a political party.\n\nThat was patently, incontrovertibly true when he wrote it. It's obviously, unavoidably true now.\n\nREAD MORE from Scott McKay: Should Trump Follow the WSJ's Vice-Presidential Advice?\n\nYou don't need to go any further than the shambolic kangaroo-court trial going on in New York, in which Soros-funded District Attorney \"Fat Alvin\" Bragg is attempting to prosecute Donald Trump for activity that is not a crime in front of a left-wing activist judge, Juan Merchan, with clear, disqualifying conflicts - his daughter heads up a Chicago political fundraising firm that's close to raising nine figures' worth of campaign cash for Democrats like Adam Schiff. Fat Alvin's case is being shepherded by a high Biden Justice Department official brought in as a ringer. Trump has been ordered not to make any of the above information known to the public, so now Republican political officials like Tommy Tuberville, J.D. Vance, and Mike Johnson are appearing at the courthouse to unload on Bragg, Merchan, and the Biden administration for the utter perversion of the legal system they're unleashing on the public.\n\nAnd why? Power.\n\nThe Democrats oppose efforts to stop illegal aliens from voting in our elections. Their defense is that those efforts are a solution to a problem that doesn't exist . Well, if that's true, then it would seem that no harm would come of trying to restrict the franchise to those who are eligible for it, no?\n\nNo.\n\nThey also oppose efforts to mandate that someone who shows up to vote present an official identification card, like a passport or a driver's license. Their argument to oppose voter ID is that it unduly burdens black people. Asked about that argument, the vast majority of black people rightly respond that they're insulted at the idea that they're too bereft and stupid to obtain one.\n\nEverybody knows why Democrats oppose voter ID. It's plain and obvious why. They aren't fooling anyone - if they ever did. What's interesting is that they don't care whether their arguments are persuasive. Voter ID would make it harder to steal an election; therefore, they oppose it. Period.\n\nAnd then there's Nevada.\n\nYou're aware that Donald Trump leads by as much as 13 points in the Silver State, are you not? Yep, it's true :\n\n[T]he new poll of six swing states shows that among likely voters surveyed in Nevada, former President Trump leads President Joe Biden by 13 percentage points : 51% to 38%.\n\nThat difference may hinge on favorability.\n\nThose with a \"net unfavorable\" view of Biden - somewhat or very unfavorable - is 64%. It rises to 70% net unfavorable among Nevada's large nonpartisan population.\n\nRegarding Trump, Nevada registered voters have a 49% net unfavorable view, according to those who responded to the poll. Fifty-four percent of registered nonpartisan have a net unfavorable view - 16 percentage points lower than for Biden.\n\nIf Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other third-party candidates are added to the mix, the difference stays approximately the same: Trump 14 points ahead of Biden if the vote were held today.\n\nRFK Jr. would get 12% of Nevada's votes, according to the survey.\n\nIf the numbers in that latest New York Times /Siena College poll hold - maybe they will, and maybe they won't - there is nothing Team Biden can do to claim Nevada's electoral votes. When 70 percent of the voters in a state hold an unfavorable view of an incumbent, that incumbent is screwed.\n\nBut even more screwed in Nevada, thanks to Biden and his party, is election integrity.\n\nDemocrats foisted a universal mail-in ballot regime in Nevada, and it's worked quite well for them. They were able to win Nevada for Biden in 2020 and a pair of Senate seats they quite likely would not have won were a more conventional and accountable mode of electoral execution used there.\n\nDid you know that in Nevada, they'll count those mail-in ballots even if they come in as late as four days after the election? Keeping the vote-counting going that long, with mail-in ballots harvested by partisan operatives - particularly in a place like Las Vegas, where much of the population is transitory - is about as obvious a recipe for disaster as it's possible to have.\n\nThe transitory population is a big deal here. When people are moving in and out of a state, particularly when it's a lot of young, single people who tend to live in apartments, you'll get a great deal of trash in the voter rolls - entries representing names of people who no longer live in a state or at an address. And Democrats never, ever clean the voter rolls.\n\nBring in mail-in balloting - particularly if it's universal mail-in balloting, wherein all the names on the voter rolls are sent ballots - and you'll get scads of ballots mailed to a single apartment mailbox. If five people have lived at that apartment over the last 10 years, you could easily have four or five ballots arriving in the mail. All it takes is one operative working that complex, and you could have 100 or more bad ballots to gather up, fill out, and send in.\n\nEspecially if they'll be counted well after Election Day, because who knows how many fraudulent ballots might magically turn up in Democrat-run jurisdictions and simply added to the count? The Dems have an amazing track record of finding just enough of those ballots to eke out electoral victory.\n\nThat's why the Republican Party has, in a fit of political competence, gone to court in Nevada in an effort to at least force an end to perpetual vote-counting.\n\nPlease forgive the horrendous facsimile of journalism in this AP story :\n\nThe Republican National Committee on Friday filed a federal lawsuit seeking to prevent Nevada from counting mail ballots received after Election Day, as the state's law currently permits.\n\nThe law, passed by Democrats in 2021, permits the tallying of mail ballots received up to four days after Election Day, provided the envelopes are postmarked before the end of the day. The lawsuit says the provision also assumes that envelopes received three days after Election Day that don't have a postmark indicating otherwise were posted in time.\n\nRepublicans contend this violates the U.S. Constitution's requirement that there be a single day for Election Day.\n\n\"Nevada's ballot receipt deadline clearly violates federal law and undermines election integrity in the state,\" RNC Chairman Michael Whatley said in a statement. \"Ballots received days after Election Day should not be counted.\"\n\nThe lawsuit comes after Republicans sued to overturn laws permitting the tallying of ballots received after Election Day in Mississippi and North Dakota, and it's the 83rd election-related suit filed by the party six months before Election Day. That's a sign of both the increased pace of election-related litigation and the party's focus on fighting over election rules after former President Donald Trump installed loyalists who have parroted his false claims about the 2020 election being stolen from him.\n\nAnd then there is this laughable quote that the AP pulled out of Francisco Aguilar, the crook who serves as Nevada's Democrat secretary of state: \"I hope the RNC is putting as much time and energy into educating voters on how to participate in elections as they put into suing the state of Nevada.\"\n\nThe argument is that people who mail in their ballots should have as much time to make a decision as do people who vote on Election Day. Of course, there's an easy answer for that - go vote on Election Day.\n\nWhich somehow is beyond the power of the Democrats' \"voters\" to do.\n\nWe know that elections in places like Nevada are no longer tests of the public will but, rather, contests for who can fill out and turn in the most pieces of paper marked with their candidates' names. When the Democrats insult you with references to \"our democracy,\" bear in mind that this bastardized sham of the franchise is what they're referring to.\n\nThey're hell-bent on rigging the vote in Nevada.\n\nThe problem is that their man in the White House has done such an awful job of running the country, including ruining the private economy and flooding the country - and particularly states like Nevada - with illegal aliens, that rigging the vote has gotten much, much harder.\n\nPerhaps the RNC will win the lawsuit and make it more difficult to harvest those fake ballots.\n\nOr perhaps it won't even matter, because enough real, live Nevadans will show up to defeat Team Biden and its cabal of crooked ballot-harvesting operatives.\n\nWe'll see. But the more we see of these transparent attacks on electoral integrity, the harder it is for the Democrats to escape their well-deserved status as villains.\n\nBecause this is a criminal organization masquerading as a political party. Walsh was spot on years ago, and he's even more spot on today.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit... Read More\n\nIt's been a busy few weeks for Bernie Sanders, traveling...

Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) said during an interview on Breitbart News Daily , discussing the bird flu and the effect it is having on egg prices and farmers.\n\nHost Mike Slater pointed to an editorial written by Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins in the Wall Street Journal , where she outlined what USDA is doing to help solve the problem and, ultimately, lower the price of eggs.\n\n\"Well, first of all, we have a problem with bird flu. Now, the good thing is, we need to protect, you know, the areas that we grow chickens and have the opportunity to either have broilers or have a production of eggs,\" Tuberville told Slater.\n\n\"Now it only takes like 36 days to go from an egg to a full grown chicken, so it's not like it takes years and years to get it all back,\" he said, adding some perspective.\n\nTuberville ultimately said there is a need for \"base protection\" to provide safety from \"things that could cause bird flu - a few more regulations.\" However, he noted that he is usually the last person asking for more regulations.\n\n\"Again, you're talking to somebody that just hates regulations, but well, because it's here, because of some unreasonable regulations that allowed this to happen, we need to protect the people against this, and then again, be able to protect for eggs,\" he said, calling for protections of American farmers as well.\n\n\"I saw Brooke Rollins, and I'm a big fan of hers, and we're getting ready to import hundreds and hundreds of thousands of eggs, and you know, that's fine, but it needs to be a short period of time, because we have to protect our farmers here,\" he added.\n\nLISTEN:\n\nIndeed, Rollins has said the USDA is \"rolling out a plan that addresses the avian flu directly,\" which includes importing eggs.\n\n\"We are beginning to import. I just met with Ag. Commissioner of Texas Sid Miller (R). He let me know that they are working to import some eggs from the country of Turkey. ... So, there will be some slight import, I think, to immediately address the shortage,\" she said in late February.\n\n\"But, eventually, we will get our arms around this,\" Rollins added. \"We will, hopefully, solve for the avian flu, we will get the cost of inputs down, we will lift regulations, and, ultimately, it is - again, it is not just one reason that eggs are so high - it's a myriad of reasons that we are working to solve every day.\"\n\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

      "text": "Exclusive: Tommy Tuberville Bill Will End Taxes on Social Security Benefits, Delivering on Key Trump Pledge\n\nSen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) introduced legislation Wednesday to write into law one of President Donald Trump's key campaign pledges, Breitbart News can exclusively reveal.\n\nTuberville and Sen. Tim Sheehy (R-MT) introduced the Senior Citizens Tax Elimination Act to stop the unjust double tax on Social Security benefits.\n\n\"Seniors work the majority of their adult lives so that they can spend their retirement comfortably,\" Tuberville said in a statement to Breitbart News ahead of the bill's introduction. \"In a day and age where the cost of living has skyrocketed, our seniors should not experience a second tax on their Social Security, when they've already paid income tax on their paychecks.\"\n\nThe Senior Citizens Tax Elimination Act would amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to terminate the inclusion of tier I railroad retirement benefits and Social Security benefits in an individual's gross income. As Tuberville's legislation takes effect, seniors' tax liability will be significantly reduced and the \"double tax\" on seniors' federally earned benefits will end.\n\nRELATED: Tuberville Responds to Leftists Calling Him White Nationalist: \"I'm an American. I'm for Everybody\"\n\nRep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) has introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives.\n\n\"Although seniors have already paid tax on their Social Security contributions via the payroll tax, they are still required to list these benefits as taxable income on their tax returns,\" Massie said in a statement. \"This is simply a way for Congress to obtain more revenue for the federal government at the expense of seniors who have already paid into Social Security. My bill would exempt Social Security retirement benefits from taxation and boost the retirement income of millions of older Americans.\"\n\nTrump proposed ending the Social Security tax on retirees in July. Breitbart News economics editor John Carney wrote after Trump's announcement, \"The taxation of Social Security benefits has long needed an overhaul, but the recent explosion of inflation has highlighted the problems with the current system. And for the first time in living memory, we have a proposed Social Security reform that will actually help seniors pay their bills.\"\n\nCarney noted \"Social Security benefits were not taxed for the first fifty years,\" which the the Congressional Research Service (CRS), a nonpartisan public policy institute serving Congress, reenforced.\n\n\"Before 1984, Social Security benefits were exempt from the federal income tax,\" CRS says. \"Congress then enacted legislation to tax a portion of those benefits, with the share gradually increasing as a person's income rose above a specified income threshold.\"\n\nTrump has long been a defender of protecting Social Security and Medicare, as he told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview at Mar-a-Lago in March 2024.\n\n\"I will never do anything that will jeopardize or hurt Social Security or Medicare,\" he told Alex Marlow and Matt Boyle of Breitbart News. \"We'll have to [find cuts] elsewhere. But we're not going to do anything to hurt them.\"\n\nTuberville's bill follows his recent announcement that he will serve on the Senate Committee on Aging in the 119th Congress.\n\n\"As Alabama's voice on the Senate Aging Committee, I'll continue to fight for our seniors to enjoy their hard-earned Social Security benefits,\" he said.\n\nBradley Jaye is Deputy Political Editor for Breitbart News.

      "text": "Exclusive - Coach Tommy Tuberville: Rick Scott Would Lead 'New Era' in Senate by Implementing Trump's Agenda\n\nSen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) believes Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) is the best candidate for Senate Majority Leader to deliver on President-elect Donald Trump's agenda, he explained Monday in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News.\n\nThe legendary college football coach and Alabama senator endorsed Scott over Sens. John Thune (R-SD) and John Cornyn (R-TX). While Tuberville said he is friends with all three, Scott is more likely to shakeup the Senate status quo after 18 years of Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) leading Republicans.\n\n\"I'm looking for a new direction,\" Tuberville told Breitbart News. \"John Thune has been in leadership. John Cornyn has been in leadership. Rick Scott is a businessman by trade. He was governor of Florida, and he knows President Trump very well, has been with him the whole way.\"\n\nScott's history supporting Trump weighs heavily in his favor at a make-or-break time for the America First agenda, Tuberville said.\n\n\"The other two were kind of little sketchy on President Trump early, finally decided to get on,\" he said. \"But at the end of the day, we're going to have a majority in the Senate and be able to control the floor of the Senate for the next two years, and I want to make sure that we don't do anything to take away from Donald Trump's first two years because it's going to be two of the most important years of our lifetime to get all these crazies out of the way, get our country back on track.\"\n\nRepublican senators and senators-elect will meet Tuesday evening for a candidate roundtable before electing a new slate of leaders Wednesday by secret ballot. Most senators have not tipped their hand yet, leaving the race up for grabs.\n\n\"He's got to earn it,\" Tuberville said of Scott. \"The next two days, there'll be a lot of discussion. They'll be talking to the members, but the vote will be Wednesday, and we'll see what happens.\"\n\nA handful of conservative senators, led by Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), seek reforms in the operation of the Senate that would empower individual senators and committees to consider legislation and amendments, among other changes. With no clear leader among the three candidates, those conservative senators are hoping to extract promises from the eventual winner that would lead to a more egalitarian Senate.\n\nWhile those dynamics fuel hopes that the Senate will operate differently regardless of who wins, the Senate still needs a leader with a strong backbone, Tuberville said.\n\n\"We do need somebody that's going to stand up to Chuck Schumer because he's going to try to hold everything up, try to run us in the ground, try to hold President Trump's agenda, and we got to have a plan to stop that,\" he told Breitbart News.\n\nScott discussed his plan to deliver on Trump's agenda Tuesday in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, promising \"to get his nominees done quickly\" before moving to a legislative agenda.\n\n\"We know Schumer's going to try to block them, and then anything that needs legislation, we got to figure out how to get it done, whether reconciliation or if it takes 60 votes, we're gonna have to say, 'how do we come together to fulfill Trump's agenda that the public demand has demanded?'\" Scott said.\n\nRepresentatives for Thune and Cornyn declined Breitbart News's interview requests.\n\nThune, McConnell's top deputy in the leadership hierarchy, and Cornyn, who preceded Thune before stepping aside due to Republican Conference term limit rules, were elected to their posts in a different era of the party. Tuberville pointed to the expansion of the Republican Party under Trump, contending that the GOP Senate \"need(s) to be able to grab a hold of that and hold on to it and represent all those people.\"\n\nBut the leader must stand up for his Republican senators too - not just against Democrats, but their establishment media allies. McConnell has faced criticism for working more closely with Schumer than his own conference, most notably on foreign aid and spending bills.\n\nThe leader should be \"somebody that's going to speak up for us, that's going to stand up to the mainstream media - and we all know how they are,\" Tuberville said.\n\nPart of that is a leader's willingness \"to listen to everybody\" in his own conference, not advance his own agenda or even retaliate against his colleagues.\n\n\"The problem is, right now, there's not many voices in the United States Senate,\" Tuberville said. \"When Sen. McConnell has been the leader, he's basically controlled everything. But I'm looking for an opportunity to be able to say what I want when I want to, and not have to look behind my back.\"\n\nTrump's mandate from the American people extends to the Senate, Tuberville believes, and Republicans should get serious about working to honor that mandate in the Upper Chamber of the Capitol as well as the White House.\n\n\"This is a new time, a new era,\" he said. \"We've got the Democrats on the run ... We have to take advantage of this because they are going to do everything they possibly can to hold us back, whether it's in the House, whether it's the Senate or President Trump, and we've got to have fighters - somebody's going to stand up and say it like it is, and don't worry about hurting somebody's feelings.\"\n\nTuberville does not buy the argument that senators who have spent years in leadership possess fundraising chops that cannot be replicated by new blood. And he does not believe its healthy for the conference to have one leader dictate how the campaign funds are allotted.\n\n\"We should have a committee of three or four people that allots all that money out, not one person,\" Tuberville said. \"I know there've been several instances in 2022 and this year where I would have voted totally different on sending money to a Senate candidate when I felt very strongly that would have helped somebody else.\"\n\nHe also believes the leadership PAC has been used to help Republican candidates who would feel beholden to the man holding the pursestrings.\n\n\"Having a leadership PAC used to basically, at the end of the day, say, 'Okay, I helped you get elected. I need your vote to be leader again,' see what I'm saying? We don't need that,\" Tuberville said. \"We need a leader that's going to worry about running the Senate and not worry about maintaining that position as leader.\"\n\nScott echoed that position when talking to Breitbart News.\n\n\"This money is not given for the leader,\" he insisted. \"The money is given to win elections. It's not to win elections that the leader wants, its to win elections that are good for Republicans. So my role would be to do what I did in business, get feedback, get people involved.\"\n\nTuberville equates advancing Trump's agenda with winning, and the coach wants to put the best player on the field.\n\n\"I don't want us to take somebody just because they were number two,\" Tuberville said, insisting each candidate should make the case on their merits.\n\n\"This thing kind of got out of control early because John Thune said, 'Well, I'm number two. I deserve this promotion.' No, no, no, no. That doesn't work like that,\" he insisted. \"It'd be like in college, you lose the head coach and you promote the offensive coordinator to be the head coach. Well, nobody knows whether he can handle it or not. He hasn't been there and done that.\"\n\nScott's real world success tips the scales in his favor, Tuberville believes.\n\n\"Rick Scott has been in the fire before because he's been in a huge business world in health care, and he understands the country and how to make decisions, how to hold up under pressure,\" he said.\n\nBradley Jaye is a Capitol Hill Correspondent for Breitbart News.

      "text": "MORGAN MURPHY: How Tommy Tuberville Sacked The Pentagon's Abortion Scam\n\n(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\n\nIt was the most cynical and fraudulent scheme in Washington... until Friday.\n\nFor the past two years, the U.S. Department of Defense funded all-expense paid trips for service members or their dependents who wanted an abortion for any reason, at any point in a pregnancy. No questions asked. No ethical guardrails. No worries about the morality of using taxpayer dollars to fund what many Americans find morally reprehensible.\n\nThankfully, President Trump and Secretary Pete Hegseth crushed the illegal power-grab this week. (RELATED: MORGAN MURPHY: Woke DC Bishop Who Lectured Trump, Vance Overlooked Several Biblical Lessons In Sermon)\n\nThe change was a resounding victory for one man who dared to fight the Pentagon, Biden's White House, the D.C. media morass and nearly every wannabe general in the swamp: Tommy Tuberville.\n\nFor two years, Tuberville stood in the breach against the Biden White House. He was ridiculed, harassed and shunned, all of which he took with his usual affability. \"Awe hell,\" he told me one afternoon after being jeered in the halls of the Senate Russell building, \"Try losing an SEC game one Saturday. I've been called worse. At least nobody's thrown a beer bottle at my head here in the Senate.\"\n\nWhen Tuberville came to Washington in January 2021, the former Auburn football coach was well regarded and even liked by many Democrats behind closed doors. I should know, as he brought me on as his National Security Advisor soon after taking office.\n\nI saw firsthand how Tuberville's fame and general affability was hard for most people to resist. When the man walks down the hall, he greets every janitor, security guard, and staffer along the way, often by name. When people asked me what it was like working for \"Coach,\" as he prefers to be called, I'd often compare him to another coach, the lovable Ted Lasso .\n\nThat all changed in June of 2022.\n\nAfter the leaked U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization that summer, the Department of Defense magically deduced that overturning Roe v. Wade would \"have significant implications for...the readiness of the Force.\"\n\nTo anyone who knows the military, that just didn't make sense. Until 2022, the Pentagon funded less than 20 abortions per year in cases of rape, incest or life of the mother. Under Austin's new policy, the Pentagon told me it estimated taxpayer-funded abortions would zoom to 4,100 per year, an increase of 20,500%.\n\nTuberville saw straight through the ruse for what it was: an illegal power grab by the executive branch. He repeatedly warned the Department of Defense in letter after letter to change course. He reached out to the Secretary of Defense again and again, and even offered to come meet him at his Pentagon office. What makes this more remarkable is that Tuberville voted to confirm Austin and sat on the Pentagon's oversight committee.\n\nCoach's outreach went unanswered by Lloyd Austin, who seemed more interested in helping Democrats nab suburban female swing voters than, oh, little things such as the Constitution, Congress, and the DoD's own rules .\n\nAfter being ignored for months, Coach directed me to warn the Pentagon in no uncertain terms: implement this illegal order, and Senator Tuberville would place a hold on all generals and admirals, gumming up promotions for the military's most senior ranks. Austin ignored that warning, too.\n\nSo Tuberville followed through on his pledge, blocking every admiral and general appointment in the United States military. He held that position for nearly a year, spending many late nights on the Senate floor arguing that Article I, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution gives Congress, not the Department of Defense, the ability to write laws.  \"[Austin] cannot and must not legislate from the E-ring,\" as Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah) said supporting Coach's stand.\n\nWashington, D.C., immediately freaked out.\n\nDemocrats suddenly tried to portray themselves as great champions of the military brass. Democratic Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren claimed the holds impacted \"military readiness\" and the hurt families of officers making hundreds of thousands of dollars per year. Never mind that she herself consistently votes against authorization of the entire military through the National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nOthers were even more hypocritical, blasting Tuberville's holds on military members as \"unprecedented.\" Turns out, some of Coach's most ardent critics had threatened to place holds themselves, such as Colorado Democratic Sen. Michael Bennett. In 2020, Sen. Tammy Duckworth blocked 1,100 military promotions so she could make sure Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman got promoted to colonel.\n\nIn fact, the \"unprecedented\" practice dates all the way back to George Washington's first term, where it was employed by senators in the first six months of the chamber's history.\n\nStill, politicians seldom lets facts get in the way of a good story.\n\nEven many Republicans fretted about Coach's lone stand. \"Why won't he just let it go?\" I was often asked, \"It's bad politics -we're going to lose votes.\"\n\nBut Alabama's senior senator stuck to his guns, holding 400+ generals and admirals until December 2023. When Coach released the holds, President Joe Biden said , \"In the end, this was all pointless.\"\n\nAs usual, the 46th president was wrong. In the end, Coach's holds raised such a stink that only 12 service members took advantage of the policy. And the senator's brave stand made certain that the Pentagon's abortion policy was among the first overturned by Secretary Hegseth on his first week in office.\n\nOther conservatives should take a page from Coach's playbook: winners stick to their principles and play the long game.\n\nMorgan Murphy is military thought leader, former press secretary to the Secretary of Defense and national security advisor in the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do not reflect the official position of the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "SEN. TOMMY TUBERVILLE: Coach Calls For Stopping The Foul Play With March Madness\n\nMarch Madness has begun-one of the greatest traditions in sports. Alabama is proud to be home to six teams competing in both the men's and women's tournaments. While I'll be rooting hard for my Auburn Tigers, I'm concerned that this may be the last March Madness as we know it.\n\nEver since the Supreme Court ruled that student-athletes can make money, college sports have been in a tailspin.  I spent 40 years as a coach, an educator, and a mentor, and I fully support student-athletes making money. But there have to be rules-and right now there are almost no national rules for Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) endorsement contracts.\n\nAt least 39 states have passed, proposed, or drafted laws-often conflicting-on this issue. This has created an unequal playing field for universities and student-athletes. Schools in states with more restrictive NIL laws will struggle to compete against schools in states with more lax laws. The result will be a race to the bottom.\n\nIf Congress does not act, then one state-or a handful of states-will dictate the rules to the rest of the country, which is what we've seen happen in other areas of law.\n\nAs a result of this new landscape, college sports have turned into the Wild West, with bidding wars for the most talented athletes now starting with freshmen in high school. It will soon be impossible for any coach to build or preserve a team, knowing that his best players are likely to enter the transfer portal at the drop of a hat. Every player is now a free agent every year. This is at odds with some of the best lessons learned on the field-hard work, loyalty, and team over self.\n\nThis new age of NIL deals will also destroy the comradery between our players. Michael Jordan is considered one of the greatest of all time not just because of his God-given abilities, but because he was a leader who made his teammates better on the court. To create a positive team environment, student-athletes need to be able to trust the teammate playing next to them. That's hard to do if you don't know who will show up to practice tomorrow.\n\nIt gets worse. Earlier this month, Dartmouth's men's basketball team voted to unionize. If this idea catches on players will be able to hold their coaches hostage. We may even see players go on strike before big games-with games even being cancelled as a result. If that happens, television revenues, which are used to fund the vast majority of college sports, will tank and college athletics as we know it will be over.\n\nWe need to do something about this-and it needs to happen before the next March Madness. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and I have a solution called the Protecting Athletes, Schools, and Sports (PASS) Act. Our bill would create a single national standard for NIL contracts and require universities to honor the original scholarship made to a student athlete, regardless of their NIL deal status.\n\nOur common-sense legislation would provide stability for student-athletes and teams by requiring a student-athlete to commit to a university for three years before becoming eligible for the transfer portal. It would also protect student-athletes by ensuring they receive health insurance for sports-related injuries for up to eight years after graduating.\n\nThe PASS Act is a bill we wrote in consultation with coaches, athletic directors, and educators across the country. It's also a product of bipartisan compromise. It's not my dream bill and it's not Sen. Manchin's dream bill either. It just sets out a few basic rules that we can all agree on. It's a bill that could actually pass a divided Congress at a very divided time in our history.\n\nUnfortunately, some other senators have put forward more extreme proposals that could not pass a divided Congress, and these efforts have only muddied the waters further. Some of my Democrat colleagues want student-athletes to unionize or become university employees, effectively endorsing the Dartmouth model. And these extreme proposals might not even pass the Democrat Senate-never mind the Republican House.\n\nLet's focus on what we all agree on and pass the PASS Act. If we don't, then the situation will only get worse. Congress needs to act quickly and pass the PASS Act to ensure March Madness continues for generations to come.\n\nSen. Tommy Tuberville, R.-Ala., was elected to the Senate in 2020. Prior to that he spent 40-years in higher education as a college football coach, including as the head coach at Auburn University in Auburn, Alabama, where he coached for 11 years.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do not reflect the official position of the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "Fight To Protect Women's Sports Could Stall In Senate\n\n(Photo by Samuel Corum/Getty Images)\n\nA commonsense issue that Americans overwhelmingly support is expected to face Democratic resistance in the Senate.\n\nSenators will vote to invoke cloture on Republican Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville's Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act Monday evening. Every GOP senator is expected to vote to advance the bill, but the legislation faces uncertain prospects due to the upper chamber's 60-vote legislative threshold and expected opposition from Senate Democrats. (RELATED: Vulnerable Dem Rep Changing His Tune On Men In Women's Sports After Voting Against Bill To Protect It)\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune told hosts of the Ruthless podcast Thursday that his decision to bring the bill up for a vote is an attempt to codify President Donald Trump's executive order (EO) enacting a categorical ban on transgender athletes from participating in girls and women's sports.\n\n\"This is an 80/20 issue,\" Thune said, calling the protection of women's sports a \"commonsense\" idea. \"It's unfortunate that it's something that needs to be codified, but we're going to try and make sure that the president's EO ... endures over time and the way to do that is to have Congress take action.\"\n\n\"In recent years, many educational institutions and athletic associations have allowed men to compete in women's sports,\" Trump wrote in his in his executive order titled \"Keeping Men Out Of Women's Sports.\"\n\n\"This is demeaning, unfair, and dangerous to women and girls, and denies women and girls the equal opportunity to participate and excel in competitive sports,\" the president added.\n\nSeven Senate Democrats will need to vote \"yes\" on invoking cloture to advance the bill to a vote on final passage. Despite roughly eight in ten Americans opposing transgender-identifying athletes' participation in girls and women's sports - including a majority of Democratic voters - the women's sports bill could die in the Senate due to Democrats' opposition.\n\nTuberville's bill would interpret Title IX to bar biological males from participating in girls and women's sports and would withhold federal funding to schools that allow transgender athletes to participate in women's sports. The Biden administration's attempt to rewrite Title IX to include gender identity, which would have opened up girls and women's sports to transgender athletes, was ultimately blocked by a federal court judge.\n\nFemale athletes who have been forced to compete against and share locker rooms with males who identify as females are pledging to hold Senate Democrats accountable. Many of these athletes are demanding that Democrats protect Title IX and fair play in women's sports and reject left-wing gender ideology.\n\n\"A vote for S.9 is the most basic acknowledgement of common sense a Senator could make,\" Macy Petty, a legislative strategist for Concerned Women for America and former NCAA volleyball player, told the DCNF. \"Anything less than their full support is a knife to the back to every single woman they claim to champion. But forgetting basic humanity doesn't just affect athletes, it harms every single one of their constituents.\"\n\n\"They'll have a choice to either stand with the vast majority of Democrats - and Americans - who believe in fairness, or they're going to cater to this radical ideology that ignores common sense and biological reality,\" Kaitlynn Wheeler, a Riley Gaines Center ambassador and former NCAA swimmer, told the DCNF.\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 28: Georgia Democratic Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff will be closely watched on how they vote on the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images).\n\nProponents of legislation to protect women's sports will be closely watching how Senate Democrats, especially those representing states Trump won in November, vote Monday evening. Georgia Democratic Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff are facing considerable pressure to back the women's sports bill due to their constituents overwhelmingly supporting efforts to bar biological males from women's sports.\n\n\"All women and girls deserve a fair opportunity to achieve athletic excellence,\" Georgia Republican Rep. Buddy Carter told the DCNF Wednesday. \"I am calling on Senators Warnock and Ossoff to stand with the people of Georgia and protect female athletes by supporting the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act.\"\n\nApproximately 73% of likely Georgia general election voters believe Georgia's state government should ban biological males from participating in girls' sports, according to a January poll by the Tyson Group that surveyed 600 Georgia residents.\n\nGeorgia's state legislature is also moving to pass legislation barring transgender-identifying athletes from girls and women's sports at the state level.\n\nFemale athletes are demanding that Senate Democrats, who claim to stand for women's rights, put their words into action by voting to protect girls and women's sports\n\n\"If Senate Democrats truly stand for women's rights, they should have no problem voting 'yes' for a bill that ensures fairness and safety and the dignity of female athletes,\" Wheeler told the DCNF. \"Anything less than full support of this bill is a betrayal to me and the women and girls they claim to represent.\"\n\n\"Regardless of what happens, I think this fight is far from over,\" Wheeler continued. \"We [will] continue working with lawmakers and athletes and parents to ensure that Title IX is upheld and women's sports remains fair and protected.\"\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "SEN. TOMMY TUBERVILLE: The Biden-Harris Department Of Veterans Affairs Created A Crisis We Can't Ignore\n\nPhoto by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nRight before the Senate gaveled out for recess, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) alerted Congress that it needs an additional $15 billion . This amounts to the largest budget shortfall in the history of the agency.\n\nIn past communications to Congress, the VA has never indicated it would exceed its normal requests by an amount like this. Now, the VA is claiming that if emergency funding is not passed by Sept. 20, veterans run the risk of not receiving benefits on time.\n\nIs this VA budget calamity due to gross mismanagement or incompetence or both? Before Congress passes another massive emergency supplemental to save the VA from itself, we need to get to the bottom of this failure. That is why I am calling on Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee Chairman Jon Tester (D-Mont.), to immediately schedule a hearing. No one wants veterans' benefits delayed, but Congress needs to get to the bottom of this before we burn more taxpayer dollars.\n\nIn July, chief financial officers from the VA quietly alerted Congress to multiple significant budget shortfalls that the agency would experience without additional immediate funding from Congress. (RELATED: TUBERVILLE: Biden Is Infecting Our Military With Woke Politics While The World Implodes)\n\nFirst, the VA briefed Congress on a shortfall of nearly $3 billion in the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) for the remainder of Fiscal Year 2024, which ends September 30. In Fiscal Year 2025, which begins October 1, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) estimates a nearly $12 billion shortfall and the VBA projects an additional shortfall of $22 billion. Combined, this amounts to the largest budget shortfall in the history of the VA.\n\nFurther, the VA informed Congress that, should the extra $3 billion not be appropriated to the VA by Sept. 20, veterans and dependents will likely experience a delay in receiving their compensation payments. As a result, the Senate is now scrambling to move an emergency appropriations package that would keep the VA afloat.\n\nSenator Jon Tester (D-MT) chairs the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs (REUTERS/Joshua Roberts)\n\nWhat the Senate is not scrambling to do is to understand why the VA is saying they have shortfalls in the first place. No senator wants to delay benefits to veterans and dependents. But we also have a duty to protect the American taxpayers, and the VA clearly owes us an explanation.\n\nThese supplemental funding requests are proof of gross mismanagement of billions of taxpayer dollars by the Biden-Harris VA. In the private sector, if you mismanage funds to the tune of billions, you are likely to go out of business. More likely yet, you could go to prison. Fortunately for the Biden-Harris administration, mismanaging funds like this likely won't result in any negative repercussions for the bureaucrats who let it happen - unless Congress takes action.\n\nThe VA's first priority is making sure America's veterans get the best care possible. But they also have a responsibility to ensure taxpayer dollars are well stewarded. Rather than providing an explanation for this mind-boggling accounting error or by simply accepting blame, the VA is using veterans as a political bargaining chip. This impedes Congress' ability to ensure that the VA never again fails in its duty to responsibly deliver care and benefits to our veterans. In the coming weeks, the Biden-Harris VA, Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee Chairman Tester, and the media will attempt to cast the fallout of this incompetence - and the massive amount of funds required to fix the problem - as Republicans' fault. \"If Republicans don't pass this emergency funding now, veterans will suffer,\" they will say. It is as dishonest as it gets.\n\nThis political tactic flies in the face of reality. Namely, that the VA misled Congress about the true costs of the PACT Act . In 2022, the VA aggressively promoted this legislation and assured Congress that the VA would effectively budget for any increase in cost as a result of its implementation and execution. That was two years ago. And since that time, the VA has never suggested to Congress it would need additional funding outside of regular funding requests.\n\nWhy did the VA wait until the last minute to alert Congress to the shortfalls? Did the VA know about the potential budget issues months ago - while Congress was drafting spending bills - and refuse to tell Congress? It seems to me they either knew this was likely to happen (and did not say anything) or that the VA is in dire need of vastly more capable financial officers.\n\nAmericans need to know what is going on at the VA. An oversight hearing must occur to ensure Congress has an understanding of what happened to cause this significant budget shortfall and guarantee it does not happen again. This situation is a glaring misuse of taxpayer dollars and should never be tolerated - at the VA or any other agency.\n\nThat is why I, and some of my Republican colleagues in the Senate, are asking Chairman Tester to schedule an oversight hearing in September to uncover what happened at the VA before this $3 billion supplemental funding package moves forward. I don't want assurances of a hearing. I want a VA oversight hearing noticed on the calendar. We cannot allow this crisis of agency management to be swept under the rug.\n\nWith nearly half a million veterans in the state of Alabama, I know how critical it is that they receive their health care and benefits quickly. To ensure this remains the case in Alabama and across the country, we can't have a VA that runs the risk of financial insolvency - especially as a result of political tactics in an election year.\n\nVeterans and taxpayers deserve answers. I hope that both the VA and Chairman Tester consider the gravity of these shortfalls and take the necessary steps to remedy them. Plugging the holes with billion-dollar band aids may work for President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, but our veterans deserve better.\n\nSen.

      "text": "SEN. TOMMY TUBERVILLE: The Dangerous Biden-Harris Plan To Leave Our Veterans Behind\n\n(Screen Capture/CSPAN)\n\nOver the last four years, the Biden-Harris administration has made it clear its priorities lie anywhere but with America's military service members.\n\nIt was apparent in the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal that left 13 service members dead. It was obvious when the Department of Defense forced extreme DEI requirements on our troops and discharged service members who had legitimate concerns about taking the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nWe hear it time and again with the White House's rhetoric that now has us teetering on the brink of another World War - an event which would drag our sons and daughters into more foreign wars on behalf of interests that are not our own. (RELATED: NOELLE HUIZENGA: Kamala Harris Said It Out Loud)\n\nWhich is why it comes as no surprise that the Biden-Harris administration is severely limiting veterans' access to timely care. Access to community care is an essential health care option that can meet the various needs and circumstances for our veterans - especially those living in rural areas.\n\nThe Community Care Network allows veterans to seek care from a provider who may be closer to the veteran in proximity than the nearest Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facility, or who may have a shorter wait time than a comparable provider in the VA. It's something that the brave men and women who have served our country need more access to, not less.\n\nIn fact, the VA has been systematically rejecting community care referrals over the last four years. It's a concerted effort to force all veterans back into VA facilities for their care, regardless of the veteran's preference, and despite serious staffing shortages at the VA.\n\nThis reduction in veterans' access to community care has resulted in longer wait times for specialty care, and particularly behavioral and mental-health care. Given the high incidence of suicide among veterans and increased demand for mental-health resources, a reasonable person would assume that the VA would prioritize this type of care.\n\nSadly, this is not the case under the Biden-Harris administration.\n\nUnfortunately for the administration, federal unions and their left-wing lackies, canceling referrals and limiting access to community care is illegal under U.S. law. In 2018, Congress passed, and President Donald Trump signed into law, the VA MISSION Act , which requires the VA to coordinate health care for veterans by using both the VA and community providers.\n\nThe VA must comply with four primary requirements under the VA MISSION Act: (1) ensure timely scheduling of medical appointments, (2) ensure continuity of care and services, (3) coordinate among regional networks, and (4) ensure that eligible veterans do not experience a lapse in care or an unusual or excessive burden in accessing care due to errors or delays by the VA or its contractors. The VA is failing veterans in all four categories.\n\nThe evidence on the ground is astonishing. Multiple sources within the VA have stepped forward with evidence showing that VA leadership is actively directing providers not to refer patients to community care. VA health care providers from across the country have reported incidents of the VA canceling referrals for community care submitted by VA providers.\n\nEven the current Veterans Health Administration Undersecretary Shereef Elnahal is on record saying one of his goals is to reduce veterans' reliance on community care.\n\nLet's be clear: when a veteran seeks care through the VA, the sole objective should be connecting that veteran with care as quickly as possible. Throwing veterans into an endless bureaucratic hellscape in no way improves the health of a veteran.\n\nAnd ultimately, it decreases veterans' trust in the system that was established to provide care for them in the first place.\n\nI've heard firsthand from veterans and their families in Alabama about their experiences struggling with the Biden-Harris VA. The stories are heartbreaking.\n\nThe result is veterans feeling hopelessly abandoned with nowhere to turn. Our veterans shouldn't have to deal with this level of disfunction and uncertainty - a direct result of the Biden-Harris' left-wing vision for veterans' health care.\n\nThe political agenda is alive and well at the VA, and their backwards policies have led to increased wait times, meaning veterans don't have access to timely care. And because of the staffing shortages, some veterans don't have access appropriate care when they are seeking specialty care for critical needs, such as mental or behavioral health.\n\nAs one VA provider pointed out, this delay in critical healthcare could put us on the path to a \"mass casualty event.\"\n\nIn the waning days of this administration, I hope President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will look back on their track record with our service members and realize they have failed them.\n\nA \"mass casualty event\" should never be a concern for the brave men and women who have served our country. I sincerely hope the Biden-Harris VA changes course before that day arrives.\n\nSen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) was elected to the Senate in 2020.

      "text": "Tuberville Brings Back Military Promotion Stonewall Over Concerns About Sec Def Austin's Hospitalization\n\n(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)\n\nAlabama Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville is blocking the promotion of an Army general over concerns about his role in Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's mysterious hospitalization, the Daily Caller News Foundation has learned.\n\nTuberville is singlehandedly stonewalling the nomination of Lt. Gen. Ronald P. Clark, a senior aide to Austin, to the position of four-star commander of the Army, a spokesperson for Tuberville told the DCNF. The senator is doing so because he reportedly has concerns over Clark's supposed role in helping Austin keep secret his late 2023 and early 2024 hospitalization from the White House, the spokesperson said. (RELATED: Team Trump Turns To The Youngkin Playbook To Try And Flip Virginia Red)\n\nTuberville's move is reminiscent of his now-infamous strategy throughout 2023, in which he blocked hundreds of high-level military promotions out of protest of the Pentagon's abortion policy.\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - JUNE 17: Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) arrives at the U.S. Capitol for the first vote of the week on June 17, 2024 in Washington, DC. Tuberville joined fellow congressional Republicans last week to welcome former President Donald Trump back to Capitol Hill, three and a half years after the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol by a violent mob of Trump supporters attempting to overturn the 2020 election. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\n\"Sen. Tuberville has concerns about Lt. Gen. Clark's actions during Secretary Austin's hospitalization,\" Tuberville spokesperson Mallory Jaspers told the DCNF.\n\nAustin underwent a procedure in late 2023 due to issues stemming from a prostate cancer diagnosis, which created its own set of complications that forced him to go into intensive care at the end of the year, where he stayed until early January. The Defense Secretary chose to withhold that information from the public and the White House; Clark learned of Austin's hospitalization on Jan. 2 but did not disclose that information to the White House until they learned about it two days later.\n\nAustin and Clark, among others who knew, faced heavy scrutiny for their decision to hide the hospitalization from the White House and the public. Austin has since publicly apologized for the incident.\n\n\"Lt. Gen. Clark knew that Sec. Austin was incapacitated and did not tell the Commander in Chief. As a senior commissioned officer, Lt. Gen. Clark's oath requires him to notify [President Joe Biden] when the chain of command is compromised,\" Jaspers told the DCNF.\n\nSenate rules dictate that a single senator can delay military promotions through objection, upsetting a usually routine and quick process to promote military members in batches of nominations through unanimous consent. Though the Senate can still clear these nominations through single promotion votes, it is a much more laborious and time-consuming process.\n\n\"Lt. Gen. Clark is highly qualified and was nominated for this critical position because of his experience and strategic expertise,\" a Pentagon spokesperson told the DCNF. \"We urge the Senate to confirm all of our qualified nominees. These holds undermine our military readiness.\"\n\nTuberville stonewalled over 400 military promotions throughout 2023, citing his disapproval of the Biden Pentagon's policy to reimburse servicemembers if they have to travel out of state for an abortion. He eventually dropped his months-long blockade at the end of 2023.\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated to include comment from the Pentagon.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "'Put Up Or Shut Up': Tuberville Says To Megyn Kelly It's Time To 'Pressure' Dems On Women's Sports Act\n\n[Screenshot/YouTube/\"The Megyn Kelly Show\"]\n\nRepublican Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville told SiriusXM's Megyn Kelly on her podcast Monday that it was time to \"put pressure\" on Democrats over the Protect Women's Sports Act.\n\nTuberville also said to Kelly that a majority of Americans are on their \"side.\"\n\nThe Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act passed the House on Jan. 14 with a 218-206 vote, as two Democratic Texas lawmakers, Reps. Vicente Gonzalez and Henry Cuellar, voted in favor. On \"The Megyn Kelly Show,\" the SiriusXM host asked Tuberville why the legislation has been \"waiting\" since its passage.\n\nTuberville said that his recent introduction of the bill is the third time he's brought it to the floor, adding that President Donald Trump has also pressed lawmakers for it. (RELATED: Dem Who Scolded Party For Trans Issue Voted Against Protecting Girls' Sports Last Year)\n\n\"We're going to get 60 votes, and we got a lot of work to do. We have 53 Republicans. We know we've got to get some Democrats. But it is a very, very touchy subject,\" Tuberville said. \"It is a disgrace what's going on. What's going to happen is we are going to end up not having women's sports because parents are not going to allow their kids to dress in dressing rooms, take showers with biological boys, or they don't want them to compete against them because of [it] being a safety factor.\n\n\"[Exactly] 79% of the people in this country, Republican and Democrat, say it is wrong for men or boys to participate in women's sports. We've got the majority on our side. As you said, we've got to get it to the floor. [Senate Majority Leader] John Thune told me he's going to get it to the floor. He hadn't done it. Now it's time to put up or shut up. We've got to get it on the floor so people can see if it's not going to pass. We'll do it again,\" Tuberville added.\n\nWATCH:\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump vowed to address the transgender agenda. He signed an executive order on his first day in office declaring that the United States' policy would be to \"recognize two sexes, male and female.\"\n\n\"These sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality,\" the executive order says .\n\nIn addition to addressing gender ideology, the president signed another executive order, this one prohibiting federal funding to K-12 schools teaching CRT or radical gender ideology, as first reported by the Daily Caller.\n\nTuberville went on to say he believes the vote has been delayed because Thune \"has been overwhelmed.\" However, the lawmaker added that the bill can't wait \"any longer,\" warning that women's sports could be drastically impacted.\n\n\"Now is the time to put pressure on the Democrats time and time again, four or five times. We have to, even before the next election, get them on the vote that they're going to vote against girls and women having to participate in against men and boys,\" Tuberville said. \"It's devastating to the sports. It's devastating to the lives of young people. There's been rapes in dressing rooms and showers.\"\n\n\"It is so important that we keep people's mind on this and not let it go down and forget about it. This is so important to the people across the country,\" Tuberville said.\n\nAccording to a recent New York Times/Ipsos survey , 79% of 2,128 respondents said that biological males identifying as women should not be allowed to participate in women's sports. Of the total respondents, 1,025 were Democrats or lean Democratic, with 67% saying that biological male athletes should not be allowed to compete with women.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.\n\nNow that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate  media and \n\t\t\t\t\tjoining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes \n\t\t\t\t\tto marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; \n\t\t\t\t\tsenators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want \n\t\t\t\t\tto limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our \n\t\t\t\t\tindependence.\n\nWe don't complain -- we can't stand complainers --  but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our \n\t\t\t\t\thands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.\n\nWe're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. \n\t\t\t\t\tOur original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates \n\t\t\t\t\tthem -- because we won't bend the knee to political correctness.\n\nOne reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of \n\t\t\t\t\tour being, and we think she's worth saving from today's craziness.\n\nHelp us save her.\n\nA second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train.  We have \n\t\t\t\t\ttrained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political \n\t\t\t\t\tspectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There's a good chance they were trained at Daily \n\t\t\t\t\tCaller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, \n\t\t\t\t\tNewsmax, Daily Wire and many others.\n\nSimply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a \n\t\t\t\t\tfair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.\n\nSince 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. \n\t\t\t\t\tAnd we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible \n\t\t\t\t\tto ignore.\n\nWe can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can't do it unless you - \n\t\t\t\t\tthe everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment - have our back.\n\nPlease consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, \n\t\t\t\t\tcorporations and other leaders accountable. Help us thumb our noses at political correctness. Help us train a new \n\t\t\t\t\tgeneration of news reporters who will actually tell the truth.

      "text": "White House Backs Tuberville's Women's Sports Legislation Ahead Of Senate Vote\n\n'Men participating in women's sports...is demeaning and dangerous to women and girls,' the White House said Monday.\n\nWASHINGTON-Ahead of the Senate vote on legislation protecting women's sports, the White House issued a statement supporting the bill, saying that it is an important move that complements the president's executive order.\n\n\"The Administration strongly supports passage of S. 9, the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2025,\" the White House statement said. \"Through an amendment to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, this bill would expressly recognize what is already federal law-that it is an illegal act of discrimination for a man to participate in a federally funded athletic program or activity designated for women or girls.\"\n\nThe White House also noted that the bill, introduced by Republican Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville, recognizes that the word \"sex,\" as \"used in the statutory scheme, is based solely on reproductive biology and genetics.\"\n\n\"Men participating in women's sports not only is demeaning and dangerous to women and girls, but it erodes the integrity of our Nation's civil rights laws,\" the White House said. \"Congress's affirmative vote on this bill would complement both federal court rulings and President Trump's February 5, 2025, Executive Order, 'Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports.'\"\n\n(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)\n\nOn Monday evening, senators will vote on the legislation, which Tuberville introduced in January 2025. The House of Representatives passed similar legislation in January.\n\nBoth Tuberville and Trump have repeatedly pointed to polls showing that most Americans do not support men in women's sports. The Alabama senator has condemned former President Joe Biden for taking a \"sledgehammer to Title IX\" and allowing men in women's sports across the United States - a move that resulted in more than 900 women losing trophies to men who identify as transgender women.\n\nIn early February, Trump signed an executive order banning men from competing in women's sports, a significant moment in the fight to protect the integrity of women's spaces from gender activists and ideologues.\n\n\"From now on,\" he said to massive applause from those assembled, \"women's sports will be for only women.\"\n\n\"With this executive order, the war on women's sports is over,\" he added.\n\nThe order itself states that \"it is the policy of the United States to rescind all funds from educational programs that deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities, which results in the endangerment, humiliation, and silencing of women and girls and deprives them of privacy. It shall also be the policy of the United States to oppose male competitive participation in women's sports more broadly, as a matter of safety, fairness, dignity, and truth.\"\n\nTuberville's legislation bolsters that order, and is particularly important, given that executive orders can be reversed by a subsequent administration.\n\n\" 73% of Georgia voters do NOT want men competing in women's sports,\" Tuberville posted on X Monday. \"I hope my colleagues @ReverendWarnock and @Ossoff will join me in standing up for the more than 77,000 Georgia high school female athletes who want men OUT of their sports and locker rooms.\"\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

Tommy Tuberville will reintroduce a bill Wednesday aimed at protecting women's Olympic Sports from men who identify as transgender females, The Daily Wire can first report.\n\nTuberville's Protection of Women in Olympic and Amateur Sports Act would prohibit any governing bodies recognized by the U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) from permitting men to compete in athletic events intended for women, modifying eligibility requirements for amateur sports governing organizations.\n\nIt comes on National Girls and Women in Sports Day - the same day President Donald Trump will sign an executive order banning men from competing in women's sports. The president will sign an executive order at 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday at the White House, The Daily Wire first reported Tuesday .\n\n\"Men should not be competing in women's sports at any level,\" Tuberville told The Daily Wire. \"We were all deeply disturbed last summer to see videos of men boxing against women in the Olympics. This is not only dangerous but it is incredibly unfair to the young women who have trained their whole lives to compete.\"\n\n\"Whether in little league or the Olympics, it's unsafe, it's unfair, and it's just plain wrong,\" he added. \"I am proud to introduce this bill and hope to see it signed into law long before the United States hosts the 2028 Summer Olympics so we can all enjoy watching safe, fair competition.\"\n\nRep. Greg Steube (R-FL) introduced a House version of the bill, arguing that it is \"more important than ever that we stand up for common sense by prohibiting biological males from competing in female athletics.\"\n\n\"From the swimming pool to the boxing ring, far-left activists have hijacked the rulebook to push their extremist agenda onto sports governing bodies,\" he told The Daily Wire. \"Not only is this antithetical to the principles of fair competition, but it constitutes a direct assault on the future of women's sports altogether.\"\n\nThe effort is supported by a broad coalition of advocates fighting for the integrity of women's spaces, including Riley Gaines, the 12-time NCAA All-American Swimmer forced to compete against a male athlete. She praised Tuberville's and Steube's efforts in a statement, saying, \"They have made it clear that they will fight for fairness, privacy, and safety for girls and women in sports.\"\n\nTerr Schilling, president of the American Principles Project, similarly emphasized that \"it's obvious that men do not belong in women's sports.\"\n\n\"Yet despite the overwhelming support for this position among the American people, too many sports bodies still allow men who claim to be women to compete against female athletes,\" he said. \"This is incredibly unfair to women, and it needs to end.\"\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "Tuberville Sounds Off On Republicans Opposing Trump Picks: 'The American People Gave Him A Mandate'\n\n'It's just hard to watch,' the Alabama senator told The Daily Wire in a Monday Interview\n\nAlabama Senator Tommy Tuberville argued Monday that his Republican Senate colleagues who oppose president-elect Donald Trump's nominees are defying the wishes of their own constituents, who flocked to the polls for Trump.\n\n\"I don't understand it,\" he said in a Monday phone interview with The Daily Wire. \"The American people gave him a mandate. This is his team now. He needs the opportunity to put the people around him that are gonna help him with his agenda. Who are we to say that we know more about these people than Trump?\"\n\nThere's quite a few senators who are not fans of Trump, he noted, including several Republicans.\n\n\"I went through the first process with Biden when I first got here,\" he added. \"There were zero Democrats that voted against any of his nominees. Zero. We got three or four of these nominees fighting to get all the Republican votes. They're fighting hard and they're having to go see senators more than once. It makes no sense to me whatsoever.\"\n\nTuberville appeared to refer to Pete Hegseth's second meeting with Republican Sen. Joni Ernst (IA) on Monday. Hegseth has been one of Trump's most controversial picks, facing an avalanche of allegations from Democrats and the media about sexual misconduct and excessive drinking. Tuberville argued that since Trump had hand picked his nominees himself, Trump deserves to have Republicans back his choices.\n\n\"We've got people in the Republican side, for some reason they're trying to push the envelope too much,\" he remarked. \"I'm gonna take President Trump's word that the people he picked are vetted and they're the type of people that he needs but it's just hard to watch what's going on up here because it's Republicans versus the Democrats and the media and they gang up on us up here.\"\n\n(Photo by Matt McClain/The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\n\"But again, everybody's got to make their own decision,\" he commented. \"These senators that are representing these states that President Trump won very easily, I think that to me that says, hey, give him the team he wants and let him go with it because we're not gonna have very long. We're gonna have a 2 years. It's gonna be very tough and he needs people fighting for him on every side to beat the Democrats, right?\"\n\nErnst said Monday evening that she would \"support Pete\" through the confirmation process.\n\nAsked why Democrats display such unity in getting their president's nominees through, while Republicans do not, Tuberville commented: \"I'd say the leadership.\"\n\n\"You got leadership in the Democratic side that basically says you vote this way or it's gonna be the highway. You won't get any campaign money or you're gonna be, you're gonna be primaried. On our side, you're your own person, which you should be. But for instance, I represent the people of Alabama. I don't represent me and the people sent me up here and I looked at the amount of votes that President Trump got out of Alabama...I'm on President Trump's side.\"\n\nTuberville also met with Trump's nominee for Education Secretary, Linda McMahon, ahead of his conversation with The Daily Wire. He said that he was \"enthusiastic about her approach,\" and emphasizing the need for real education within the United States following years of woke, racial, and ideological content in schools.\n\n\"We gotta get back to teaching and educating our kids and give them a chance to survive,\" he said, \"and she's totally on board with that. She understands it. We talked about school choice, we talk about homeschool, we talk about workforce development, higher education, I could talk all day about education because that's pretty much what I've done my entire life. So, we're going to work with her very hard and hopefully we can make things work and get better and better and get our kids back to being educated.\"\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "Tuberville Slams Activist Doctor, NIH For Hiding Negative Effects of Puberty Blockers\n\n'They don't improve mental health of children and they're trying to prove that it did'\n\nAlabama Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville is calling on the National Institutes of Health to explain why one of its researchers intentionally withheld data on the negative effects of puberty blockers on American children.\n\nLast month, Dr. Johanna Olson-Kennedy revealed to The New York Times that she purposefully stopped the publication of a $10 million taxpayer-funded study into puberty blockers and their effects on American children. Olson-Kennedy had hoped the study would show that puberty blockers improve children's mental health, and her study found no evidence that this was the case.\n\n\"I do not want our work to be weaponized,\" said Olson-Kennedy, who was sued just last week by a teenage detransitioner. \"It has to be exactly on point, clear and concise. And that takes time.\"\n\nTuberville, along with Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), called on the NIH to explain Olson-Kennedy's actions, since she was funded by the agency.\n\n\"We remain concerned that minors lack the ability to fully understand the lifelong outcomes of the interventions studied in this project and provide their consent,\" the senators wrote. \"Further, taxpayers have the right to know the outcomes of the research they fund, particularly when the intervention studied has life-altering impacts.\"\n\nIn a phone interview with The Daily Wire this week, Tuberville slammed the NIH for \"withholding all the data from the American public about puberty blockers.\"\n\n\"At the end of the day, they don't improve mental health of children and they're trying to prove that it did,\" he said. \"It's just another insane idea that the Left has had ... they want to create a war over gender and we're not going to fall for it right now.\"\n\n(Photo by Mostafa Bassim/Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\nThe Alabama Republican argued that Americans deserve to know where every one of their taxpayer dollars goes, warning that gender activists are \"trying to hide everything that they're doing when it comes to gender.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump has suggested he will be open to protecting children from these irreversible transgender procedures, and Tuberville emphasized to The Daily Wire that Trump has made it very clear to the public that he is against gender ideology and its impacts on children. Tuberville specifically pointed to Trump's statements supporting the fight to keep men out of women's sports.\n\n\"Totally against it,\" Tuberville said of Trump. \"He's gonna have to find some kind of avenue in which to put a stop to all this madness because we're losing women's sports, right and left. We're losing scholarships for women. We're gonna have young women not getting into the sports at all.\"\n\n\"It's just on and on nonsense that continues to be brought to life by the Left,\" he remarked, commenting on how the Trump campaign \"hammered\" gender ideology so effectively in the last few months of the campaign. \"I think it had a big difference with a lot of people's late decision on the election.\"\n\n\"I'd be 100% for, for banning anything with minors,\" the Alabama senator said. \"There's no reason for any parent to have the right to have their kids gender transitioned, before they reach the age of 18 or 19 years old. You're starting to see a lot of young people that are, whether it's a lawsuit or whatever, saying, 'Why did I do this to myself? Why did my parents allow this to happen?'\"\n\nAsked if he thinks a bill banning transgender procedures for children could make it through the Senate, Tuberville replied, \"Oh, I don't think it would get 60 votes.\"\n\n\"I had two votes my first year here on the floor about men and women's sports and I didn't get all the Republicans votes. Joe Manchin voted with me, but I didn't get all the Republican votes. It was heartbreaking to me, just to watch anybody that would vote against that. But again, you know, it was a big part of the Democrat agenda.\"\n\nThe NIH did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "Senate Dems Block Bill To Protect Women's Sports\n\nThe White House had encouraged Congress to pass the bill.\n\nOn Monday, Democrats in the GOP-led Senate blocked legislation that aims to protect women's sports leagues in schools by trying to keep male athletes who identify as females from competing.\n\nBy a 51-45 vote , a motion to invoke cloture on Sen. Tommy Tuberville's (R-AL) \"Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act\" failed. A three-fifths majority - or 60 votes - was needed to cap debate and proceed to a final vote for passage sometime in the future.\n\n\"Senate Democrats just BLOCKED the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act. Every Senate Republican supported it,\" Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso (R-WY) said in a post to X. \"Americans agree - men should not compete against women in sports. Democrats are out of touch on this common-sense issue.\"\n\nThe bill says it aims to \"provide that for purposes of determining compliance with title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 in athletics, sex shall be recognized based solely on a person's reproductive biology and genetics at birth.\"\n\nIf enacted, the bill would amend Section 901 of the Education Amendments of 1972 by adding two provisions to the end:\n\n(1) It shall be a violation of subsection (a) for a recipient of Federal funds who operates, sponsors, or facilitates athletic programs or activities to permit a person whose sex is male to participate in an athletic program or activity that is designated for women or girls.\n\n(2) For purposes of this subsection, sex shall be recognized based solely on a person's reproductive biology and genetics at birth.\n\n\"79% of Americans agree: men don't belong in women's sports,\" Tuberville said in a post to X last week, citing the findings of a recent New York Times/Ipsos survey . \"I hope EVERY SENATOR will join me to PERMANENTLY restore Title IX protections and protect women and girls everywhere.\"\n\nIn January, the GOP-led House passed a variant of the \"Protection of Women and Girls Act.\" That bill, which came from Rep. Greg Steube (R-FL), got the support of two Democrats: Reps. Henry Cueller (D-TX) and Vicente Gonzalez (D-TX).\n\nIf the Senate managed to approve its own version of the legislation, the House would need to pass it, too. Or both chambers of Congress would have to compromise on legislation that might integrate aspects of each bill.\n\nOpponents of such legislation have warned it would have invasive consequences, including \"invasive physical inspections.\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) said the House version of the legislation is supported by \"bigoted folks,\" \"assaulters,\" and CEOs.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order in February geared toward keeping men out of women's sports at schools that receive federal funding. The White House released a statement earlier on Monday that said the Trump administration \"strongly\" supported passage of Tuberville's bill.\n\n\"Well, at least now the American people know the truth. Even after [Trump's] landslide election, Democrats STILL support men competing in women's sports,\" Tuberville said in a post to X after his bill was blocked in the procedural vote. \"This is far from over. I'll NEVER stop fighting to protect women and girls.\"\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "Why Young Voters Will Flock To President Trump This November\n\nLike all elections, the 2024 presidential election will bring a new wave of Americans to the polls. This year, many Gen-Z members will cast their vote for the first time. As someone who spent 40 years working with America's youth as a coach and educator, I am proud that our country encourages our young people to make their voices heard.\n\nThis presidential election happens to be an incredibly consequential one too. It's a choice between two distinct visions for America. I believe President Trump's vision for our country will bring young voters into the Republican Party like we've never seen before. And there is good reason to believe this will happen.\n\nLet's look at the two different visions for America. On one hand, you have President Trump's vision of a free, prosperous, and safe America where young people can work hard to achieve the American dream. According to President Trump's vision, merit, content of character, and love of country will bring you success.\n\nOn the other hand, there is the Democratic Party which is the political wing of the \"Woke HR Complex\" that is ruling our country today. This Woke HR Complex includes corporate America, the mainstream media, Hollywood, and the higher education system. Together, this regime determines winners and losers in our country based on identity, like racial and sexual identity, and judges you based on your adherence to Wokism. It's like a country-wide HR department that polices people who dare challenge the prevailing liberal narrative.\n\nThe main rule of the Woke HR Complex is simple: in order to succeed, make sure you adhere 100% to the standards of political correctness and identity politics. Be sure to never offend the liberal sensibilities of the regime. If you ask questions, you will be labeled an \"extremist,\" \"conspiracy theorist,\" or worse. If you transgress the Complex, you will be disciplined, like an HR department, for attempting to think freely.\n\nGone are the days of Democrats being the party of \"free thinkers,\" anti-establishment figures, and working-class populists. Democrats like RFK Jr. or Tulsi Gabbard who bravely questioned the liberal-elite narrative were outlawed and ostracized by the Party.\n\nIt is my belief that young Americans will reject this vision for our country. Young people don't want to be told that they must think a certain way or that they are a prisoner to their own circumstances. They don't want to be reduced to their skin color, sexual preferences, or by how well they adhere to liberal cultural guidelines. Young people inherently like to challenge the status quo-and the Democratic Party doesn't permit its members to do so.\n\nInstead, young people want a country that gives them an opportunity stand on their own two feet. They want to think for themselves and not be canceled for questioning the Complex's equation for success. They're growing tired of the same old liberal talking points parroted by the media, universities, and corporate America-they want to break free.\n\nIt's probably why politically incorrect or \"edgy\" entertainers are making a splash with young people. Take the massive popularity of comedians like Shane Gillis and Joe Rogan. Online streamers are also gaining huge followings for speaking their mind. Trump's campaign understands this phenomenon and has brilliantly set-up interviews between President Trump and prominent influencers like Jake Paul and Adin Ross. Young people are drawn to these figures because they question the Complex's narrative-and they see that President Trump is doing the same. If polls are to be believed, perhaps this is why Trump is making inroads with young voters.\n\nIn my own experience as a coach, I've worked with thousands of young people across the country. I had kids of all races, ethnicities, and socio-economic backgrounds on my teams. I've coached both men and women's sports. What was common with all these young adults is that they believed in working hard and earning success on their own merit. They loved to ask questions to figure out how to be the best. They needed a leader to guide them and encourage them to ask questions, not police their thoughts and actions. Similarly, President Trump will provide our Nation's young people with the environment and the tools needed to prosper.\n\nMany Republican pundits will say that it's President Trump's policies that are winning young people over. I agree that his excellent policies play a big part. But many Establishment Republicans don't see what's so obvious to young voters: President Trump is a breath of fresh air in the stuffy HR department age we live in.\n\nI don't think it's an exaggeration to say that when young Americans mark an \"X\" next to Donald J. Trump's name on Nov. 5, they are taking a revolutionary stance against the toxic groupthink culture represented by Kamala Harris and the Democrat Party. I believe that President Trump offers an alternative to the Woke HR Complex and that many young Americans will choose this path in November.\n\n* * *\n\nTommy Tuberville is the senior United States Senator from Alabama.

      "text": "Tuberville Blasts Biden: 'Would Rather Burn Down The Senate Than Negotiate' On Military Abortion Policy\n\nSen. Tommy Tuberville said President Joe Biden would rather \"burn the Senate down\" before negotiating to lift Tuberville's hold on Senate approval for military promotions en masse.\n\nThe Alabama Republican has held up approval of mass military promotions since February of a Department of Defense (DoD) policy that reimburses military members who travel out of state for abortions. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin put the policy in place after the Supreme Court repealed Roe v. Wade , leaving the issue of abortion legality and limits up to state governments.\n\nTuberville's hold does not block military promotions entirely. The Senate may still consider promotions one at a time, and Democrats have brought some cases up for a vote for certain top-level positions. Tuberville's hold prevents voting on multiple cases at once as a time-saving move, however.\n\n\"It's typical of this place. This administration would rather burn the Senate down and that's what would happen. ... If you change the rules of the Senate then it lasts forever,\" Tuberville said on CNN on Sunday. \"So they would rather burn down the Senate than negotiate.\"\n\nTuberville has refused to budge on his hold amid the war in Ukraine and after a conflict erupted between Israel and Hamas after the Palestinian terror group killed over 1,400 Israelis, most of them civilians, in an October 7 terror attack.\n\nThe Alabama senator has demanded Austin reverse the DoD policy on abortion travel saying it politicizes the military and effectively funds abortions. He has denied Democrat charges that the hold is effecting military readiness.\n\n\"If I thought this was happening, I wouldn't be doing this. And I've told you that all along. And the people that I trust tell me that it's not,\" he said.\n\nDemocrats have floated changing Senate rules to get around Tuberville's blockade. For the rule-change to work, nine Republicans would have to vote with every Democrat to approve it.\n\n\"If they go around and, without negotiating, change the rules of the Senate it just goes to show you they want it their way or the highway,\" Tuberville told CNN.\n\nTuberville's stand on the DoD policy has split some in the GOP. Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, who is running for the GOP nomination for president, has called Tuberville's hold on military promotions a \"mistake.\"\n\nRepublican Sen. Mike Lee has praised Tuberville's blockade, however.\n\n\"We need more like  @SenTuberville,\" Lee posted in September. \"And we need more senators defending him - especially those claiming to care about life and the rule of law. Republican senators shouldn't be siding with Biden here; nor should they silently acquiesce to his false and inflammatory talking points.\"\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "Tuberville Still Fighting For Life After Taking On Military Abortion Complex\n\nThe Alabama senator, who took Swamp heat for protesting Biden Pentagon's abortion subsidies, says it's time to turn Trump order into law.\n\nWhen Tommy Tuberville stood up for life against the military abortion complex, he stood virtually alone.\n\nAbortion-loving Democrats, of course, derided the Alabama senator for imposing a blanket hold on military confirmations and promotions - as was his right to do -  in fighting back against the Biden administration's policy subsidizing abortions in the U.S. military. In defiance of the long-standing Hyde Amendment , the Department of Defense covered travel and other costs of members of the military and their dependents who chose to cross state lines to murder the unborn. It was a naked political move by the Biden administration following the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark ruling overturning Roe v. Wade and returning abortion policy back to the states.\n\nTuberville's fellow Republicans, many of whom promote themselves as pro-life stalwarts, lashed out at the senator, too. Washington, D.C., can be a very lonely place for the principled.\n\n\"Why are we putting holds on war heroes?\" demanded Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, a retired colonel in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve, during the contentious session. \"I don't understand.\" As the Associated Press reported, Sullivan huffed that Tuberville's stand would be remembered as a \"national security suicide mission,\" apparently forgetting about the actual national security suicide mission the Biden administration was leading on a daily basis.\n\nSen. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., who seems to have never met a war he hasn't wanted U.S taxpayers to fund or some young service member to die in, scolded Tuberville for not just suing the Pentagon, because, \"That's how you handle these things.\" After the Alabama senator declared his objection to calling a vote on a two-star general nominated to serve as an Air Force deputy commander, Graham disgustedly told Tuberville, \"You just denied that lady a promotion.\"\n\nDespite the pressure from many in his own party, the legendary college football coach known for his fortitude (aka cajones) stood his ground for 11 long months. He backed down only after abortion-on-demand Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Senate majority leader at the time, threatened to go around Tuberville and change the rules on Senate nominee holds. But Tuberville never stopped fighting against the Pentagon's policy and standing up for the unborn and taxpayers.\n\n\"Remarkably, Senator Tuberville held off the entire military-industrial complex and the Senate establishment ...,\" the Family Research Council said in a press release.\n\nSen. Mike Lee, one of Tuberville's most vocal defenders during the nomination battle, called his colleague a hero.\n\n\"Senator Tuberville fought courageously for unborn Americans and the rule of law. His opponents threatened to forever destroy Senate procedure to get their way, and today he is acting to protect our institution from them,\" the Utah Republican senator wrote on X after Tuberville announced he would lift his blockade.\n\n. @SenTuberville fought courageously for unborn Americans and the rule of law. His opponents threatened to forever destroy Senate procedure to get their way, and today he is acting to protect our institution from them. Hero. https://t.co/foMb9zOyIK\n\nIt took an election, a new commander-in-chief, and the Defense secretary that some Republicans trashed as too divisive and inexperienced to end Biden's abortion subsidy. On Jan. 30., the DOD reversed the directive that had been in place since right before the 2022 midterm elections. The action followed Trump's executive order on \"Enforcing the Hyde Amendment\", which ordered federal agencies to \"end the use of federal taxpayer dollars to fund or promote elective abortion.\"\n\nThe order recognizes that for nearly a half century the Hyde Amendment , which prohibits federal tax dollars to pay for abortion, has been the law of the land. \"Contrary to this longstanding commonsense policy, the previous administration embedded federal funding of elective abortion in a wide variety of government programs,\" Trump's order states. President Joe Biden's Department of Justice had argued that the Hyde Amendment \"does not prohibit the use of funds to pay expenses, such as a per diem or travel expenses, that are incidental to the abortion.\"\n\nTuberville, chairman of Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Personnel, lauded President Trump and Secretary Pete Hegseth for putting an end to the Biden administration policy, and the Democrats treating taxpayer dollars \"like their own personal piggy bank\" to \"bankroll their woke agenda.\"\n\nOn a recent episode of \" The Federalist Radio Hour, \" the Alabama Republican said he felt gratified by the Pentagon's memo . But he said he'll never forget how brutal the battle was, the times he stood on the Senate floor in the wee hours of the morning fighting against \"pro-life\" Republicans. Interestingly, many of those same Republicans were among the first to applaud the president and Hegseth for scrapping the Biden abortion travel stipend.\n\n\"It was funny. I watched the president do this executive order and of course all of those same Republicans were just clapping and yelling that that was the right thing to do,\" Tuberville says on the podcast. \"Just hypocrites.\"\n\nTuberville said it's time to make Trump's executive order law so that the next pro-abortion president can't simply reverse executive branch policy, Hyde Amendment not withstanding.\n\nThe Republican-controlled House last year, basically on party lines, passed a version of the National Defense Authorization Act that included an amendment barring the Pentagon from paying for or reimbursing abortion-related expenses.\n\n\"Biden's Department of Defense is using taxpayer dollars to fund time off, lodging and travel expenses for elective abortions, directly violating the long-standing Hyde Amendment in yet another attempt to promote abortion,\" Rep. Beth Van Duyne, R-Texas., who spearheaded the amendment to the defense bill, said in a press release.\n\nA version of the NDAA without the prohibition ultimately made it through the Democrat-controlled Senate and Biden signed the nearly $900 billion spending bill in late December. The law does restrict funding for transgender treatments and other medical mutilation of children of service members, a prohibition Biden and fellow Democrats lamented.\n\nAs of March 2024, the only time the Biden Pentagon had provided data on the abortion travel expense policy, \" it had been used 12 times \" and cost taxpayers $44,791, the Military Times reported . The Federalist has requested updated information from the Department of Defense.\n\nInterestingly, while the Biden administration couldn't bring itself to provide updates on its skirting of abortion restrictions in the federal government, it reportedly had time to sic the Internal Revenue Service on Hegseth. The Defense secretary on Monday claimed on X that the IRS hit him with an audit as a Biden administration parting gift.\n\n\"Of course the outgoing Biden IRS rushed an 'audit' of the incoming SecDef. Total sham,\" Hegseth wrote. The post includes a photo of an IRS letter addressed to Hegseth and his wife stating the couple owes the federal government $33,558.16. The IRS demands it be paid immediately to avoid further penalties\n\n\"The party of 'norms' and 'decency' strikes again,\" Hegseth wrote, noting what appears to be another incident of the left's weaponizing of the government to target its political enemies. \"We will never back down.\"\n\nOf course the outgoing Biden IRS rushed an \"audit\" of the incoming SecDef. Total sham. The party of \"norms\" and \"decency\" strikes again. We will never back down. pic.twitter.com/coW1UpFPrD\n\nTuberville knows the feeling from his fight for life against the military industrial complex. The son of a World War II veteran and a vehement supporter of U.S. service members, the senator said he was vilified for sticking to his principles. As Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts said amid the bruising Senate battles over Biden military nominees, \"When Mr. Smith goes to Washington, Washington always fights back.\" Roberts said Tuberville \"refused to abandon unborn children in favor of unelected bureaucrats.\"\n\nThe more things change the more they stay the same in the swamp. Tuberville compared his battles to stop government subsidizing of abortion to Trump's efforts to expose and excise waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal bureaucracy. Now that the Trump administration is threatening thousands of unelected bureaucrat jobs in the swamp, the administrative state is going to war with the administration.\n\nTrump, too, has taken on the DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) complex that has infected the U.S. government.\n\nIn a press release following the DOD's reversal of the Biden-era abortion assistance policy, Tuberville said he's encouraged by the Trump administration quickly addressing \"the poisonous, woke ideology that has permeated every part of our government, including the military.\"\n\n\"I'm proud of the small role I played in protecting taxpayers and standing up for life,\" the senator said. \"Trump and I have something in common: promises made, promises kept.\"\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Why Is SBA Pro-Life MIA In The Fight Against Biden Pentagon's Radical Abortion Support?\n\nSBA Pro-Life America often puts itself at the forefront of the fight against Democrats' abortion extremism, but when it comes to Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville's fight against the Pentagon's plans for taxpayer-funded abortion, the group is uncharacteristically quiet.\n\nNow that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has threatened to bring a resolution that would let the Senate process military promotions en bloc, Tuberville needs the support of pro-life groups more than ever.\n\n\"Patience is wearing thin with Senator Tuberville on both sides of the aisle,\" Schumer said in floor remarks on Wednesday. \"What happened with the Marine Commandant just showed many people how dangerous what Tuberville is doing is. And so I will call for a resolution on the floor to allow us to vote on all these people at once. And I'm very hopeful and optimistic about it.\"\n\nIn a statement to The Federalist, SBA's VP of Communications E.V. Osment was quick to condemn the Biden administration for \"illegally injected abortion into our military against the will of the American people\" and reaffirm that Schumer has the power to bypass Tuberville's hold.\n\nSBA, however, wouldn't tell The Federalist if it plans to score the Schumer-led vote. Nor did the pro-life group explain why it hasn't consistently backed Tuberville's pro-life stand.\n\nWhen Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin announced in February that the taxpayer-funded Pentagon would grant up to three weeks of paid time off and travel for U.S. military members and their family members to obtain abortions, Tuberville placed a hold on the Senate confirmation of all civilian and general flag officer nominees.\n\nHe forced the Biden administration and its Democrat allies in Congress to choose between abandoning their radical abortion agenda or handing individual congressional approval to Austin's subordinates.\n\nSince Tuberville began slow-walking military promotions, he sustained multiple attacks from Democrats, corporate media , former intel officials , high-ranking military members, and even Senate GOP leadership for impairing \"military readiness,\" a claim that lacks evidence and is overshadowed by the fact that the Senate Armed Services Committee can vote on each nomination individually .\n\nDespite SBA's favorable ranking of Tuberville and his pro-life track record, their support for him and his fight against the Pentagon is strictly limited.\n\nIn May, SBA featured a video of the Alabama Policy Institute's Stephanie Smith thanking Tuberville for \"standing up for the people of Alabama and for those of us who don't want our tax dollars going toward abortions.\"\n\nTommy Tuberville is standing up for the rule of law and the people of Alabama. Thank you so much, @SenTuberville , for standing up for us. pic.twitter.com/LYfV9ppJVe\n\nFour months later, SBA posted a clip of former Vice President Mike Pence declaring Tuberville's hold \"is right and the Pentagon is wrong.\"\n\n\" @SenTuberville is right and the Pentagon is wrong.\" @Mike_Pence speaks up in support of Sen. Tuberville and Americans who don't want their tax dollars to support abortion. #PVSS2023 pic.twitter.com/tIaBHs5Vz3\n\nIt wasn't until Sept. 21 that SBA explicitly expressed support for Tuberville's stalling.\n\n\"Sen. Tuberville is a heroic example of how pro-life MoC should stand for the protection of unborn children and their mothers and the rule of law,\" SBA President Marjorie Dannenfelser said in a statement . \"We are proud to stand with him as he works with his colleagues to rein in Biden's extremism and save innocent lives.\"\n\nSBA's delayed response to Tuberville's months-long fight strongly contrasts how the pro-life group has closely allied itself with several of the Senate Republicans who have criticized their colleague in recent months.\n\nWhen Sen. Lindsey Graham proposed a national 15-week abortion ban bill, SBA was extremely supportive; the group quickly published a press release praising the Republican for attempting to bring the U.S. up to speed with Europe.\n\nGraham recently accused Tuberville of \"doing great damage to our military\" with his abortion protest.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Politicos Who Attacked Tuberville's Abortion Protest Over 'Military Readiness' Are MIA On Defense Sec's Secret Leave\n\nThe same figures who used phony \"military readiness\" claims to attack Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., for protesting the Pentagon's unlawful abortion policy are MIA on Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's failure to inform leading administration officials of his hospitalization.\n\nLast year, Tuberville began using his position on the Senate Armed Services Committee to slow-walk votes on President Biden's military nominees in protest of the Pentagon's use of U.S. taxpayer dollars to pay for service members' abortion-related travel expenses. Rather than allow the committee to confirm a large number of military nominations \"en masse,\" the GOP senator's protest forced the body to vote on each nomination one at a time.\n\nThroughout his fight for the unborn, Tuberville faced vicious and dishonest attacks from Democrats and Biden military officials such as Austin , who regularly and baselessly claimed the Alabama senator's protest harmed \"military readiness\" and \"national security.\" If that wasn't bad enough, several GOP senators, led by Alaska's Dan Sullivan, joined Democrats in piling on Tuberville and regurgitating unsubstantiated \"military readiness\" claims.\n\nTuberville was ultimately forced to abandon his holds last month after Sullivan and other Republicans threatened to side with Democrats to change Senate rules to skirt his protest.\n\nYet for all their supposed concern about \"military readiness\" and \"national security,\" many of the politicos and officials who attacked Tuberville's defense of life have remained mum on Austin's failure to notify the president and leading administration officials about his hospitalization. The Pentagon revealed on Friday that Austin - whose military authority is second only to the president - was hospitalized with an undisclosed medical issue on Jan. 1, with the department later confirming the admission came as a result of \"complications following a recent elective medical procedure.\"\n\nThe American public and members of Congress didn't know about the matter until Friday, but even President Biden and high-ranking administration officials reportedly weren't briefed on Austin's absence until Thursday, meaning the White House was unaware for three days that Austin was MIA. Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks - whom Austin transferred his responsibilities to and was vacationing in Puerto Rico at the time - was also reportedly unaware of the situation until Thursday.\n\nDespite baselessly asserting Tuberville's holds would \"weaken our national security,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has yet to issue a statement, as of publishing time, criticizing Austin for his negligence. Rhode Island Democrat Sen. Jack Reed - who once hyperbolically claimed Tuberville's actions \"achieved something that Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin could have only dreamed of\" - issued a milquetoast statement by comparison about how he's \"concerned\" but is glad Austin is \"taking responsibility for the situation.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Sullivan and Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham and Mitt Romney - all of whom sided with Democrats in attacking Tuberville - have also neglected to release statements condemning Austin's misconduct as of this article's publication.\n\nFor all their supposed concern about \"military readiness,\" many of these same officials don't seem bothered that the second-highest-ranking military official in the country was gone for days and didn't bother to tell the public, let alone the president. As I previously wrote in these pages, Austin's secret medical episode, in conjunction with Biden's mental decline, unveils a frightening reality in which Americans are left to depend on unknown, feckless bureaucrats to respond to the country's biggest international crises.\n\nIf only their representatives showed as much concern about actual national security issues rather than ginning up unfounded attacks on a single senator for his lawful and just defense of life.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "It's Joe Biden, Not Tommy Tuberville, Who Brought The 'Culture War' To The Military\n\nSince February, Alabama Republican Tommy Tuberville has been using a \"senatorial hold\" to block personnel moves by the U.S. military that require Senate confirmation. The media and Democrats are very upset that Tuberville is \"waging an unprecedented campaign\" and embroiling our vital national defense policy in the culture war.\n\nJoe Biden claims that Republicans are \"injecting into fundamental foreign policy decisions what in fact is a domestic social debate on social issues is bizarre,\" which is \"totally irresponsible.\" While I don't know much about Tommy Tuberville, the president has it backward. It was Biden and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, not any Republican, who broke with 45 years of policy last year by instituting effective reimbursements for elective abortions by military and dependents. It is just as true to say, probably truer, that the president is the one holding up military promotions by unilaterally trashing policy that has been in place since 1980.\n\nOne of the implications of most stories covering the military hold debate illustrates the radically rightward shift and unprecedented fanaticism of Republican politics. This, too, is backward. Biden, who supported the Hyde Amendment, a law banning federal funds to pay for abortion, from 1976-2019, is an exemplar of the hard-left cultural lurch of the modern left.\n\nBiden had not merely gone along with the Hyde Amendment as a means of compromising with Republicans back in the '80s and '90s. Until the past couple of decades, the abortion debate wasn't neatly divided by party, and Biden, purportedly a devout Catholic, had to keep conservative working-class Delawarean voters happy. In 1994, the future president wrote a letter to a constituent bragging that he had voted against abortion funding on 50 occasions .\n\nLike most things Biden says, this was probably untrue . But he did vote to save the Hyde Amendment repeatedly over the decades. Biden also voted against allowing Medicaid to fund abortions, even for victims of rape and incest. He supported a Jesse Helms amendment that would have prohibited using federal funds for abortions and abortion research or training. Biden voted numerous times to prohibit the Federal Employees Health Benefits program from funding abortions for government workers.\n\nIndeed, Biden was constantly \"injecting into fundamental foreign policy decisions what in fact is a domestic social debate on social issues.\" He didn't merely support banning public funding for abortion in the United States; he wrote an amendment to Foreign Assistance Act - for years, referred to as the \"Biden amendment\" - that barred U.S. foreign aid from being used in any research related to abortions. In 1984, Biden supported the \"Mexico City policy,\" banning federal funding for private organizations that provide abortion, advocate to decriminalize abortion, or expand abortion services.\n\nEven on June 5,  2019, not long after his 2020 presidential campaign kickoff, Biden publicly reaffirmed his support for the Hyde Amendment. The very next day , after some criticism from primary opponents, the spineless candidate changed his position and \" denounce[d] \" the Hyde Amendment.\n\nFor what it's worth, virtually every poll on the question of public funding for abortion, even ones that offer a misleading framing of the issue, find most Americans support banning taxpayer funding for abortions. Poll support doesn't mean much in my book, but it does put to rest the idea that Tuberville is taking on some kind of fanatical position outside the mainstream.\n\nThen again, today, Biden, the man who twice voted for partial-birth abortion bans and once supported overturning Roe v. Wade , backs state-funded abortions on demand from conception to crowning for any reason, including eugenics and sex-selective abortion. And, for the first time in history, he wants to implement that policy in the military. Bizarre, indeed.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

Tommy Tuberville for slow-walking President Biden's military nominees in protest of the Pentagon's abortion policy hold major ties with America's military-industrial complex, according to a conservative government watchdog group.\n\nIn May, seven former Defense secretaries signed a letter criticizing Tuberville's bid to force individual votes on Biden's military appointees. In their letter, the secretaries claimed Tuberville's protest of the Pentagon's use of taxpayer money to cover service members' travel expenses to get abortions was \"irresponsible\" and baselessly asserted such a practice \"risks turning military officers into political pawns.\"\n\nThe letter's signatories included James Mattis, Mark Esper, Chuck Hagel, Leon Panetta, Robert Gates, William Cohen, and William Perry.\n\nIn a thread published on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Monday, the American Accountability Foundation (AAF) unearthed how these same former Defense secretaries now hold exclusive positions with major U.S. defense contractors and related ventures.\n\nFor instance, Leon Panetta, who held the position under President Barack Obama, has since served as a senior counselor for Beacon Global Strategies LLC since 2014 . According to its website , Beacon Global is a \"strategic advisory firm\" that specializes in areas such as defense and homeland security. A 2013 Defense News article reportedly described the company's clients as \"primarily defense contractors\" but noted that the identities of said entities are not publicly available \"because of nondisclosure agreements.\"\n\nChuck Hagel, who also served as defense secretary under Obama, sits on the RAND Corporation Board of Trustees as of July. A nonprofit with its origins dating back to the post-World War II era, RAND claims to \"help[] improve policy and decision[-]making through research and analysis\" across a variety of areas , including national security and terrorism, international affairs, and homeland security and public safety, among others.\n\nRepublican-appointed defense secretaries also appear to have waded into America's military-industrial complex since leaving public office. James Mattis, a Trump appointee, now serves on the Board of Directors for General Dynamics Corporation, a major defense contractor whose portfolio includes aerospace, combat systems, and other defense-related technologies.\n\nMeanwhile, Mark Esper, another Trump nominee and former Raytheon (now RTX ) executive, reportedly has ties to numerous defense-related entities. In May 2021, Esper officially joined the board of directors of Epirus, a self-described \"high-growth technology company.\" In a statement announcing the decision, Epirus claimed adding Esper to its board \"solidifies our ability to bring to market the technology we need to help protect the U.S. warfighter and develop other new applications of our technology for broad commercial use.\"\n\nIn addition to Epirus, Esper also serves on the boards of Cobham Advanced Electronics Systems and Red Cell Partners . While the former provides electronics-based weapons systems to the U.S. aerospace and defense industry, the latter \"leverages big data, artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, and advanced materials to develop powerful technologies that address our Nation's most pressing problems.\"\n\nRobert Gates, who served as defense secretary under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, as well as Bill Clinton appointees William Cohen and William Perry, were also among those documented in AAF's X thread as having ties to the U.S. military-industrial complex.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Report: Corrupt Congress Beat The Market Again In 2023\n\nA significant number of elected officials in Congress have a history of failing to disclose their trades until they are caught.\n\nThe 118th Congress traded more than $1 billion in 2023, with a third of trading members beating the fund that tracks S&P 500 growth - demonstrating once again that if you're privy to the insider information that's readily available to the nation's primary legislative body, it's not hard to beat the market.\n\nFinancial data platform Unusual Whales released a report detailing the stock purchasing and selling activity of the more than 100 members who disclosed their stock trading decisions.\n\nLegislators have tried and failed several times to ban their peers from trading stocks, a stipulation that 86 percent of U.S. voters support. The lucrative lure of bullish and bearish ebb and flow, however, has proven too great for Congress to cut it off.\n\nSuch was the case in 2023 which, for Congress, was marked by selling more than buying.\n\nMembers technically traded less in 2023 than they did in the past few years, with close to 11,000 transactions. The number of elected members of Congress trading also declined last year, to 115.\n\nUnusual Whales concluded that lagging participation from serial congressional traders like Rep. Nancy Pelosi, who infamously profits millions from her and her husband's shares, was likely a campaign strategy since voters \"vigorously\" keep an eye on members and their trading activity.\n\n\"A general rule I've found is that if they're up for re-election in 2024, then they've severely decreased and/or stopped their trading activity in the last year,\" the report states.\n\nEven though Pelosi significantly reduced her share activity in 2023, she still raked in big gains from several of her favorite NASDAQ participants including Crowdstrike, Tesla, Apple, and Microsoft.\n\nOverall, profitability on the shares that did exchange hands, including on Congress's \"many unusual trades and conflicts,\" was on par with previous years.\n\n\"Many of the large portfolio gains are members who are holding unrealized gains in stocks like NVDA, or META, or other tech stocks,\" the report states.\n\nDemocrats had a leg up on their Republican colleagues by what Unusual Whales called a \"massive margin.\" While Republican members were up 18 percent from previous years, Democrats saw a 31 percent increase in stock returns.\n\nSome members \"disclosed more stock trades than legislative votes.\" Democrat Rep. Ro Khanna, who sits on the House Armed Services and House Oversight and Accountability committees, disclosed the most stock market purchases for 2023 at 1,589, and more than $25 million in stock sales.\n\nThe next highest stock trading activity came from Republican Rep. Michael McCaul, a member of the House Foreign Affairs and House Homeland Security committees, who bought more than 140 technology stocks and sold more than $42 million worth of shares in technology, health care, and other sectors.\n\nDemocrat Rep. Josh Gottheimer, who sits on the House Intelligence and House Financial Services committees, recorded 91 technology stock purchases.\n\nIn the Senate, Republicans Tommy Tuberville and Markwayne Mullin purchased dozens of stocks across multiple sectors. Tuberville also sold $1.7 million in technology stocks and $1.2 in basic material stocks. Republican Sen. Rick Scott sold another $7 million in technology stocks.\n\nAcross the political aisle, Democrat Sens. John Hickenlooper and Richard Blumenthal sold $1.7 million and $1.5 million in communication services stocks, respectively.\n\nThe committees known for regulating the health care, financial, and technology sectors also purchased and sold stocks traded in those same sectors.\n\nIn the House, members of the Oversight and Accountability and Armed Services committees purchased hundreds of stocks worth tens of millions of dollars at the same time that they held hearings and meetings about the future of the industries where they acquired shares. Similarly, members on those same committees collectively sold more than 1,000 stocks in the health care, financial, and technology sectors for more than $62 million.\n\nIn the Senate, members of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee combined with members of the Armed Services, Veterans' Affairs, and Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry committees purchased millions in healthcare, financial services, and technology stocks. They, along with members of the Environment and Public Works, Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Aging, and Budget committees, also sold millions of shares.\n\nNot only did members make millions trading stocks, but they also raked in financial reward for resuming options trading.\n\n\"You read that right, Congress is once again buying leveraged positions on equities they hold. In fact, in 2023 US Congress traded more options than they did in 2022 AND 2021!\" the report notes. \"Some notable highlights here, Josh Gottheimer traded, and this is no exaggeration, NEARLY $150 MILLION (!!!!) of option contracts in 2023. This was often done while Congress was in session.\"\n\nThe $1 billion in exchanges calculated by Unusual Whales is already a jarring number, but it may not even represent the totality of congressional trades in 2023. A significant number of elected officials in the upper and lower chambers have a history of failing to disclose their trades until they are caught .\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Tuberville Is Right To Hold The Line Against The Pentagon's Taxpayer-Funded Abortions\n\nTuberville is blocking the promotions of senior military officers until the Pentagon reverses its policy subsidizing abortions.\n\nAmerica's military is facing a major recruiting crisis and growing threats from China and other belligerents. Yet the Biden administration is pushing taxpayer-funded abortions, among other woke agenda items, that are rightfully fueling fears that a politicized Pentagon won't be able to defend our country.\n\nWhether it's climate change, subsidizing abortions, or the woke trio of diversity, equity, and inclusion, the Defense Department's top brass is in lockstep with the radical left's political agenda. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is overseeing these sweeping changes and harming our military's readiness as a result.\n\nToo few political leaders are standing up to challenge this damaging agenda. Fortunately, Sen. Tommy Tuberville, a Republican from Alabama, isn't shying away from the fight.\n\nOver the past several months, Tuberville has blocked the promotions of senior military officers, refusing to budge until the Pentagon reverses its policy subsidizing abortions. He's taking heat from Democrats and Republicans, but he's fully within his rights and consistent with his duties and responsibility as a senator to withhold consent as he demands changes from Pentagon leadership.\n\nLet's be absolutely clear: The Pentagon's new abortion policy has everything to do with activist politics and nothing to do with Congress's obligation to raise and maintain armed forces to provide for the common defense.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court decision in Dobbs , Biden declared his intent to further his radical pro-abortion agenda through every means possible. In February, the Defense Department heeded his directive, circumventing Congress and issuing new policies that allow taxpayer funds to pay for abortions and to indemnify DOD staff who may violate state criminal protections of unborn life.\n\nTuberville and a growing number of conservative lawmakers, recognize this policy for what it is: an abusive use of political power. Austin's action is clearly illegal. It's also immoral.\n\nAs the Biden administration and the Defense Department well know, there is a proper and legal way to make new policies. Congress annually considers a National Defense Authorization Act, and there is one awaiting action now. The NDAA is the appropriate venue to make policy for the DOD.\n\nCongress too often cedes its authority to the executive branch, and Tuberville is right to insist on a debate in the House and Senate. Democrats and the Biden administration know they'll lose that debate, as American taxpayers have firmly rejected the idea of government-subsidized abortions.\n\nThirty years ago, when the military faced another crisis, members of Congress took steps similar to what Tuberville is doing now. In the early 1990s, senators held up hundreds of Naval officer promotions after the Tailhook fiasco. They did it not only to officers who were directly involved in the stuff at the hotel in Las Vegas, but also others in the aviation community across the Navy, pending the full NCIS investigation.\n\nIn that case, Congress wanted to make sure the Navy was being truthful and transparent. In this case, it is about the Defense Department's respecting the rule of law.\n\nIn recent weeks, Austin and past defense secretaries have fired off missives warning of readiness problems. How much Tuberville's hold affects readiness is hotly debated. Here is what cannot be debated: The greatest threat to military readiness is the actions of a commander-in-chief who imposes unlawful policies and undermines the sanctity of civil-military relations that are the bedrock of well-functioning armed forces. He should be ashamed to put a political agenda ahead of the purpose and mission of the armed forces and the support and well-being of those that serve.\n\nRather than focusing on confronting serious challenges such as the rise of China and its hegemonic ambitions, Biden and Austin have unnecessarily dragged the military into the middle of a divisive political and social issue and attempted to co-opt military resources in furtherance of an unrelated, partisan, ideological agenda.\n\nIndeed, Tuberville has a case to make that readiness is too important to ignore as part of this debate.\n\nEach year, The Heritage Foundation publishes an \"Index of U.S. Military Strength\" to gauge the U.S. military's ability to perform its missions. This year, for the first time, it ranks the military as weak and at growing risk of not being able to meet the demands of defending America's vital national interests.\n\nThe significant decline in the propensity to serve among America's youth is one of the major problems. Increased political polarization and the perception of the military as a \"woke\" institution is a significant factor.\n\nIt's time for our military to get back to doing the nation's business and stop imposing a woke agenda on our military. There is a war in Europe, a rising and threatening China, and an open border.\n\nAmerica is a global power with global interests and responsibilities. We can't afford a military distracted by politics. The quickest way to make this right is for Austin to immediately rescind his radical abortion policy.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

      "text": "45 Senate Democrats Kill Legislation Keeping Men Out Of Women's Sports\n\nOn Monday, 45 Senate Democrats effectively killed federal legislation aimed at preventing trans-identifying males from unfairly competing against female athletes. The party-line vote was 51-45, with Sens. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., and Peter Welch, D-Vt, not voting.\n\n\"45 Democratic Senators voted NO on Protecting Women & Girls in Sports,\" former NCAA swimmer Riley Gaines wrote on X. \"Never, ever let them gaslight you into thinking Democrats care about 'women's rights'...\"\n\nKnown as the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2025 , the proposed legislation sought to alter the Education Amendments of 1972 by making it unlawful for entities who receive federal dollars and facilitate, operate, and/or sponsor \"athletic programs or activities to permit a person whose sex is male to participate in an athletic program or activity that is designated for women or girls.\" The bill specifies that sex \"shall be recognized based solely on a person's reproductive biology and genetics at birth.\"\n\nMonday's procedural vote required support from at least 60 senators to move the bill forward to a final vote in the Senate. A companion measure previously passed (218-206) in the House of Representatives in January, with only two Democrats voting alongside all Republicans in support.\n\nThe bill seemingly sought to codify protections included in an executive order signed by Trump last month. That directive vowed to strip federal funding for educational programs that allow woman-pretending males to compete against female athletes.\n\nAccording to the New York Post , a recent New York Times/Ipsos poll found that the vast majority of Americans (79 percent) - including two-thirds of self-identified Democrats or leaning-Democrats (67 percent) - believe that men who identify as women should not be allowed to participate in female athletics.\n\n[READ: NCAA Had The Power To Keep Men Out Of Women's Sports This Whole Time ]\n\nResponding to Monday's vote, Senate bill sponsor and Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., noted how \"at least now the American people know the truth\" about where Democrats stand when it comes to protecting female athletes.\n\n\"Even after @realdonaldtrump's landslide election, Democrats STILL support men competing in women's sports,\" Tuberville wrote on X. \"This is far from over. I'll NEVER stop fighting to protect women and girls.\"\n\nIncidents exposing the dangers and unfairness of allowing trans-identifying men to participate in women's sports have generated nationwide attention in recent years.\n\nLast year, for example, numerous collegiate women's volleyball teams forfeited matches against San Jose State University to protest the allowed participation of SJSU's Blaire Fleming, a trans-identifying male.\n\nVideo of SJSU's match against San Diego State University in October reportedly showed Fleming spiking the ball in the face of his female opponent. According to the New York Post , the female player \"was knocked down after the hit, and the crowd audibly gasped.\"\n\nFleming and SJSU ultimately lost the Mountain West Conference championship game to Colorado State.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Don't Ask Tommy Tuberville Why The Senate's Not Voting On Military Nominations. Ask Chuck Schumer\n\nNew York Democrat Sen. Chuck Schumer loves to lament how Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville's protest of the Pentagon's abortion policy supposedly \"weaken[s] our national security.\" So, why isn't he using his power as Senate majority leader to do anything about it?\n\nSince March, Tuberville has used his position on the Senate Armed Services Committee to slow down military personnel moves requiring Senate confirmation to protest the Pentagon's use of taxpayer money to cover service members' travel expenses to get abortions. To be clear, Tuberville is not blocking votes but is forcing the committee to vote on each nomination individually rather than voting \"en masse on large numbers of nominations.\"\n\nDespite fomenting baseless claims that Tuberville's protest is putting \"American security in jeopardy,\" Schumer could easily utilize existing Senate procedures to bring President Biden's military nominations to the floor for a confirmation vote.\n\nAs noted by The Daily Signal's Ryan Walker, many \"non-controversial nominees\" are confirmed by the Senate via \"a request for unanimous consent,\" which requires the unanimous support of the upper chamber's 100 senators. While refusal to consent by a single senator would initiate a \"hold\" on any one nominee, it wouldn't \"doom\" the nomination altogether.\n\nA hold \"just means the majority leader will have to use Senate floor time ... to confirm the nominee,\" Walker wrote. \"After years of escalating attacks on applying the filibuster to nomination votes, all it takes to confirm most nominees is a simple majority vote and two hours of debate. If the majority leader stacks the votes properly, he can confirm four nominees in a single day, although Schumer rarely has shown such urgency.\"\n\nIf Tuberville's protest is endangering national security, as Schumer claims, then why isn't the latter using every available tool at his disposal to do something about it?\n\nIn all likelihood, the Senate's leading Democrat would rather play politics than actually staff the military he contends will falter without Biden's \" woke \" nominees to run it. If military readiness was his priority, Schumer wouldn't have kept the Senate on summer vacation for several weeks or sent senators home early last week; he would be forcing votes on military nominations every day.\n\nInstead, Schumer will keep running to the nearest camera to feign outrage about pending military nominations, all the while possessing the power to do something about it.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

Trump. They want President Trump's agenda now. I intend to do my part to ensure he has the people around him so we can work and work together.\"\n\n\"Now's the time to put up or shut up,\" Tuberville later added. \"We have to get President Trump, his team I mean, to end of the day and they can't be deep state. They can't be shadow government. They have to be people that believe in this country. I promise you, we're not going to put anybody I'm not going to vote for anybody that's not qualified that I don't think will work hard for the people of Alabama.\"\n\nTuberville specifically praised on the Senate floor Pete Hegseth for Secretary of Defense, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for Secretary of Health and Human Services, and Matt Gaetz for Attorney General. Speaking from the Senate floor in front of a sign reading, \"Number of Democrats who voted AGAINST Biden's 21 Cabinet Nominees: 0,\" Tuberville argued that the criticism of these nominees is rooted in political bias rather than qualification concerns.\n\n\"Ask yourself: why are my Democratic colleagues, the media, and the establishment losing their minds over these highly qualified nominees?\" Tuberville asked. \"It's because of the dislike for President Trump, the America First agenda, and nearly 80 million Americans who voted to send him back to the White House.\"\n\n\"Panic has set in at the DOJ, the intelligence community, and the entire DC swamp,\" he added. \"They're finding out, as Barack Obama said, that elections have consequences.\"\n\nShortly after winning the presidential election, Trump announced a series of rapid-fire cabinet appointments. While some have been widely accepted, a number of high-profile nominations have been met with significant backlash. Gaetz's nomination as Attorney General, in particular, has faced criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Gaetz was subjected to a federal sex trafficking investigation which was closed without charges being issued. Tuberville expressed support for Gaetz, dismissing the criticisms as rumors. \"We're going to look at facts not rumors,\" Tuberville said on Fox News on Tuesday. \"There's more rumors up there going around about Matt Gaetz and Pete Hegseth...I'm looking forward to backing all of them as long as the facts are there.\" Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.'s nomination to lead the Department of Health and Human Services has also sparked resistance, particularly among Senate Republicans, due to his pro-abortion stance. Tuberville, a member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, stated that Kennedy's position on abortion is an issue he plans to address.

In this moment of rapidly evolving security environments and intense competition, he is risking our ability to ensure that the United States Armed Forces remain the greatest fighting force in the history of the world.\" Tuberville responded to other concerns over military readiness earlier this week and said, \"If I thought it was having just a small part of an effect on national security, I wouldn't be doing this. I'm a military person.\" \"We have fires all over the world. One of biggest fires is in this country within. We're turning into a woke military, we're turning into a military that's soft, that's dropped its regulations, its dropped its formulations to how we take recruits,\" Tuberville continued. Service members have been sounding the alarm that \"woke\" messaging coming from the military has been depriving it of new recruits. In a report from the US Air Force, Franchetti and other female leaders in the military discussed the benefits of military service. Franchetti said, that women bring needed skills that the military needs in order \"to be the world's most formidable fighting force, ready to deter, fight and win whenever the nation needs.\"\n\nPowered by The Post Millennial CMSTM Comments\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.

I don't think that they should. And I actually think that his testimony is going to hurt with any reasonable juror, and hopefully we have a few of those.\"\n\n\"Does any reasonable, sensible person believe anything that Michael Cohen says? I don't think that they should. And I actually think that his testimony is going to hurt with any reasonable juror, and hopefully we have a few of those.\"\n\nSenator JD Vance criticized New York DA Alvin Bragg's \"star witness\" in the Trump falsified business records case, former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, on Monday. Vance said he thinks Cohen will hurt the prosecution's case and offered support for President Trump.\n\n\"First of all, Michael Cohen is the prosecution's star witness. This guy is a convicted felon who admitted in his testimony that he secretly recorded his former employer, that he only did it once, allegedly, and that this was supposed to help Donald Trump,\" Vance told the press. \"Does any reasonable, sensible person believe anything that Michael Cohen says? I don't think that they should. And I actually think that his testimony is going to hurt with any reasonable juror, and hopefully we have a few of those,\" he added. Vance continued to criticize the gag order placed on Trump by Judge Juan Merchan, saying, \"The thing that the President is prevented from saying, which is a disgrace, is that every single person involved in this prosecution is practically a democratic political operative.\" \"The judge inside, his daughter is making millions of dollars running against Donald Trump, raising money for Donald Trump's political opponents. The number three person in the Department of Justice, Biden's Department of Justice, left to become a local prosecutor to go after Donald Trump. And of course, there's Alvin Bragg, a Soros-funded prosecutor who promised to go after Donald Trump and now is doing exactly that,\" he added. \"Now look, whether you love Donald Trump, whether you like Donald Trump, or whether you're a Democrat or don't care about politics, what's going on inside that courtroom is a threat to American democracy, ladies and gentlemen. We cannot have a country where you get to prosecute your political opponents instead of persuading voters,\" Vance added. \"Joe Biden's entire strategy is to try to distract from inflation at home and war overseas with this sham trial. I just want to live in a reasonable country where we try to persuade voters in our politics. We don't try to throw our political opponents in jail. So this is a disgrace. And I wanted to be here to show some support for my friend.\" Vance appeared at the Manhattan courthouse on Monday alongside Senator Tommy Tuberville and Rep. Nicole Malliotakis to show their support for Trump. Vance called out Cohen for his testimony, writing, \"Cohen can't remember how old his son is or how old he was when he started to work for Trump but I'm sure he remembers extremely small details from years ago!\" \"Michael Cohen admitting he secretly recorded his employer. Just totally normal conduct, right? The best part is he said he did it only once and only for Trump's benefit. A standup guy!\"\n\n\"First of all, Michael Cohen is the prosecution's star witness.
