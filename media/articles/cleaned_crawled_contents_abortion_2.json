      "text": "Why we may never how many deaths are being caused by abortion bans across the U.S.\n\nIn states with abortion bans, ProPublica has found, pregnant women have bled to death, succumbed to fatal infections and wound up in morgues with what medical examiners recorded were \"products of conception\" still in their bodies.\n\nThese are the very kinds of cases state maternal mortality review committees are supposed to delve into, determining why they happened and how to stop them from happening again.\n\nBut panels in states that have recently imposed strict bans on abortion have done little to uncover whether the laws are contributing to maternal deaths, including tracking delays in care for pregnancy complications and making these problems known, a ProPublica investigation shows.\n\nIn fact, we found that in a few states, political leaders who backed the bans have stood in the way of measuring their consequences.\n\nThey have dismissed committees, slowing down their work. They have weeded out members openly critical of abortion bans and supportive of transparency.\n\nTexas has gone as far as to legally prohibit its committee from reviewing deaths that are considered abortion-related. This could include some miscarriage care, health officials told ProPublica.\n\nIn two deaths of Texas women that ProPublica investigated, Porsha Ngumezi and Josseli Barnica had already miscarried when they were given misoprostol to help complete the process. The committee does not review cases that involve that drug because it's also used for abortions, said committee chair Dr. Carla Ortique: \"If they received medication, if they received any procedure, we will not get those records.\" Chris Van Deusen, the spokesperson at the Texas Department of State Health Services, would not say whether Ngumezi's and Barnica's deaths would be reviewed.\n\nOther state committees have not made changes to systematically examine the role abortion bans are playing in maternal deaths, officials acknowledged, though some said they might note it as a contributing factor if it appears in the records. \"If the committee discovers a trend that raises a particular concern, it could decide to include that information in its reports,\" South Carolina officials said.\n\nSome noted that they follow guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and that those recommendations don't direct committees to consider abortion access or delays in abortion care. Indiana's law directs committee members to determine whether the person who died had an abortion and whether that contributed to their death; it does not focus on delays in access to abortion care.\n\nStates can direct their committees to look at any important health issue; Texas' panel added new questions to its process to help capture the role of the coronavirus pandemic in deaths , for example.\n\nProPublica asked governors in 15 states with strict abortion bans whether committees should examine the impact of the laws on maternal deaths; most did not respond. None directly answered the question or advocated for specific changes. ( Read their responses here. )\n\n\"We're not acting like we want to know the answer to this question. And that concerns me,\" said Caitlin Myers, an economics researcher at Middlebury College who is studying the impact of abortion access on maternal health. \"However you feel about the ethics of abortion, we should want to understand how these policies are affecting women's health.\"\n\nExperts interviewed by ProPublica say state maternal mortality review committees are uniquely well-positioned to examine the impacts of abortion bans on maternal health. The panels are often made up of practicing OB-GYNs, cardiologists and nurses, and they can also include doulas, medical examiners and experts in mental health, substance abuse and domestic violence. They review summaries of medical records to determine whether deaths were preventable and to identify contributing factors. This allows researchers and government officials to see patterns and come up with ways to improve the country's poor maternal health outcomes.\n\nCommittees are not systematically tracking an issue that came up throughout ProPublica's reporting on deaths in states with abortion bans: delays and denials of procedures, like dilation and curettage, which are used to empty the uterus during miscarriages to avoid hemorrhage and infection. The procedures are also used for abortions, and doctors face prison time for violating restrictions. Women have died after they could not access these procedures, ProPublica found.\n\nNevaeh Crain, a teenager whose organs were failing , was made to wait 90 minutes for a second ultrasound to confirm fetal demise. Amber Thurman suffered for 20 hours while sepsis spread. And Barnica was subjected to serious infection risks for 40 hours while doctors monitored the fetal heartbeat until it stopped.\n\nStudying such delays \"needs to be a part of these kinds of reviews,\" said Dr. Daniel Grossman, a leading reproductive health care researcher and professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California San Francisco.\n\nGrossman has collected dozens of accounts from health care providers detailing substandard treatment and poor outcomes in states that banned abortion. But he and others recognize who is ultimately in charge of state maternal mortality review committees.\n\n\"I can't imagine the states that passed restrictions saying, 'Now we want to know if that caused any deaths,'\" said Eugene Declercq, a professor at Boston University's School of Public Health who serves on Massachusetts' maternal mortality review committee. \"The clinicians and the public health people might want to know, but the political leaders would be aghast.\"\n\nEven if they start to pursue such answers, states are years behind in reviewing deaths, ProPublica found in a survey of 18 states with the most restrictive abortion laws. Most have not finished reviewing deaths from 2022, the year most bans became effective after the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion. Two states are still reviewing 2021 deaths. Three states - Florida, North Dakota and South Dakota - did not respond.\n\nReviews typically lag years behind deaths because of the time it takes state health department employees to learn of cases, track down records and wrestle them free from hospitals and doctors before they summarize and redact them for review. \"We have one person in the entire state that has to collect all that data. Literally one,\" said Dr. Stacie Geller, a founding member of Illinois' committee. \"I live in fear of her retiring.\"\n\nThe CDC, which has pumped tens of millions of dollars into helping states establish these committees and standardizing their work, has tried to reduce the backlog by setting a goal for committees that receive funding to review cases within two years. However, there's no way to compel states to do so, and not all have caught up.\n\nSuch lags matter more in places where there has been a seismic shift in abortion access, experts told ProPublica, because there isn't a full understanding yet of the laws' effect on maternal health care.\n\nMarian Knight leads the United Kingdom's maternal mortality review program, widely seen as the world's best. She said if there were a major legal shift like this in her country, she and her colleagues would adapt to track the impact in close to real time. \"I would be monitoring that in the same way as I did during COVID, where we were analyzing data weekly and feeding it in,\" Knight said.\n\nAs of last month, only five states - Iowa, West Virginia, Indiana, Georgia and Tennessee - had finished reviewing cases from 2022, ProPublica found. None had yet published a report on its findings for that year.\n\nSeven other states were still examining 2022 cases: Alabama, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Mississippi, Missouri, Arkansas and Louisiana.\n\nIdaho, Texas and Kentucky had not yet started looking at cases from that year.\n\nEven though North Dakota did not respond to ProPublica's survey, reporters found that its committee, formed by state legislation in 2021, has never met to review cases, according to two members.\n\nIn some instances, state officials are responsible for delays.\n\nIdaho disbanded its committee in summer 2023 after a conservative group argued it was unnecessary and attacked members for recommending that the state expand Medicaid for postpartum patients. The move froze the group's work until last month, when a reconstituted, smaller committee met for the first time. Two members who had spoken out against the ban's impacts on maternal health, and are suing the state over it, were not brought back onto the committee. The state is defending its anti-abortion laws; the Idaho Attorney General has said he \"will not stop protecting life in Idaho.\"\n\nIt is unclear how long Georgia's reviews will be stalled after state officials dismissed its committee last month, citing a violation of confidentiality rules after ProPublica reported on internal documents in stories about two preventable deaths examined by the group. The Georgia Department of Public Health said in a letter about the dismissal that this would not result in any delays to the committee's responsibilities.\n\nIn a move that confused maternal research experts, Texas' committee said it would not review data from 2022 and 2023 and begin with reports from 2024 to get a more \"contemporary\" view of deaths. The committee has skipped years in the past to address gaps, and at its recent meeting, Ortique, the chair, said that the decision had \"absolutely no nefarious intent.\" The period it plans to skip includes two of the preventable deaths ProPublica reported.\n\nDr. Romy Ghosh, an OB-GYN in Austin, Texas, pleaded with the maternal mortality review committee at a public meeting this month to reconsider its decision to skip those years.\n\n\"There's been a lot of fear in my patients. They wonder, can I save their life if something goes wrong?\" she said. \"I think that this information will tell us there's either nothing to worry about or it will be damning.\"\n\nBetween the decision to skip years and the legal prohibition against examining cases involving abortion-related care, it appears Texas will not review any of the three preventable deaths ProPublica identified.\n\nThere is a limit to how much committee members can push back against state leaders.\n\nWhen Texas delayed publishing its maternal mortality report in 2022, an election year, then-committee member Nakeenya Wilson, a community advocate, spoke out, saying \"withholding data that does not make us look good is dishonorably burying those women.\"\n\nThe next session, Texas lawmakers passed a bill changing the requirements for the position that Wilson held, effectively removing her from the committee. State officials appointed Dr. Ingrid Skop, a Texas OB-GYN who is the vice president of a prominent anti-abortion organization.\n\nWilson said maternal mortality review committees must be free to speak candidly about patterns they see in maternal deaths and to release information in a timely fashion.\n\n\"If it's not the committee, then who is it?\" she said. \"There has to be increased accountability.\"\n\nAudrey Dutton , Anna Maria Barry-Jester , Lizzie Presser and Amy Yurkanin contributed reporting."

      "text": "7 of 10 states backed abortion rights - but little to change yet\n\nVoters backed abortion rights in seven of the 10 states where the issue appeared on ballots Tuesday - at first glance, seemingly reshaping the nation's patchwork of abortion rules.\n\nColorado, Maryland, Montana, and New York - states where abortions are already permitted at least until fetal viability - all will add abortion protections to their state constitutions. Nevada voters also favored protections and can enshrine them by passing the measure again in the next general election.\n\nFlorida and South Dakota voters, meanwhile, did not pass abortion rights amendments, and Nebraska voters essentially affirmed the state's existing ban on abortions after the first trimester, while rejecting a measure that would have protected abortions later into pregnancy.\n\nThe biggest changes came in Arizona, where, in 2022, abortion was banned after 15 weeks, and in Missouri, which has had a near-total ban. Voters in those states approved constitutional amendments to protect abortion rights through fetal viability, opening the door to overturning those states' restrictions and increasing access to abortion services.\n\nBut when Alison Dreith, director of strategic partnerships at the Midwest Access Coalition abortion fund, which has helped people from Missouri and 27 other states get abortions, was asked before the results came in how her organization was preparing for logistical changes, she said simply: \"We're not.\"\n\nThat's because actual access to abortion in the country remains largely unchanged, despite the Nov. 5 results. The web of preexisting state laws on abortions will likely remain in place while they are contested in court, a process that could take months or even years.\n\nDreith said she doesn't think many voters understood all that before heading to the polls. \"It might not get them the results that they want, especially immediately,\" Dreith said.\n\nFurther complicating these state results: The election wins of Donald Trump as president-elect and Republicans in the U.S. Senate, giving their party control, have raised the question of whether a national abortion ban will be on the table. Republicans had demurred on the campaign trail. Such a law would take time to enact, too.\n\nThe abortion landscape changed dramatically when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned federal abortion protections with its 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization . That left abortion rules up to the states, prompting 14 to enact bans with few exceptions and several others to limit access.\n\nThe ruling also led to a raft of ballot measures: Voters in 16 states have now weighed in on abortion-related ballot measures. Thirteen have favored access to abortions in some way. And while the Florida amendment to protect abortion access failed to meet the necessary 60% threshold to pass, it did receive a majority of the vote.\n\nAbortion opponents such as Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America praised the votes rejecting amendments in Florida and South Dakota and lamented the amendments that passed in states, such as Missouri, with restrictive abortion rules and bans.\n\n\"We mourn the lives that will be lost,\" Sue Liebel, its director of state affairs, wrote in a statement. \"The disappointing results are a reminder that human rights battles are not won overnight.\"\n\nStates that passed abortion rights amendments in 2022 and 2023 offer a view into the lengthy legal road ahead for abortion policies to take effect. It took nine months after Ohio voters added abortion protections to their state's constitution for a judge to strike down the state's 24-hour waiting period for abortions. And some of Michigan's abortion restrictions, including its own 24-hour waiting period, were suspended only in June, 19 months after Michigan voters approved their state's abortion rights amendment.\n\nMissouri has an extensive set of such rules. Legal abortions had almost ceased even before the state's ban was triggered by the Dobbs decision. Over three decades, state lawmakers passed a series of restrictions on abortion providers that made it increasingly difficult to operate there. By 2018, only one clinic was providing abortions in the state, a Planned Parenthood affiliate in St. Louis. Anticipating further tightened restrictions, it opened a large facility 20 miles away in Illinois in 2019.\n\nThose laws that reduced the number of recorded abortions in the state from 5,772 in 2011 down to 150 in 2021 remain on the books, despite the newly passed amendment protecting abortion rights.\n\nAbortion services often get talked about like a light switch, according to Kimya Forouzan , principal state policy adviser at the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that supports abortion rights. But the infrastructure needed to provide abortions is not so easy to turn on and off.\n\nNorth Dakota's abortion ban was repealed by the courts in September , for example, but the lone provider of abortions in the state before the ban took effect has no plans to return, having moved operations a five-minute drive away to Minnesota.\n\nAnd even when clinics quickly ramp up services, the legal wrangling over abortion rules can lead to policy whiplash, with patients caught in the middle.\n\nGeorgia's law banning most abortions after about six weeks spent years in the courts after it passed in 2019. During two brief stretches after the Dobbs decision, once in 2022 and again in 2024, court rulings meant that clinics in the state could provide abortions up to 22 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nDemand for abortion surged during those times, and clinics were able to resume offering services quickly. But when state courts later said the ban should be enforced, those windows slammed shut. During the 2022 period, some patients scheduled for abortions were left sitting in waiting rooms, according to Megan Cohen, medical director of Planned Parenthood Southeast.\n\nThe various abortion rights amendments that passed Nov. 5 could also face challenges.\n\nIn Missouri, the state's Republican-dominated legislature has attempted to ignore voter-passed amendments before. After Missouri voters added Medicaid expansion to the state's constitution in 2020, the state legislature refused to fund the program until a judge ordered the state to start accepting applications, prompting significant delays in enrollment.\n\nThe state's presumptive House speaker, Republican Jon Patterson , has said the legislature must respect the outcome of the Nov. 5 ballot measure vote, while others have pledged to bring the issue to voters again.\n\nIn the meantime, Dreith of the Midwest Access Coalition said people seeking abortions in the Midwest will do what they often do in the region for everything from groceries to health care: drive.\n\n\"We expect that the resources we need are not in our communities,\" Dreith said, \"and I think that's been helpful to us in this crisis.\"\n\nKFF Health News' Renuka Rayasam and Sam Whitehead in Georgia and Arielle Zionts in South Dakota contributed to this report .\n\nSubscribe to KFF Health News' free Morning Briefing."

      "text": "What the Bible actually says about abortion may surprise you\n\nIn the days since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade , which had established the constitutional right to an abortion, some Christians have cited the Bible to argue why this decision should either be celebrated or lamented. But here's the problem: This 2,000-year-old text says nothing about abortion.\n\nAs a university professor of biblical studies , I am familiar with faith-based arguments Christians use to back up views of abortion, whether for or against. Many people seem to assume the Bible discusses the topic head-on, which is not the case.\n\nAbortions were known and practiced in biblical times, although the methods differed significantly from modern ones. The second-century Greek physician Soranus , for example, recommended fasting, bloodletting, vigorous jumping and carrying heavy loads as ways to end a pregnancy.\n\nSoranus' treatise on gynecology acknowledged different schools of thought on the topic. Some medical practitioners forbade the use of any abortive methods. Others permitted them, but not in cases in which they were intended to cover up an adulterous liaison or simply to preserve the mother's good looks.\n\nIn other words, the Bible was written in a world in which abortion was practiced and viewed with nuance. Yet the Hebrew and Greek equivalents of the word \"abortion\" do not appear in either the Old or New Testament of the Bible. That is, the topic simply is not directly mentioned.\n\nThe absence of an explicit reference to abortion, however, has not stopped its opponents or proponents from looking to the Bible for support of their positions.\n\nAbortion opponents turn to several biblical texts that, taken together, seem to suggest that human life has value before birth. For example, the Bible opens by describing the creation of humans \" in the image of God \": a way to explain the value of human life, presumably even before people are born. Likewise, the Bible describes several important figures, including the prophets Jeremiah and Isaiah and the Christian Apostle Paul , as having being called to their sacred tasks since their time in the womb. Psalm 139 asserts that God \" knit me together in my mother's womb .\"\n\nHowever, abortion opponents are not the only ones who can appeal to the Bible for support. Supporters can point to other biblical texts that would seem to count as evidence in their favor.\n\nExodus 21 , for example, suggests that a pregnant woman's life is more valuable than the fetus's. This text describes a scenario in which men who are fighting strike a pregnant woman and cause her to miscarry. A monetary fine is imposed if the woman suffers no other harm beyond the miscarriage. However, if the woman suffers additional harm, the perpetrator's punishment is to suffer reciprocal harm, up to life for life.\n\nThere are other biblical texts that seem to celebrate the choices that women make for their bodies, even in contexts in which such choices would have been socially shunned. The fifth chapter of the Gospel of Mark , for example, describes a woman with a gynecological ailment that has made her bleed continuously taking a great risk: She reaches out to touch Jesus' cloak in hopes that it will heal her, even though the touch of a menstruating woman was believed to cause ritual contamination. However, Jesus commends her choice and praises her faith.\n\nSimilarly, in the Gospel of John, Jesus' follower Mary seemingly wastes resources by pouring an entire container of costly ointment on his feet and using her own hair to wipe them - but he defends her decision to break the social taboo around touching an unrelated man so intimately.\n\nIn the response to the Supreme Court's decision, Christians on both sides of the partisan divide have appealed to any number of texts to assert that their particular brand of politics is biblically backed . However, if they claim the Bible specifically condemns or approves of abortion, they are skewing the textual evidence to fit their position.\n\nOf course, Christians can develop their own faith-based arguments about modern political issues, whether or not the Bible speaks directly to them. But it is important to recognize that although the Bible was written at a time when abortion was practiced, it never directly addresses the issue.\n\nMelanie A.

      "text": "New abortion-rights measures in 7 states could trigger legal, legislative challenges\n\nAttendees cheer during a Missourians for Constitutional Freedom rally after the campaign turned in more than 380,000 signatures for its initiative petition to enshrine abortion rights in Missouri's constitution. Voters in seven states, including Missouri, chose to protect or expand access to abortion through ballot initiatives in Tuesday's election. (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent)\n\nWidespread support for abortion rights continued to defy partisan labels in Tuesday's election, but several of the ballot measures that voters approved may face legal and legislative challenges in the coming months. And supporters worry that federal efforts could eventually override the state measures.\n\nVoters in seven states - including deep-red Missouri and Montana - chose to protect or expand access to abortion through ballot initiatives.\n\n\"This won't be the last time Missourians vote on so-called 'reproductive rights,'\" Missouri Republican state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, who opposed the ballot measure, wrote in a press release . \"I will do everything in my power to ensure that vote happens.\"\n\nIn Missouri and Arizona , the ballot measures will expand abortion access beyond what state laws currently allow. Though those constitutional amendments are set to go into effect in the coming weeks, abortion is unlikely to become immediately accessible in those states because abortion-rights advocates will have to go to court to overturn existing laws.\n\nIn addition, anti-abortion groups and their legislative allies in recent years have worked to undermine abortion protections through laws and court challenges based on concepts such as fetal personhood, parental rights and fetal viability. Those efforts could limit the impact of the new ballot measures.\n\nSupporters of the Missouri measure anticipate continued opposition. Mallory Schwartz, the executive director of Abortion Action Missouri, told a crowd celebrating on Tuesday night that \"anti-abortion, anti-democracy politicians are going to try to stomp us out,\" according to the Missouri Independent .\n\n\"They're going to try to fight us in court, and they're going to file new attacks in Jefferson City,\" Schwartz said.\n\nSome abortion-rights supporters worry that without a federal constitutional right to abortion, which the U.S. Supreme Court struck down in its 2022 Dobbs ruling, the new state-level protections are vulnerable to federal moves that could override them.\n\nAfter the Dobbs decision, the Biden administration took several steps to protect access to birth control, abortion medication and emergency abortion care at hospitals.\n\nBut Nourbese Flint, president of the abortion-rights group All* In Action Fund, said the incoming Trump administration could restrict access even in states that have abortion-rights measures on the books.\n\n- Nourbese Flint, president of the abortion-rights group All* In Action Fund\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has flip-flopped on abortion and other reproductive rights, bragging for years that his U.S. Supreme Court nominations led to the Dobbs decision - then telling Fox News viewers last month that some state abortion laws were \"too tough\" and would be \"redone.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, we are in a position where even if your state has passed great legislation, the actual, tangible access to medication abortion might be harder\" in the future, Flint said.\n\nSome anti-abortion groups want the Trump administration to enforce the Comstock Act, a long-dormant 1873 law they believe could be used to make it a federal crime to send or receive abortion pills in the mail.\n\nThe Trump administration also could reverse a current policy under the federal Food and Drug Administration that allows the mailing of abortion medication. And when the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a case earlier this year involving FDA regulation of the abortion medication mifepristone, it left the door open for future challenges. Meanwhile, some states have laws limiting access, such as requiring in-person physician visits for abortion medication, effectively barring patients from accessing it via telemedicine.\n\n\"I don't want people to think just because they voted 'yes' to protect reproductive rights there is going to be a magic wand to restore those rights,\" said Chris Melody Fields Figueredo, executive director of the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, which supports progressive ballot initiatives nationwide.\n\n\"They're going to have to double down and fight to make sure people are going to receive the reproductive care they need and deserve.\"\n\nIn addition to reliably red Missouri and Montana, voters on Tuesday also approved abortion-rights measures in presidential battlegrounds Arizona and Nevada and solidly blue Colorado, Maryland and New York. In Nevada, voters will have to approve the amendment again in 2026 for it to go into effect.\n\nBefore last week, voters in six states - including conservative Kansas and Kentucky - had endorsed abortion rights when presented with abortion-related ballot questions.\n\nBut Tuesday's election marked the first time since the fall of Roe v. Wade that abortion-rights ballot measures failed: Voters defeated proposed amendments in Nebraska and South Dakota. And in Florida, 57% of voters supported an abortion-rights amendment, but it fell short of the 60% supermajority required for passage.\n\nThe ballot measures in Arizona, Missouri and Montana establish the right to abortion up to \"fetal viability.\" It's a term that lacks an exact medical or legal definition, and thanks to medical advances over the years, viability has moved earlier in pregnancy. Today, it's generally considered to be around 23 or 24 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n\"'Fetal viability' is not a legal term,\" said Dale Margolin Cecka, director of the Family Violence Litigation Clinic at Albany Law School and a former Georgia assistant attorney general. \"Even in states that now have amended their constitutions [to permit abortion], I can foresee challenges to the 'fetal viability' aspect of those amendments.\"\n\nFor example, she said, state legislators could attempt to restrict abortions by defining \"fetal viability\" in state law in such a way that might create doubt in the minds of providers about whether a patient's pregnancy meets state requirements for a legal abortion.\n\nIn the days leading up to the election, Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody, a Republican, used the vagueness of the \"viability\" standard in Florida's proposed abortion amendment to ask the state's highest court to keep the measure off the ballot, though the court declined to do so.\n\nIn Montana, where abortion was already legal until fetal viability under a 1999 state Supreme Court ruling, the new constitutional amendment shores up that protection by defining fetal viability. The amendment says viability should be based on \"the good faith judgment of a treating health care professional and based on the particular facts of the case.\"\n\nThe concept of \"fetal personhood\" also could be used to circumvent state constitutional amendments on abortion. Long a cornerstone of the anti-abortion movement, fetal personhood is the idea that a fetus, embryo or fertilized egg has the same legal rights as a person who has been born. If state law considers fetuses to be people, the thinking goes, the abortion would be considered murder.\n\nMissouri state Rep. Brian Seitz, a Republican, told Stateline in July that he plans to introduce a fetal personhood bill in the upcoming legislative session that would grant \"unborn children\" the same rights as newborns. His hope was that the bill could protect embryos and fetuses regardless of whether Missourians passed a constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to abortion.\n\nCecka also expects to see state legislators continue testing abortion protections with so-called parental rights laws. Since Dobbs, conservative legislators in several states have filed parental consent bills to restrict access to abortion, birth control and other reproductive health care for people under age 18. Proponents argue such laws are needed to protect the rights of parents and to prevent other adults from persuading adolescents to get abortions.\n\nThe lawsuit filed last week by Missouri reproductive care providers to strike down several of Missouri's abortion restriction laws after passage of the constitutional amendment does not challenge the state's parental consent law.\n\nIn Cecka's view, abortion access remains at risk, even in states that have passed protective laws, unless federal protections are put in place.\n\n\"In red states where there's a strong enough push, the anti-reproductive freedom movement is a big machine with a deep bench, and they're ready to fight,\" she said.\n\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\n\nStateline is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

      "text": "What you should know about RFK Jr.'s views on abortion\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., U.S. President Trump's nominee to be secretary of Health and Human Services, testifies before a Senate Finance Committee confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., January 29, 2025.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's decision to tap Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the nation's top health agency has elicited criticism from abortion-rights supporters and opponents. Kennedy's confirmation hearing before the U.S. Senate Finance Committee began today at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services secretary oversees agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - crucial to gathering reproductive health data across the nation - and the Food and Drug Administration, the authority that under the Biden administration approved the first-over-the-counter birth control pill and loosened restrictions on mifepristone, an abortion medication.\n\nFormer HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra directed hospital officials that received Medicare funding to offer medically necessary abortions, even in states where abortion is banned. It's unclear what position the Trump administration will take on the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act , a federal law at the center of court battles over life-saving abortion care.\n\nKennedy, who is also a noted vaccine skeptic , supported abortion rights during his presidential bid, but he has been somewhat mum on the issue since joining Trump's circle.\n\nBefore dropping out of the race for the White House, Kennedy released a video in June about his abortion stance: \"Abortion has become a notoriously divisive issue in America, and many of my critics have painted me as some kind of extremist. But actually I support the emerging consensus in this country: it's that abortion should be legal up until a certain number of weeks and restricted thereafter,\" he said.\n\n\"I support the emerging consensus that abortion should be unrestricted up until a certain point. I believe that point should be when a baby is viable outside the womb,\" Kennedy added. Fetal viability is around 24 weeks of pregnancy, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists , which also \"strongly opposes policy makers defining viability or using viability as a basis to limit access to evidence-based care.\"\n\nA statement on Kennedy's campaign site said he would support legislation to restore Roe v. Wade: \"Abortion is a tragedy, but I don't trust the government to make these decisions for Americans. I'm for choice and medical freedom. We need to trust mothers to make the best decisions. We also need to give full support to mothers who want to bring babies to term.\"\n\nIn August 2023, he told NBC News that he would support a national 15-week or 21-week ban, but a spokesperson said he misheard the question.\n\nHis possible support for a federal ban has alarmed abortion-rights groups. \"RFK Jr. is an unfit, unqualified extremist who cannot be trusted to protect the health, safety, and reproductive freedom of American families,\" Mini Timmaraju, Reproductive Freedom for All's president and CEO, said in a statement .\n\nDespite his public stance on the issue, conservative senators who met with Kennedy last month said he is committed to anti-abortion policies. U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican on the Senate Health Committee scoping the nominee on Thursday, said Kennedy wants to reinstate a ban on Title X funding going to organizations that promote abortion. And U.S. Sen.

      "text": "Trump doesn't need Congress to make abortion effectively unavailable - here's how\n\nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump tried mightily to reassure abortion rights supporters, vowing he would not sign into law a nationwide abortion ban even if Congress sent him one.\n\nBut once he returns to the White House in January, Trump can make abortions difficult - or illegal -across the United States without Congress taking action at all.\n\nThe president-elect will have a variety of tools to restrict reproductive rights in general and abortion rights in particular, both directly from 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. and from the executive agencies he'll oversee. They include strategies he used during his first term, but also new ones that emerged in the wake of the Supreme Court's overturn of Roe v. Wade in 2022.\n\nThe Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment on this topic.\n\nBy far the most sweeping thing Trump could do without Congress would be to order the Justice Department to enforce the Comstock Act , an 1873 anti-vice law that bars the mailing of \"obscene matter and articles used to produce abortion.\"\n\nWhile Roe was in effect, the law was presumed unconstitutional, but many legal scholars say it could be resurrected. \"And it is so broad that it would ban abortion nationwide from the beginning of a pregnancy without exception. Procedural abortion, pills, everything,\" Greer Donley, an associate professor and abortion policy researcher at the University of Pittsburgh Law School, said on KFF Health News' \"What the Health?\" podcast early this year.\n\nEven if he does not turn to Comstock, Trump is expected to quickly reimpose restrictions embraced by every GOP president for the past four decades. When Trump took office in 2017, he reinstituted the \" Mexico City Policy \" (also known as the \"global gag rule\"), a Ronald Reagan-era rule that banned U.S. aid to international organizations that support abortion rights. He also pulled U.S. funding for the United Nations Population Fund . Both actions were undone when President Joe Biden took office in 2021.\n\nThose aren't the only policies Trump could resurrect. Others that Trump imposed and Biden overturned include:\n\nAnti-abortion groups say those changes are the minimum they expect. \"The commonsense policies of President Trump's first term become the baseline for the second, along with reversing Biden-Harris administration's unprecedented violation of longstanding federal laws,\" Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said in a statement to KFF Health News.\n\nDannenfelser was referring to the expectation that Trump will overturn actions that Biden took toward protecting abortion rights after the Supreme Court's decision. Some included:\n\nEven easier than formal changes of policy, though, Trump could simply order the Justice Department to drop several cases being heard in federal court in which the federal government is effectively arguing to preserve abortion rights. Those cases include:\n\nWhether Trump will take any or all of these actions is anyone's guess. Whether he can take these actions, however, is unquestioned.\n\nHealthBent, a regular feature of KFF Health News, offers insight into and analysis of policies and politics from KFF Health News chief Washington correspondent Julie Rovner, who has covered health care for more than 30 years.\n\nSubscribe to KFF Health News' free Morning Briefing.\n\nThis article first appeared on KFF Health News and is republished here under a Creative Commons license."

      "text": "Expanding abortion access strengthens democracy - while abortion bans signal broader repression: worldwide study\n\nAbortion is on the agenda not just in the United States but worldwide.\n\nA majority of people in developed democracies increasingly favor abortion rights and self-determination. And, in most places, laws are shifting to reflect public opinion. Since 2020, Argentina, Colombia and Mexico, among others , have legalized abortion. In 2024, France adopted the right to an abortion as a \"guaranteed freedom\" in its constitution .\n\nAt the same time, on every continent, some modern democracies are rolling back reproductive rights, among them Poland, Brazil and the U.S.\n\nMy new study, Abortion Rights Backlash , traces the relationship between abortion rights and democracy worldwide. Comparing progress in Argentina and California with the regression of Poland, Texas and beyond, I found that expanding abortion rights strengthens democracy, while restricting reproductive freedom weakens it .\n\nUnsafe abortions kill or maim tens of thousands of pregnant people every year globally, and access to safe abortion is considered a fundamental right in international law .\n\nThe struggle for abortion rights, then, is a test for democracy. It signals whether citizens have control of their bodies and can influence decision-making on their fundamental rights.\n\nThis process has been playing out in the U.S. since 2022, when the Supreme Court ended federal protection for the right to get an abortion . Abortion has since been on the ballot in seven state elections, and in every case people have voted to protect reproductive rights .\n\nA majority of Americans support legal abortion , and upcoming referendums in 10 more states are expected to reflect this democratic sentiment.\n\nArgentina's path to legalizing abortion in 2020 shows how mobilizing for reproductive rights builds democracy.\n\nThe Argentine abortion-rights movement, which began after the end of the country's military dictatorship in 1983, bolstered the country's most representative democratic institutions and increased women's political participation. It also forged new forms of solidarity between marginalized groups.\n\nUnder Argentina's ruling military junta, which was aligned with the Catholic Church, contraception and even divorce had all been banned. The country began steadily expanding women's rights starting in 1985, when the newly democratic government signed the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women , a United Nations agreement obliging it to protect women's rights.\n\nStudies show that signing international women's rights treaties lays the groundwork for reproductive rights , and Argentina was no exception. It legalized birth control and divorce in the 1980s, and in 1991 it established a congressional quota requiring that at least 30% of legislative seats be allocated to women.\n\nWomen steadily gained more influence in politics , a proven precursor to greater access to abortion . The rising number of women legislators in the Argentine Congress repeatedly moved to legalize abortion , proposing bills to Congress in 2007, 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2018.\n\nThey all failed, but each successive version gained increasing support from legislators and from the Argentine people. The defeat of the 2018 legal abortion bill triggered massive protests , and progressive legislators responded by sponsoring days of hearings on abortion legalization. Representatives from women's organizations testified movingly on the thousands of lives lost to unsafe, illegal abortions.\n\nBeyond the political system, Argentine activists worked to forge strategic social coalitions.\n\nThey enlisted the country's powerful unions and respected human-rights movements to their cause. These forces were essential to securing the 2019 victory of President Alberto Fernandez, who pledged to partner with Congress to deliver reproductive rights.\n\nThe abortion-rights movement also allied with Latin America's influential movement to end gender violence and with the LGBTQ rights campaign of Argentina, which in 2010 became the first country in the region to recognize same-sex marriage.\n\nTo broaden their appeal beyond the capital city and professional women, the activists worked to engage rural areas and working-class voters. They emphasized the discriminatory impact of abortion bans.\n\n\"The rich abort,\" they chanted at marches . \"The poor die.\"\n\nIn 2020, the Argentine Congress legalized abortion in Argentina as thousands rallied outside in the Plaza de Mayo . Many were wearing green bandannas, a symbol inspired by the white scarves worn by human-rights activists during Argentina's military dictatorship. Braving the COVID-19 pandemic, the abortion-rights protesters turned their iconic green scarves into face masks.\n\nIn contrast to Argentina, Poland's abortion clampdown illustrates how repression of reproductive rights correlates with rising authoritarianism.\n\nIn 2016, Poland's conservative nationalist Law and Justice Party took power , pledging to restore \"family values,\" and then proceeded to undermine women's rights and rule of law .\n\nAt the time, abortion was legal in Poland only when pregnancy threatened the life or health of the mother. In 2016, 2017 and 2018, the ruling party presented legislative proposals that would eliminate these limited exemptions to Poland's abortion ban.\n\nThe efforts stalled in parliament due to a combination of resistance from opposition parties and massive public outcry, with over 100,000 Poles turning out for street protests in 2016 and 2017 to oppose the proposed ban.\n\nLaw and Justice Party leaders solved the problem of democratic opposition by cutting the legislature and the Polish people out of the process.\n\nIn 2020, with public protest restricted during the pandemic, the Polish government filed a case with the constitutional court arguing to outlaw abortion under all circumstances. The court, stacked with justices loyal to the government, agreed. It ordered a total ban .\n\nSince then, half a dozen women denied therapeutic abortions or abortion aftercare have died of sepsis in Polish hospitals because doctors, fearful of prosecution, refused them lifesaving surgery.\n\nWhile it was clamping down on abortion rights, Poland's right-wing government was attacking the civil liberties of other people. Security forces targeted doctors, raided women's organizations and arrested activists . Gay people were declared a \" threat to the Polish state .\"\n\nIn 2023, centrist Donald Tusk was elected as Poland's prime minister on pledges to restore human rights and the rule of law. So far, though, parliament and the courts have blocked his efforts to moderate Poland's abortion ban.\n\nThe evidence is clear: When abortion is legal, democracy thrives. And when reproductive rights are restricted, democracy withers. That same story is unfolding in the U.S. right now, state by state.\n\nFollowing a successful 2022 abortion ballot initiative, California guaranteed reproductive freedom in its state Constitution. As in Argentina, this move was spearheaded by a strong women's movement in the state Legislature.\n\nBy contrast, Texas has echoed Poland's path . After shutting down access to abortion, the state restricted its citizens' right to travel , further curbing civil liberties.\n\nMobilizing for reproductive rights expands democracy because it gives women voice and control over basic freedoms. The struggle for abortion rights shows society that the personal is indeed political - and that women's lives matter.\n\nAlison Brysk , Professor of Political Science and Global Studies, University of California, Santa Barbara\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox .\n\nWrapping his wife in a blanket as she mourned the loss of her pregnancy at 11 weeks, Hope Ngumezi wondered why no obstetrician was coming to see her.\n\nOver the course of six hours on June 11, 2023, Porsha Ngumezi had bled so much in the emergency department at Houston Methodist Sugar Land that she'd needed two transfusions. She was anxious to get home to her young sons, but, according to a nurse's notes, she was still \"passing large clots the size of grapefruit.\"\n\nHope dialed his mother, a former physician, who was unequivocal. \"You need a D&C,\" she told them, referring to dilation and curettage, a common procedure for first-trimester miscarriages and abortions. If a doctor could remove the remaining tissue from her uterus, the bleeding would end.\n\nBut when Dr. Andrew Ryan Davis, the obstetrician on duty, finally arrived, he said it was the hospital's \"routine\" to give a drug called misoprostol to help the body pass the tissue, Hope recalled. Hope trusted the doctor. Porsha took the pills, according to records, and the bleeding continued.\n\nThree hours later, her heart stopped.\n\nThe 35-year-old's death was preventable, according to more than a dozen doctors who reviewed a detailed summary of her case for ProPublica. Some said it raises serious questions about how abortion bans are pressuring doctors to diverge from the standard of care and reach for less-effective options that could expose their patients to more risks. Doctors and patients described similar decisions they've witnessed across the state.\n\nIt was clear Porsha needed an emergency D&C, the medical experts said. She was hemorrhaging and the doctors knew she had a blood-clotting disorder, which put her at greater danger of excessive and prolonged bleeding. \"Misoprostol at 11 weeks is not going to work fast enough,\" said Dr. Amber Truehart, an OB-GYN at the University of New Mexico Center for Reproductive Health. \"The patient will continue to bleed and have a higher risk of going into hemorrhagic shock.\" The medical examiner found the cause of death to be hemorrhage.\n\nD&Cs - a staple of maternal health care - can be lifesaving. Doctors insert a straw-like tube into the uterus and gently suction out any remaining pregnancy tissue. Once the uterus is emptied, it can close, usually stopping the bleeding.\n\nBut because D&Cs are also used to end pregnancies, the procedure has become tangled up in state legislation that restricts abortions. In Texas, any doctor who violates the strict law risks up to 99 years in prison. Porsha's is the fifth case ProPublica has reported in which women died after they did not receive a D&C or its second-trimester equivalent, a dilation and evacuation; three of those deaths were in Texas.\n\nTexas doctors told ProPublica the law has changed the way their colleagues see the procedure; some no longer consider it a first-line treatment, fearing legal repercussions or dissuaded by the extra legwork required to document the miscarriage and get hospital approval to carry out a D&C. This has occurred, ProPublica found, even in cases like Porsha's where there isn't a fetal heartbeat or the circumstances should fall under an exception in the law. Some doctors are transferring those patients to other hospitals, which delays their care, or they're defaulting to treatments that aren't the medical standard.\n\nMisoprostol, the medicine given to Porsha, is an effective method to complete low-risk miscarriages but is not recommended when a patient is unstable. The drug is also part of a two-pill regimen for abortions, yet administering it may draw less scrutiny than a D&C because it requires a smaller medical team and because the drug is commonly used to induce labor and treat postpartum hemorrhage. Since 2022, some Texas women who were bleeding heavily while miscarrying have gone public about only receiving medication when they asked for D&Cs . One later passed out in a pool of her own blood.\n\n\"Stigma and fear are there for D&Cs in a way that they are not for misoprostol,\" said Dr. Alison Goulding, an OB-GYN in Houston. \"Doctors assume that a D&C is not standard in Texas anymore, even in cases where it should be recommended. People are afraid: They see D&C as abortion and abortion as illegal.\"\n\nDoctors and nurses involved in Porsha's care did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nSeveral physicians who reviewed the summary of her case pointed out that Davis' post-mortem notes did not reflect nurses' documented concerns about Porsha's \"heavy bleeding.\" After Porsha died, Davis wrote instead that the nurses and other providers described the bleeding as \"minimal,\" though no nurses wrote this in the records. ProPublica tried to ask Davis about this discrepancy. He did not respond to emails, texts or calls.\n\nHouston Methodist officials declined to answer a detailed list of questions about Porsha's treatment. They did not comment when asked whether Davis' approach was the hospital's \"routine.\" A spokesperson said that \"each patient's care is unique to that individual.\"\n\n\"All Houston Methodist hospitals follow all state laws,\" the spokesperson added, \"including the abortion law in place in Texas.\"\n\nHope marveled at the energy Porsha had for their two sons, ages 5 and 3. Whenever she wasn't working, she was chasing them through the house or dancing with them in the living room. As a finance manager at a charter school system, she was in charge of the household budget. As an engineer for an airline, Hope took them on flights around the world - to Chile, Bali, Guam, Singapore, Argentina.\n\nThe two had met at Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas. \"When Porsha and I began dating,\" Hope said, \"I already knew I was going to love her.\" She was magnetic and driven, going on to earn an MBA, but she was also gentle with him, always protecting his feelings. Both were raised in big families and they wanted to build one of their own.\n\nWhen he learned Porsha was pregnant again in the spring of 2023, Hope wished for a girl. Porsha found a new OB-GYN who said she could see her after 11 weeks. Ten weeks in, though, Porsha noticed she was spotting. Over the phone, the obstetrician told her to go to the emergency room if it got worse.\n\nTo celebrate the end of the school year, Porsha and Hope took their boys to a water park in Austin, and as they headed back, on June 11, Porsha told Hope that the bleeding was heavier. They decided Hope would stay with the boys at home until a relative could take over; Porsha would drive to the emergency room at Houston Methodist Sugar Land, one of seven community hospitals that are part of the Houston Methodist system.\n\nAt 6:30 p.m, three hours after Porsha arrived at the hospital, she saw huge clots in the toilet. \"Significant bleeding,\" the emergency physician wrote. \"I'm starting to feel a lot of pain,\" Porsha texted Hope. Around 7:30 p.m., she wrote: \"She said I might need surgery if I don't stop bleeding,\" referring to the nurse. At 7:50 p.m., after a nurse changed her second diaper in an hour: \"Come now.\"\n\nStill, the doctor didn't mention a D&C at this point, records show. Medical experts told ProPublica that this wait-and-see approach has become more common under abortion bans. Unless there is \"overt information indicating that the patient is at significant risk,\" hospital administrators have told physicians to simply monitor them, said Dr. Robert Carpenter, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist who works in several hospital systems in Houston. Methodist declined to share its miscarriage protocols with ProPublica or explain how it is guiding doctors under the abortion ban.\n\nAs Porsha waited for Hope, a radiologist completed an ultrasound and noted that she had \"a pregnancy of unknown location.\" The scan detected a \"sac-like structure\" but no fetus or cardiac activity. This report, combined with her symptoms, indicated she was miscarrying.\n\nBut the ultrasound record alone was less definitive from a legal perspective, several doctors explained to ProPublica. Since Porsha had not had a prenatal visit, there was no documentation to prove she was 11 weeks along. On paper, this \"pregnancy of unknown location\" diagnosis could also suggest that she was only a few weeks into a normally developing pregnancy, when cardiac activity wouldn't be detected. Texas outlaws abortion from the moment of fertilization; a record showing there is no cardiac activity isn't enough to give physicians cover to intervene, experts said.\n\nDr. Gabrielle Taper, who recently worked as an OB-GYN resident in Austin, said that she regularly witnessed delays after ultrasound reports like these. \"If it's a pregnancy of unknown location, if we do something to manage it, is that considered an abortion or not?\" she said, adding that this was one of the key problems she encountered. After the abortion ban went into effect, she said, \"there was much more hesitation about: When can we intervene, do we have enough evidence to say this is a miscarriage, how long are we going to wait, what will we use to feel definitive?\"\n\nAt Methodist, the emergency room doctor reached Davis, the on-call OB-GYN, to discuss the ultrasound, according to records. They agreed on a plan of \"observation in the hospital to monitor bleeding.\"\n\nAround 8:30 p.m., just after Hope arrived, Porsha passed out. Terrified, he took her head in his hands and tried to bring her back to consciousness. \"Babe, look at me,\" he told her. \"Focus.\" Her blood pressure was dipping dangerously low. She had held off on accepting a blood transfusion until he got there. Now, as she came to, she agreed to receive one and then another.\n\nBy this point, it was clear that she needed a D&C, more than a dozen OB-GYNs who reviewed her case told ProPublica. She was hemorrhaging, and the standard of care is to vacuum out the residual tissue so the uterus can clamp down, physicians told ProPublica.\n\n\"Complete the miscarriage and the bleeding will stop,\" said Dr. Lauren Thaxton, an OB-GYN who recently left Texas.\n\n\"At every point, it's kind of shocking,\" said Dr. Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, San Francisco who reviewed Porsha's case. \"She is having significant blood loss and the physician didn't move toward aspiration.\"\n\nAll Porsha talked about was her devastation of losing the pregnancy. She was cold, crying and in extreme pain. She wanted to be at home with her boys. Unsure what to say, Hope leaned his chest over the cot, passing his body heat to her.\n\nAt 9:45 p.m., Esmeralda Acosta, a nurse, wrote that Porsha was \"continuing to pass large clots the size of grapefruit.\" Fifteen minutes later, when the nurse learned Davis planned to send Porsha to a floor with fewer nurses, she \"voiced concern\" that he wanted to take her out of the emergency room, given her condition, according to medical records.\n\nAt 10:20 p.m., seven hours after Porsha arrived, Davis came to see her. Hope remembered what his mother had told him on the phone earlier that night: \"She needs a D&C.\" The doctor seemed confident about a different approach: misoprostol. If that didn't work, Hope remembers him saying, they would move on to the procedure.\n\nA pill sounded good to Porsha because the idea of surgery scared her. Davis did not explain that a D&C involved no incisions, just suction, according to Hope, or tell them that it would stop the bleeding faster. The Ngumezis followed his recommendation without question. \"I'm thinking, 'He's the OB, he's probably seen this a thousand times, he probably knows what's right,'\" Hope said.\n\nBut more than a dozen doctors who reviewed Porsha's case were concerned by this recommendation. Many said it was dangerous to give misoprostol to a woman who's bleeding heavily, especially one with a blood clotting disorder. \"That's not what you do,\" said Dr. Elliott Main, the former medical director for the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative and an expert in hemorrhage, after reviewing the case. \"She needed to go to the operating room.\" Main and others said doctors are obliged to counsel patients on the risks and benefits of all their options, including a D&C.\n\nPerforming a D&C, though, attracts more attention from colleagues, creating a higher barrier in a state where abortion is illegal, explained Goulding, the OB-GYN in Houston. Staff are familiar with misoprostol because it's used for labor, and it only requires a doctor and a nurse to administer it. To do a procedure, on the other hand, a doctor would need to find an operating room, an anesthesiologist and a nursing team. \"You have to convince everyone that it is legal and won't put them at risk,\" said Goulding. \"Many people may be afraid and misinformed and refuse to participate - even if it's for a miscarriage.\"\n\nDavis moved Porsha to a less-intensive unit, according to records. Hope wondered why they were leaving the emergency room if the nurse seemed so worried. But instead of pushing back, he rubbed Porsha's arms, trying to comfort her. The hospital was reputable. \"Since we were at Methodist, I felt I could trust the doctors.\"\n\nOn their way to the other ward, Porsha complained of chest pain. She kept remarking on it when they got to the new room. From this point forward, there are no nurse's notes recording how much she continued to bleed. \"My wife says she doesn't feel right, and last time she said that, she passed out,\" Hope told a nurse. Furious, he tried to hold it together so as not to alarm Porsha. \"We need to see the doctor,\" he insisted.\n\nHer vital signs looked fine. But many physicians told ProPublica that when healthy pregnant patients are hemorrhaging, their bodies can compensate for a long time, until they crash. Any sign of distress, such as chest pain, could be a red flag; the symptom warranted investigation with tests, like an electrocardiogram or X-ray, experts said. To them, Porsha's case underscored how important it is that doctors be able to intervene before there are signs of a life-threatening emergency.\n\nBut Davis didn't order any tests, according to records.\n\nAround 1:30 a.m., Hope was sitting by Porsha's bed, his hands on her chest, telling her, \"We are going to figure this out.\" They were talking about what she might like for breakfast when she began gasping for air.\n\n\"Help, I need help!\" he shouted to the nurses through the intercom. \"She can't breathe.\"\n\nHours later, Hope returned home in a daze. \"Is mommy still at the hospital?\" one of his sons asked. Hope nodded; he couldn't find the words to tell the boys they'd lost their mother. He dressed them and drove them to school, like the previous day had been a bad dream. He reached for his phone to call Porsha, as he did every morning that he dropped the kids off. But then he remembered that he couldn't.\n\nFriends kept reaching out. Most of his family's network worked in medicine, and after they said how sorry they were, one after another repeated the same message. All she needed was a D&C , said one. They shouldn't have given her that medication, said another. It's a simple procedure, the callers continued. We do this all the time in Nigeria .\n\nSince Porsha died, several families in Texas have spoken publicly about similar circumstances. This May, when Ryan Hamilton's wife was bleeding while miscarrying at 13 weeks, the first doctor they saw at Surepoint Emergency Center Stephenville noted no fetal cardiac activity and ordered misoprostol, according to medical records. When they returned because the bleeding got worse, an emergency doctor on call, Kyle Demler, said he couldn't do anything considering \"the current stance\" in Texas, according to Hamilton, who recorded his recollection of the conversation shortly after speaking with Demler. (Neither Surepoint Emergency Center Stephenville nor Demler responded to several requests for comment.)\n\nThey drove an hour to another hospital asking for a D&C to stop the bleeding, but there, too, the physician would only prescribe misoprostol, medical records indicate. Back home, Hamilton's wife continued bleeding until he found her passed out on the bathroom floor. \"You don't think it can really happen like that,\" said Hamilton. \"It feels like you're living in some sort of movie, it's so unbelievable.\"\n\nAcross Texas, physicians say they blame the law for interfering with medical care. After ProPublica reported last month on two women who died after delays in miscarriage care , 111 OB-GYNs sent a letter to Texas policymakers, saying that \"the law does not allow Texas women to get the lifesaving care they need.\"\n\nDr. Austin Dennard, an OB-GYN in Dallas, told ProPublica that if one person on a medical team doubts the doctor's choice to proceed with a D&C, the physician might back down. \"You constantly feel like you have someone looking over your shoulder in a punitive, vigilante type of way.\"\n\nThe criminal penalties are so chilling that even women with diagnoses included in the law's exceptions are facing delays and denials . Last year, for example, legislators added an update to the ban for patients diagnosed with previable premature rupture of membranes, in which a patient's water breaks before a fetus can survive. Doctors can still face prosecution for providing abortions in those cases, but they are offered the chance to justify themselves with what's called an \"affirmative defense,\" not unlike a murder suspect arguing self defense. This modest change has not stopped some doctors from transferring those patients instead of treating them; Dr. Allison Gilbert, an OB-GYN in Dallas, said doctors send them to her from other hospitals. \"They didn't feel like other staff members would be comfortable proceeding with the abortion,\" she said. \"It's frustrating that places still feel like they can't act on some of these cases that are clearly emergencies.\" Women denied treatment for ectopic pregnancies, another exception in the law, have filed federal complaints .\n\nIn response to ProPublica's questions about Houston Methodist's guidance on miscarriage management, a spokesperson, Gale Smith, said that the hospital has an ethics committee, which can usually respond within hours to help physicians and patients make \"appropriate decisions\" in compliance with state laws.\n\nAfter Porsha died, Davis described in the medical record a patient who looked stable: He was tracking her vital signs, her bleeding was \"mild\" and she was \"said not to be in distress.\" He ordered bloodwork \"to ensure patient wasn't having concerning bleeding.\" Medical experts who reviewed Porsha's case couldn't understand why Davis noted that a nurse and other providers reported \"decreasing bleeding\" in the emergency department when the record indicated otherwise. \"He doesn't document the heavy bleeding that the nurse clearly documented, including the significant bleeding that prompted the blood transfusion, which is surprising,\" Grossman, the UCSF professor, said.\n\nPatients who are miscarrying still don't know what to expect from Houston Methodist.\n\nThis past May, Marlena Stell, a patient with symptoms nearly identical to Porsha's, arrived at another hospital in the system, Houston Methodist The Woodlands. According to medical records, she, too, was 11 weeks along and bleeding heavily. An ultrasound confirmed there was no fetal heartbeat and indicated the miscarriage wasn't complete. \"I assumed they would do whatever to get the bleeding to stop,\" Stell said.\n\nInstead, she bled for hours at the hospital. She wanted a D&C to clear out the rest of the tissue, but the doctor gave her methergine, a medication that's typically used after childbirth to stop bleeding but that isn't standard care in the middle of a miscarriage, doctors told ProPublica. \"She had heavy bleeding, and she had an ultrasound that's consistent with retained products of conception.\" said Dr. Jodi Abbott, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Boston University School of Medicine, who reviewed the records. \"The standard of care would be a D&C.\"\n\nStell says that instead, she was sent home and told to \"let the miscarriage take its course.\" She completed her miscarriage later that night, but doctors who reviewed her case, so similar to Porsha's, said it showed how much of a gamble physicians take when they don't follow the standard of care. \"She got lucky - she could have died,\" Abbott said. (Houston Methodist did not respond to a request for comment on Stell's care.)\n\nIt hadn't occurred to Hope that the laws governing abortion could have any effect on his wife's miscarriage. Now it's the only explanation that makes sense to him. \"We all know pregnancies can come out beautifully or horribly,\" Hope told ProPublica. \"Instead of putting laws in place to make pregnancies safer, we created laws that put them back in danger.\"\n\nFor months, Hope's youngest son didn't understand that his mom was gone. Porsha's long hair had been braided, and anytime the toddler saw a woman with braids from afar, he would take off after her, shouting, \"That's mommy!\"\n\nA couple weeks ago, Hope flew to Amsterdam to quiet his mind. It was his first trip without Porsha, but as he walked the city, he didn't know how to experience it without her. He kept thinking about how she would love the Christmas lights and want to try all the pastries. How she would have teased him when he fell asleep on a boat tour of the canals. \"I thought getting away would help,\" he wrote in his journal. \"But all I've done is imagine her beside me.\"\n\nMariam Elba and Lexi Churchill contributed research."

      "text": "Abortion doctor fights to keep license as DeSantis administration pushes for revocation\n\nThe administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis wants to punish a doctor who violated the state's 24-hour rule on abortion by stripping away her medical license.\n\nThe push to revoke the license is going forward even though an administrative law judge (ALJ) who looked at the physician's actions suggested a $10,000 fine and a reprimand.\n\nBut the Florida Department of Health has taken exception to the judge's position and is asking the Florida Board of Medicine (BOM) to revoke the license of Dr. Candace Cooley.\n\n\"The Board [of Medicine] should send a clear message to Respondent and every other physician in Florida that knowing and complying with the laws governing their practice is not optional, and serious breaches of this duty will be met with serious consequences,\" DOH Chief Andrew Pietrylo Jr. wrote in a 19- page exception to Administrative Law Judge James Peterson's recommended order.\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis signed Florida's 15-week abortion ban into law on April 14, 2022. Credit: Governor Ron DeSantis Facebook.\n\nThe case against Cooley is slated to be discussed during the Board of Medicine's Dec. 6 meeting in Orlando. That would be shortly after voters in the state decide whether to pass Amendment 4, an initiative that would bar government interference with abortion up to the point of viability. The DeSantis administration has been actively engaged in a campaign designed to convince voters to vote down the amendment.\n\nCooley was charged with a single violation of \"failing to perform any statutory or legal obligation placed upon a licensed physician\" stemming from 193 abortions she performed between April 25 and May 7, 2022, without waiting 24 hours between consultation and the procedure - one of the mandated informed consent requirements that are part of the state's abortion laws.\n\nIn his recommended order, Peterson said the state cannot discipline Cooley on charges not alleged in the complaint. The DOH alleged a single violation of the law, not 193 separate violations.\n\nPietrylo argued Peterson's conclusion is \"illogical\" and that since the filing of the complaint Cooley has known the state is seeking discipline based on her performing 193 abortions without adhering to the waiting period.\n\n\"According to the [administrative law judge] reasoning, the Department would have to plead 193 separate counts in its Administrative Complaint in order for the Board to consider the number of offenses as an aggravating factor. This would result in an entirely unwieldy and repetitive pleading for the parties and the ALJ to muddle through, and it would fail to provide Respondent with any additional meaningful notice of the charges against her,\" Pietrylo wrote.\n\nIn legal filings Julie Gallagher, the attorney representing Cooley, said the state's push to revoke Cooley's license is \"extreme and unwarranted.\"\n\nCooley practiced medicine in Florida between 1999-2011 and 2014-2023. She is certified by the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology. She provided both surgical and medication abortions with the \"majority being medication abortions,\" the record shows. She had previously been disciplined by the state medical board in 2019 and had restrictions placed on her license.\n\nCooley had been working at the Center of Orlando for Women, an abortion clinic, since 2019 but was unaware that Florida had a 24-hour waiting period for abortions. The restriction was passed in 2015 but had been put on hold pending litigation. Circuit Court Judge Angela Dempsey in early April upheld the law pending a written final order, which she issued on April 25, 2022.\n\nClinic management started contacting state health care regulators on April 14, asking about the effective date of the 24-hour waiting period. Julie Murano, the clinic's human resources director, made 14 calls to the state Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA).\n\n\"Each time she communicated with AHCA, she was told 'we are aware of the ruling and we have no information' or words to that effect,\" the record shows. \"On May 3, 2022, the contact at AHCA told Ms. Murano to stop calling every day and to check the website as the information would be posted on AHCA's website when they received the information.\"\n\nThe clinic implemented its 24-hour waiting period policy on May 9. Cooley, the only physician who performed abortions at the clinic, provided the 193 abortions between the date of the ruling and May 7.\n\nAHCA ultimately fined the clinic $193,000, nearly three times more than an ALJ's recommendation. The clinic raised the money it needed to cover the fine through crowdfunding .\n\nAHCA regulates health care facilities but has no authority over health care professionals. So, the agency referred Cooley to the Department of Health, which houses the state's medical and health care boards, for prosecution.\n\nSixteen medical doctors had their licenses revoked by the BOM in state fiscal year 2022-23, the latest available data. By comparison, the BOM placed restrictions or limitations on 75 licenses during the same period.\n\n\"Revocation is traditionally reserved for the most egregious cases in which the board finds the physicians is an immediate threat to the safety of Florida patients,\" said Jacksonville health care attorney and lobbyist Chris Nuland, who regularly attends the board meetings.\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\n\nIn her response to the department's exceptions, Gallagher said none of the 193 patients who had abortions were injured as a result of Cooley's actions and none filed complaints.\n\nCooley complied with all the other informed consent requirements in Florida's abortion laws, including providing an ultrasound that confirms gestational age and information about abortions and the risks involved.\n\n\"To say she performed 193 abortions without informed consent is misleading,\" Gallagher wrote.\n\nGallagher in her response also accuses the DeSantis administration of taking \"retaliatory\" action against Cooley, who chose not to waive her right to an administrative hearing. Before the administrative hearing, Gallagher contends, the board sought restrictions against Cooley's license that would have prohibited her from performing abortions again in Florida.\n\n\"There was no indication Petitioner might seek revocation of Respondent's license if she did not accept the offer, until the Department filed its Proposed Recommended Order and recommended revocation. This increase in penalty recommendation appears to be motivated by retaliation for Respondent taking the Department to a trial so she could present mitigation to the Judge which, in this case, took an hour.\"\n\nThe move to revoke the license, Gallagher argues, is \"extreme\" because the board did not revoke Dr. Christopher Saputa's license after he failed to provide emergency care to patients following abortions. Gallagher noted that his malpractice was found to be so severe that two patients nearly died and at least one lost her fertility.\n\n'In those grievous cases, the Board did not revoke Dr. Saputa's license. Rather, it suspended him for one year and restricted him from performing abortions in Florida,\" Gallagher wrote. \"Similarly, some physicians with patient deaths related to the Brazilian Butt Lift procedure have not had their licenses revoked but, rather, have been given remedial education and monitoring.\"\n\nThe DOH's Pietrylo, though, argues the 193 women were exposed to \"significant potential harm\" and that revocation, not a fine, is the fitting punishment.\n\n\"Respondent's violation was inherently severe because it deprived women of their right to make a fully informed decision about whether to terminate their pregnancy. It also exposed the women to significant potential harm - even if no actual harm resulted. These patients proceeded with a medical procedure that could lead to excessive bleeding, infection, organ perforation, adverse reactions to medications, and even death, without having the full amount of time required to consider these risks.\"\n\nThe Florida Board of Medicine is a 15-member panel appointed by the governor and charged with disciplining physicians and establishing rules and standards of care for medical doctors in the state.\n\nThe case against Cooley is slated to be discussed during the Board of Medicine's Dec. 6 meeting in Orlando.\n\nDeSantis's choice to appoint Dr. Steven Christie, an oncological radiologist in Miami and creator of the website Speaking for the Unborn, to the board made headlines earlier this year.\n\nIn addition to practicing medicine, Christie lectures regularly on \"marriage, family, and the dignity of life,\" according to Catholic Charities of Central Florida's website . He's also an attorney and creator of a book and video teaching series on abortion that New York Archbishop Timothy Dolan called a \"must-read.\"\n\nDeSantis reappointed Dr. Hector Vila to the board. Vila is politically active on the abortion issue. The anesthesiologist was a witness for the state when the 24-hour waiting period was being litigated and testified that he was \"not aware of another area of medicine, besides abortion, in which a non-emergency outpatient invasive procedure is performed without a prior visit and consultation.\"\n\nHe stated that the lack of a 24-hour waiting period \"would fall below the acceptable medical standard of care.\"\n\nGallagher told the Florida Phoenix Thursday that her client received a \"reasonable recommendation from the ALJ but the department is trying to increase the penalty to revocation. We will see what the board does.\"\n\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\n\nFlorida Phoenix is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

      "text": "New bill would let voters donate to anti-abortion centers instead of paying any taxes\n\nIn an unprecedented move to funnel more public tax dollars toward groups that oppose abortion, Republican lawmakers in Missouri are advancing a plan to allow residents to donate to pregnancy resource centers instead of paying any state income taxes.\n\nThe proposal would establish a 100% tax credit, up from 70%, and a $50,000 annual cap per taxpayer. The result: Nearly all Missouri households - except those with the highest incomes - could fully satisfy their state tax bill by redirecting their payment from the state to pregnancy centers.\n\nThe move comes four months after Missouri voters reversed one of the nation's strictest abortion bans, and just as clinics have begun performing the procedure again after overcoming Republican obstacles.\n\nSupporters of the bill, which last month cleared a key legislative hurdle in the state House, say it gives taxpayers more control over where their tax dollars go and allows them to support organizations that help pregnant women and provide alternatives to abortion. Alissa Gross, CEO of Resource Health Services, which runs four pregnancy resource centers in the Kansas City area, told the committee in written testimony that tax credits have led to a surge in donations to her organization and that a 100% tax credit could bring in even more.\n\n\"Our ability to impact more men and women for life as well as build healthy families has been substantial,\" she said.\n\nCritics argue the state's support for pregnancy resource centers, also known as crisis pregnancy centers, diverts tax revenue away from essential services such as health care and public education and becomes a funding stream for anti-abortion advocacy. They say many centers do little to actually help women; instead, they say they merely discourage women from getting abortions.\n\n\"A 70 percent tax credit with no cap was excessive. A 100 percent tax credit is absurd,\" Katie Baylie, a lawyer and reproductive rights advocate based in the Kansas City area, wrote in testimony submitted to the committee. \"It is an insult to Missourians that our lawmakers are spending time even considering this bill.\"\n\nExperts in tax policy and philanthropy said a dollar-for-dollar tax credit - for any purpose - is rare and could be much costlier for the state than intended, especially if pregnancy centers actively promote it.\n\nThere is a big psychological difference for donors between a 100% tax credit and a 70% credit, the experts said. At 70%, donors still have to pay some taxes, but at 100%, there is no reason to make a donation less than their tax liability.\n\n\"I could imagine a possibility where there's a big publicity campaign by these centers, or a viral campaign, and massive numbers of conservative Missourians decide to effectively defund state government in favor of these pregnancy resource centers,\" said David Gamage, a professor of tax law and policy at the University of Missouri law school.\n\nHowever, expansion of tax credits clashes with another Republican push to eliminate Missouri's income tax altogether. Two proposals to replace it with a higher sales tax recently advanced in the state Senate , although it was unclear whether they could pass. If Missouri were to abolish state income taxes, tax credits would become meaningless.\n\nThe bill represents one more expansion of a measure Missouri lawmakers have been growing for several years. Until 2021, Missouri taxpayers who donated to pregnancy resource centers were able to claim a 50% tax credit for their donations, meaning for every $1,000 in donations, a taxpayer's bill dropped by $500. That's when an expansion approved by the legislature in 2019 took effect and raised the rate to 70%. That shifted more of the cost of those contributions to the state, since tax credits work by directly reducing the amount of money a taxpayer owes to the state. Unlike deductions, which lower taxable income, tax credits are a dollar-for-dollar reduction in tax liability. When these credits are redeemed, they prevent the state from collecting that revenue, effectively reducing the total income available for public services.\n\nThe legislature also removed a $3.5 million-per-year cap on the program and removed its expiration date.\n\nAt the time, the change drew little attention because it was tucked into the same legislation that created Missouri's trigger law to ban abortion if Roe v. Wade were overturned - a move that dominated headlines. And there were few warnings about how much it could cost.\n\nThe bill's official cost estimate, prepared by nonpartisan legislative oversight staff, projected only a modest increase in taxpayer expense. Raising the tax credit to 70% was expected to increase annual tax credits from $3.5 million to $4.9 million. That estimate assumed donations would remain steady.\n\nBut they didn't. The program has grown significantly, with $11.8 million in tax credits authorized in the past year alone. Still, it remains a small fraction of Missouri's overall budget; Gov. Mike Kehoe has proposed a $54 billion spending plan for next year.\n\nOnce again, legislative research is downplaying the potential impact on Missouri's budget. The fiscal note for the bill accounts only for the jump from a 70% to a 100% tax credit, without considering the likely surge in donations that such an incentive would trigger - even though increasing giving is the entire point of the policy.\n\nThe note says that it was \"unclear\" whether the enhanced tax credit would encourage more people to contribute and claim the credit, which would lead to more foregone tax revenue for the state.\n\nThe legislative research staffer who authored the impact statement declined to comment, and the bill's House sponsor, Rep. Christopher Warwick, did not respond to questions from ProPublica.\n\nWarwick, a Republican from Bolivar, in southwest Missouri, told the tax reform committee that his proposal empowers taxpayers to support important work without the state \"trying to verify what programs work.\" He said, too, that he would oppose requirements for pregnancy resource centers to report how they spend the money, saying he wanted to \"limit the bureaucracy.\"\n\nWarwick's bill would also increase the tax credit for donations to maternity homes from 70% to 100% and for diaper banks from 50% to 100%. The state has not yet studied the impact of those changes.\n\nA matching bill has been introduced in the Senate but has not yet advanced.\n\nRep. Steve Butz, a Democrat from St. Louis, argued the tax credit would effectively shift charitable giving from individuals to the state.\n\n\"This will be the fourth bill I've heard that will reduce revenue, which I guess is clearly your goal here - to reduce the revenue to the state,\" Butz told Warwick during a legislative hearing on the bill. He argued that if donors receive a full tax credit for their contributions, they aren't really giving their own money - rather, the state is effectively making the donation for them. \"So I don't know that I'd consider that much charitable giving.\"\n\nIn an interview, Butz said he considers himself pro-life and has donated to pregnancy resource centers, receiving the 70% tax credit. However, he said he does not believe the program should take priority over others that receive less or no tax incentives for giving.\n\nMissouri's approach to crisis pregnancy centers reflects a growing divide between red and blue states. While Republican-led states such as Florida , Texas and Tennessee have ramped up funding for pregnancy resource centers, states led by Democrats, including Massachusetts and California , have warned residents the centers mislead patients by posing as medical clinics while steering them away from abortion.\n\nMissouri is among the national leaders in per capita spending on pregnancy resource centers even before tax credits are factored in, according to data from states that fund them. Kehoe has proposed increasing direct state funding by almost 50% to more than $12 million in the fiscal year that starts July 1.\n\nIn a statement, Gabby Picard, communications director in Kehoe's office, said the governor \"is committed to supporting services that help women choose to carry their unborn child to term, which is why his budget recommends increased funding\" for abortion alternatives, including pregnancy resource centers.\n\nMissouri was the first state to use tax credits to fund pregnancy centers, becoming a model for other states looking to support the anti-abortion movement. One public health expert who has tracked the impact of pregnancy centers said Missouri has been a leader and innovator in this effort. \"What Missouri is proposing really makes them an outlier at the top of the game,\" said Andrea Swartzendruber, an associate professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Georgia.\n\nWarwick's initiative follows sweeping changes to Missouri's abortion laws.\n\nIn November, voters approved a constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to abortion and other reproductive health decisions, effectively nullifying a near-total ban that had been in place since 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe first abortion performed under the new amendment took place in Kansas City on Feb. 15, after a judge struck down restrictive licensing rules that had prevented providers like Planned Parenthood from resuming services in the state.\n\nIn response, Republican lawmakers have introduced a wave of bills aimed at limiting the amendment's impact. Among the measures is another proposed constitutional amendment that would restrict abortion and ban gender-affirming care for minors - an effort to combine something that voters support with something they don't in the hopes it'll turn off abortion-rights supporters.\n\nSome abortion-rights advocates in the legislature see the expanded tax credit as part of a broader push by anti-abortion lawmakers stung by the repeal of the abortion ban. After the amendment passed, those legislators \"needed some wins,\" said Rep. Kemp Strickler, a Democrat from the Kansas City suburbs.\n\n\"But even if the amendment had lost,\" Strickler said, \"they probably would have been coming forward with these kinds of things.\""

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Major anti-abortion groups gathered in the nation's capital on Thursday to begin a lobbying effort with Congress and President Donald Trump's administration aimed at eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood , with some calling on Elon Musk to make the organization one of his cost-cutting targets.\n\nThe anti-abortion groups are taking aim at abortion providers under an initiative called Defund Planned Parenthood, which targets federal Medicaid funding for the reproductive health care provider. More than 150 of the groups signed a letter Wednesday urging Congress to cut Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood and other health care centers that provide abortions through the budget reconciliation process.\n\n\"Today is a historic moment where the pro-life movement stands united behind one message: Defund Planned Parenthood,\" said Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life, as she kicked off the rally in view of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nShe called on Trump and other Republicans to \"defund your political enemies,\" adding that the abortion lobby has long targeted Republicans.\n\nThe federal Hyde Amendment already restricts government funding for most abortions, and less than 5% of the services Planned Parenthood provides are abortions, according to the organization's 2023 annual report.\n\nVicki Ringer, Planned Parenthood's South Carolina director of public affairs, said claims that Planned Parenthood uses Medicaid funding for abortion is \"an attempt to mislead the public\" and emphasized Planned Parenthood's role in providing broader reproductive health care.\n\n\"We should be expanding health care to low-income people rather than trying to kick off these people who rely on us for health care,\" Ringer said.\n\nPlanned Parenthood provides a wide range of services besides abortion. Its most recent annual report shows that contraceptive services and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections make up the vast majority of its medical care. It also performs more cancer screening and prevention procedures than abortions, according to the report.\n\nThe national group said eliminating its federal funding could put those services out of reach for millions of people and would hit low-income communities with little access to health care hardest.\n\nRachel Rebouche, dean of Temple University's Beasley School of Law, said the Defund Planned Parenthood movement has been building for 10 years but has gained momentum as the anti-abortion movement has been emboldened by Trump's presidential victory and by Republicans winning control of Congress in November.\n\n\"We're seeing more enthusiasm in states like South Carolina and others to close down Planned Parenthood under the banner of stopping abortions, which their laws already do,\" she said.\n\nTina Whittington, executive vice president at Students for Life, said she was confident that Trump would consider cutting Planned Parenthood's Medicaid funding and that Musk's Department of Government Efficiency could be just the tool for doing it.\n\n\"I'm more confident because we're in an era where DOGE's actions are targeting waste, fraud and abuse,\" she said. \"And this is a great way to do that.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court announced it will hear a case involving South Carolina's attempt to strip Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood. Experts say the lawsuit could prompt similar efforts in conservative states across the country to chip away at the organization's funding.\n\nDuring a 2015 push to strip Planned Parenthood funding, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that doing so would cost the government $130 million over 10 years.\n\nMeanwhile, lawmakers in at least three states - Missouri, Ohio and South Carolina - have introduced bills this year aiming to create tax breaks for anti-abortion centers .\n\nThe strategies come during a time when abortion rights advocates are warning that Trump and his Cabinet hold significant power to restrict access to medication abortion nationwide.\n\nRather than immediately heeding calls from anti-abortion allies to restrict Medicaid funding for clinics that provide abortions, Trump has made quieter moves after waffling on the issue on the campaign trail.\n\nHe reinstated a policy that requires foreign nongovernmental agencies to certify that they don't provide or promote abortion if they receive U.S. aid for family planning. He also pardoned several anti-abortion activists who had been convicted of blockading abortion clinics and used wording related to fetal personhood in an executive order rolling back protections for transgender people.\n\nThe Republican president has appointed abortion opponents to some key Cabinet positions that could affect the availability of medication abortion and contraception, Medicaid coverage for family planning services, collection of abortion-related data and abortion access for troops and veterans. In a pre-recorded message to the thousands who attended the March for Life in January, Trump said he proudly stood for families and for life.\n\nAlabama Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville said during Thursday's rally that he \"truly believes President Trump is the most pro-life president in history.\"\n\n\"Absolutely zero taxpayer dollars should be going to abortion,\" he said. \"... And I know President Trump agrees.\"\n\nMarjorie Dannenfelser, president of SBA Pro-Life America, said Republican control of the White House and Congress represents a unique opportunity to push for legislation targeting Planned Parenthood.\n\n\"I believe this is the moment they will be defunded, and this is the blow that will bring them down,\" she said.\n\nAdvocates on either side of the abortion debate are waiting to see if Trump's Department of Justice will revive the Comstock Act , a 19th-century obscenity law, to restrict the mailing of medication abortion or other materials used for abortions. Attorney General Pam Bondi has a history of defending abortion restrictions, and her confirmation was celebrated by abortion opponents.\n\nAt the Thursday rally, some passers-by shouted support for Planned Parenthood, saying the organization saves lives.\n\nHaven Wright, an 83-year-old retired entrepreneur visiting Washington to see the National Museum of African American History and Culture, happened upon the rally and noted that Planned Parenthood also provided health care for underserved communities.\n\n\"They are the main doctors for many, many poor women,\" she said. \"They are their main resource for all kinds of reproductive health care.\"\n\nWright said she had two abortions while in her 20s, once while she had an IUD and another time after she was raped. She said she was grateful she had the \"agency to get the care I needed.\"\n\n\"Women,\" she said, \"deserve a choice.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of abortion at https://apnews.com/hub/abortion .\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

(AP Photo/Gerald Herbert, file)\n\nCHICAGO (AP) - Donald Trump has had a tough time finding a consistent message to questions about abortion and reproductive rights .\n\nThe former president has constantly shifted his stances or offered vague, contradictory and at times nonsensical answers to questions on an issue that has become a major vulnerability for Republicans in this year's election. Trump has been trying to win over voters, especially women , skeptical about his views, especially after he nominated three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn the nationwide right to abortion two years ago.\n\nThe latest example came this week when the Republican presidential nominee said some abortion laws are \"too tough\" and would be \"redone.\"\n\n\"It's going to be redone,\" he said during a Fox News town hall that aired Wednesday. \"They're going to, you're going to, you end up with a vote of the people. They're too tough, too tough. And those are going to be redone because already there's a movement in those states.\"\n\nTrump did not specify if he meant he would take some kind of action if he wins in November, and he did not say which states or laws he was talking about. He did not elaborate on what he meant by \"redone.\"\n\nHe also seemed to be contradicting his own stand when referencing the strict abortion bans passed in Republican-controlled states since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Trump recently said he would vote against a constitutional amendment on the Florida ballot that is aimed at overturning the state's six-week abortion ban. That decision came after he had criticized the law as too harsh.\n\nTrump has shifted between boasting about nominating the justices who helped strike down federal protections for abortion and trying to appear more neutral. It's been an attempt to thread the divide between his base of anti-abortion supporters and the majority of Americans who support abortion rights.\n\nAbout 6 in 10 Americans think their state should generally allow a person to obtain a legal abortion if they don't want to be pregnant for any reason, according to a July poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Voters in seven states , including some conservative ones, have either protected abortion rights or defeated attempts to restrict them in statewide votes over the past two years.\n\nTrump also has been repeating the narrative that he returned the question of abortion rights to states, even though voters do not have a direct say on that or any other issue in about half the states. This is particularly true for those living in the South, where Republican-controlled legislatures, many of which have been gerrymandered to give the GOP disproportionate power, have enacted some of the strictest abortion bans since Roe v. Wade was overturned.\n\nCurrently, 13 states have banned abortion at all stages of pregnancy, while four more ban it after six weeks - before many women know they're pregnant.\n\nMeanwhile, anti-abortion groups and their Republican allies in state governments are using an array of strategies to counter proposed ballot initiatives in at least eight states this year.\n\nHere's a breakdown of Trump's fluctuating stances on reproductive rights.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump claimed some abortion laws are \"too tough\" and would be \"redone.\"\n\nBut in August, Trump said he would vote against a state ballot measure that is attempting to repeal the six-week abortion ban passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature and signed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nThat came a day after he seemed to indicate he would vote in favor of the measure. Trump previously called Florida's six-week ban a \"terrible mistake\" and too extreme. In an April Time magazine interview , Trump repeated that he \"thought six weeks is too severe.\"\n\nTrump's latest flip-flopping has involved his views on a national abortion ban.\n\nDuring the Oct. 1 vice presidential debate, Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social that he would veto a national abortion ban: \"Everyone knows I would not support a federal abortion ban, under any circumstances, and would, in fact, veto it.\"\n\nThis came just weeks after Trump repeatedly declined to say during the presidential debate with Democrat Kamala Harris whether he would veto a national abortion ban if he were elected.\n\nTrump's running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, said in an interview with NBC News before the presidential debate that Trump would veto a ban. In response to debate moderators prompting him about Vance's statement, Trump said: \"I didn't discuss it with JD, in all fairness. And I don't mind if he has a certain view, but I don't think he was speaking for me.\"\n\nTrump's shifting abortion policy stances began when the former reality TV star and developer started flirting with running for office.\n\nHe once called himself \"very pro-choice.\" But before becoming president, Trump said he \"would indeed support a ban,\" according to his book \"The America We Deserve,\" which was published in 2000.\n\nIn his first year as president, he said he was \"pro-life with exceptions\" but also said \"there has to be some form of punishment\" for women seeking abortions - a position he quickly reversed.\n\nAt the 2018 annual March for Life, Trump voiced support for a federal ban on abortion on or after 20 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nMore recently, Trump suggested in March that he might support a national ban on abortions around 15 weeks before announcing that he instead would leave the matter to the states.\n\nIn the Time interview, Trump said it should be left up to the states to decide whether to prosecute women for abortions or to monitor women's pregnancies.\n\n\"The states are going to make that decision,\" Trump said. \"The states are going to have to be comfortable or uncomfortable, not me.\"\n\nDemocrats have seized on the comments he made in 2016, saying \"there has to be some form of punishment\" for women who have abortions.\n\nTrump also declined to comment on access to the abortion pill mifepristone , claiming that he has \"pretty strong views\" on the matter. He said he would make a statement on the issue, but it never came.\n\nTrump responded similarly when asked about his views on the Comstock Act , a 19th century law that has been revived by anti-abortion groups seeking to block the mailing of mifepristone.\n\nIn May, Trump said during an interview with a Pittsburgh television station that he was open to supporting regulations on contraception and that his campaign would release a policy on the issue \"very shortly.\" He later said his comments were misinterpreted.\n\nIn the KDKA interview, Trump was asked, \"Do you support any restrictions on a person's right to contraception?\"\n\n\"We're looking at that and I'm going to have a policy on that very shortly,\" Trump responded.\n\nTrump has not since released a policy statement on contraception.\n\nTrump also has offered contradictory statements on in vitro fertilization.\n\nDuring the Fox News town hall, which was taped Tuesday, Trump declared that he is \"the father of IVF,\" despite acknowledging during his answer that he needed an explanation of IVF in February after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law.\n\nTrump said he instructed Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., to \"explain IVF very quickly\" to him in the aftermath of the ruling.\n\nAs concerns over access to fertility treatments rose, Trump pledged to promote IVF by requiring health insurance companies or the federal government to pay for it. Such a move would be at odds with the actions of much of his own party.\n\nEven as the Republican Party has tried to create a national narrative that it is receptive to IVF, these messaging efforts have been undercut by GOP state lawmakers, Republican-dominated courts and anti-abortion leaders within the party's ranks, as well as opposition to legislative attempts to protect IVF access.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

(AP Photo/Michael Conroy, File)\n\nLawmakers in some states where abortion is already banned are seeking to explicitly bar abortion pills or take a step that most leading anti-abortion groups oppose: punish women who seek to end their pregnancies.\n\nIt's too early in some legislative sessions to know whether the measures will get serious consideration. But it does show that the policy debate continues to evolve following the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door to state bans on abortion.\n\nHere's a look at where things stand:\n\nLawmakers in several states have introduced measures to classify the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol - which are used together in the majority of U.S. abortions - as controlled dangerous substances, making it a crime to possess them without prescriptions.\n\nLouisiana last year became the first state to adopt such a law, despite concerns from doctors who contended that the restrictions would make it harder for them to access the drugs to perform life-saving procedures.\n\nThe measures have been introduced in states where Republicans control the government and where there are bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions.\n\nThe legislation has died or appears unlikely to advance in Indiana and Mississippi.\n\nElsewhere - including Idaho, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas - it's too early to know whether they have a chance.\n\nIn Oklahoma, Gov. Kevin Stitt, a staunch opponent of abortion, has vowed to sign any anti-abortion measure that comes to his desk.\n\nAnd one scholar who follows abortion policy said that the bills can affect the debate even if they don't pick up momentum.\n\n\"The more often that they're introduced, the more normalized these sorts of bills and these sorts of concepts that they're pushing become,\" said Laura Hermer, a professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\nAuthorities in two states with stringent abortion laws have targeted a New York doctor for allegedly sending abortion pills to patients in those states.\n\nLast month, a Louisiana grand jury indicted Dr. Maggie Carpenter on charges of criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Carpenter in civil court under similar circumstances.\n\nThe legal actions set up a test of laws in some Democratic-controlled states, including New York, that seek to protect health care providers who use telehealth to prescribe and then mail abortion pills to patients in states where they're banned. New York officials say they will not extradite the doctor to Louisiana.\n\nSince Carpenter's indictment, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed a law that allows doctors to leave their names off prescription bottles for abortion pills as a way to further insulate them. Similar legislation has been introduced in Maine.\n\nThe attorneys general of Idaho, Kansas and Missouri are also suing in federal court to roll back federal approvals for mifepristone and bar prescriptions for it by telehealth.\n\nSome advocates are calling on President Donald Trump to enforce an 1873 law to ban mailing medication or instruments used in abortion, but he has not done so.\n\nWhile critics say the drugs are unsafe, some major medical groups disagree. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says there is decades of evidence that mifepristone and misoprostol are safe and effective. The group cited a study showing that major adverse events such as significant infection and excessive blood loss occur in less than 0.32% of patients taking mifepristone for a medication abortion. Medical organizations say mifepristone's safety compares to that of the over-the-counter pain medication ibuprofen.\n\nBills in several states would open the door to criminal charges against women who seek or obtain abortions on charges including murder.\n\nThat's a step no state has taken so far, and which leading anti-abortion groups such as Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America and the National Right to Life Committee oppose.\n\nStill, such bills have been introduced in Idaho and Indiana, where they're unlikely to advance, and Oklahoma, North Dakota and South Carolina, where they're all early in the legislative process.\n\nSouth Carolina state Sen. Richard Cash, the sponsor of a bill introduced last week that allows for punishing women who obtain abortions, said he's aware that national groups oppose that aspect of legislation. But he disagrees.\n\n\"The bill does not single out women by any means,\" he said in an interview. \"The bill simply acknowledges that if the unborn child is a human being, anyone involved in killing that human being should be held accountable to the law.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Rebecca Boone in Boise, Idaho; Kimberlee Kruesi in Nashville, Tennessee; Nadia Lathan in Austin, Texas; Sean Murphy in Oklahoma City; Laura Ungar Louisville, Kentucky; and Isabella Volmert in Lansing, Michigan, contributed to this article.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

As individual women\nconsulted with doctors, they made them understand their needs.

Indeed, it was physicians and lawyers who\ninitiated the earliest efforts to rewrite the abortion laws.

The nineteenth-century\nideology of \"separate spheres\" bifurcated the world into the \"public sphere,\"\nthe world of politics and business in which men lived, and the 'private\nsphere,\" the domestic world of women and children. The concept of separate\nspheres proved to be fruitful for women's historians and produced an abundance\nof important new insights and knowledge. Recently, however, women's historians\nhave questioned the idea of separate spheres both because it excluded the\nmajority of women who were working class or women of color and because it\ninaccurately described white middle-class life. The worlds of men and women no\nlonger appear to be as exclusive and separate as once thought: men lived in the\nprivate sphere too, and women walked on public streets, participated in\nbusiness, worked for wages, and intervened in political life; indeed, women\ncreated issues of national political importance. Of recently renewed\ntheoretical interest to a variety of scholars is the public sphere itself.\nHere, attention has been on the nature of the public sphere, its membership,\ndemocratic discourse, citizenship, and the formation of public opinion and\ndebate. This book challenges the dichotomy between public and private in another way.\nIt looks more toward the private sphere and finds interaction between what have\nbeen assumed to be two distinct spheres. The relationship between public and\nprivate is dynamic; it is not just that the public has invaded private life or\nthat excluded, politically unrecognized groups, including women, have found\nways to move into public life. Rather, during the period of this study, the\nprivate invaded the public. Abortion is an example of how private activities\nand conversations reshaped public policy. The words and needs of women had the\npower to change medicine, law, and public debate. The public sphere, moreover,\nwas not the only place where crucial communication and spirited debate\noccurred. They occurred in \"private\" arenas such as the home and the medical\noffice. Those conversations, generally designated \"private\" and thus irrelevant\nto public discourse, impacted debates in the public sphere and eventually\nchanged public policy. For over a century, women challenged public policy and\naltered medical thinking and practice through their conversation and activity\nin private arenas. I use the terms private and public , but with a\nsense of their ambiguity and interaction. Analysis of public policy should examine how policy has been implemented and\nby whom, rather than be narrowly restricted to federal legislation or agency\nactivity. Looking at statutes alone, or the actions of legislators or the\njudiciary, inhibits our view of how law works, how public policy is made, and\nwho acts on behalf of the state to enforce the law. Abortion serves as a case\nstudy for rethinking the nature of the state in the United States. Much of the\nregulation of abortion was carried out not by government agents, but by\nvoluntary agencies and individuals. The state expected the medical profession\nto assist in enforcing the law. It may be more accurate to think of the state\napparatus not as the government, but as consisting of official agencies that\nwork in conjunction with other semiofficial agencies. State officials, this\nhistory and others show, have often relied on \"private\" agents to act as part\nof the state. Feminist scholars in the 1970s tended to see the medical profession as the\nsource of the regulation of female sexuality and reproduction, but the medical\nprofession's role was more complex. This book shifts attention to the state's\ninterest in controlling abortion and the alliance between medicine and the\nstate. It would have been virtually impossible for the state to enforce the\ncriminal abortion laws without the cooperation of physicians. State officials\nwon medical cooperation in suppressing abortion by threatening doctors and\nmedical institutions with prosecution or scandal. Physicians learned to protect\nthemselves from legal trouble by reporting to officials women injured or dying\nas a result of illegal abortions. By the 1940s and 1950s, physicians and\nhospitals had become so accustomed to this regulatory stance toward women and\nabortion that they instituted new regulations to observe and curb the practice\nof abortion in the hospital. The medical profession and its institutions acted\nas an arm of the state. Yet the medical profession's position was contradictory. While physicians\nhelped control abortion, they too were brought under greater control. State\nofficials demanded that the profession police the practices of its members. The\nduty of self-policing and physicians' fears of prosecution for abortion created\ndilemmas for doctors who at times compromised their duties to patients in order\nto carry out their duties to the state. Furthermore, plenty of physicians provided abortions. This book points to the\npower of patients, even female patients, to influence and change medical\npractice. The widespread practice of abortion by physicians attests to both the\nability of patients to communicate their needs to physicians and the ability of\nphysicians to listen. Physicians' practices were shaped by the experiences and\nperspectives of private life, not only by professional antiabortion values. The\nphysician-patient relationship was often more close than distant. This was\nparticularly true in the early twentieth century, but became more class\nstratified as medicine became increasingly specialized and hospital oriented.\nMedicine was more of a negotiated terrain between physicians and patients than\nhas been realized. The peaks of the medical profession's public hostility to abortion have\nobscured the depth of medical involvement in abortion. The antiabortion stance\nof organized medicine should not be mistaken for an accurate representation of\nthe views and practices of the entire profession. This study views the medical\nprofession as complex and composed of competing groups with opposing views and\npractices rather than as a unified whole. The medical profession was not\nmonolithic, but divided in its attitude toward abortion and in its treatment of\npatients. This book differentiates between organized medicine and individual\nphysicians. By \"organized medicine,\" I mean medicine's institutional\nstructures, such as the American Medical Association (AMA) and other medical\nsocieties, medical schools, and hospitals that produced the official, public\nimage of the profession and acted in concert with the state. Furthermore, this\nstudy distinguishes between prescriptive commentary about medical practices, as\nfound in the medical literature, and actual practice by physicians. These\nofficial and instructional materials reveal the thought, and perhaps the\npractice, of only a few. Finally, attention to specialization is crucial.\nSpecialists played critical public roles in the history of abortion, their\ninterests and those of general practitioners were not identical. This book is the first to chart the nation's enforcement of the criminal\nabortion laws. To understand the power of law in the lives of the masses of\nAmericans requires that one take seriously the experiences of ordinary people\ncaught in criminal investigations. Thus it is necessary to analyze the\nprocesses and routine procedures of the legal system that shape those\nexperiences. Most historians of crime and punishment have focused on police and\nprisons, while historians of women and the law have focused mainly on marriage\nand property rights, not crime. Surprisingly little historical work has\nexamined the relationship between medicine and law. Few have studied law in\npractice. Analysis of the day-to-day workings of the legal system, rather than\nstatutory changes, judicial rulings, or the volume of cases, reveals how the\nlaw intervened in the lives of ordinary citizens to regulate reproductive and\nsexual behavior.\" Punishment for violation of the law and sexual norms has been gendered. In\nabortion cases, the investigative procedures themselves constituted a form of\npunishment and control for women. Publicity and public exposure of women's\ntransgressions further served as punishment. This form of punishment served, in\nMichel Foucault's words, as \"a school.\" The shame of public exposure was for\nall of \"the potentially guilty,\" not only the individual who had been caught.\nThis eighteenth-century mode of punishment, thought to have been replaced by\nthe surveillance of the prison, persisted in the state's response to women and\ntheir sexual crimes. Without analyzing gender, we cannot fully understand the\nsystems of punishment. Even as the abortion statutes remained the same through this period, the\nmeaning of the law and the legality and illegality of abortion changed over\ntime. Law is not fixed, but fluid. The criminal abortion laws passed in every\nstate by T880 made exceptions for therapeutic abortions performed in order to\nsave a woman's life. Because the laws governing abortion did not precisely\ndefine what was criminal and what was not, this had to be worked out in\npractice, in policing, and in the courts. The complexity of defining \"legal\"\nand \"illegal\" abortions for medical practitioners and legal authorities alike,\nthe gray and ever-shifting nature of \"criminality,\" is an important theme in\nthis book. Nor was medical understanding of therapeutic abortion stable.\nMedicine too is interpretive and changing. Throughout the period of illegal\nabortion, physicians disagreed on the conditions that mandated a therapeutic\nabortion and on the methods: there was no consensus. Changes in medicine\ninfluenced legal definitions of crime; at the same time, the law shaped medical\nthinking and practice. The medical profession and the legal profession each\nlooked to the other to define the legality of abortion practices. Therapeutic\nabortion became increasingly important in the 1930s; by the 1960s the practice\n(and nonpractice) of therapeutic abortion was at the very heart of the campaign\nto reform and repeal the criminal abortion laws. The illegality of abortion has hidden the existence of an unarticulated,\nalternative, popular morality, which supported women who had abortions. This\npopular ethic contradicted the law, the official attitude of the medical\nprofession, and the teachings of some religions. Private discussions among\nfamily and friends, conversations between women and doctors, and the behavior\nof women (and the people who aided them) suggest that traditional ideas that\naccepted early abortions endured into the twentieth century. Furthermore,\nthrough the 1920s at least, working-class women did not make a distinction\nbetween contraceptives and abortion. What I call a popular morality that\naccepted abortion was almost never publicly expressed but was rooted in\npeople's daily lives. Americans have a long history of accepting abortion in\ncertain situations as a necessity and as a decision that, implicitly, belongs\nto women to make. This popular attitude made itself felt in the courts and in\ndoctors' offices: prosecutors found it difficult to convict abortionists\nbecause juries regularly nullified the law by acquitting abortionists,  and few\nphysicians escaped the pressure from women for abortions. Throughout the period\nof illegal abortion, women asserted their need for abortion and, in doing so,\nimplicitly asserted their sense of having a right to control their own\nreproduction. I am not suggesting a \"gap\" between people's beliefs and their ability to live\nup to them, but different, even oppositional, moral perspectives. The values\nexpressed by ordinary people deserve to be taken seriously rather than\ncategorized and dismissed as sinful or mistaken. Though some felt guilt about\nabortion and found ways to justify their behavior, others never held the\nofficial antiabortion views. Prescribed morality and popular morality may not\nbe identical. Analysis of women's practices and ideas -- popular\nbehavior and\nbelief -- rather than exclusive focus on the statements of male\ntheologians and\nphilosophers suggests that it is incorrect to conclude that hostility to\nabortion is \"almost an absolute value in history.\" The reverse may be more\naccurate. Although this book takes note of religious teachings and the religious\nbackground of women who had abortions, it does not focus on religious opinion.\nOrganized religion had little interest in abortion until it entered the public,\npolitical arena in the late 1950s and early 1960s. There was no reason to\nenergetically fight abortion when, for nearly a century, abortion was a crime\nand no social movement suggested otherwise. From the 1920s on, however, there\nwas much religious interest in, and division over, another method of\nreproductive control: contraception. Birth control became a topic of interest\nbecause a movement advocated women's right to reproductive control. Further, it\nis incorrect to assume that the Catholic Church has always organized against\nabortion or that all Catholics subscribe to the views of their church leaders.\nIndeed, many Catholics shared what I have described as a popular ethic\naccepting abortion. A good history of religion and reproductive control would\nexamine not only theology and sermons, but also the attitudes and actions of\nthe congregations, with particular attention to women. Women who had abortions did so within a context of illegality and religious\ndisapproval, but the prohibitions were ambiguous. Christian traditions had\ntabooed abortion since antiquity, but the acceptance of abortion in order to\nsave the life of a pregnant woman had a long tradition as well. Until the\nmid-nineteenth century, the Catholic Church implicitly accepted early abortions\nprior to ensoulment. Not until T869, at about the same time that abortion\nbecame politicized in this country, did the church condemn abortion; in 1895,\nit condemned therapeutic abortion. Protestant churches accepted abortion when\npregnancy threatened a woman's life, a view shared by the medical profession\nand written into the nation's laws. Jewish tradition clearly viewed the woman's\nlife as primary. The Mishnah, a code of ancient Jewish law that guided later\nrabbinic thought, required abortion when childbirth threatened a woman's life,\nfor \"her life takes precedence over its life.\" This study points to the importance of studying the social history of\nsexuality as well as the medical and legal discourse about it. These discourses\nregarding abortion are important because they introduced new meanings of\nabortion and shaped people's views (and fears) of abortion and sexuality. I\nanalyze the language women used to describe abortion and the production of\nstories about abortion in the press and in the courtroom. Yet exclusive\nattention to professional or even popular discourse about abortion would result\nin a distorted picture of that history. Medical discourse has convinced some\nscholars that physicians did not perform abortions in the period of illegal\nabortion, and most press coverage of abortion in the early twentieth century\ngives the misleading impression that abortion was universally condemned and\ngenerally fatal. These conclusions are not correct. Analysis of discourse alone\nwould miss the ongoing medical practice of abortion in total contradiction of\nofficial medical mores. As others have pointed out, Foucault's theory\nconcerning the production of sexuality through discourse ignores differences in\nthe power of individuals and social groups to enter and shape discourse. The\npublicly articulated and published discussion of abortion rarely included the\nvoices or perspectives of women who had abortions, except to provide shocking\nexamples of depraved womanhood. Women who had abortions did not intervene to\nexplain themselves, but instead, in other nonpublic arenas, made their\nperspectives known and acted to obtain a much-needed method for preventing\nbirths. More tolerant attitudes toward abortion, rooted in material\nexperiences, persisted in the face of a public discourse that denounced it. The\nhistory of sexuality and reproduction demands a combined analysis of ideas and\npractice. Common Law and the Criminalization of Abortion Abortion was not always a crime. During the eighteenth and early nineteenth\ncenturies, abortion of early pregnancy was legal under common law. Abortions\nwere illegal only after \"quickening,\" the point at which a pregnant woman could\nfeel the movements of the fetus (approximately the fourth month of pregnancy).\nThe common law's attitude toward pregnancy and abortion was based on an\nunderstanding of pregnancy and human development as a process rather than an\nabsolute moment. Indeed, the term abortion referred only to the miscarriages of\nlater pregnancies, after quickening. What we would now identify as an early\ninduced abortion was not called an abortion at all. If an early pregnancy\nended, it had \"slipp[ed] away,\" or the menses had been \"restored.\" At\nconception and the earliest stage of pregnancy before quickening, no one\nbelieved that a human life existed; not even the Catholic Church took this\nview. Rather, the popular ethic regarding abortion and common law were grounded\nin the female experience of their own bodies. Colonial and early-nineteenth-century women, historians have learned,\nperceived conception as the \"blocking\" or \"obstructing\" of menstruation, which\nrequired attention. The cessation of the menses indicated a worrisome imbalance\nin the body and the need to bring the body back into balance by restoring the\nflow. This idea of menstruation corresponded with medical and popular\nunderstanding of sickness and health. The body was a delicate system of\nequilibrium that could easily be thrown out of balance -- by a change\nin weather\nor diet, for example -- and that then needed to be restored through active\nintervention. A disruption in the healthy body, in the worldview of patients\nand physicians, required a visible, often violent, physical response to\ntreatment in order to restore equilibrium. This theory underlay eighteenth and\nnineteenth-century regular medical practice, which emphasized heroic\nmeasures -- bleeding, blistering, purging, and puking -- in\nresponse to sickness.\nThe response to the blocking of the menses was part of this shared\nunderstanding of the body: women took drugs in order to make their menses\nregular and regarded the ensuing vomiting and evacuation as evidence of the\ndrugs' effective action. Restoring the menses was a domestic practice. The power of certain herbs to\nrestore menstruation was widely known. One colonial woman who feared pregnancy\nhad \"twice taken Savin; once boyled in milk and the other time strayned through\na Cloath.\" Savin, derived from juniper bushes, was the most popular\nabortifacient and easily acquired since junipers grew wild throughout the\ncountry. Other herbs used as abortifacients included pennyroyal, tansy, ergot,\nand seneca snakeroot. Slave women used cottonroot. Many of these useful plants\ncould be found in the woods or cultivated. in gardens, and women could refer to\nhome medical guides for recipes for \"bringing on the menses.\" Both of these concepts, blocked menses and quickening, must be taken seriously\nby late-twentieth-century observers. Blocked menses cannot be dismissed as an\nexcuse made by women who knew they were pregnant. Quickening was a moment\nrecognized by women and by law as a defining moment in human development. Once\nquickening occurred, women recognized a moral obligation to carry the fetus to\nterm. This age-old idea underpinned the practice of abortion in America. The\nlegal acceptance of induced miscarriages before quickening tacitly assumed that\nwomen had a basic right to bodily integrity. By the mid-eighteenth century, the most common means of inducing\nabortion -- by\ntaking drugs was commercialized. The availability of abortifacients was so\nwell-known that a common euphemism described their use. When Sarah Grosvenor, a\nConnecticut farm girl, confided to her sister in 1742 that she was \"taking the\ntrade,\" her sister understood. That Grosvenor successfully conveyed her meaning\nto her sister in three metaphoric words tells us a great deal about the world\nof mid-eighteenth-century New England. Many New Englanders, including these\nsisters, knew of the possibility of inducing an abortion by purchasing and\ningesting drugs. The need for a euphemism tells of the difficulty of speaking\nopenly about sex and reproductive control and of the need for secrecy. Yet it\nreveals an awareness that women could and did regulate their own fertility\nthrough abortion. Furthermore, abortifacients had become a profitable product\nsold by doctors, apothecaries, and other healers. The first statutes governing abortion in the United States, James Mohr has\nfound, were poison control measures designed to protect pregnant women like\nGrosvenor by controlling the sale of abortifacient drugs, which often killed\nthe women who took them. The proliferation of entrepreneurs who openly sold and\nadvertised abortifacients may have inspired this early legislation, passed in\nthe 1820s and 1830s. The 18 Illinois law, which prohibited the provision of\nabortifacients, was listed under \"poisoning.\" It is crucial to recognize what these early-nineteenth-century laws did not\ncover: they did not punish women for inducing abortions, and they did not\neliminate the concept of quickening. Even as poison control measures, they said\nnothing about growing the plants needed in one's own garden or mixing together\none's own home remedy in order to induce an abortion. The legal silence on\ndomestic practices suggests that the new laws were aimed at the\ncommercialization of this practice and, implicitly, retained to women the right\nto make their own decisions about their pregnancies before quickening. By the 1840s, the abortion business boomed. Despite the laws forbidding the\nsale of abortifacients, they were advertised in the popular press and could be\npurchased from physicians or pharmacists or through the mail. If drugs failed,\nwomen could go to a practitioner who specialized in performing instrumental\nabortions. Advertisements and newspaper exposes made it appear that what had\nbeen an occasional domestic practice had become a daily occurrence performed\nfor profit in northern cities. Madame Restell, for example, openly advertised\nand provided abortion services for thirty-five years. Restell began her\nabortion business in New York City in the late 1830s; by the mid-1840s, she had\noffices in Boston and Philadelphia and traveling agents who sold her \"Female\nMonthly Pills.\" Restell became the most infamous abortionist in the country,\nbut she was not the only abortionist. The clientele of these busy clinics were\nprimarily married, white, native-born Protestant women of the upper and middle\nclasses. In 1857, the newly organized AMA initiated a crusade to make abortion at every\nstage of pregnancy illegal. The antiabortion campaign grew in part, James Mohr\nhas shown, out of regular physicians' desire to win professional power, control\nmedical practice, and restrict their competitors, particularly Homeopaths and\nmidwives. \"Regular,\" or \"orthodox,\" physicians, practitioners of \"heroic\"\nmedicine, had come under attack in the 1820s and 1830s as elitist. They faced\ncompetition from a variety of practitioners from other medical sects,\ncollectively known as \"Irregulars.\" Through the 1870S, regular physicians\nacross the country worked for the passage of new criminal abortion laws. In\nsecuring criminal abortion laws, the Regulars won recognition of their\nparticular views as well as some state control over the practice of\nmedicine. Though professional issues underlay the medical campaign, gender, racial, and\nclass anxieties pushed the criminalization of abortion forward. The visible use\nof abortion by middle-class married women, in conjunction with other challenges\nto gender norms and changes in the social makeup of the nation, generated\nanxieties among American men of the same class. Birth rates among the Yankee\nclasses had declined by mid-century while immigrants poured into the country.\nAntiabortion activists pointed out that immigrant families, many of them\nCatholic, were larger and would soon outpopulate native-born white Yankees and\nthreaten their political power. Dr. Horatio R Storer, the leader of the medical\ncampaign against abortion, envisioned the spread of \"civilization\" west and\nsouth by native-born white Americans, not Mexicans, Chinese, Blacks, Indians,\nor Catholics. \"Shall\" these regions, he asked, \"be filled by our own children\nor by those of aliens? This is a question our women must answer; upon their\nloins depends the future destiny of the nation.\" Hostility to immigrants,\nCatholics, and people of color fueled this campaign to criminalize abortion.\nWhite male patriotism demanded that maternity be enforced among white\nProtestant women. The antiabortion campaign was antifeminist at its core. Women were condemned\nfor following \"fashion\" and for avoiding the self-sacrifice expected of\nmothers. \"The true wife,\" Storer declared, did not seek `'undue power in public\nlife, . . . undue control in domestic affairs, . . . [or] privileges not her\nown.\" The antiabortion campaign was a reactionary response to two important\nefforts of the nineteenth-century women's movements: the fight to admit women\ninto the regular medical profession and the battle to make men conform to a\nsingle standard of sexual behavior. The antiabortion campaign coincided with\nthe fight by male Regulars to keep women out of their medical schools,\nsocieties, and hospitals. Boston and Harvard University, Storer's hometown and\nalma mater, were key sites of struggle over women's place in medicine, and\nStorer was personally engaged in the battle against female physicians.\nAdvocates of women in medicine argued that women doctors would protect women\npatients from sexual violation. Regular male doctors degraded female physicians\nby accusing them, along with midwives, of performing abortions. The relative morality of men and women was of crucial importance to this\ncampaign. For the specialists, whose interest in the female reproductive system\nraised questions about their sexual morality, the antiabortion campaign was a\nway to proclaim their own high morality in contrast to their competitors, their\nfemale patients, and even the ministers who tolerated abortion. It was at the\nsame time a backlash against the women's movement's critique of male sexual\nbehavior and feminist claims to political power. Nineteenth-century feminists\nexpressed their anger with male sexual domination and promiscuity in a number\nof movements, including the campaigns against prostitution and slavery and the\nfight for temperance. All sections of the women's movement advocated \"voluntary\nmotherhood,\" a slogan that addressed both men's sexual violation of their wives\nand women's desire to control childbearing. Women saw themselves as morally\nsuperior and urged men to adopt a single standard  --  the female\nstandard of\nchastity until marriage, followed by monogamy and moderation. The campaign\nagainst abortion challenged this feminist analysis of men by condemning women\nfor having abortions. Indeed, Storer compared abortion to prostitution and, in\nso doing, called into question all claims made by middle-class\nnineteenth-century women on the basis of moral superiority. \"There is little\ndifference,\" he proclaimed, \"between the immorality\" of the man who visited\nprostitutes and the woman who aborted. The nineteenth-century women's movements\nnever defended abortion, but activist women and women doctors were blamed for\nthe practice of abortion nonetheless. The antiabortion campaign attempted to destroy the idea of quickening. As\nphysicians targeted quickening, they discredited women's experiences of\npregnancy and claimed pregnancy as medical terrain. \"Quickening,\" as Storer\ndescribed it, \"is in fact but a sensation.\" A sensation that had emotional,\nsocial, and legal meaning was thus denigrated. Quickening was based on women's\nown bodily sensations -- not on medical diagnosis. It made physicians, and\nobstetricians in particular, dependent on female self-diagnosis and judgment.\nQuickening could not be relied upon as an indicator of fetal life because,\nStorer argued, it did not occur at a standard moment. \"Many women never quicken\nat all,\" he joked about women's perceptions, \"though their children are born\nliving.\" Storer's propaganda aimed to erase the distinctions between earlier\nand later stages of pregnancy, thereby redefining the restoration of the\nmenses. What had previously been understood as a blockage and a restoration of\nthe menses prior to quickening was now associated with inducing a miscarriage\nafter quickening by labeling it abortion. Furthermore, Storer equated abortion\nwith infanticide. Regular medical men had entered the debate about sexual politics by attacking\nthe female practice of abortion as immoral, unwomanly, and unpatriotic. In\ngiving abortion new meaning, the Regulars provided a weapon that white,\nnative-born, male legislators could use against the women of their own class\nwho had been agitating for personal and political reform. Regular physicians\nwon passage of new criminal abortion laws because their campaign appealed to a\nset of fears of white, nativeborn, male elites about losing political power to\nCatholic immigrants and to women. Class privilege did not protect middle-class\nwhite women from public policy designed to control them. Although the\ncriminalization of abortion was aimed at middle-class white women, it affected\nwomen of every class and race. The new laws passed across the country between\n1860 and 1880 regarded abortion in an entirely different light from common law\nand the statutes regulating abortifacients. In general, the laws included two\ninnovations: they eliminated the common-law idea of quickening and prohibited\nabortion at any point in pregnancy. Some included punishment for the women who\nhad abortions. The \"Comstock Law\" passed in 1873 included abortion and birth\ncontrol in federal antiobscenity legislation; states and municipalities passed\nsimilar ordinances. The antiabortion laws made one exception: physicians could perform therapeutic\nabortions if pregnancy and childbirth threatened the woman's life. A bill\ncriminalizing abortion unless done for \" bona fide medical or surgical\npurposes\" passed the Illinois state legislature unanimously and was signed into\nlaw in 1867. A few years later, Illinois passed another law prohibiting the\nsale of abortifacients but made an exception for \"the written prescription of\nsome well known and respectable practicing physician.\" Physicians had won the\ncriminalization of abortion and retained to themselves alone the right to\ninduce abortions when they determined it necessary. Through the antiabortion campaign, doctors claimed scientific authority to\ndefine life and death. In so doing, they claimed the authority of religious\nleaders. In leading this moral crusade and thoroughly criticizing the\nministry's lack of interest in abortion, regular doctors set themselves above\nreligious leaders as well as above the general populace. The medical\nprofession's claim to moral purity and the authority of the clergy was a\nstepping-stone to greater social authority. Regular physicians won an important\nvictory when they persuaded the nation's states to criminalize abortion.\nPhysicians entered a new partnership with the state and won the power to set\nreproductive policy. In the process, women's perceptions of pregnancy were\ndelegitimated and women lost what had been a common-law right. Periodization: Changing Patterns of Illegal Abortion During the more than one hundred years that abortion was illegal in the United\nStates, the patterns; practice, policing, and politics of abortion all changed\nover time, though not always simultaneously. I trace the history along several\nlines at once, according to the location, practice, and availability of\nabortion as well as its regulation. Abortion was widely available throughout\nmuch of the era when abortion was a crime. Yet periods of tolerance were\npunctuated by moments of severe repression. At some points the changing\nstructure of medicine brought about crucial changes in the history of abortion;\nat others, changes in women's lives or the political and economic context came\nto the fore. In the nineteenth century, abortion came under attack at a moment when women\nwere claiming political power; in the twentieth century, it came under attack\nwhen they claimed sexual freedom. Abortion, like contraception, means that\nwomen can separate sex and procreation -- still a controversial notion.\nAntiabortion campaigns developed when women asserted sexual independence, as\nduring the Progressive Era and since the 1970s. When abortion was most firmly\nlinked to the needs of family rather than the freedoms of women, as during the\nDepression, it was most ignored by those who would suppress it. Periods of\nantiabortion activity mark moments of hostility to female independence. The epoch of illegal abortion may be broken down into four periods. The first\ncovers the time from the criminalization of abortion state-by-state,\naccomplished nationwide by 1880, to 1930. This period, covering fifty years, is\nheavily marked by continuity. As other historians have also found, the\nreproductive lives of most women and the day-to-day practice of most physicians\nchanged slowly. In this period, abortion was widely accepted and was practiced\nin women's homes and in the offices of physicians and midwives. The diversity\nof practitioners, the privacy of medical practice, and the autonomy of\nphysicians in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries made the\nwidespread medical practice of abortion possible. A crackdown on abortion\noccurred between 1890 and 1920 as specialists in obstetrics renewed the earlier\ncampaign against abortion, and the medical profession was drawn into the\nstate's enforcement system. The structural transformation that occurred during the 1930s, the second\nperiod, was crucial for the history of abortion. Abortion became more available\nand changed location. As the practice moved from private offices and homes to\nhospitals and clinics, abortion was consolidated in medical hands and became\nmore visible. The changes wrought by the Depression accelerated the pace of\nchange in the coming decades, particularly in the methods of enforcing the\ncriminal abortion laws. The third period was marked by increasing restrictions on abortion by state\nand medical authorities and intensifying demand for abortion from women of all\ngroups. This period begins in 1940, when the new methods of controlling\nabortion were first instituted, and continues through 1973, when they were\ndismantled. In reaction to the growing practice of abortion as well as apparent\nchanges in female gender and reproductive patterns, a backlash against abortion\ndeveloped. 1940 marks a dividing line as hospitals instituted new policies, and\npolice and prosecutors changed their tactics. The repression of abortion was\npart of the repression of political and personal deviance that took place in\nthe 1940s and 1950s. Yet even in this period, the practice of abortion expanded\nin new directions in response to relentless demand. The new repression of\nabortion, however, was devastating for women. A dual system of abortion,\ndivided by race and class, developed. During the postwar period, the\ncriminalization of abortion produced its harshest results. A new stage in the history of abortion, the movement to legalize it, overlaps\nwith the third period. The movement to decriminalize abortion began in the\nmid-1950s and arose out of the difficult experiences resulting from the\nrepression of abortion in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1950s, a handful of\nphysicians began to challenge the very abortion laws their profession had\nadvocated a century earlier. The progress of that challenge attests to the\ncontinuing power of the medical profession to make public policy regarding\nreproduction. As legal reform moved forward, a new feminist movement arose,\nwhich radically transformed the movement for legal change. When the women's\nmovement described abortion as an aspect of sexual freedom, they articulated a\nnew feminist meaning for abortion; when they demanded abortion as a right, they\nechoed generations of women. The structure of this book follows this periodization. The first half of the\nbook uncovers the history of abortion from the late nineteenth century through\nthe 1920s. Chapters 1 through 4 each cover different aspects of abortion, from\nwomen's lives to practice to politics to enforcement, during the first\nhalf-century of illegal abortion. The changes of the 1930S, both medical and\nsocial, precipitated other changes. The second half of the book traces the\nhistory of abortion in chronologically ordered chapters concluding with the\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions that ended the era of illegal abortion. Women's history of abortion needs to be examined both as a commonly felt need\nto control reproduction, arising from women's biological capacity to bear\nchildren and social relations that assign childbearing to women, and in terms\nof differences among women. This book differentiates among women by class, race\nand ethnic identity, and marital status. Though class did not absolutely\ndetermine access to or safety of abortion, class position helped define when a\nwoman felt she needed an abortion and affected the type available to her. In\ngeneral, urban women had greater access to abortion than rural women, though\nsome rural women located abortionists in their areas or traveled to cities for\nabortions. Race played a less obvious role in access to abortion, though the\ngrim statistics of the postwar period show the connection between\ndiscrimination and death. I have made a specific effort to locate sources\nrelated to African Americans in order to learn more about black women's use of\nabortion and how race shaped the history of abortion. Evidence concerning women\nof color is meager, however, until the 1930s, when medical and sociological\nstudies began separating their findings by race. Before then, contemporary\nobservers tended to focus their attention on the differences among many (white)\nforeign-born ethnic groups. This book integrates a national analysis of the history of abortion with a\nlocal study. The advantage of this approach is that it connects everyday life\nand local medical and legal practice to national policy. It examines that\nrelationship rather than assuming that all the public policy action takes place\non the federal level without reference to local and \"private\" events. I select\na major metropolis in order to uncover the nature of both abortion practices\nand police enforcement of the criminal abortion laws. Chicago, the second\nlargest city in the nation, is the focus of my local study. Chicago, the city\nin \"the heartland\" that has of ten served as a metaphor for the spirit of\nAmerica, was also known as an important medical center (the home of the AMA)\nand as a regional center for abortion. Trains brought European immigrants, men\nand women migrating from farms to the city, African Americans moving from the\nSouth to the North, all going to live and work in Chicago. The same trains\nbrought women looking for abortions. Directing my attention to one city enabled\nme to uncover the nitty-gritty details of the practice and regulation of\nabortion. Though much of my analysis of the history of abortion draws on Chicago as a\ncase study, sources verify that my findings hold true for other cities, large\nand small. Throughout I present national data and trends as well as regional\nones and take note of patterns elsewhere. The book moves back and forth from a\nnational overview of abortion practices and politics to a close look at events\nin Chicago. As medical practice became more standardized in hospitals, the\nstory becomes a more national one and key events take place in other cities:\nNew York, Detroit, Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington, D.C.,\nand elsewhere. This is primarily a study of abortion in urban areas, where\nabortion was concentrated. I comment occasionally on practices in rural areas,\nbut the history of reproductive control and abortion is likely to be somewhat\ndifferent there. Legal records, most notably lower-level court and criminal trial records, and\nmedical literature make up the foundation of my research. I have also surveyed\nother government documents, newspapers, popular periodicals, hospital records,\nand manuscript collections. Using these materials, I have delineated how\nmedical thinking and state regulation have changed over time. Yet this is more\nthan a study of prescriptive literature or policy. I have uncovered the\ncircumstances of hundreds of actual induced abortions and reconstructed\nchanging abortion practices. This study periodizes the history of abortion for\nthe first time. This book presents the lives of many women and their abortions in rich detail\nin order to convey the variety and intricacy of the situations that made\nabortion necessary for women. It is in the minutiae of women's lives that we\ncan discover why women had abortions and how they won sympathy from physicians\nwho belonged to a profession dedicated to fighting abortion. Abortion was a\nmoment in a woman's reproductive life. It cannot be separated from sexual\nrelations or reproduction as a whole. Women themselves did not separate them,\nnor should we, whether analyzing abortion in the past or present. This book\ndeepens our understanding of the female experience of reproduction and the\nconnections between sexuality, contraception, pregnancy, and childbirth. At its\nmost fundamental, a policy that restricts abortion is one that forces women\ninto maternity. Without contraceptives and abortion, most women in heterosexual\nrelationships will become pregnant and bear children, whether they want to or\nnot. When women sought abortions, they often revealed the texture of\nheterosexual relations and the rest of their lives. Many situations made\nenduring pregnancy unbearable to women. In using abortion, women rebelled\nagainst the law and asserted their sense that the decision to carry a pregnancy\nto term or to abort was theirs to make. A few expressed in words as well as in\naction the view that abortion was their right. The experiences of women's\nprivate lives and private practices over the course of one hundred years\naltered medical thinking and reshaped public policy. Despite the fact that\nwomen's abortion narratives are part of our own contemporary discourse, the\nstories told here have long been hidden. Copyright © 1996  by the Regents of the University of California.\n\nThis book challenges the dichotomy between public and private in another way.\nIt looks more toward the private sphere and finds interaction between what have\nbeen assumed to be two distinct spheres. The relationship between public and\nprivate is dynamic; it is not just that the public has invaded private life or\nthat excluded, politically unrecognized groups, including women, have found\nways to move into public life. Rather, during the period of this study, the\nprivate invaded the public. Abortion is an example of how private activities\nand conversations reshaped public policy. The words and needs of women had the\npower to change medicine, law, and public debate. The public sphere, moreover,\nwas not the only place where crucial communication and spirited debate\noccurred. They occurred in \"private\" arenas such as the home and the medical\noffice. Those conversations, generally designated \"private\" and thus irrelevant\nto public discourse, impacted debates in the public sphere and eventually\nchanged public policy. For over a century, women challenged public policy and\naltered medical thinking and practice through their conversation and activity\nin private arenas. I use the terms private and public , but with a\nsense of their ambiguity and interaction. Analysis of public policy should examine how policy has been implemented and\nby whom, rather than be narrowly restricted to federal legislation or agency\nactivity. Looking at statutes alone, or the actions of legislators or the\njudiciary, inhibits our view of how law works, how public policy is made, and\nwho acts on behalf of the state to enforce the law. Abortion serves as a case\nstudy for rethinking the nature of the state in the United States. Much of the\nregulation of abortion was carried out not by government agents, but by\nvoluntary agencies and individuals. The state expected the medical profession\nto assist in enforcing the law. It may be more accurate to think of the state\napparatus not as the government, but as consisting of official agencies that\nwork in conjunction with other semiofficial agencies. State officials, this\nhistory and others show, have often relied on \"private\" agents to act as part\nof the state. Feminist scholars in the 1970s tended to see the medical profession as the\nsource of the regulation of female sexuality and reproduction, but the medical\nprofession's role was more complex. This book shifts attention to the state's\ninterest in controlling abortion and the alliance between medicine and the\nstate. It would have been virtually impossible for the state to enforce the\ncriminal abortion laws without the cooperation of physicians. State officials\nwon medical cooperation in suppressing abortion by threatening doctors and\nmedical institutions with prosecution or scandal. Physicians learned to protect\nthemselves from legal trouble by reporting to officials women injured or dying\nas a result of illegal abortions. By the 1940s and 1950s, physicians and\nhospitals had become so accustomed to this regulatory stance toward women and\nabortion that they instituted new regulations to observe and curb the practice\nof abortion in the hospital. The medical profession and its institutions acted\nas an arm of the state. Yet the medical profession's position was contradictory. While physicians\nhelped control abortion, they too were brought under greater control. State\nofficials demanded that the profession police the practices of its members. The\nduty of self-policing and physicians' fears of prosecution for abortion created\ndilemmas for doctors who at times compromised their duties to patients in order\nto carry out their duties to the state. Furthermore, plenty of physicians provided abortions. This book points to the\npower of patients, even female patients, to influence and change medical\npractice. The widespread practice of abortion by physicians attests to both the\nability of patients to communicate their needs to physicians and the ability of\nphysicians to listen. Physicians' practices were shaped by the experiences and\nperspectives of private life, not only by professional antiabortion values. The\nphysician-patient relationship was often more close than distant. This was\nparticularly true in the early twentieth century, but became more class\nstratified as medicine became increasingly specialized and hospital oriented.\nMedicine was more of a negotiated terrain between physicians and patients than\nhas been realized. The peaks of the medical profession's public hostility to abortion have\nobscured the depth of medical involvement in abortion. The antiabortion stance\nof organized medicine should not be mistaken for an accurate representation of\nthe views and practices of the entire profession. This study views the medical\nprofession as complex and composed of competing groups with opposing views and\npractices rather than as a unified whole. The medical profession was not\nmonolithic, but divided in its attitude toward abortion and in its treatment of\npatients. This book differentiates between organized medicine and individual\nphysicians. By \"organized medicine,\" I mean medicine's institutional\nstructures, such as the American Medical Association (AMA) and other medical\nsocieties, medical schools, and hospitals that produced the official, public\nimage of the profession and acted in concert with the state. Furthermore, this\nstudy distinguishes between prescriptive commentary about medical practices, as\nfound in the medical literature, and actual practice by physicians. These\nofficial and instructional materials reveal the thought, and perhaps the\npractice, of only a few. Finally, attention to specialization is crucial.\nSpecialists played critical public roles in the history of abortion, their\ninterests and those of general practitioners were not identical. This book is the first to chart the nation's enforcement of the criminal\nabortion laws. To understand the power of law in the lives of the masses of\nAmericans requires that one take seriously the experiences of ordinary people\ncaught in criminal investigations. Thus it is necessary to analyze the\nprocesses and routine procedures of the legal system that shape those\nexperiences. Most historians of crime and punishment have focused on police and\nprisons, while historians of women and the law have focused mainly on marriage\nand property rights, not crime. Surprisingly little historical work has\nexamined the relationship between medicine and law. Few have studied law in\npractice. Analysis of the day-to-day workings of the legal system, rather than\nstatutory changes, judicial rulings, or the volume of cases, reveals how the\nlaw intervened in the lives of ordinary citizens to regulate reproductive and\nsexual behavior.\" Punishment for violation of the law and sexual norms has been gendered. In\nabortion cases, the investigative procedures themselves constituted a form of\npunishment and control for women. Publicity and public exposure of women's\ntransgressions further served as punishment. This form of punishment served, in\nMichel Foucault's words, as \"a school.\" The shame of public exposure was for\nall of \"the potentially guilty,\" not only the individual who had been caught.\nThis eighteenth-century mode of punishment, thought to have been replaced by\nthe surveillance of the prison, persisted in the state's response to women and\ntheir sexual crimes. Without analyzing gender, we cannot fully understand the\nsystems of punishment. Even as the abortion statutes remained the same through this period, the\nmeaning of the law and the legality and illegality of abortion changed over\ntime. Law is not fixed, but fluid. The criminal abortion laws passed in every\nstate by T880 made exceptions for therapeutic abortions performed in order to\nsave a woman's life. Because the laws governing abortion did not precisely\ndefine what was criminal and what was not, this had to be worked out in\npractice, in policing, and in the courts. The complexity of defining \"legal\"\nand \"illegal\" abortions for medical practitioners and legal authorities alike,\nthe gray and ever-shifting nature of \"criminality,\" is an important theme in\nthis book. Nor was medical understanding of therapeutic abortion stable.\nMedicine too is interpretive and changing. Throughout the period of illegal\nabortion, physicians disagreed on the conditions that mandated a therapeutic\nabortion and on the methods: there was no consensus. Changes in medicine\ninfluenced legal definitions of crime; at the same time, the law shaped medical\nthinking and practice. The medical profession and the legal profession each\nlooked to the other to define the legality of abortion practices. Therapeutic\nabortion became increasingly important in the 1930s; by the 1960s the practice\n(and nonpractice) of therapeutic abortion was at the very heart of the campaign\nto reform and repeal the criminal abortion laws. The illegality of abortion has hidden the existence of an unarticulated,\nalternative, popular morality, which supported women who had abortions. This\npopular ethic contradicted the law, the official attitude of the medical\nprofession, and the teachings of some religions. Private discussions among\nfamily and friends, conversations between women and doctors, and the behavior\nof women (and the people who aided them) suggest that traditional ideas that\naccepted early abortions endured into the twentieth century. Furthermore,\nthrough the 1920s at least, working-class women did not make a distinction\nbetween contraceptives and abortion. What I call a popular morality that\naccepted abortion was almost never publicly expressed but was rooted in\npeople's daily lives. Americans have a long history of accepting abortion in\ncertain situations as a necessity and as a decision that, implicitly, belongs\nto women to make. This popular attitude made itself felt in the courts and in\ndoctors' offices: prosecutors found it difficult to convict abortionists\nbecause juries regularly nullified the law by acquitting abortionists,  and few\nphysicians escaped the pressure from women for abortions. Throughout the period\nof illegal abortion, women asserted their need for abortion and, in doing so,\nimplicitly asserted their sense of having a right to control their own\nreproduction. I am not suggesting a \"gap\" between people's beliefs and their ability to live\nup to them, but different, even oppositional, moral perspectives. The values\nexpressed by ordinary people deserve to be taken seriously rather than\ncategorized and dismissed as sinful or mistaken. Though some felt guilt about\nabortion and found ways to justify their behavior, others never held the\nofficial antiabortion views. Prescribed morality and popular morality may not\nbe identical. Analysis of women's practices and ideas -- popular\nbehavior and\nbelief -- rather than exclusive focus on the statements of male\ntheologians and\nphilosophers suggests that it is incorrect to conclude that hostility to\nabortion is \"almost an absolute value in history.\" The reverse may be more\naccurate. Although this book takes note of religious teachings and the religious\nbackground of women who had abortions, it does not focus on religious opinion.\nOrganized religion had little interest in abortion until it entered the public,\npolitical arena in the late 1950s and early 1960s. There was no reason to\nenergetically fight abortion when, for nearly a century, abortion was a crime\nand no social movement suggested otherwise. From the 1920s on, however, there\nwas much religious interest in, and division over, another method of\nreproductive control: contraception. Birth control became a topic of interest\nbecause a movement advocated women's right to reproductive control. Further, it\nis incorrect to assume that the Catholic Church has always organized against\nabortion or that all Catholics subscribe to the views of their church leaders.\nIndeed, many Catholics shared what I have described as a popular ethic\naccepting abortion. A good history of religion and reproductive control would\nexamine not only theology and sermons, but also the attitudes and actions of\nthe congregations, with particular attention to women. Women who had abortions did so within a context of illegality and religious\ndisapproval, but the prohibitions were ambiguous. Christian traditions had\ntabooed abortion since antiquity, but the acceptance of abortion in order to\nsave the life of a pregnant woman had a long tradition as well. Until the\nmid-nineteenth century, the Catholic Church implicitly accepted early abortions\nprior to ensoulment. Not until T869, at about the same time that abortion\nbecame politicized in this country, did the church condemn abortion; in 1895,\nit condemned therapeutic abortion. Protestant churches accepted abortion when\npregnancy threatened a woman's life, a view shared by the medical profession\nand written into the nation's laws. Jewish tradition clearly viewed the woman's\nlife as primary. The Mishnah, a code of ancient Jewish law that guided later\nrabbinic thought, required abortion when childbirth threatened a woman's life,\nfor \"her life takes precedence over its life.\" This study points to the importance of studying the social history of\nsexuality as well as the medical and legal discourse about it. These discourses\nregarding abortion are important because they introduced new meanings of\nabortion and shaped people's views (and fears) of abortion and sexuality. I\nanalyze the language women used to describe abortion and the production of\nstories about abortion in the press and in the courtroom. Yet exclusive\nattention to professional or even popular discourse about abortion would result\nin a distorted picture of that history. Medical discourse has convinced some\nscholars that physicians did not perform abortions in the period of illegal\nabortion, and most press coverage of abortion in the early twentieth century\ngives the misleading impression that abortion was universally condemned and\ngenerally fatal. These conclusions are not correct. Analysis of discourse alone\nwould miss the ongoing medical practice of abortion in total contradiction of\nofficial medical mores. As others have pointed out, Foucault's theory\nconcerning the production of sexuality through discourse ignores differences in\nthe power of individuals and social groups to enter and shape discourse. The\npublicly articulated and published discussion of abortion rarely included the\nvoices or perspectives of women who had abortions, except to provide shocking\nexamples of depraved womanhood. Women who had abortions did not intervene to\nexplain themselves, but instead, in other nonpublic arenas, made their\nperspectives known and acted to obtain a much-needed method for preventing\nbirths. More tolerant attitudes toward abortion, rooted in material\nexperiences, persisted in the face of a public discourse that denounced it. The\nhistory of sexuality and reproduction demands a combined analysis of ideas and\npractice. Common Law and the Criminalization of Abortion Abortion was not always a crime. During the eighteenth and early nineteenth\ncenturies, abortion of early pregnancy was legal under common law. Abortions\nwere illegal only after \"quickening,\" the point at which a pregnant woman could\nfeel the movements of the fetus (approximately the fourth month of pregnancy).\nThe common law's attitude toward pregnancy and abortion was based on an\nunderstanding of pregnancy and human development as a process rather than an\nabsolute moment. Indeed, the term abortion referred only to the miscarriages of\nlater pregnancies, after quickening. What we would now identify as an early\ninduced abortion was not called an abortion at all. If an early pregnancy\nended, it had \"slipp[ed] away,\" or the menses had been \"restored.\" At\nconception and the earliest stage of pregnancy before quickening, no one\nbelieved that a human life existed; not even the Catholic Church took this\nview. Rather, the popular ethic regarding abortion and common law were grounded\nin the female experience of their own bodies. Colonial and early-nineteenth-century women, historians have learned,\nperceived conception as the \"blocking\" or \"obstructing\" of menstruation, which\nrequired attention. The cessation of the menses indicated a worrisome imbalance\nin the body and the need to bring the body back into balance by restoring the\nflow. This idea of menstruation corresponded with medical and popular\nunderstanding of sickness and health. The body was a delicate system of\nequilibrium that could easily be thrown out of balance -- by a change\nin weather\nor diet, for example -- and that then needed to be restored through active\nintervention. A disruption in the healthy body, in the worldview of patients\nand physicians, required a visible, often violent, physical response to\ntreatment in order to restore equilibrium. This theory underlay eighteenth and\nnineteenth-century regular medical practice, which emphasized heroic\nmeasures -- bleeding, blistering, purging, and puking -- in\nresponse to sickness.\nThe response to the blocking of the menses was part of this shared\nunderstanding of the body: women took drugs in order to make their menses\nregular and regarded the ensuing vomiting and evacuation as evidence of the\ndrugs' effective action. Restoring the menses was a domestic practice. The power of certain herbs to\nrestore menstruation was widely known. One colonial woman who feared pregnancy\nhad \"twice taken Savin; once boyled in milk and the other time strayned through\na Cloath.\" Savin, derived from juniper bushes, was the most popular\nabortifacient and easily acquired since junipers grew wild throughout the\ncountry. Other herbs used as abortifacients included pennyroyal, tansy, ergot,\nand seneca snakeroot. Slave women used cottonroot. Many of these useful plants\ncould be found in the woods or cultivated. in gardens, and women could refer to\nhome medical guides for recipes for \"bringing on the menses.\" Both of these concepts, blocked menses and quickening, must be taken seriously\nby late-twentieth-century observers. Blocked menses cannot be dismissed as an\nexcuse made by women who knew they were pregnant. Quickening was a moment\nrecognized by women and by law as a defining moment in human development. Once\nquickening occurred, women recognized a moral obligation to carry the fetus to\nterm. This age-old idea underpinned the practice of abortion in America. The\nlegal acceptance of induced miscarriages before quickening tacitly assumed that\nwomen had a basic right to bodily integrity. By the mid-eighteenth century, the most common means of inducing\nabortion -- by\ntaking drugs was commercialized. The availability of abortifacients was so\nwell-known that a common euphemism described their use. When Sarah Grosvenor, a\nConnecticut farm girl, confided to her sister in 1742 that she was \"taking the\ntrade,\" her sister understood. That Grosvenor successfully conveyed her meaning\nto her sister in three metaphoric words tells us a great deal about the world\nof mid-eighteenth-century New England. Many New Englanders, including these\nsisters, knew of the possibility of inducing an abortion by purchasing and\ningesting drugs. The need for a euphemism tells of the difficulty of speaking\nopenly about sex and reproductive control and of the need for secrecy. Yet it\nreveals an awareness that women could and did regulate their own fertility\nthrough abortion. Furthermore, abortifacients had become a profitable product\nsold by doctors, apothecaries, and other healers. The first statutes governing abortion in the United States, James Mohr has\nfound, were poison control measures designed to protect pregnant women like\nGrosvenor by controlling the sale of abortifacient drugs, which often killed\nthe women who took them. The proliferation of entrepreneurs who openly sold and\nadvertised abortifacients may have inspired this early legislation, passed in\nthe 1820s and 1830s. The 18 Illinois law, which prohibited the provision of\nabortifacients, was listed under \"poisoning.\" It is crucial to recognize what these early-nineteenth-century laws did not\ncover: they did not punish women for inducing abortions, and they did not\neliminate the concept of quickening. Even as poison control measures, they said\nnothing about growing the plants needed in one's own garden or mixing together\none's own home remedy in order to induce an abortion. The legal silence on\ndomestic practices suggests that the new laws were aimed at the\ncommercialization of this practice and, implicitly, retained to women the right\nto make their own decisions about their pregnancies before quickening. By the 1840s, the abortion business boomed. Despite the laws forbidding the\nsale of abortifacients, they were advertised in the popular press and could be\npurchased from physicians or pharmacists or through the mail. If drugs failed,\nwomen could go to a practitioner who specialized in performing instrumental\nabortions. Advertisements and newspaper exposes made it appear that what had\nbeen an occasional domestic practice had become a daily occurrence performed\nfor profit in northern cities. Madame Restell, for example, openly advertised\nand provided abortion services for thirty-five years. Restell began her\nabortion business in New York City in the late 1830s; by the mid-1840s, she had\noffices in Boston and Philadelphia and traveling agents who sold her \"Female\nMonthly Pills.\" Restell became the most infamous abortionist in the country,\nbut she was not the only abortionist. The clientele of these busy clinics were\nprimarily married, white, native-born Protestant women of the upper and middle\nclasses. In 1857, the newly organized AMA initiated a crusade to make abortion at every\nstage of pregnancy illegal. The antiabortion campaign grew in part, James Mohr\nhas shown, out of regular physicians' desire to win professional power, control\nmedical practice, and restrict their competitors, particularly Homeopaths and\nmidwives. \"Regular,\" or \"orthodox,\" physicians, practitioners of \"heroic\"\nmedicine, had come under attack in the 1820s and 1830s as elitist. They faced\ncompetition from a variety of practitioners from other medical sects,\ncollectively known as \"Irregulars.\" Through the 1870S, regular physicians\nacross the country worked for the passage of new criminal abortion laws. In\nsecuring criminal abortion laws, the Regulars won recognition of their\nparticular views as well as some state control over the practice of\nmedicine. Though professional issues underlay the medical campaign, gender, racial, and\nclass anxieties pushed the criminalization of abortion forward. The visible use\nof abortion by middle-class married women, in conjunction with other challenges\nto gender norms and changes in the social makeup of the nation, generated\nanxieties among American men of the same class. Birth rates among the Yankee\nclasses had declined by mid-century while immigrants poured into the country.\nAntiabortion activists pointed out that immigrant families, many of them\nCatholic, were larger and would soon outpopulate native-born white Yankees and\nthreaten their political power. Dr. Horatio R Storer, the leader of the medical\ncampaign against abortion, envisioned the spread of \"civilization\" west and\nsouth by native-born white Americans, not Mexicans, Chinese, Blacks, Indians,\nor Catholics. \"Shall\" these regions, he asked, \"be filled by our own children\nor by those of aliens? This is a question our women must answer; upon their\nloins depends the future destiny of the nation.\" Hostility to immigrants,\nCatholics, and people of color fueled this campaign to criminalize abortion.\nWhite male patriotism demanded that maternity be enforced among white\nProtestant women. The antiabortion campaign was antifeminist at its core. Women were condemned\nfor following \"fashion\" and for avoiding the self-sacrifice expected of\nmothers. \"The true wife,\" Storer declared, did not seek `'undue power in public\nlife, . . . undue control in domestic affairs, . . . [or] privileges not her\nown.\" The antiabortion campaign was a reactionary response to two important\nefforts of the nineteenth-century women's movements: the fight to admit women\ninto the regular medical profession and the battle to make men conform to a\nsingle standard of sexual behavior. The antiabortion campaign coincided with\nthe fight by male Regulars to keep women out of their medical schools,\nsocieties, and hospitals. Boston and Harvard University, Storer's hometown and\nalma mater, were key sites of struggle over women's place in medicine, and\nStorer was personally engaged in the battle against female physicians.\nAdvocates of women in medicine argued that women doctors would protect women\npatients from sexual violation. Regular male doctors degraded female physicians\nby accusing them, along with midwives, of performing abortions. The relative morality of men and women was of crucial importance to this\ncampaign. For the specialists, whose interest in the female reproductive system\nraised questions about their sexual morality, the antiabortion campaign was a\nway to proclaim their own high morality in contrast to their competitors, their\nfemale patients, and even the ministers who tolerated abortion. It was at the\nsame time a backlash against the women's movement's critique of male sexual\nbehavior and feminist claims to political power. Nineteenth-century feminists\nexpressed their anger with male sexual domination and promiscuity in a number\nof movements, including the campaigns against prostitution and slavery and the\nfight for temperance. All sections of the women's movement advocated \"voluntary\nmotherhood,\" a slogan that addressed both men's sexual violation of their wives\nand women's desire to control childbearing. Women saw themselves as morally\nsuperior and urged men to adopt a single standard  --  the female\nstandard of\nchastity until marriage, followed by monogamy and moderation. The campaign\nagainst abortion challenged this feminist analysis of men by condemning women\nfor having abortions. Indeed, Storer compared abortion to prostitution and, in\nso doing, called into question all claims made by middle-class\nnineteenth-century women on the basis of moral superiority. \"There is little\ndifference,\" he proclaimed, \"between the immorality\" of the man who visited\nprostitutes and the woman who aborted. The nineteenth-century women's movements\nnever defended abortion, but activist women and women doctors were blamed for\nthe practice of abortion nonetheless. The antiabortion campaign attempted to destroy the idea of quickening. As\nphysicians targeted quickening, they discredited women's experiences of\npregnancy and claimed pregnancy as medical terrain. \"Quickening,\" as Storer\ndescribed it, \"is in fact but a sensation.\" A sensation that had emotional,\nsocial, and legal meaning was thus denigrated. Quickening was based on women's\nown bodily sensations -- not on medical diagnosis. It made physicians, and\nobstetricians in particular, dependent on female self-diagnosis and judgment.\nQuickening could not be relied upon as an indicator of fetal life because,\nStorer argued, it did not occur at a standard moment. \"Many women never quicken\nat all,\" he joked about women's perceptions, \"though their children are born\nliving.\" Storer's propaganda aimed to erase the distinctions between earlier\nand later stages of pregnancy, thereby redefining the restoration of the\nmenses. What had previously been understood as a blockage and a restoration of\nthe menses prior to quickening was now associated with inducing a miscarriage\nafter quickening by labeling it abortion. Furthermore, Storer equated abortion\nwith infanticide. Regular medical men had entered the debate about sexual politics by attacking\nthe female practice of abortion as immoral, unwomanly, and unpatriotic. In\ngiving abortion new meaning, the Regulars provided a weapon that white,\nnative-born, male legislators could use against the women of their own class\nwho had been agitating for personal and political reform. Regular physicians\nwon passage of new criminal abortion laws because their campaign appealed to a\nset of fears of white, nativeborn, male elites about losing political power to\nCatholic immigrants and to women. Class privilege did not protect middle-class\nwhite women from public policy designed to control them. Although the\ncriminalization of abortion was aimed at middle-class white women, it affected\nwomen of every class and race. The new laws passed across the country between\n1860 and 1880 regarded abortion in an entirely different light from common law\nand the statutes regulating abortifacients. In general, the laws included two\ninnovations: they eliminated the common-law idea of quickening and prohibited\nabortion at any point in pregnancy. Some included punishment for the women who\nhad abortions. The \"Comstock Law\" passed in 1873 included abortion and birth\ncontrol in federal antiobscenity legislation; states and municipalities passed\nsimilar ordinances. The antiabortion laws made one exception: physicians could perform therapeutic\nabortions if pregnancy and childbirth threatened the woman's life. A bill\ncriminalizing abortion unless done for \" bona fide medical or surgical\npurposes\" passed the Illinois state legislature unanimously and was signed into\nlaw in 1867. A few years later, Illinois passed another law prohibiting the\nsale of abortifacients but made an exception for \"the written prescription of\nsome well known and respectable practicing physician.\" Physicians had won the\ncriminalization of abortion and retained to themselves alone the right to\ninduce abortions when they determined it necessary. Through the antiabortion campaign, doctors claimed scientific authority to\ndefine life and death. In so doing, they claimed the authority of religious\nleaders. In leading this moral crusade and thoroughly criticizing the\nministry's lack of interest in abortion, regular doctors set themselves above\nreligious leaders as well as above the general populace. The medical\nprofession's claim to moral purity and the authority of the clergy was a\nstepping-stone to greater social authority. Regular physicians won an important\nvictory when they persuaded the nation's states to criminalize abortion.\nPhysicians entered a new partnership with the state and won the power to set\nreproductive policy. In the process, women's perceptions of pregnancy were\ndelegitimated and women lost what had been a common-law right. Periodization: Changing Patterns of Illegal Abortion During the more than one hundred years that abortion was illegal in the United\nStates, the patterns; practice, policing, and politics of abortion all changed\nover time, though not always simultaneously. I trace the history along several\nlines at once, according to the location, practice, and availability of\nabortion as well as its regulation. Abortion was widely available throughout\nmuch of the era when abortion was a crime. Yet periods of tolerance were\npunctuated by moments of severe repression. At some points the changing\nstructure of medicine brought about crucial changes in the history of abortion;\nat others, changes in women's lives or the political and economic context came\nto the fore. In the nineteenth century, abortion came under attack at a moment when women\nwere claiming political power; in the twentieth century, it came under attack\nwhen they claimed sexual freedom. Abortion, like contraception, means that\nwomen can separate sex and procreation -- still a controversial notion.\nAntiabortion campaigns developed when women asserted sexual independence, as\nduring the Progressive Era and since the 1970s. When abortion was most firmly\nlinked to the needs of family rather than the freedoms of women, as during the\nDepression, it was most ignored by those who would suppress it. Periods of\nantiabortion activity mark moments of hostility to female independence. The epoch of illegal abortion may be broken down into four periods. The first\ncovers the time from the criminalization of abortion state-by-state,\naccomplished nationwide by 1880, to 1930. This period, covering fifty years, is\nheavily marked by continuity. As other historians have also found, the\nreproductive lives of most women and the day-to-day practice of most physicians\nchanged slowly. In this period, abortion was widely accepted and was practiced\nin women's homes and in the offices of physicians and midwives. The diversity\nof practitioners, the privacy of medical practice, and the autonomy of\nphysicians in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries made the\nwidespread medical practice of abortion possible. A crackdown on abortion\noccurred between 1890 and 1920 as specialists in obstetrics renewed the earlier\ncampaign against abortion, and the medical profession was drawn into the\nstate's enforcement system. The structural transformation that occurred during the 1930s, the second\nperiod, was crucial for the history of abortion. Abortion became more available\nand changed location. As the practice moved from private offices and homes to\nhospitals and clinics, abortion was consolidated in medical hands and became\nmore visible. The changes wrought by the Depression accelerated the pace of\nchange in the coming decades, particularly in the methods of enforcing the\ncriminal abortion laws. The third period was marked by increasing restrictions on abortion by state\nand medical authorities and intensifying demand for abortion from women of all\ngroups. This period begins in 1940, when the new methods of controlling\nabortion were first instituted, and continues through 1973, when they were\ndismantled. In reaction to the growing practice of abortion as well as apparent\nchanges in female gender and reproductive patterns, a backlash against abortion\ndeveloped. 1940 marks a dividing line as hospitals instituted new policies, and\npolice and prosecutors changed their tactics. The repression of abortion was\npart of the repression of political and personal deviance that took place in\nthe 1940s and 1950s. Yet even in this period, the practice of abortion expanded\nin new directions in response to relentless demand. The new repression of\nabortion, however, was devastating for women. A dual system of abortion,\ndivided by race and class, developed. During the postwar period, the\ncriminalization of abortion produced its harshest results. A new stage in the history of abortion, the movement to legalize it, overlaps\nwith the third period. The movement to decriminalize abortion began in the\nmid-1950s and arose out of the difficult experiences resulting from the\nrepression of abortion in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1950s, a handful of\nphysicians began to challenge the very abortion laws their profession had\nadvocated a century earlier. The progress of that challenge attests to the\ncontinuing power of the medical profession to make public policy regarding\nreproduction. As legal reform moved forward, a new feminist movement arose,\nwhich radically transformed the movement for legal change. When the women's\nmovement described abortion as an aspect of sexual freedom, they articulated a\nnew feminist meaning for abortion; when they demanded abortion as a right, they\nechoed generations of women. The structure of this book follows this periodization. The first half of the\nbook uncovers the history of abortion from the late nineteenth century through\nthe 1920s. Chapters 1 through 4 each cover different aspects of abortion, from\nwomen's lives to practice to politics to enforcement, during the first\nhalf-century of illegal abortion. The changes of the 1930S, both medical and\nsocial, precipitated other changes. The second half of the book traces the\nhistory of abortion in chronologically ordered chapters concluding with the\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions that ended the era of illegal abortion. Women's history of abortion needs to be examined both as a commonly felt need\nto control reproduction, arising from women's biological capacity to bear\nchildren and social relations that assign childbearing to women, and in terms\nof differences among women. This book differentiates among women by class, race\nand ethnic identity, and marital status. Though class did not absolutely\ndetermine access to or safety of abortion, class position helped define when a\nwoman felt she needed an abortion and affected the type available to her. In\ngeneral, urban women had greater access to abortion than rural women, though\nsome rural women located abortionists in their areas or traveled to cities for\nabortions. Race played a less obvious role in access to abortion, though the\ngrim statistics of the postwar period show the connection between\ndiscrimination and death. I have made a specific effort to locate sources\nrelated to African Americans in order to learn more about black women's use of\nabortion and how race shaped the history of abortion. Evidence concerning women\nof color is meager, however, until the 1930s, when medical and sociological\nstudies began separating their findings by race. Before then, contemporary\nobservers tended to focus their attention on the differences among many (white)\nforeign-born ethnic groups. This book integrates a national analysis of the history of abortion with a\nlocal study. The advantage of this approach is that it connects everyday life\nand local medical and legal practice to national policy. It examines that\nrelationship rather than assuming that all the public policy action takes place\non the federal level without reference to local and \"private\" events. I select\na major metropolis in order to uncover the nature of both abortion practices\nand police enforcement of the criminal abortion laws. Chicago, the second\nlargest city in the nation, is the focus of my local study. Chicago, the city\nin \"the heartland\" that has of ten served as a metaphor for the spirit of\nAmerica, was also known as an important medical center (the home of the AMA)\nand as a regional center for abortion. Trains brought European immigrants, men\nand women migrating from farms to the city, African Americans moving from the\nSouth to the North, all going to live and work in Chicago. The same trains\nbrought women looking for abortions. Directing my attention to one city enabled\nme to uncover the nitty-gritty details of the practice and regulation of\nabortion. Though much of my analysis of the history of abortion draws on Chicago as a\ncase study, sources verify that my findings hold true for other cities, large\nand small. Throughout I present national data and trends as well as regional\nones and take note of patterns elsewhere. The book moves back and forth from a\nnational overview of abortion practices and politics to a close look at events\nin Chicago. As medical practice became more standardized in hospitals, the\nstory becomes a more national one and key events take place in other cities:\nNew York, Detroit, Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington, D.C.,\nand elsewhere. This is primarily a study of abortion in urban areas, where\nabortion was concentrated. I comment occasionally on practices in rural areas,\nbut the history of reproductive control and abortion is likely to be somewhat\ndifferent there. Legal records, most notably lower-level court and criminal trial records, and\nmedical literature make up the foundation of my research. I have also surveyed\nother government documents, newspapers, popular periodicals, hospital records,\nand manuscript collections. Using these materials, I have delineated how\nmedical thinking and state regulation have changed over time. Yet this is more\nthan a study of prescriptive literature or policy. I have uncovered the\ncircumstances of hundreds of actual induced abortions and reconstructed\nchanging abortion practices. This study periodizes the history of abortion for\nthe first time. This book presents the lives of many women and their abortions in rich detail\nin order to convey the variety and intricacy of the situations that made\nabortion necessary for women. It is in the minutiae of women's lives that we\ncan discover why women had abortions and how they won sympathy from physicians\nwho belonged to a profession dedicated to fighting abortion. Abortion was a\nmoment in a woman's reproductive life. It cannot be separated from sexual\nrelations or reproduction as a whole. Women themselves did not separate them,\nnor should we, whether analyzing abortion in the past or present. This book\ndeepens our understanding of the female experience of reproduction and the\nconnections between sexuality, contraception, pregnancy, and childbirth. At its\nmost fundamental, a policy that restricts abortion is one that forces women\ninto maternity. Without contraceptives and abortion, most women in heterosexual\nrelationships will become pregnant and bear children, whether they want to or\nnot. When women sought abortions, they often revealed the texture of\nheterosexual relations and the rest of their lives. Many situations made\nenduring pregnancy unbearable to women. In using abortion, women rebelled\nagainst the law and asserted their sense that the decision to carry a pregnancy\nto term or to abort was theirs to make. A few expressed in words as well as in\naction the view that abortion was their right. The experiences of women's\nprivate lives and private practices over the course of one hundred years\naltered medical thinking and reshaped public policy. Despite the fact that\nwomen's abortion narratives are part of our own contemporary discourse, the\nstories told here have long been hidden. Copyright © 1996  by the Regents of the University of California.\n\nAnalysis of public policy should examine how policy has been implemented and\nby whom, rather than be narrowly restricted to federal legislation or agency\nactivity. Looking at statutes alone, or the actions of legislators or the\njudiciary, inhibits our view of how law works, how public policy is made, and\nwho acts on behalf of the state to enforce the law. Abortion serves as a case\nstudy for rethinking the nature of the state in the United States. Much of the\nregulation of abortion was carried out not by government agents, but by\nvoluntary agencies and individuals. The state expected the medical profession\nto assist in enforcing the law. It may be more accurate to think of the state\napparatus not as the government, but as consisting of official agencies that\nwork in conjunction with other semiofficial agencies. State officials, this\nhistory and others show, have often relied on \"private\" agents to act as part\nof the state. Feminist scholars in the 1970s tended to see the medical profession as the\nsource of the regulation of female sexuality and reproduction, but the medical\nprofession's role was more complex. This book shifts attention to the state's\ninterest in controlling abortion and the alliance between medicine and the\nstate. It would have been virtually impossible for the state to enforce the\ncriminal abortion laws without the cooperation of physicians. State officials\nwon medical cooperation in suppressing abortion by threatening doctors and\nmedical institutions with prosecution or scandal. Physicians learned to protect\nthemselves from legal trouble by reporting to officials women injured or dying\nas a result of illegal abortions. By the 1940s and 1950s, physicians and\nhospitals had become so accustomed to this regulatory stance toward women and\nabortion that they instituted new regulations to observe and curb the practice\nof abortion in the hospital. The medical profession and its institutions acted\nas an arm of the state. Yet the medical profession's position was contradictory. While physicians\nhelped control abortion, they too were brought under greater control. State\nofficials demanded that the profession police the practices of its members. The\nduty of self-policing and physicians' fears of prosecution for abortion created\ndilemmas for doctors who at times compromised their duties to patients in order\nto carry out their duties to the state. Furthermore, plenty of physicians provided abortions. This book points to the\npower of patients, even female patients, to influence and change medical\npractice. The widespread practice of abortion by physicians attests to both the\nability of patients to communicate their needs to physicians and the ability of\nphysicians to listen. Physicians' practices were shaped by the experiences and\nperspectives of private life, not only by professional antiabortion values. The\nphysician-patient relationship was often more close than distant. This was\nparticularly true in the early twentieth century, but became more class\nstratified as medicine became increasingly specialized and hospital oriented.\nMedicine was more of a negotiated terrain between physicians and patients than\nhas been realized. The peaks of the medical profession's public hostility to abortion have\nobscured the depth of medical involvement in abortion. The antiabortion stance\nof organized medicine should not be mistaken for an accurate representation of\nthe views and practices of the entire profession. This study views the medical\nprofession as complex and composed of competing groups with opposing views and\npractices rather than as a unified whole. The medical profession was not\nmonolithic, but divided in its attitude toward abortion and in its treatment of\npatients. This book differentiates between organized medicine and individual\nphysicians. By \"organized medicine,\" I mean medicine's institutional\nstructures, such as the American Medical Association (AMA) and other medical\nsocieties, medical schools, and hospitals that produced the official, public\nimage of the profession and acted in concert with the state. Furthermore, this\nstudy distinguishes between prescriptive commentary about medical practices, as\nfound in the medical literature, and actual practice by physicians. These\nofficial and instructional materials reveal the thought, and perhaps the\npractice, of only a few. Finally, attention to specialization is crucial.\nSpecialists played critical public roles in the history of abortion, their\ninterests and those of general practitioners were not identical. This book is the first to chart the nation's enforcement of the criminal\nabortion laws. To understand the power of law in the lives of the masses of\nAmericans requires that one take seriously the experiences of ordinary people\ncaught in criminal investigations. Thus it is necessary to analyze the\nprocesses and routine procedures of the legal system that shape those\nexperiences. Most historians of crime and punishment have focused on police and\nprisons, while historians of women and the law have focused mainly on marriage\nand property rights, not crime. Surprisingly little historical work has\nexamined the relationship between medicine and law. Few have studied law in\npractice. Analysis of the day-to-day workings of the legal system, rather than\nstatutory changes, judicial rulings, or the volume of cases, reveals how the\nlaw intervened in the lives of ordinary citizens to regulate reproductive and\nsexual behavior.\" Punishment for violation of the law and sexual norms has been gendered. In\nabortion cases, the investigative procedures themselves constituted a form of\npunishment and control for women. Publicity and public exposure of women's\ntransgressions further served as punishment. This form of punishment served, in\nMichel Foucault's words, as \"a school.\" The shame of public exposure was for\nall of \"the potentially guilty,\" not only the individual who had been caught.\nThis eighteenth-century mode of punishment, thought to have been replaced by\nthe surveillance of the prison, persisted in the state's response to women and\ntheir sexual crimes. Without analyzing gender, we cannot fully understand the\nsystems of punishment. Even as the abortion statutes remained the same through this period, the\nmeaning of the law and the legality and illegality of abortion changed over\ntime. Law is not fixed, but fluid. The criminal abortion laws passed in every\nstate by T880 made exceptions for therapeutic abortions performed in order to\nsave a woman's life. Because the laws governing abortion did not precisely\ndefine what was criminal and what was not, this had to be worked out in\npractice, in policing, and in the courts. The complexity of defining \"legal\"\nand \"illegal\" abortions for medical practitioners and legal authorities alike,\nthe gray and ever-shifting nature of \"criminality,\" is an important theme in\nthis book. Nor was medical understanding of therapeutic abortion stable.\nMedicine too is interpretive and changing. Throughout the period of illegal\nabortion, physicians disagreed on the conditions that mandated a therapeutic\nabortion and on the methods: there was no consensus. Changes in medicine\ninfluenced legal definitions of crime; at the same time, the law shaped medical\nthinking and practice. The medical profession and the legal profession each\nlooked to the other to define the legality of abortion practices. Therapeutic\nabortion became increasingly important in the 1930s; by the 1960s the practice\n(and nonpractice) of therapeutic abortion was at the very heart of the campaign\nto reform and repeal the criminal abortion laws. The illegality of abortion has hidden the existence of an unarticulated,\nalternative, popular morality, which supported women who had abortions. This\npopular ethic contradicted the law, the official attitude of the medical\nprofession, and the teachings of some religions. Private discussions among\nfamily and friends, conversations between women and doctors, and the behavior\nof women (and the people who aided them) suggest that traditional ideas that\naccepted early abortions endured into the twentieth century. Furthermore,\nthrough the 1920s at least, working-class women did not make a distinction\nbetween contraceptives and abortion. What I call a popular morality that\naccepted abortion was almost never publicly expressed but was rooted in\npeople's daily lives. Americans have a long history of accepting abortion in\ncertain situations as a necessity and as a decision that, implicitly, belongs\nto women to make. This popular attitude made itself felt in the courts and in\ndoctors' offices: prosecutors found it difficult to convict abortionists\nbecause juries regularly nullified the law by acquitting abortionists,  and few\nphysicians escaped the pressure from women for abortions. Throughout the period\nof illegal abortion, women asserted their need for abortion and, in doing so,\nimplicitly asserted their sense of having a right to control their own\nreproduction. I am not suggesting a \"gap\" between people's beliefs and their ability to live\nup to them, but different, even oppositional, moral perspectives. The values\nexpressed by ordinary people deserve to be taken seriously rather than\ncategorized and dismissed as sinful or mistaken. Though some felt guilt about\nabortion and found ways to justify their behavior, others never held the\nofficial antiabortion views. Prescribed morality and popular morality may not\nbe identical. Analysis of women's practices and ideas -- popular\nbehavior and\nbelief -- rather than exclusive focus on the statements of male\ntheologians and\nphilosophers suggests that it is incorrect to conclude that hostility to\nabortion is \"almost an absolute value in history.\" The reverse may be more\naccurate. Although this book takes note of religious teachings and the religious\nbackground of women who had abortions, it does not focus on religious opinion.\nOrganized religion had little interest in abortion until it entered the public,\npolitical arena in the late 1950s and early 1960s. There was no reason to\nenergetically fight abortion when, for nearly a century, abortion was a crime\nand no social movement suggested otherwise. From the 1920s on, however, there\nwas much religious interest in, and division over, another method of\nreproductive control: contraception. Birth control became a topic of interest\nbecause a movement advocated women's right to reproductive control. Further, it\nis incorrect to assume that the Catholic Church has always organized against\nabortion or that all Catholics subscribe to the views of their church leaders.\nIndeed, many Catholics shared what I have described as a popular ethic\naccepting abortion. A good history of religion and reproductive control would\nexamine not only theology and sermons, but also the attitudes and actions of\nthe congregations, with particular attention to women. Women who had abortions did so within a context of illegality and religious\ndisapproval, but the prohibitions were ambiguous. Christian traditions had\ntabooed abortion since antiquity, but the acceptance of abortion in order to\nsave the life of a pregnant woman had a long tradition as well. Until the\nmid-nineteenth century, the Catholic Church implicitly accepted early abortions\nprior to ensoulment. Not until T869, at about the same time that abortion\nbecame politicized in this country, did the church condemn abortion; in 1895,\nit condemned therapeutic abortion. Protestant churches accepted abortion when\npregnancy threatened a woman's life, a view shared by the medical profession\nand written into the nation's laws. Jewish tradition clearly viewed the woman's\nlife as primary. The Mishnah, a code of ancient Jewish law that guided later\nrabbinic thought, required abortion when childbirth threatened a woman's life,\nfor \"her life takes precedence over its life.\" This study points to the importance of studying the social history of\nsexuality as well as the medical and legal discourse about it. These discourses\nregarding abortion are important because they introduced new meanings of\nabortion and shaped people's views (and fears) of abortion and sexuality. I\nanalyze the language women used to describe abortion and the production of\nstories about abortion in the press and in the courtroom. Yet exclusive\nattention to professional or even popular discourse about abortion would result\nin a distorted picture of that history. Medical discourse has convinced some\nscholars that physicians did not perform abortions in the period of illegal\nabortion, and most press coverage of abortion in the early twentieth century\ngives the misleading impression that abortion was universally condemned and\ngenerally fatal. These conclusions are not correct. Analysis of discourse alone\nwould miss the ongoing medical practice of abortion in total contradiction of\nofficial medical mores. As others have pointed out, Foucault's theory\nconcerning the production of sexuality through discourse ignores differences in\nthe power of individuals and social groups to enter and shape discourse. The\npublicly articulated and published discussion of abortion rarely included the\nvoices or perspectives of women who had abortions, except to provide shocking\nexamples of depraved womanhood. Women who had abortions did not intervene to\nexplain themselves, but instead, in other nonpublic arenas, made their\nperspectives known and acted to obtain a much-needed method for preventing\nbirths. More tolerant attitudes toward abortion, rooted in material\nexperiences, persisted in the face of a public discourse that denounced it. The\nhistory of sexuality and reproduction demands a combined analysis of ideas and\npractice. Common Law and the Criminalization of Abortion Abortion was not always a crime. During the eighteenth and early nineteenth\ncenturies, abortion of early pregnancy was legal under common law. Abortions\nwere illegal only after \"quickening,\" the point at which a pregnant woman could\nfeel the movements of the fetus (approximately the fourth month of pregnancy).\nThe common law's attitude toward pregnancy and abortion was based on an\nunderstanding of pregnancy and human development as a process rather than an\nabsolute moment. Indeed, the term abortion referred only to the miscarriages of\nlater pregnancies, after quickening. What we would now identify as an early\ninduced abortion was not called an abortion at all. If an early pregnancy\nended, it had \"slipp[ed] away,\" or the menses had been \"restored.\" At\nconception and the earliest stage of pregnancy before quickening, no one\nbelieved that a human life existed; not even the Catholic Church took this\nview. Rather, the popular ethic regarding abortion and common law were grounded\nin the female experience of their own bodies. Colonial and early-nineteenth-century women, historians have learned,\nperceived conception as the \"blocking\" or \"obstructing\" of menstruation, which\nrequired attention. The cessation of the menses indicated a worrisome imbalance\nin the body and the need to bring the body back into balance by restoring the\nflow. This idea of menstruation corresponded with medical and popular\nunderstanding of sickness and health. The body was a delicate system of\nequilibrium that could easily be thrown out of balance -- by a change\nin weather\nor diet, for example -- and that then needed to be restored through active\nintervention. A disruption in the healthy body, in the worldview of patients\nand physicians, required a visible, often violent, physical response to\ntreatment in order to restore equilibrium. This theory underlay eighteenth and\nnineteenth-century regular medical practice, which emphasized heroic\nmeasures -- bleeding, blistering, purging, and puking -- in\nresponse to sickness.\nThe response to the blocking of the menses was part of this shared\nunderstanding of the body: women took drugs in order to make their menses\nregular and regarded the ensuing vomiting and evacuation as evidence of the\ndrugs' effective action. Restoring the menses was a domestic practice. The power of certain herbs to\nrestore menstruation was widely known. One colonial woman who feared pregnancy\nhad \"twice taken Savin; once boyled in milk and the other time strayned through\na Cloath.\" Savin, derived from juniper bushes, was the most popular\nabortifacient and easily acquired since junipers grew wild throughout the\ncountry. Other herbs used as abortifacients included pennyroyal, tansy, ergot,\nand seneca snakeroot. Slave women used cottonroot. Many of these useful plants\ncould be found in the woods or cultivated. in gardens, and women could refer to\nhome medical guides for recipes for \"bringing on the menses.\" Both of these concepts, blocked menses and quickening, must be taken seriously\nby late-twentieth-century observers. Blocked menses cannot be dismissed as an\nexcuse made by women who knew they were pregnant. Quickening was a moment\nrecognized by women and by law as a defining moment in human development. Once\nquickening occurred, women recognized a moral obligation to carry the fetus to\nterm. This age-old idea underpinned the practice of abortion in America. The\nlegal acceptance of induced miscarriages before quickening tacitly assumed that\nwomen had a basic right to bodily integrity. By the mid-eighteenth century, the most common means of inducing\nabortion -- by\ntaking drugs was commercialized. The availability of abortifacients was so\nwell-known that a common euphemism described their use. When Sarah Grosvenor, a\nConnecticut farm girl, confided to her sister in 1742 that she was \"taking the\ntrade,\" her sister understood. That Grosvenor successfully conveyed her meaning\nto her sister in three metaphoric words tells us a great deal about the world\nof mid-eighteenth-century New England. Many New Englanders, including these\nsisters, knew of the possibility of inducing an abortion by purchasing and\ningesting drugs. The need for a euphemism tells of the difficulty of speaking\nopenly about sex and reproductive control and of the need for secrecy. Yet it\nreveals an awareness that women could and did regulate their own fertility\nthrough abortion. Furthermore, abortifacients had become a profitable product\nsold by doctors, apothecaries, and other healers. The first statutes governing abortion in the United States, James Mohr has\nfound, were poison control measures designed to protect pregnant women like\nGrosvenor by controlling the sale of abortifacient drugs, which often killed\nthe women who took them. The proliferation of entrepreneurs who openly sold and\nadvertised abortifacients may have inspired this early legislation, passed in\nthe 1820s and 1830s. The 18 Illinois law, which prohibited the provision of\nabortifacients, was listed under \"poisoning.\" It is crucial to recognize what these early-nineteenth-century laws did not\ncover: they did not punish women for inducing abortions, and they did not\neliminate the concept of quickening. Even as poison control measures, they said\nnothing about growing the plants needed in one's own garden or mixing together\none's own home remedy in order to induce an abortion. The legal silence on\ndomestic practices suggests that the new laws were aimed at the\ncommercialization of this practice and, implicitly, retained to women the right\nto make their own decisions about their pregnancies before quickening. By the 1840s, the abortion business boomed. Despite the laws forbidding the\nsale of abortifacients, they were advertised in the popular press and could be\npurchased from physicians or pharmacists or through the mail. If drugs failed,\nwomen could go to a practitioner who specialized in performing instrumental\nabortions. Advertisements and newspaper exposes made it appear that what had\nbeen an occasional domestic practice had become a daily occurrence performed\nfor profit in northern cities. Madame Restell, for example, openly advertised\nand provided abortion services for thirty-five years. Restell began her\nabortion business in New York City in the late 1830s; by the mid-1840s, she had\noffices in Boston and Philadelphia and traveling agents who sold her \"Female\nMonthly Pills.\" Restell became the most infamous abortionist in the country,\nbut she was not the only abortionist. The clientele of these busy clinics were\nprimarily married, white, native-born Protestant women of the upper and middle\nclasses. In 1857, the newly organized AMA initiated a crusade to make abortion at every\nstage of pregnancy illegal. The antiabortion campaign grew in part, James Mohr\nhas shown, out of regular physicians' desire to win professional power, control\nmedical practice, and restrict their competitors, particularly Homeopaths and\nmidwives. \"Regular,\" or \"orthodox,\" physicians, practitioners of \"heroic\"\nmedicine, had come under attack in the 1820s and 1830s as elitist. They faced\ncompetition from a variety of practitioners from other medical sects,\ncollectively known as \"Irregulars.\" Through the 1870S, regular physicians\nacross the country worked for the passage of new criminal abortion laws. In\nsecuring criminal abortion laws, the Regulars won recognition of their\nparticular views as well as some state control over the practice of\nmedicine. Though professional issues underlay the medical campaign, gender, racial, and\nclass anxieties pushed the criminalization of abortion forward. The visible use\nof abortion by middle-class married women, in conjunction with other challenges\nto gender norms and changes in the social makeup of the nation, generated\nanxieties among American men of the same class. Birth rates among the Yankee\nclasses had declined by mid-century while immigrants poured into the country.\nAntiabortion activists pointed out that immigrant families, many of them\nCatholic, were larger and would soon outpopulate native-born white Yankees and\nthreaten their political power. Dr. Horatio R Storer, the leader of the medical\ncampaign against abortion, envisioned the spread of \"civilization\" west and\nsouth by native-born white Americans, not Mexicans, Chinese, Blacks, Indians,\nor Catholics. \"Shall\" these regions, he asked, \"be filled by our own children\nor by those of aliens? This is a question our women must answer; upon their\nloins depends the future destiny of the nation.\" Hostility to immigrants,\nCatholics, and people of color fueled this campaign to criminalize abortion.\nWhite male patriotism demanded that maternity be enforced among white\nProtestant women. The antiabortion campaign was antifeminist at its core. Women were condemned\nfor following \"fashion\" and for avoiding the self-sacrifice expected of\nmothers. \"The true wife,\" Storer declared, did not seek `'undue power in public\nlife, . . . undue control in domestic affairs, . . . [or] privileges not her\nown.\" The antiabortion campaign was a reactionary response to two important\nefforts of the nineteenth-century women's movements: the fight to admit women\ninto the regular medical profession and the battle to make men conform to a\nsingle standard of sexual behavior. The antiabortion campaign coincided with\nthe fight by male Regulars to keep women out of their medical schools,\nsocieties, and hospitals. Boston and Harvard University, Storer's hometown and\nalma mater, were key sites of struggle over women's place in medicine, and\nStorer was personally engaged in the battle against female physicians.\nAdvocates of women in medicine argued that women doctors would protect women\npatients from sexual violation. Regular male doctors degraded female physicians\nby accusing them, along with midwives, of performing abortions. The relative morality of men and women was of crucial importance to this\ncampaign. For the specialists, whose interest in the female reproductive system\nraised questions about their sexual morality, the antiabortion campaign was a\nway to proclaim their own high morality in contrast to their competitors, their\nfemale patients, and even the ministers who tolerated abortion. It was at the\nsame time a backlash against the women's movement's critique of male sexual\nbehavior and feminist claims to political power. Nineteenth-century feminists\nexpressed their anger with male sexual domination and promiscuity in a number\nof movements, including the campaigns against prostitution and slavery and the\nfight for temperance. All sections of the women's movement advocated \"voluntary\nmotherhood,\" a slogan that addressed both men's sexual violation of their wives\nand women's desire to control childbearing. Women saw themselves as morally\nsuperior and urged men to adopt a single standard  --  the female\nstandard of\nchastity until marriage, followed by monogamy and moderation. The campaign\nagainst abortion challenged this feminist analysis of men by condemning women\nfor having abortions. Indeed, Storer compared abortion to prostitution and, in\nso doing, called into question all claims made by middle-class\nnineteenth-century women on the basis of moral superiority. \"There is little\ndifference,\" he proclaimed, \"between the immorality\" of the man who visited\nprostitutes and the woman who aborted. The nineteenth-century women's movements\nnever defended abortion, but activist women and women doctors were blamed for\nthe practice of abortion nonetheless. The antiabortion campaign attempted to destroy the idea of quickening. As\nphysicians targeted quickening, they discredited women's experiences of\npregnancy and claimed pregnancy as medical terrain. \"Quickening,\" as Storer\ndescribed it, \"is in fact but a sensation.\" A sensation that had emotional,\nsocial, and legal meaning was thus denigrated. Quickening was based on women's\nown bodily sensations -- not on medical diagnosis. It made physicians, and\nobstetricians in particular, dependent on female self-diagnosis and judgment.\nQuickening could not be relied upon as an indicator of fetal life because,\nStorer argued, it did not occur at a standard moment. \"Many women never quicken\nat all,\" he joked about women's perceptions, \"though their children are born\nliving.\" Storer's propaganda aimed to erase the distinctions between earlier\nand later stages of pregnancy, thereby redefining the restoration of the\nmenses. What had previously been understood as a blockage and a restoration of\nthe menses prior to quickening was now associated with inducing a miscarriage\nafter quickening by labeling it abortion. Furthermore, Storer equated abortion\nwith infanticide. Regular medical men had entered the debate about sexual politics by attacking\nthe female practice of abortion as immoral, unwomanly, and unpatriotic. In\ngiving abortion new meaning, the Regulars provided a weapon that white,\nnative-born, male legislators could use against the women of their own class\nwho had been agitating for personal and political reform. Regular physicians\nwon passage of new criminal abortion laws because their campaign appealed to a\nset of fears of white, nativeborn, male elites about losing political power to\nCatholic immigrants and to women. Class privilege did not protect middle-class\nwhite women from public policy designed to control them. Although the\ncriminalization of abortion was aimed at middle-class white women, it affected\nwomen of every class and race. The new laws passed across the country between\n1860 and 1880 regarded abortion in an entirely different light from common law\nand the statutes regulating abortifacients. In general, the laws included two\ninnovations: they eliminated the common-law idea of quickening and prohibited\nabortion at any point in pregnancy. Some included punishment for the women who\nhad abortions. The \"Comstock Law\" passed in 1873 included abortion and birth\ncontrol in federal antiobscenity legislation; states and municipalities passed\nsimilar ordinances. The antiabortion laws made one exception: physicians could perform therapeutic\nabortions if pregnancy and childbirth threatened the woman's life. A bill\ncriminalizing abortion unless done for \" bona fide medical or surgical\npurposes\" passed the Illinois state legislature unanimously and was signed into\nlaw in 1867. A few years later, Illinois passed another law prohibiting the\nsale of abortifacients but made an exception for \"the written prescription of\nsome well known and respectable practicing physician.\" Physicians had won the\ncriminalization of abortion and retained to themselves alone the right to\ninduce abortions when they determined it necessary. Through the antiabortion campaign, doctors claimed scientific authority to\ndefine life and death. In so doing, they claimed the authority of religious\nleaders. In leading this moral crusade and thoroughly criticizing the\nministry's lack of interest in abortion, regular doctors set themselves above\nreligious leaders as well as above the general populace. The medical\nprofession's claim to moral purity and the authority of the clergy was a\nstepping-stone to greater social authority. Regular physicians won an important\nvictory when they persuaded the nation's states to criminalize abortion.\nPhysicians entered a new partnership with the state and won the power to set\nreproductive policy. In the process, women's perceptions of pregnancy were\ndelegitimated and women lost what had been a common-law right. Periodization: Changing Patterns of Illegal Abortion During the more than one hundred years that abortion was illegal in the United\nStates, the patterns; practice, policing, and politics of abortion all changed\nover time, though not always simultaneously. I trace the history along several\nlines at once, according to the location, practice, and availability of\nabortion as well as its regulation. Abortion was widely available throughout\nmuch of the era when abortion was a crime. Yet periods of tolerance were\npunctuated by moments of severe repression. At some points the changing\nstructure of medicine brought about crucial changes in the history of abortion;\nat others, changes in women's lives or the political and economic context came\nto the fore. In the nineteenth century, abortion came under attack at a moment when women\nwere claiming political power; in the twentieth century, it came under attack\nwhen they claimed sexual freedom. Abortion, like contraception, means that\nwomen can separate sex and procreation -- still a controversial notion.\nAntiabortion campaigns developed when women asserted sexual independence, as\nduring the Progressive Era and since the 1970s. When abortion was most firmly\nlinked to the needs of family rather than the freedoms of women, as during the\nDepression, it was most ignored by those who would suppress it. Periods of\nantiabortion activity mark moments of hostility to female independence. The epoch of illegal abortion may be broken down into four periods. The first\ncovers the time from the criminalization of abortion state-by-state,\naccomplished nationwide by 1880, to 1930. This period, covering fifty years, is\nheavily marked by continuity. As other historians have also found, the\nreproductive lives of most women and the day-to-day practice of most physicians\nchanged slowly. In this period, abortion was widely accepted and was practiced\nin women's homes and in the offices of physicians and midwives. The diversity\nof practitioners, the privacy of medical practice, and the autonomy of\nphysicians in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries made the\nwidespread medical practice of abortion possible. A crackdown on abortion\noccurred between 1890 and 1920 as specialists in obstetrics renewed the earlier\ncampaign against abortion, and the medical profession was drawn into the\nstate's enforcement system. The structural transformation that occurred during the 1930s, the second\nperiod, was crucial for the history of abortion. Abortion became more available\nand changed location. As the practice moved from private offices and homes to\nhospitals and clinics, abortion was consolidated in medical hands and became\nmore visible. The changes wrought by the Depression accelerated the pace of\nchange in the coming decades, particularly in the methods of enforcing the\ncriminal abortion laws. The third period was marked by increasing restrictions on abortion by state\nand medical authorities and intensifying demand for abortion from women of all\ngroups. This period begins in 1940, when the new methods of controlling\nabortion were first instituted, and continues through 1973, when they were\ndismantled. In reaction to the growing practice of abortion as well as apparent\nchanges in female gender and reproductive patterns, a backlash against abortion\ndeveloped. 1940 marks a dividing line as hospitals instituted new policies, and\npolice and prosecutors changed their tactics. The repression of abortion was\npart of the repression of political and personal deviance that took place in\nthe 1940s and 1950s. Yet even in this period, the practice of abortion expanded\nin new directions in response to relentless demand. The new repression of\nabortion, however, was devastating for women. A dual system of abortion,\ndivided by race and class, developed. During the postwar period, the\ncriminalization of abortion produced its harshest results. A new stage in the history of abortion, the movement to legalize it, overlaps\nwith the third period. The movement to decriminalize abortion began in the\nmid-1950s and arose out of the difficult experiences resulting from the\nrepression of abortion in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1950s, a handful of\nphysicians began to challenge the very abortion laws their profession had\nadvocated a century earlier. The progress of that challenge attests to the\ncontinuing power of the medical profession to make public policy regarding\nreproduction. As legal reform moved forward, a new feminist movement arose,\nwhich radically transformed the movement for legal change. When the women's\nmovement described abortion as an aspect of sexual freedom, they articulated a\nnew feminist meaning for abortion; when they demanded abortion as a right, they\nechoed generations of women. The structure of this book follows this periodization. The first half of the\nbook uncovers the history of abortion from the late nineteenth century through\nthe 1920s. Chapters 1 through 4 each cover different aspects of abortion, from\nwomen's lives to practice to politics to enforcement, during the first\nhalf-century of illegal abortion. The changes of the 1930S, both medical and\nsocial, precipitated other changes. The second half of the book traces the\nhistory of abortion in chronologically ordered chapters concluding with the\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions that ended the era of illegal abortion. Women's history of abortion needs to be examined both as a commonly felt need\nto control reproduction, arising from women's biological capacity to bear\nchildren and social relations that assign childbearing to women, and in terms\nof differences among women. This book differentiates among women by class, race\nand ethnic identity, and marital status. Though class did not absolutely\ndetermine access to or safety of abortion, class position helped define when a\nwoman felt she needed an abortion and affected the type available to her. In\ngeneral, urban women had greater access to abortion than rural women, though\nsome rural women located abortionists in their areas or traveled to cities for\nabortions. Race played a less obvious role in access to abortion, though the\ngrim statistics of the postwar period show the connection between\ndiscrimination and death. I have made a specific effort to locate sources\nrelated to African Americans in order to learn more about black women's use of\nabortion and how race shaped the history of abortion. Evidence concerning women\nof color is meager, however, until the 1930s, when medical and sociological\nstudies began separating their findings by race. Before then, contemporary\nobservers tended to focus their attention on the differences among many (white)\nforeign-born ethnic groups. This book integrates a national analysis of the history of abortion with a\nlocal study. The advantage of this approach is that it connects everyday life\nand local medical and legal practice to national policy. It examines that\nrelationship rather than assuming that all the public policy action takes place\non the federal level without reference to local and \"private\" events. I select\na major metropolis in order to uncover the nature of both abortion practices\nand police enforcement of the criminal abortion laws. Chicago, the second\nlargest city in the nation, is the focus of my local study. Chicago, the city\nin \"the heartland\" that has of ten served as a metaphor for the spirit of\nAmerica, was also known as an important medical center (the home of the AMA)\nand as a regional center for abortion. Trains brought European immigrants, men\nand women migrating from farms to the city, African Americans moving from the\nSouth to the North, all going to live and work in Chicago. The same trains\nbrought women looking for abortions. Directing my attention to one city enabled\nme to uncover the nitty-gritty details of the practice and regulation of\nabortion. Though much of my analysis of the history of abortion draws on Chicago as a\ncase study, sources verify that my findings hold true for other cities, large\nand small. Throughout I present national data and trends as well as regional\nones and take note of patterns elsewhere. The book moves back and forth from a\nnational overview of abortion practices and politics to a close look at events\nin Chicago. As medical practice became more standardized in hospitals, the\nstory becomes a more national one and key events take place in other cities:\nNew York, Detroit, Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington, D.C.,\nand elsewhere. This is primarily a study of abortion in urban areas, where\nabortion was concentrated. I comment occasionally on practices in rural areas,\nbut the history of reproductive control and abortion is likely to be somewhat\ndifferent there. Legal records, most notably lower-level court and criminal trial records, and\nmedical literature make up the foundation of my research. I have also surveyed\nother government documents, newspapers, popular periodicals, hospital records,\nand manuscript collections. Using these materials, I have delineated how\nmedical thinking and state regulation have changed over time. Yet this is more\nthan a study of prescriptive literature or policy. I have uncovered the\ncircumstances of hundreds of actual induced abortions and reconstructed\nchanging abortion practices. This study periodizes the history of abortion for\nthe first time. This book presents the lives of many women and their abortions in rich detail\nin order to convey the variety and intricacy of the situations that made\nabortion necessary for women. It is in the minutiae of women's lives that we\ncan discover why women had abortions and how they won sympathy from physicians\nwho belonged to a profession dedicated to fighting abortion. Abortion was a\nmoment in a woman's reproductive life. It cannot be separated from sexual\nrelations or reproduction as a whole. Women themselves did not separate them,\nnor should we, whether analyzing abortion in the past or present. This book\ndeepens our understanding of the female experience of reproduction and the\nconnections between sexuality, contraception, pregnancy, and childbirth. At its\nmost fundamental, a policy that restricts abortion is one that forces women\ninto maternity. Without contraceptives and abortion, most women in heterosexual\nrelationships will become pregnant and bear children, whether they want to or\nnot. When women sought abortions, they often revealed the texture of\nheterosexual relations and the rest of their lives. Many situations made\nenduring pregnancy unbearable to women. In using abortion, women rebelled\nagainst the law and asserted their sense that the decision to carry a pregnancy\nto term or to abort was theirs to make. A few expressed in words as well as in\naction the view that abortion was their right. The experiences of women's\nprivate lives and private practices over the course of one hundred years\naltered medical thinking and reshaped public policy. Despite the fact that\nwomen's abortion narratives are part of our own contemporary discourse, the\nstories told here have long been hidden.

This book shifts attention to the state's\ninterest in controlling abortion and the alliance between medicine and the\nstate. It would have been virtually impossible for the state to enforce the\ncriminal abortion laws without the cooperation of physicians. State officials\nwon medical cooperation in suppressing abortion by threatening doctors and\nmedical institutions with prosecution or scandal. Physicians learned to protect\nthemselves from legal trouble by reporting to officials women injured or dying\nas a result of illegal abortions. By the 1940s and 1950s, physicians and\nhospitals had become so accustomed to this regulatory stance toward women and\nabortion that they instituted new regulations to observe and curb the practice\nof abortion in the hospital. The medical profession and its institutions acted\nas an arm of the state. Yet the medical profession's position was contradictory. While physicians\nhelped control abortion, they too were brought under greater control. State\nofficials demanded that the profession police the practices of its members. The\nduty of self-policing and physicians' fears of prosecution for abortion created\ndilemmas for doctors who at times compromised their duties to patients in order\nto carry out their duties to the state. Furthermore, plenty of physicians provided abortions. This book points to the\npower of patients, even female patients, to influence and change medical\npractice. The widespread practice of abortion by physicians attests to both the\nability of patients to communicate their needs to physicians and the ability of\nphysicians to listen. Physicians' practices were shaped by the experiences and\nperspectives of private life, not only by professional antiabortion values. The\nphysician-patient relationship was often more close than distant. This was\nparticularly true in the early twentieth century, but became more class\nstratified as medicine became increasingly specialized and hospital oriented.\nMedicine was more of a negotiated terrain between physicians and patients than\nhas been realized. The peaks of the medical profession's public hostility to abortion have\nobscured the depth of medical involvement in abortion. The antiabortion stance\nof organized medicine should not be mistaken for an accurate representation of\nthe views and practices of the entire profession. This study views the medical\nprofession as complex and composed of competing groups with opposing views and\npractices rather than as a unified whole. The medical profession was not\nmonolithic, but divided in its attitude toward abortion and in its treatment of\npatients. This book differentiates between organized medicine and individual\nphysicians. By \"organized medicine,\" I mean medicine's institutional\nstructures, such as the American Medical Association (AMA) and other medical\nsocieties, medical schools, and hospitals that produced the official, public\nimage of the profession and acted in concert with the state. Furthermore, this\nstudy distinguishes between prescriptive commentary about medical practices, as\nfound in the medical literature, and actual practice by physicians. These\nofficial and instructional materials reveal the thought, and perhaps the\npractice, of only a few. Finally, attention to specialization is crucial.\nSpecialists played critical public roles in the history of abortion, their\ninterests and those of general practitioners were not identical. This book is the first to chart the nation's enforcement of the criminal\nabortion laws. To understand the power of law in the lives of the masses of\nAmericans requires that one take seriously the experiences of ordinary people\ncaught in criminal investigations. Thus it is necessary to analyze the\nprocesses and routine procedures of the legal system that shape those\nexperiences. Most historians of crime and punishment have focused on police and\nprisons, while historians of women and the law have focused mainly on marriage\nand property rights, not crime. Surprisingly little historical work has\nexamined the relationship between medicine and law. Few have studied law in\npractice. Analysis of the day-to-day workings of the legal system, rather than\nstatutory changes, judicial rulings, or the volume of cases, reveals how the\nlaw intervened in the lives of ordinary citizens to regulate reproductive and\nsexual behavior.\" Punishment for violation of the law and sexual norms has been gendered. In\nabortion cases, the investigative procedures themselves constituted a form of\npunishment and control for women. Publicity and public exposure of women's\ntransgressions further served as punishment. This form of punishment served, in\nMichel Foucault's words, as \"a school.\" The shame of public exposure was for\nall of \"the potentially guilty,\" not only the individual who had been caught.\nThis eighteenth-century mode of punishment, thought to have been replaced by\nthe surveillance of the prison, persisted in the state's response to women and\ntheir sexual crimes. Without analyzing gender, we cannot fully understand the\nsystems of punishment. Even as the abortion statutes remained the same through this period, the\nmeaning of the law and the legality and illegality of abortion changed over\ntime. Law is not fixed, but fluid. The criminal abortion laws passed in every\nstate by T880 made exceptions for therapeutic abortions performed in order to\nsave a woman's life. Because the laws governing abortion did not precisely\ndefine what was criminal and what was not, this had to be worked out in\npractice, in policing, and in the courts. The complexity of defining \"legal\"\nand \"illegal\" abortions for medical practitioners and legal authorities alike,\nthe gray and ever-shifting nature of \"criminality,\" is an important theme in\nthis book. Nor was medical understanding of therapeutic abortion stable.\nMedicine too is interpretive and changing. Throughout the period of illegal\nabortion, physicians disagreed on the conditions that mandated a therapeutic\nabortion and on the methods: there was no consensus. Changes in medicine\ninfluenced legal definitions of crime; at the same time, the law shaped medical\nthinking and practice. The medical profession and the legal profession each\nlooked to the other to define the legality of abortion practices. Therapeutic\nabortion became increasingly important in the 1930s; by the 1960s the practice\n(and nonpractice) of therapeutic abortion was at the very heart of the campaign\nto reform and repeal the criminal abortion laws. The illegality of abortion has hidden the existence of an unarticulated,\nalternative, popular morality, which supported women who had abortions. This\npopular ethic contradicted the law, the official attitude of the medical\nprofession, and the teachings of some religions. Private discussions among\nfamily and friends, conversations between women and doctors, and the behavior\nof women (and the people who aided them) suggest that traditional ideas that\naccepted early abortions endured into the twentieth century. Furthermore,\nthrough the 1920s at least, working-class women did not make a distinction\nbetween contraceptives and abortion. What I call a popular morality that\naccepted abortion was almost never publicly expressed but was rooted in\npeople's daily lives. Americans have a long history of accepting abortion in\ncertain situations as a necessity and as a decision that, implicitly, belongs\nto women to make. This popular attitude made itself felt in the courts and in\ndoctors' offices: prosecutors found it difficult to convict abortionists\nbecause juries regularly nullified the law by acquitting abortionists,  and few\nphysicians escaped the pressure from women for abortions. Throughout the period\nof illegal abortion, women asserted their need for abortion and, in doing so,\nimplicitly asserted their sense of having a right to control their own\nreproduction. I am not suggesting a \"gap\" between people's beliefs and their ability to live\nup to them, but different, even oppositional, moral perspectives. The values\nexpressed by ordinary people deserve to be taken seriously rather than\ncategorized and dismissed as sinful or mistaken. Though some felt guilt about\nabortion and found ways to justify their behavior, others never held the\nofficial antiabortion views. Prescribed morality and popular morality may not\nbe identical. Analysis of women's practices and ideas -- popular\nbehavior and\nbelief -- rather than exclusive focus on the statements of male\ntheologians and\nphilosophers suggests that it is incorrect to conclude that hostility to\nabortion is \"almost an absolute value in history.\" The reverse may be more\naccurate. Although this book takes note of religious teachings and the religious\nbackground of women who had abortions, it does not focus on religious opinion.\nOrganized religion had little interest in abortion until it entered the public,\npolitical arena in the late 1950s and early 1960s. There was no reason to\nenergetically fight abortion when, for nearly a century, abortion was a crime\nand no social movement suggested otherwise. From the 1920s on, however, there\nwas much religious interest in, and division over, another method of\nreproductive control: contraception. Birth control became a topic of interest\nbecause a movement advocated women's right to reproductive control. Further, it\nis incorrect to assume that the Catholic Church has always organized against\nabortion or that all Catholics subscribe to the views of their church leaders.\nIndeed, many Catholics shared what I have described as a popular ethic\naccepting abortion. A good history of religion and reproductive control would\nexamine not only theology and sermons, but also the attitudes and actions of\nthe congregations, with particular attention to women. Women who had abortions did so within a context of illegality and religious\ndisapproval, but the prohibitions were ambiguous. Christian traditions had\ntabooed abortion since antiquity, but the acceptance of abortion in order to\nsave the life of a pregnant woman had a long tradition as well. Until the\nmid-nineteenth century, the Catholic Church implicitly accepted early abortions\nprior to ensoulment. Not until T869, at about the same time that abortion\nbecame politicized in this country, did the church condemn abortion; in 1895,\nit condemned therapeutic abortion. Protestant churches accepted abortion when\npregnancy threatened a woman's life, a view shared by the medical profession\nand written into the nation's laws. Jewish tradition clearly viewed the woman's\nlife as primary. The Mishnah, a code of ancient Jewish law that guided later\nrabbinic thought, required abortion when childbirth threatened a woman's life,\nfor \"her life takes precedence over its life.\" This study points to the importance of studying the social history of\nsexuality as well as the medical and legal discourse about it. These discourses\nregarding abortion are important because they introduced new meanings of\nabortion and shaped people's views (and fears) of abortion and sexuality. I\nanalyze the language women used to describe abortion and the production of\nstories about abortion in the press and in the courtroom. Yet exclusive\nattention to professional or even popular discourse about abortion would result\nin a distorted picture of that history. Medical discourse has convinced some\nscholars that physicians did not perform abortions in the period of illegal\nabortion, and most press coverage of abortion in the early twentieth century\ngives the misleading impression that abortion was universally condemned and\ngenerally fatal. These conclusions are not correct. Analysis of discourse alone\nwould miss the ongoing medical practice of abortion in total contradiction of\nofficial medical mores. As others have pointed out, Foucault's theory\nconcerning the production of sexuality through discourse ignores differences in\nthe power of individuals and social groups to enter and shape discourse. The\npublicly articulated and published discussion of abortion rarely included the\nvoices or perspectives of women who had abortions, except to provide shocking\nexamples of depraved womanhood. Women who had abortions did not intervene to\nexplain themselves, but instead, in other nonpublic arenas, made their\nperspectives known and acted to obtain a much-needed method for preventing\nbirths. More tolerant attitudes toward abortion, rooted in material\nexperiences, persisted in the face of a public discourse that denounced it. The\nhistory of sexuality and reproduction demands a combined analysis of ideas and\npractice. Common Law and the Criminalization of Abortion Abortion was not always a crime. During the eighteenth and early nineteenth\ncenturies, abortion of early pregnancy was legal under common law. Abortions\nwere illegal only after \"quickening,\" the point at which a pregnant woman could\nfeel the movements of the fetus (approximately the fourth month of pregnancy).\nThe common law's attitude toward pregnancy and abortion was based on an\nunderstanding of pregnancy and human development as a process rather than an\nabsolute moment. Indeed, the term abortion referred only to the miscarriages of\nlater pregnancies, after quickening. What we would now identify as an early\ninduced abortion was not called an abortion at all. If an early pregnancy\nended, it had \"slipp[ed] away,\" or the menses had been \"restored.\" At\nconception and the earliest stage of pregnancy before quickening, no one\nbelieved that a human life existed; not even the Catholic Church took this\nview. Rather, the popular ethic regarding abortion and common law were grounded\nin the female experience of their own bodies. Colonial and early-nineteenth-century women, historians have learned,\nperceived conception as the \"blocking\" or \"obstructing\" of menstruation, which\nrequired attention. The cessation of the menses indicated a worrisome imbalance\nin the body and the need to bring the body back into balance by restoring the\nflow. This idea of menstruation corresponded with medical and popular\nunderstanding of sickness and health. The body was a delicate system of\nequilibrium that could easily be thrown out of balance -- by a change\nin weather\nor diet, for example -- and that then needed to be restored through active\nintervention. A disruption in the healthy body, in the worldview of patients\nand physicians, required a visible, often violent, physical response to\ntreatment in order to restore equilibrium. This theory underlay eighteenth and\nnineteenth-century regular medical practice, which emphasized heroic\nmeasures -- bleeding, blistering, purging, and puking -- in\nresponse to sickness.\nThe response to the blocking of the menses was part of this shared\nunderstanding of the body: women took drugs in order to make their menses\nregular and regarded the ensuing vomiting and evacuation as evidence of the\ndrugs' effective action. Restoring the menses was a domestic practice. The power of certain herbs to\nrestore menstruation was widely known. One colonial woman who feared pregnancy\nhad \"twice taken Savin; once boyled in milk and the other time strayned through\na Cloath.\" Savin, derived from juniper bushes, was the most popular\nabortifacient and easily acquired since junipers grew wild throughout the\ncountry. Other herbs used as abortifacients included pennyroyal, tansy, ergot,\nand seneca snakeroot. Slave women used cottonroot. Many of these useful plants\ncould be found in the woods or cultivated. in gardens, and women could refer to\nhome medical guides for recipes for \"bringing on the menses.\" Both of these concepts, blocked menses and quickening, must be taken seriously\nby late-twentieth-century observers. Blocked menses cannot be dismissed as an\nexcuse made by women who knew they were pregnant. Quickening was a moment\nrecognized by women and by law as a defining moment in human development. Once\nquickening occurred, women recognized a moral obligation to carry the fetus to\nterm. This age-old idea underpinned the practice of abortion in America. The\nlegal acceptance of induced miscarriages before quickening tacitly assumed that\nwomen had a basic right to bodily integrity. By the mid-eighteenth century, the most common means of inducing\nabortion -- by\ntaking drugs was commercialized. The availability of abortifacients was so\nwell-known that a common euphemism described their use. When Sarah Grosvenor, a\nConnecticut farm girl, confided to her sister in 1742 that she was \"taking the\ntrade,\" her sister understood. That Grosvenor successfully conveyed her meaning\nto her sister in three metaphoric words tells us a great deal about the world\nof mid-eighteenth-century New England. Many New Englanders, including these\nsisters, knew of the possibility of inducing an abortion by purchasing and\ningesting drugs. The need for a euphemism tells of the difficulty of speaking\nopenly about sex and reproductive control and of the need for secrecy. Yet it\nreveals an awareness that women could and did regulate their own fertility\nthrough abortion. Furthermore, abortifacients had become a profitable product\nsold by doctors, apothecaries, and other healers. The first statutes governing abortion in the United States, James Mohr has\nfound, were poison control measures designed to protect pregnant women like\nGrosvenor by controlling the sale of abortifacient drugs, which often killed\nthe women who took them. The proliferation of entrepreneurs who openly sold and\nadvertised abortifacients may have inspired this early legislation, passed in\nthe 1820s and 1830s. The 18 Illinois law, which prohibited the provision of\nabortifacients, was listed under \"poisoning.\" It is crucial to recognize what these early-nineteenth-century laws did not\ncover: they did not punish women for inducing abortions, and they did not\neliminate the concept of quickening. Even as poison control measures, they said\nnothing about growing the plants needed in one's own garden or mixing together\none's own home remedy in order to induce an abortion. The legal silence on\ndomestic practices suggests that the new laws were aimed at the\ncommercialization of this practice and, implicitly, retained to women the right\nto make their own decisions about their pregnancies before quickening. By the 1840s, the abortion business boomed. Despite the laws forbidding the\nsale of abortifacients, they were advertised in the popular press and could be\npurchased from physicians or pharmacists or through the mail. If drugs failed,\nwomen could go to a practitioner who specialized in performing instrumental\nabortions. Advertisements and newspaper exposes made it appear that what had\nbeen an occasional domestic practice had become a daily occurrence performed\nfor profit in northern cities. Madame Restell, for example, openly advertised\nand provided abortion services for thirty-five years. Restell began her\nabortion business in New York City in the late 1830s; by the mid-1840s, she had\noffices in Boston and Philadelphia and traveling agents who sold her \"Female\nMonthly Pills.\" Restell became the most infamous abortionist in the country,\nbut she was not the only abortionist. The clientele of these busy clinics were\nprimarily married, white, native-born Protestant women of the upper and middle\nclasses. In 1857, the newly organized AMA initiated a crusade to make abortion at every\nstage of pregnancy illegal. The antiabortion campaign grew in part, James Mohr\nhas shown, out of regular physicians' desire to win professional power, control\nmedical practice, and restrict their competitors, particularly Homeopaths and\nmidwives. \"Regular,\" or \"orthodox,\" physicians, practitioners of \"heroic\"\nmedicine, had come under attack in the 1820s and 1830s as elitist. They faced\ncompetition from a variety of practitioners from other medical sects,\ncollectively known as \"Irregulars.\" Through the 1870S, regular physicians\nacross the country worked for the passage of new criminal abortion laws. In\nsecuring criminal abortion laws, the Regulars won recognition of their\nparticular views as well as some state control over the practice of\nmedicine. Though professional issues underlay the medical campaign, gender, racial, and\nclass anxieties pushed the criminalization of abortion forward. The visible use\nof abortion by middle-class married women, in conjunction with other challenges\nto gender norms and changes in the social makeup of the nation, generated\nanxieties among American men of the same class. Birth rates among the Yankee\nclasses had declined by mid-century while immigrants poured into the country.\nAntiabortion activists pointed out that immigrant families, many of them\nCatholic, were larger and would soon outpopulate native-born white Yankees and\nthreaten their political power. Dr. Horatio R Storer, the leader of the medical\ncampaign against abortion, envisioned the spread of \"civilization\" west and\nsouth by native-born white Americans, not Mexicans, Chinese, Blacks, Indians,\nor Catholics. \"Shall\" these regions, he asked, \"be filled by our own children\nor by those of aliens? This is a question our women must answer; upon their\nloins depends the future destiny of the nation.\" Hostility to immigrants,\nCatholics, and people of color fueled this campaign to criminalize abortion.\nWhite male patriotism demanded that maternity be enforced among white\nProtestant women. The antiabortion campaign was antifeminist at its core. Women were condemned\nfor following \"fashion\" and for avoiding the self-sacrifice expected of\nmothers. \"The true wife,\" Storer declared, did not seek `'undue power in public\nlife, . . . undue control in domestic affairs, . . . [or] privileges not her\nown.\" The antiabortion campaign was a reactionary response to two important\nefforts of the nineteenth-century women's movements: the fight to admit women\ninto the regular medical profession and the battle to make men conform to a\nsingle standard of sexual behavior. The antiabortion campaign coincided with\nthe fight by male Regulars to keep women out of their medical schools,\nsocieties, and hospitals. Boston and Harvard University, Storer's hometown and\nalma mater, were key sites of struggle over women's place in medicine, and\nStorer was personally engaged in the battle against female physicians.\nAdvocates of women in medicine argued that women doctors would protect women\npatients from sexual violation. Regular male doctors degraded female physicians\nby accusing them, along with midwives, of performing abortions. The relative morality of men and women was of crucial importance to this\ncampaign. For the specialists, whose interest in the female reproductive system\nraised questions about their sexual morality, the antiabortion campaign was a\nway to proclaim their own high morality in contrast to their competitors, their\nfemale patients, and even the ministers who tolerated abortion. It was at the\nsame time a backlash against the women's movement's critique of male sexual\nbehavior and feminist claims to political power. Nineteenth-century feminists\nexpressed their anger with male sexual domination and promiscuity in a number\nof movements, including the campaigns against prostitution and slavery and the\nfight for temperance. All sections of the women's movement advocated \"voluntary\nmotherhood,\" a slogan that addressed both men's sexual violation of their wives\nand women's desire to control childbearing. Women saw themselves as morally\nsuperior and urged men to adopt a single standard  --  the female\nstandard of\nchastity until marriage, followed by monogamy and moderation. The campaign\nagainst abortion challenged this feminist analysis of men by condemning women\nfor having abortions. Indeed, Storer compared abortion to prostitution and, in\nso doing, called into question all claims made by middle-class\nnineteenth-century women on the basis of moral superiority. \"There is little\ndifference,\" he proclaimed, \"between the immorality\" of the man who visited\nprostitutes and the woman who aborted. The nineteenth-century women's movements\nnever defended abortion, but activist women and women doctors were blamed for\nthe practice of abortion nonetheless. The antiabortion campaign attempted to destroy the idea of quickening. As\nphysicians targeted quickening, they discredited women's experiences of\npregnancy and claimed pregnancy as medical terrain. \"Quickening,\" as Storer\ndescribed it, \"is in fact but a sensation.\" A sensation that had emotional,\nsocial, and legal meaning was thus denigrated. Quickening was based on women's\nown bodily sensations -- not on medical diagnosis. It made physicians, and\nobstetricians in particular, dependent on female self-diagnosis and judgment.\nQuickening could not be relied upon as an indicator of fetal life because,\nStorer argued, it did not occur at a standard moment. \"Many women never quicken\nat all,\" he joked about women's perceptions, \"though their children are born\nliving.\" Storer's propaganda aimed to erase the distinctions between earlier\nand later stages of pregnancy, thereby redefining the restoration of the\nmenses. What had previously been understood as a blockage and a restoration of\nthe menses prior to quickening was now associated with inducing a miscarriage\nafter quickening by labeling it abortion. Furthermore, Storer equated abortion\nwith infanticide. Regular medical men had entered the debate about sexual politics by attacking\nthe female practice of abortion as immoral, unwomanly, and unpatriotic. In\ngiving abortion new meaning, the Regulars provided a weapon that white,\nnative-born, male legislators could use against the women of their own class\nwho had been agitating for personal and political reform. Regular physicians\nwon passage of new criminal abortion laws because their campaign appealed to a\nset of fears of white, nativeborn, male elites about losing political power to\nCatholic immigrants and to women. Class privilege did not protect middle-class\nwhite women from public policy designed to control them. Although the\ncriminalization of abortion was aimed at middle-class white women, it affected\nwomen of every class and race. The new laws passed across the country between\n1860 and 1880 regarded abortion in an entirely different light from common law\nand the statutes regulating abortifacients. In general, the laws included two\ninnovations: they eliminated the common-law idea of quickening and prohibited\nabortion at any point in pregnancy. Some included punishment for the women who\nhad abortions. The \"Comstock Law\" passed in 1873 included abortion and birth\ncontrol in federal antiobscenity legislation; states and municipalities passed\nsimilar ordinances. The antiabortion laws made one exception: physicians could perform therapeutic\nabortions if pregnancy and childbirth threatened the woman's life. A bill\ncriminalizing abortion unless done for \" bona fide medical or surgical\npurposes\" passed the Illinois state legislature unanimously and was signed into\nlaw in 1867. A few years later, Illinois passed another law prohibiting the\nsale of abortifacients but made an exception for \"the written prescription of\nsome well known and respectable practicing physician.\" Physicians had won the\ncriminalization of abortion and retained to themselves alone the right to\ninduce abortions when they determined it necessary. Through the antiabortion campaign, doctors claimed scientific authority to\ndefine life and death. In so doing, they claimed the authority of religious\nleaders. In leading this moral crusade and thoroughly criticizing the\nministry's lack of interest in abortion, regular doctors set themselves above\nreligious leaders as well as above the general populace. The medical\nprofession's claim to moral purity and the authority of the clergy was a\nstepping-stone to greater social authority. Regular physicians won an important\nvictory when they persuaded the nation's states to criminalize abortion.\nPhysicians entered a new partnership with the state and won the power to set\nreproductive policy. In the process, women's perceptions of pregnancy were\ndelegitimated and women lost what had been a common-law right. Periodization: Changing Patterns of Illegal Abortion During the more than one hundred years that abortion was illegal in the United\nStates, the patterns; practice, policing, and politics of abortion all changed\nover time, though not always simultaneously. I trace the history along several\nlines at once, according to the location, practice, and availability of\nabortion as well as its regulation. Abortion was widely available throughout\nmuch of the era when abortion was a crime. Yet periods of tolerance were\npunctuated by moments of severe repression. At some points the changing\nstructure of medicine brought about crucial changes in the history of abortion;\nat others, changes in women's lives or the political and economic context came\nto the fore. In the nineteenth century, abortion came under attack at a moment when women\nwere claiming political power; in the twentieth century, it came under attack\nwhen they claimed sexual freedom. Abortion, like contraception, means that\nwomen can separate sex and procreation -- still a controversial notion.\nAntiabortion campaigns developed when women asserted sexual independence, as\nduring the Progressive Era and since the 1970s. When abortion was most firmly\nlinked to the needs of family rather than the freedoms of women, as during the\nDepression, it was most ignored by those who would suppress it. Periods of\nantiabortion activity mark moments of hostility to female independence. The epoch of illegal abortion may be broken down into four periods. The first\ncovers the time from the criminalization of abortion state-by-state,\naccomplished nationwide by 1880, to 1930. This period, covering fifty years, is\nheavily marked by continuity. As other historians have also found, the\nreproductive lives of most women and the day-to-day practice of most physicians\nchanged slowly. In this period, abortion was widely accepted and was practiced\nin women's homes and in the offices of physicians and midwives. The diversity\nof practitioners, the privacy of medical practice, and the autonomy of\nphysicians in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries made the\nwidespread medical practice of abortion possible. A crackdown on abortion\noccurred between 1890 and 1920 as specialists in obstetrics renewed the earlier\ncampaign against abortion, and the medical profession was drawn into the\nstate's enforcement system. The structural transformation that occurred during the 1930s, the second\nperiod, was crucial for the history of abortion. Abortion became more available\nand changed location. As the practice moved from private offices and homes to\nhospitals and clinics, abortion was consolidated in medical hands and became\nmore visible. The changes wrought by the Depression accelerated the pace of\nchange in the coming decades, particularly in the methods of enforcing the\ncriminal abortion laws. The third period was marked by increasing restrictions on abortion by state\nand medical authorities and intensifying demand for abortion from women of all\ngroups. This period begins in 1940, when the new methods of controlling\nabortion were first instituted, and continues through 1973, when they were\ndismantled. In reaction to the growing practice of abortion as well as apparent\nchanges in female gender and reproductive patterns, a backlash against abortion\ndeveloped. 1940 marks a dividing line as hospitals instituted new policies, and\npolice and prosecutors changed their tactics. The repression of abortion was\npart of the repression of political and personal deviance that took place in\nthe 1940s and 1950s. Yet even in this period, the practice of abortion expanded\nin new directions in response to relentless demand. The new repression of\nabortion, however, was devastating for women. A dual system of abortion,\ndivided by race and class, developed. During the postwar period, the\ncriminalization of abortion produced its harshest results. A new stage in the history of abortion, the movement to legalize it, overlaps\nwith the third period. The movement to decriminalize abortion began in the\nmid-1950s and arose out of the difficult experiences resulting from the\nrepression of abortion in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1950s, a handful of\nphysicians began to challenge the very abortion laws their profession had\nadvocated a century earlier. The progress of that challenge attests to the\ncontinuing power of the medical profession to make public policy regarding\nreproduction. As legal reform moved forward, a new feminist movement arose,\nwhich radically transformed the movement for legal change. When the women's\nmovement described abortion as an aspect of sexual freedom, they articulated a\nnew feminist meaning for abortion; when they demanded abortion as a right, they\nechoed generations of women. The structure of this book follows this periodization. The first half of the\nbook uncovers the history of abortion from the late nineteenth century through\nthe 1920s. Chapters 1 through 4 each cover different aspects of abortion, from\nwomen's lives to practice to politics to enforcement, during the first\nhalf-century of illegal abortion. The changes of the 1930S, both medical and\nsocial, precipitated other changes. The second half of the book traces the\nhistory of abortion in chronologically ordered chapters concluding with the\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions that ended the era of illegal abortion. Women's history of abortion needs to be examined both as a commonly felt need\nto control reproduction, arising from women's biological capacity to bear\nchildren and social relations that assign childbearing to women, and in terms\nof differences among women. This book differentiates among women by class, race\nand ethnic identity, and marital status. Though class did not absolutely\ndetermine access to or safety of abortion, class position helped define when a\nwoman felt she needed an abortion and affected the type available to her. In\ngeneral, urban women had greater access to abortion than rural women, though\nsome rural women located abortionists in their areas or traveled to cities for\nabortions. Race played a less obvious role in access to abortion, though the\ngrim statistics of the postwar period show the connection between\ndiscrimination and death. I have made a specific effort to locate sources\nrelated to African Americans in order to learn more about black women's use of\nabortion and how race shaped the history of abortion. Evidence concerning women\nof color is meager, however, until the 1930s, when medical and sociological\nstudies began separating their findings by race. Before then, contemporary\nobservers tended to focus their attention on the differences among many (white)\nforeign-born ethnic groups. This book integrates a national analysis of the history of abortion with a\nlocal study. The advantage of this approach is that it connects everyday life\nand local medical and legal practice to national policy. It examines that\nrelationship rather than assuming that all the public policy action takes place\non the federal level without reference to local and \"private\" events. I select\na major metropolis in order to uncover the nature of both abortion practices\nand police enforcement of the criminal abortion laws. Chicago, the second\nlargest city in the nation, is the focus of my local study. Chicago, the city\nin \"the heartland\" that has of ten served as a metaphor for the spirit of\nAmerica, was also known as an important medical center (the home of the AMA)\nand as a regional center for abortion. Trains brought European immigrants, men\nand women migrating from farms to the city, African Americans moving from the\nSouth to the North, all going to live and work in Chicago. The same trains\nbrought women looking for abortions. Directing my attention to one city enabled\nme to uncover the nitty-gritty details of the practice and regulation of\nabortion. Though much of my analysis of the history of abortion draws on Chicago as a\ncase study, sources verify that my findings hold true for other cities, large\nand small. Throughout I present national data and trends as well as regional\nones and take note of patterns elsewhere. The book moves back and forth from a\nnational overview of abortion practices and politics to a close look at events\nin Chicago. As medical practice became more standardized in hospitals, the\nstory becomes a more national one and key events take place in other cities:\nNew York, Detroit, Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington, D.C.,\nand elsewhere. This is primarily a study of abortion in urban areas, where\nabortion was concentrated. I comment occasionally on practices in rural areas,\nbut the history of reproductive control and abortion is likely to be somewhat\ndifferent there. Legal records, most notably lower-level court and criminal trial records, and\nmedical literature make up the foundation of my research. I have also surveyed\nother government documents, newspapers, popular periodicals, hospital records,\nand manuscript collections. Using these materials, I have delineated how\nmedical thinking and state regulation have changed over time. Yet this is more\nthan a study of prescriptive literature or policy. I have uncovered the\ncircumstances of hundreds of actual induced abortions and reconstructed\nchanging abortion practices. This study periodizes the history of abortion for\nthe first time. This book presents the lives of many women and their abortions in rich detail\nin order to convey the variety and intricacy of the situations that made\nabortion necessary for women. It is in the minutiae of women's lives that we\ncan discover why women had abortions and how they won sympathy from physicians\nwho belonged to a profession dedicated to fighting abortion. Abortion was a\nmoment in a woman's reproductive life. It cannot be separated from sexual\nrelations or reproduction as a whole. Women themselves did not separate them,\nnor should we, whether analyzing abortion in the past or present. This book\ndeepens our understanding of the female experience of reproduction and the\nconnections between sexuality, contraception, pregnancy, and childbirth. At its\nmost fundamental, a policy that restricts abortion is one that forces women\ninto maternity. Without contraceptives and abortion, most women in heterosexual\nrelationships will become pregnant and bear children, whether they want to or\nnot. When women sought abortions, they often revealed the texture of\nheterosexual relations and the rest of their lives. Many situations made\nenduring pregnancy unbearable to women. In using abortion, women rebelled\nagainst the law and asserted their sense that the decision to carry a pregnancy\nto term or to abort was theirs to make. A few expressed in words as well as in\naction the view that abortion was their right. The experiences of women's\nprivate lives and private practices over the course of one hundred years\naltered medical thinking and reshaped public policy. Despite the fact that\nwomen's abortion narratives are part of our own contemporary discourse, the\nstories told here have long been hidden.

While physicians\nhelped control abortion, they too were brought under greater control. State\nofficials demanded that the profession police the practices of its members. The\nduty of self-policing and physicians' fears of prosecution for abortion created\ndilemmas for doctors who at times compromised their duties to patients in order\nto carry out their duties to the state. Furthermore, plenty of physicians provided abortions. This book points to the\npower of patients, even female patients, to influence and change medical\npractice. The widespread practice of abortion by physicians attests to both the\nability of patients to communicate their needs to physicians and the ability of\nphysicians to listen. Physicians' practices were shaped by the experiences and\nperspectives of private life, not only by professional antiabortion values. The\nphysician-patient relationship was often more close than distant. This was\nparticularly true in the early twentieth century, but became more class\nstratified as medicine became increasingly specialized and hospital oriented.\nMedicine was more of a negotiated terrain between physicians and patients than\nhas been realized. The peaks of the medical profession's public hostility to abortion have\nobscured the depth of medical involvement in abortion. The antiabortion stance\nof organized medicine should not be mistaken for an accurate representation of\nthe views and practices of the entire profession. This study views the medical\nprofession as complex and composed of competing groups with opposing views and\npractices rather than as a unified whole. The medical profession was not\nmonolithic, but divided in its attitude toward abortion and in its treatment of\npatients. This book differentiates between organized medicine and individual\nphysicians. By \"organized medicine,\" I mean medicine's institutional\nstructures, such as the American Medical Association (AMA) and other medical\nsocieties, medical schools, and hospitals that produced the official, public\nimage of the profession and acted in concert with the state. Furthermore, this\nstudy distinguishes between prescriptive commentary about medical practices, as\nfound in the medical literature, and actual practice by physicians. These\nofficial and instructional materials reveal the thought, and perhaps the\npractice, of only a few. Finally, attention to specialization is crucial.\nSpecialists played critical public roles in the history of abortion, their\ninterests and those of general practitioners were not identical. This book is the first to chart the nation's enforcement of the criminal\nabortion laws. To understand the power of law in the lives of the masses of\nAmericans requires that one take seriously the experiences of ordinary people\ncaught in criminal investigations. Thus it is necessary to analyze the\nprocesses and routine procedures of the legal system that shape those\nexperiences. Most historians of crime and punishment have focused on police and\nprisons, while historians of women and the law have focused mainly on marriage\nand property rights, not crime. Surprisingly little historical work has\nexamined the relationship between medicine and law. Few have studied law in\npractice. Analysis of the day-to-day workings of the legal system, rather than\nstatutory changes, judicial rulings, or the volume of cases, reveals how the\nlaw intervened in the lives of ordinary citizens to regulate reproductive and\nsexual behavior.\" Punishment for violation of the law and sexual norms has been gendered. In\nabortion cases, the investigative procedures themselves constituted a form of\npunishment and control for women. Publicity and public exposure of women's\ntransgressions further served as punishment. This form of punishment served, in\nMichel Foucault's words, as \"a school.\" The shame of public exposure was for\nall of \"the potentially guilty,\" not only the individual who had been caught.\nThis eighteenth-century mode of punishment, thought to have been replaced by\nthe surveillance of the prison, persisted in the state's response to women and\ntheir sexual crimes. Without analyzing gender, we cannot fully understand the\nsystems of punishment. Even as the abortion statutes remained the same through this period, the\nmeaning of the law and the legality and illegality of abortion changed over\ntime. Law is not fixed, but fluid. The criminal abortion laws passed in every\nstate by T880 made exceptions for therapeutic abortions performed in order to\nsave a woman's life. Because the laws governing abortion did not precisely\ndefine what was criminal and what was not, this had to be worked out in\npractice, in policing, and in the courts. The complexity of defining \"legal\"\nand \"illegal\" abortions for medical practitioners and legal authorities alike,\nthe gray and ever-shifting nature of \"criminality,\" is an important theme in\nthis book. Nor was medical understanding of therapeutic abortion stable.\nMedicine too is interpretive and changing. Throughout the period of illegal\nabortion, physicians disagreed on the conditions that mandated a therapeutic\nabortion and on the methods: there was no consensus. Changes in medicine\ninfluenced legal definitions of crime; at the same time, the law shaped medical\nthinking and practice. The medical profession and the legal profession each\nlooked to the other to define the legality of abortion practices. Therapeutic\nabortion became increasingly important in the 1930s; by the 1960s the practice\n(and nonpractice) of therapeutic abortion was at the very heart of the campaign\nto reform and repeal the criminal abortion laws. The illegality of abortion has hidden the existence of an unarticulated,\nalternative, popular morality, which supported women who had abortions. This\npopular ethic contradicted the law, the official attitude of the medical\nprofession, and the teachings of some religions. Private discussions among\nfamily and friends, conversations between women and doctors, and the behavior\nof women (and the people who aided them) suggest that traditional ideas that\naccepted early abortions endured into the twentieth century. Furthermore,\nthrough the 1920s at least, working-class women did not make a distinction\nbetween contraceptives and abortion. What I call a popular morality that\naccepted abortion was almost never publicly expressed but was rooted in\npeople's daily lives. Americans have a long history of accepting abortion in\ncertain situations as a necessity and as a decision that, implicitly, belongs\nto women to make. This popular attitude made itself felt in the courts and in\ndoctors' offices: prosecutors found it difficult to convict abortionists\nbecause juries regularly nullified the law by acquitting abortionists,  and few\nphysicians escaped the pressure from women for abortions. Throughout the period\nof illegal abortion, women asserted their need for abortion and, in doing so,\nimplicitly asserted their sense of having a right to control their own\nreproduction. I am not suggesting a \"gap\" between people's beliefs and their ability to live\nup to them, but different, even oppositional, moral perspectives. The values\nexpressed by ordinary people deserve to be taken seriously rather than\ncategorized and dismissed as sinful or mistaken. Though some felt guilt about\nabortion and found ways to justify their behavior, others never held the\nofficial antiabortion views. Prescribed morality and popular morality may not\nbe identical. Analysis of women's practices and ideas -- popular\nbehavior and\nbelief -- rather than exclusive focus on the statements of male\ntheologians and\nphilosophers suggests that it is incorrect to conclude that hostility to\nabortion is \"almost an absolute value in history.\" The reverse may be more\naccurate. Although this book takes note of religious teachings and the religious\nbackground of women who had abortions, it does not focus on religious opinion.\nOrganized religion had little interest in abortion until it entered the public,\npolitical arena in the late 1950s and early 1960s. There was no reason to\nenergetically fight abortion when, for nearly a century, abortion was a crime\nand no social movement suggested otherwise. From the 1920s on, however, there\nwas much religious interest in, and division over, another method of\nreproductive control: contraception. Birth control became a topic of interest\nbecause a movement advocated women's right to reproductive control. Further, it\nis incorrect to assume that the Catholic Church has always organized against\nabortion or that all Catholics subscribe to the views of their church leaders.\nIndeed, many Catholics shared what I have described as a popular ethic\naccepting abortion. A good history of religion and reproductive control would\nexamine not only theology and sermons, but also the attitudes and actions of\nthe congregations, with particular attention to women. Women who had abortions did so within a context of illegality and religious\ndisapproval, but the prohibitions were ambiguous. Christian traditions had\ntabooed abortion since antiquity, but the acceptance of abortion in order to\nsave the life of a pregnant woman had a long tradition as well. Until the\nmid-nineteenth century, the Catholic Church implicitly accepted early abortions\nprior to ensoulment. Not until T869, at about the same time that abortion\nbecame politicized in this country, did the church condemn abortion; in 1895,\nit condemned therapeutic abortion. Protestant churches accepted abortion when\npregnancy threatened a woman's life, a view shared by the medical profession\nand written into the nation's laws. Jewish tradition clearly viewed the woman's\nlife as primary. The Mishnah, a code of ancient Jewish law that guided later\nrabbinic thought, required abortion when childbirth threatened a woman's life,\nfor \"her life takes precedence over its life.\" This study points to the importance of studying the social history of\nsexuality as well as the medical and legal discourse about it. These discourses\nregarding abortion are important because they introduced new meanings of\nabortion and shaped people's views (and fears) of abortion and sexuality. I\nanalyze the language women used to describe abortion and the production of\nstories about abortion in the press and in the courtroom. Yet exclusive\nattention to professional or even popular discourse about abortion would result\nin a distorted picture of that history. Medical discourse has convinced some\nscholars that physicians did not perform abortions in the period of illegal\nabortion, and most press coverage of abortion in the early twentieth century\ngives the misleading impression that abortion was universally condemned and\ngenerally fatal. These conclusions are not correct. Analysis of discourse alone\nwould miss the ongoing medical practice of abortion in total contradiction of\nofficial medical mores. As others have pointed out, Foucault's theory\nconcerning the production of sexuality through discourse ignores differences in\nthe power of individuals and social groups to enter and shape discourse. The\npublicly articulated and published discussion of abortion rarely included the\nvoices or perspectives of women who had abortions, except to provide shocking\nexamples of depraved womanhood. Women who had abortions did not intervene to\nexplain themselves, but instead, in other nonpublic arenas, made their\nperspectives known and acted to obtain a much-needed method for preventing\nbirths. More tolerant attitudes toward abortion, rooted in material\nexperiences, persisted in the face of a public discourse that denounced it. The\nhistory of sexuality and reproduction demands a combined analysis of ideas and\npractice. Common Law and the Criminalization of Abortion Abortion was not always a crime. During the eighteenth and early nineteenth\ncenturies, abortion of early pregnancy was legal under common law. Abortions\nwere illegal only after \"quickening,\" the point at which a pregnant woman could\nfeel the movements of the fetus (approximately the fourth month of pregnancy).\nThe common law's attitude toward pregnancy and abortion was based on an\nunderstanding of pregnancy and human development as a process rather than an\nabsolute moment. Indeed, the term abortion referred only to the miscarriages of\nlater pregnancies, after quickening. What we would now identify as an early\ninduced abortion was not called an abortion at all. If an early pregnancy\nended, it had \"slipp[ed] away,\" or the menses had been \"restored.\" At\nconception and the earliest stage of pregnancy before quickening, no one\nbelieved that a human life existed; not even the Catholic Church took this\nview. Rather, the popular ethic regarding abortion and common law were grounded\nin the female experience of their own bodies. Colonial and early-nineteenth-century women, historians have learned,\nperceived conception as the \"blocking\" or \"obstructing\" of menstruation, which\nrequired attention. The cessation of the menses indicated a worrisome imbalance\nin the body and the need to bring the body back into balance by restoring the\nflow. This idea of menstruation corresponded with medical and popular\nunderstanding of sickness and health. The body was a delicate system of\nequilibrium that could easily be thrown out of balance -- by a change\nin weather\nor diet, for example -- and that then needed to be restored through active\nintervention. A disruption in the healthy body, in the worldview of patients\nand physicians, required a visible, often violent, physical response to\ntreatment in order to restore equilibrium. This theory underlay eighteenth and\nnineteenth-century regular medical practice, which emphasized heroic\nmeasures -- bleeding, blistering, purging, and puking -- in\nresponse to sickness.\nThe response to the blocking of the menses was part of this shared\nunderstanding of the body: women took drugs in order to make their menses\nregular and regarded the ensuing vomiting and evacuation as evidence of the\ndrugs' effective action. Restoring the menses was a domestic practice. The power of certain herbs to\nrestore menstruation was widely known. One colonial woman who feared pregnancy\nhad \"twice taken Savin; once boyled in milk and the other time strayned through\na Cloath.\" Savin, derived from juniper bushes, was the most popular\nabortifacient and easily acquired since junipers grew wild throughout the\ncountry. Other herbs used as abortifacients included pennyroyal, tansy, ergot,\nand seneca snakeroot. Slave women used cottonroot. Many of these useful plants\ncould be found in the woods or cultivated. in gardens, and women could refer to\nhome medical guides for recipes for \"bringing on the menses.\" Both of these concepts, blocked menses and quickening, must be taken seriously\nby late-twentieth-century observers. Blocked menses cannot be dismissed as an\nexcuse made by women who knew they were pregnant. Quickening was a moment\nrecognized by women and by law as a defining moment in human development. Once\nquickening occurred, women recognized a moral obligation to carry the fetus to\nterm. This age-old idea underpinned the practice of abortion in America. The\nlegal acceptance of induced miscarriages before quickening tacitly assumed that\nwomen had a basic right to bodily integrity. By the mid-eighteenth century, the most common means of inducing\nabortion -- by\ntaking drugs was commercialized. The availability of abortifacients was so\nwell-known that a common euphemism described their use. When Sarah Grosvenor, a\nConnecticut farm girl, confided to her sister in 1742 that she was \"taking the\ntrade,\" her sister understood. That Grosvenor successfully conveyed her meaning\nto her sister in three metaphoric words tells us a great deal about the world\nof mid-eighteenth-century New England. Many New Englanders, including these\nsisters, knew of the possibility of inducing an abortion by purchasing and\ningesting drugs. The need for a euphemism tells of the difficulty of speaking\nopenly about sex and reproductive control and of the need for secrecy. Yet it\nreveals an awareness that women could and did regulate their own fertility\nthrough abortion. Furthermore, abortifacients had become a profitable product\nsold by doctors, apothecaries, and other healers. The first statutes governing abortion in the United States, James Mohr has\nfound, were poison control measures designed to protect pregnant women like\nGrosvenor by controlling the sale of abortifacient drugs, which often killed\nthe women who took them. The proliferation of entrepreneurs who openly sold and\nadvertised abortifacients may have inspired this early legislation, passed in\nthe 1820s and 1830s. The 18 Illinois law, which prohibited the provision of\nabortifacients, was listed under \"poisoning.\" It is crucial to recognize what these early-nineteenth-century laws did not\ncover: they did not punish women for inducing abortions, and they did not\neliminate the concept of quickening. Even as poison control measures, they said\nnothing about growing the plants needed in one's own garden or mixing together\none's own home remedy in order to induce an abortion. The legal silence on\ndomestic practices suggests that the new laws were aimed at the\ncommercialization of this practice and, implicitly, retained to women the right\nto make their own decisions about their pregnancies before quickening. By the 1840s, the abortion business boomed. Despite the laws forbidding the\nsale of abortifacients, they were advertised in the popular press and could be\npurchased from physicians or pharmacists or through the mail. If drugs failed,\nwomen could go to a practitioner who specialized in performing instrumental\nabortions. Advertisements and newspaper exposes made it appear that what had\nbeen an occasional domestic practice had become a daily occurrence performed\nfor profit in northern cities. Madame Restell, for example, openly advertised\nand provided abortion services for thirty-five years. Restell began her\nabortion business in New York City in the late 1830s; by the mid-1840s, she had\noffices in Boston and Philadelphia and traveling agents who sold her \"Female\nMonthly Pills.\" Restell became the most infamous abortionist in the country,\nbut she was not the only abortionist. The clientele of these busy clinics were\nprimarily married, white, native-born Protestant women of the upper and middle\nclasses. In 1857, the newly organized AMA initiated a crusade to make abortion at every\nstage of pregnancy illegal. The antiabortion campaign grew in part, James Mohr\nhas shown, out of regular physicians' desire to win professional power, control\nmedical practice, and restrict their competitors, particularly Homeopaths and\nmidwives. \"Regular,\" or \"orthodox,\" physicians, practitioners of \"heroic\"\nmedicine, had come under attack in the 1820s and 1830s as elitist. They faced\ncompetition from a variety of practitioners from other medical sects,\ncollectively known as \"Irregulars.\" Through the 1870S, regular physicians\nacross the country worked for the passage of new criminal abortion laws. In\nsecuring criminal abortion laws, the Regulars won recognition of their\nparticular views as well as some state control over the practice of\nmedicine. Though professional issues underlay the medical campaign, gender, racial, and\nclass anxieties pushed the criminalization of abortion forward. The visible use\nof abortion by middle-class married women, in conjunction with other challenges\nto gender norms and changes in the social makeup of the nation, generated\nanxieties among American men of the same class. Birth rates among the Yankee\nclasses had declined by mid-century while immigrants poured into the country.\nAntiabortion activists pointed out that immigrant families, many of them\nCatholic, were larger and would soon outpopulate native-born white Yankees and\nthreaten their political power. Dr. Horatio R Storer, the leader of the medical\ncampaign against abortion, envisioned the spread of \"civilization\" west and\nsouth by native-born white Americans, not Mexicans, Chinese, Blacks, Indians,\nor Catholics. \"Shall\" these regions, he asked, \"be filled by our own children\nor by those of aliens? This is a question our women must answer; upon their\nloins depends the future destiny of the nation.\" Hostility to immigrants,\nCatholics, and people of color fueled this campaign to criminalize abortion.\nWhite male patriotism demanded that maternity be enforced among white\nProtestant women. The antiabortion campaign was antifeminist at its core. Women were condemned\nfor following \"fashion\" and for avoiding the self-sacrifice expected of\nmothers. \"The true wife,\" Storer declared, did not seek `'undue power in public\nlife, . . . undue control in domestic affairs, . . . [or] privileges not her\nown.\" The antiabortion campaign was a reactionary response to two important\nefforts of the nineteenth-century women's movements: the fight to admit women\ninto the regular medical profession and the battle to make men conform to a\nsingle standard of sexual behavior. The antiabortion campaign coincided with\nthe fight by male Regulars to keep women out of their medical schools,\nsocieties, and hospitals. Boston and Harvard University, Storer's hometown and\nalma mater, were key sites of struggle over women's place in medicine, and\nStorer was personally engaged in the battle against female physicians.\nAdvocates of women in medicine argued that women doctors would protect women\npatients from sexual violation. Regular male doctors degraded female physicians\nby accusing them, along with midwives, of performing abortions. The relative morality of men and women was of crucial importance to this\ncampaign. For the specialists, whose interest in the female reproductive system\nraised questions about their sexual morality, the antiabortion campaign was a\nway to proclaim their own high morality in contrast to their competitors, their\nfemale patients, and even the ministers who tolerated abortion. It was at the\nsame time a backlash against the women's movement's critique of male sexual\nbehavior and feminist claims to political power. Nineteenth-century feminists\nexpressed their anger with male sexual domination and promiscuity in a number\nof movements, including the campaigns against prostitution and slavery and the\nfight for temperance. All sections of the women's movement advocated \"voluntary\nmotherhood,\" a slogan that addressed both men's sexual violation of their wives\nand women's desire to control childbearing. Women saw themselves as morally\nsuperior and urged men to adopt a single standard  --  the female\nstandard of\nchastity until marriage, followed by monogamy and moderation. The campaign\nagainst abortion challenged this feminist analysis of men by condemning women\nfor having abortions. Indeed, Storer compared abortion to prostitution and, in\nso doing, called into question all claims made by middle-class\nnineteenth-century women on the basis of moral superiority. \"There is little\ndifference,\" he proclaimed, \"between the immorality\" of the man who visited\nprostitutes and the woman who aborted. The nineteenth-century women's movements\nnever defended abortion, but activist women and women doctors were blamed for\nthe practice of abortion nonetheless. The antiabortion campaign attempted to destroy the idea of quickening. As\nphysicians targeted quickening, they discredited women's experiences of\npregnancy and claimed pregnancy as medical terrain. \"Quickening,\" as Storer\ndescribed it, \"is in fact but a sensation.\" A sensation that had emotional,\nsocial, and legal meaning was thus denigrated. Quickening was based on women's\nown bodily sensations -- not on medical diagnosis. It made physicians, and\nobstetricians in particular, dependent on female self-diagnosis and judgment.\nQuickening could not be relied upon as an indicator of fetal life because,\nStorer argued, it did not occur at a standard moment. \"Many women never quicken\nat all,\" he joked about women's perceptions, \"though their children are born\nliving.\" Storer's propaganda aimed to erase the distinctions between earlier\nand later stages of pregnancy, thereby redefining the restoration of the\nmenses. What had previously been understood as a blockage and a restoration of\nthe menses prior to quickening was now associated with inducing a miscarriage\nafter quickening by labeling it abortion. Furthermore, Storer equated abortion\nwith infanticide. Regular medical men had entered the debate about sexual politics by attacking\nthe female practice of abortion as immoral, unwomanly, and unpatriotic. In\ngiving abortion new meaning, the Regulars provided a weapon that white,\nnative-born, male legislators could use against the women of their own class\nwho had been agitating for personal and political reform. Regular physicians\nwon passage of new criminal abortion laws because their campaign appealed to a\nset of fears of white, nativeborn, male elites about losing political power to\nCatholic immigrants and to women. Class privilege did not protect middle-class\nwhite women from public policy designed to control them. Although the\ncriminalization of abortion was aimed at middle-class white women, it affected\nwomen of every class and race. The new laws passed across the country between\n1860 and 1880 regarded abortion in an entirely different light from common law\nand the statutes regulating abortifacients. In general, the laws included two\ninnovations: they eliminated the common-law idea of quickening and prohibited\nabortion at any point in pregnancy. Some included punishment for the women who\nhad abortions. The \"Comstock Law\" passed in 1873 included abortion and birth\ncontrol in federal antiobscenity legislation; states and municipalities passed\nsimilar ordinances. The antiabortion laws made one exception: physicians could perform therapeutic\nabortions if pregnancy and childbirth threatened the woman's life. A bill\ncriminalizing abortion unless done for \" bona fide medical or surgical\npurposes\" passed the Illinois state legislature unanimously and was signed into\nlaw in 1867. A few years later, Illinois passed another law prohibiting the\nsale of abortifacients but made an exception for \"the written prescription of\nsome well known and respectable practicing physician.\" Physicians had won the\ncriminalization of abortion and retained to themselves alone the right to\ninduce abortions when they determined it necessary. Through the antiabortion campaign, doctors claimed scientific authority to\ndefine life and death. In so doing, they claimed the authority of religious\nleaders. In leading this moral crusade and thoroughly criticizing the\nministry's lack of interest in abortion, regular doctors set themselves above\nreligious leaders as well as above the general populace. The medical\nprofession's claim to moral purity and the authority of the clergy was a\nstepping-stone to greater social authority. Regular physicians won an important\nvictory when they persuaded the nation's states to criminalize abortion.\nPhysicians entered a new partnership with the state and won the power to set\nreproductive policy. In the process, women's perceptions of pregnancy were\ndelegitimated and women lost what had been a common-law right. Periodization: Changing Patterns of Illegal Abortion During the more than one hundred years that abortion was illegal in the United\nStates, the patterns; practice, policing, and politics of abortion all changed\nover time, though not always simultaneously. I trace the history along several\nlines at once, according to the location, practice, and availability of\nabortion as well as its regulation. Abortion was widely available throughout\nmuch of the era when abortion was a crime. Yet periods of tolerance were\npunctuated by moments of severe repression. At some points the changing\nstructure of medicine brought about crucial changes in the history of abortion;\nat others, changes in women's lives or the political and economic context came\nto the fore. In the nineteenth century, abortion came under attack at a moment when women\nwere claiming political power; in the twentieth century, it came under attack\nwhen they claimed sexual freedom. Abortion, like contraception, means that\nwomen can separate sex and procreation -- still a controversial notion.\nAntiabortion campaigns developed when women asserted sexual independence, as\nduring the Progressive Era and since the 1970s. When abortion was most firmly\nlinked to the needs of family rather than the freedoms of women, as during the\nDepression, it was most ignored by those who would suppress it. Periods of\nantiabortion activity mark moments of hostility to female independence. The epoch of illegal abortion may be broken down into four periods. The first\ncovers the time from the criminalization of abortion state-by-state,\naccomplished nationwide by 1880, to 1930. This period, covering fifty years, is\nheavily marked by continuity. As other historians have also found, the\nreproductive lives of most women and the day-to-day practice of most physicians\nchanged slowly. In this period, abortion was widely accepted and was practiced\nin women's homes and in the offices of physicians and midwives. The diversity\nof practitioners, the privacy of medical practice, and the autonomy of\nphysicians in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries made the\nwidespread medical practice of abortion possible. A crackdown on abortion\noccurred between 1890 and 1920 as specialists in obstetrics renewed the earlier\ncampaign against abortion, and the medical profession was drawn into the\nstate's enforcement system. The structural transformation that occurred during the 1930s, the second\nperiod, was crucial for the history of abortion. Abortion became more available\nand changed location. As the practice moved from private offices and homes to\nhospitals and clinics, abortion was consolidated in medical hands and became\nmore visible. The changes wrought by the Depression accelerated the pace of\nchange in the coming decades, particularly in the methods of enforcing the\ncriminal abortion laws. The third period was marked by increasing restrictions on abortion by state\nand medical authorities and intensifying demand for abortion from women of all\ngroups. This period begins in 1940, when the new methods of controlling\nabortion were first instituted, and continues through 1973, when they were\ndismantled. In reaction to the growing practice of abortion as well as apparent\nchanges in female gender and reproductive patterns, a backlash against abortion\ndeveloped. 1940 marks a dividing line as hospitals instituted new policies, and\npolice and prosecutors changed their tactics. The repression of abortion was\npart of the repression of political and personal deviance that took place in\nthe 1940s and 1950s. Yet even in this period, the practice of abortion expanded\nin new directions in response to relentless demand. The new repression of\nabortion, however, was devastating for women. A dual system of abortion,\ndivided by race and class, developed. During the postwar period, the\ncriminalization of abortion produced its harshest results. A new stage in the history of abortion, the movement to legalize it, overlaps\nwith the third period. The movement to decriminalize abortion began in the\nmid-1950s and arose out of the difficult experiences resulting from the\nrepression of abortion in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1950s, a handful of\nphysicians began to challenge the very abortion laws their profession had\nadvocated a century earlier. The progress of that challenge attests to the\ncontinuing power of the medical profession to make public policy regarding\nreproduction. As legal reform moved forward, a new feminist movement arose,\nwhich radically transformed the movement for legal change. When the women's\nmovement described abortion as an aspect of sexual freedom, they articulated a\nnew feminist meaning for abortion; when they demanded abortion as a right, they\nechoed generations of women. The structure of this book follows this periodization. The first half of the\nbook uncovers the history of abortion from the late nineteenth century through\nthe 1920s. Chapters 1 through 4 each cover different aspects of abortion, from\nwomen's lives to practice to politics to enforcement, during the first\nhalf-century of illegal abortion. The changes of the 1930S, both medical and\nsocial, precipitated other changes. The second half of the book traces the\nhistory of abortion in chronologically ordered chapters concluding with the\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions that ended the era of illegal abortion. Women's history of abortion needs to be examined both as a commonly felt need\nto control reproduction, arising from women's biological capacity to bear\nchildren and social relations that assign childbearing to women, and in terms\nof differences among women. This book differentiates among women by class, race\nand ethnic identity, and marital status. Though class did not absolutely\ndetermine access to or safety of abortion, class position helped define when a\nwoman felt she needed an abortion and affected the type available to her. In\ngeneral, urban women had greater access to abortion than rural women, though\nsome rural women located abortionists in their areas or traveled to cities for\nabortions. Race played a less obvious role in access to abortion, though the\ngrim statistics of the postwar period show the connection between\ndiscrimination and death. I have made a specific effort to locate sources\nrelated to African Americans in order to learn more about black women's use of\nabortion and how race shaped the history of abortion. Evidence concerning women\nof color is meager, however, until the 1930s, when medical and sociological\nstudies began separating their findings by race. Before then, contemporary\nobservers tended to focus their attention on the differences among many (white)\nforeign-born ethnic groups. This book integrates a national analysis of the history of abortion with a\nlocal study. The advantage of this approach is that it connects everyday life\nand local medical and legal practice to national policy. It examines that\nrelationship rather than assuming that all the public policy action takes place\non the federal level without reference to local and \"private\" events. I select\na major metropolis in order to uncover the nature of both abortion practices\nand police enforcement of the criminal abortion laws. Chicago, the second\nlargest city in the nation, is the focus of my local study. Chicago, the city\nin \"the heartland\" that has of ten served as a metaphor for the spirit of\nAmerica, was also known as an important medical center (the home of the AMA)\nand as a regional center for abortion. Trains brought European immigrants, men\nand women migrating from farms to the city, African Americans moving from the\nSouth to the North, all going to live and work in Chicago. The same trains\nbrought women looking for abortions. Directing my attention to one city enabled\nme to uncover the nitty-gritty details of the practice and regulation of\nabortion. Though much of my analysis of the history of abortion draws on Chicago as a\ncase study, sources verify that my findings hold true for other cities, large\nand small. Throughout I present national data and trends as well as regional\nones and take note of patterns elsewhere. The book moves back and forth from a\nnational overview of abortion practices and politics to a close look at events\nin Chicago. As medical practice became more standardized in hospitals, the\nstory becomes a more national one and key events take place in other cities:\nNew York, Detroit, Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington, D.C.,\nand elsewhere. This is primarily a study of abortion in urban areas, where\nabortion was concentrated. I comment occasionally on practices in rural areas,\nbut the history of reproductive control and abortion is likely to be somewhat\ndifferent there. Legal records, most notably lower-level court and criminal trial records, and\nmedical literature make up the foundation of my research. I have also surveyed\nother government documents, newspapers, popular periodicals, hospital records,\nand manuscript collections. Using these materials, I have delineated how\nmedical thinking and state regulation have changed over time. Yet this is more\nthan a study of prescriptive literature or policy. I have uncovered the\ncircumstances of hundreds of actual induced abortions and reconstructed\nchanging abortion practices. This study periodizes the history of abortion for\nthe first time. This book presents the lives of many women and their abortions in rich detail\nin order to convey the variety and intricacy of the situations that made\nabortion necessary for women. It is in the minutiae of women's lives that we\ncan discover why women had abortions and how they won sympathy from physicians\nwho belonged to a profession dedicated to fighting abortion. Abortion was a\nmoment in a woman's reproductive life. It cannot be separated from sexual\nrelations or reproduction as a whole. Women themselves did not separate them,\nnor should we, whether analyzing abortion in the past or present. This book\ndeepens our understanding of the female experience of reproduction and the\nconnections between sexuality, contraception, pregnancy, and childbirth. At its\nmost fundamental, a policy that restricts abortion is one that forces women\ninto maternity. Without contraceptives and abortion, most women in heterosexual\nrelationships will become pregnant and bear children, whether they want to or\nnot. When women sought abortions, they often revealed the texture of\nheterosexual relations and the rest of their lives. Many situations made\nenduring pregnancy unbearable to women. In using abortion, women rebelled\nagainst the law and asserted their sense that the decision to carry a pregnancy\nto term or to abort was theirs to make. A few expressed in words as well as in\naction the view that abortion was their right. The experiences of women's\nprivate lives and private practices over the course of one hundred years\naltered medical thinking and reshaped public policy. Despite the fact that\nwomen's abortion narratives are part of our own contemporary discourse, the\nstories told here have long been hidden.

This book points to the\npower of patients, even female patients, to influence and change medical\npractice. The widespread practice of abortion by physicians attests to both the\nability of patients to communicate their needs to physicians and the ability of\nphysicians to listen. Physicians' practices were shaped by the experiences and\nperspectives of private life, not only by professional antiabortion values. The\nphysician-patient relationship was often more close than distant. This was\nparticularly true in the early twentieth century, but became more class\nstratified as medicine became increasingly specialized and hospital oriented.\nMedicine was more of a negotiated terrain between physicians and patients than\nhas been realized. The peaks of the medical profession's public hostility to abortion have\nobscured the depth of medical involvement in abortion. The antiabortion stance\nof organized medicine should not be mistaken for an accurate representation of\nthe views and practices of the entire profession. This study views the medical\nprofession as complex and composed of competing groups with opposing views and\npractices rather than as a unified whole. The medical profession was not\nmonolithic, but divided in its attitude toward abortion and in its treatment of\npatients. This book differentiates between organized medicine and individual\nphysicians. By \"organized medicine,\" I mean medicine's institutional\nstructures, such as the American Medical Association (AMA) and other medical\nsocieties, medical schools, and hospitals that produced the official, public\nimage of the profession and acted in concert with the state. Furthermore, this\nstudy distinguishes between prescriptive commentary about medical practices, as\nfound in the medical literature, and actual practice by physicians. These\nofficial and instructional materials reveal the thought, and perhaps the\npractice, of only a few. Finally, attention to specialization is crucial.\nSpecialists played critical public roles in the history of abortion, their\ninterests and those of general practitioners were not identical. This book is the first to chart the nation's enforcement of the criminal\nabortion laws. To understand the power of law in the lives of the masses of\nAmericans requires that one take seriously the experiences of ordinary people\ncaught in criminal investigations. Thus it is necessary to analyze the\nprocesses and routine procedures of the legal system that shape those\nexperiences. Most historians of crime and punishment have focused on police and\nprisons, while historians of women and the law have focused mainly on marriage\nand property rights, not crime. Surprisingly little historical work has\nexamined the relationship between medicine and law. Few have studied law in\npractice. Analysis of the day-to-day workings of the legal system, rather than\nstatutory changes, judicial rulings, or the volume of cases, reveals how the\nlaw intervened in the lives of ordinary citizens to regulate reproductive and\nsexual behavior.\" Punishment for violation of the law and sexual norms has been gendered. In\nabortion cases, the investigative procedures themselves constituted a form of\npunishment and control for women. Publicity and public exposure of women's\ntransgressions further served as punishment. This form of punishment served, in\nMichel Foucault's words, as \"a school.\" The shame of public exposure was for\nall of \"the potentially guilty,\" not only the individual who had been caught.\nThis eighteenth-century mode of punishment, thought to have been replaced by\nthe surveillance of the prison, persisted in the state's response to women and\ntheir sexual crimes. Without analyzing gender, we cannot fully understand the\nsystems of punishment. Even as the abortion statutes remained the same through this period, the\nmeaning of the law and the legality and illegality of abortion changed over\ntime. Law is not fixed, but fluid. The criminal abortion laws passed in every\nstate by T880 made exceptions for therapeutic abortions performed in order to\nsave a woman's life. Because the laws governing abortion did not precisely\ndefine what was criminal and what was not, this had to be worked out in\npractice, in policing, and in the courts. The complexity of defining \"legal\"\nand \"illegal\" abortions for medical practitioners and legal authorities alike,\nthe gray and ever-shifting nature of \"criminality,\" is an important theme in\nthis book. Nor was medical understanding of therapeutic abortion stable.\nMedicine too is interpretive and changing. Throughout the period of illegal\nabortion, physicians disagreed on the conditions that mandated a therapeutic\nabortion and on the methods: there was no consensus. Changes in medicine\ninfluenced legal definitions of crime; at the same time, the law shaped medical\nthinking and practice. The medical profession and the legal profession each\nlooked to the other to define the legality of abortion practices. Therapeutic\nabortion became increasingly important in the 1930s; by the 1960s the practice\n(and nonpractice) of therapeutic abortion was at the very heart of the campaign\nto reform and repeal the criminal abortion laws. The illegality of abortion has hidden the existence of an unarticulated,\nalternative, popular morality, which supported women who had abortions. This\npopular ethic contradicted the law, the official attitude of the medical\nprofession, and the teachings of some religions. Private discussions among\nfamily and friends, conversations between women and doctors, and the behavior\nof women (and the people who aided them) suggest that traditional ideas that\naccepted early abortions endured into the twentieth century. Furthermore,\nthrough the 1920s at least, working-class women did not make a distinction\nbetween contraceptives and abortion. What I call a popular morality that\naccepted abortion was almost never publicly expressed but was rooted in\npeople's daily lives. Americans have a long history of accepting abortion in\ncertain situations as a necessity and as a decision that, implicitly, belongs\nto women to make. This popular attitude made itself felt in the courts and in\ndoctors' offices: prosecutors found it difficult to convict abortionists\nbecause juries regularly nullified the law by acquitting abortionists,  and few\nphysicians escaped the pressure from women for abortions. Throughout the period\nof illegal abortion, women asserted their need for abortion and, in doing so,\nimplicitly asserted their sense of having a right to control their own\nreproduction. I am not suggesting a \"gap\" between people's beliefs and their ability to live\nup to them, but different, even oppositional, moral perspectives. The values\nexpressed by ordinary people deserve to be taken seriously rather than\ncategorized and dismissed as sinful or mistaken. Though some felt guilt about\nabortion and found ways to justify their behavior, others never held the\nofficial antiabortion views. Prescribed morality and popular morality may not\nbe identical. Analysis of women's practices and ideas -- popular\nbehavior and\nbelief -- rather than exclusive focus on the statements of male\ntheologians and\nphilosophers suggests that it is incorrect to conclude that hostility to\nabortion is \"almost an absolute value in history.\" The reverse may be more\naccurate. Although this book takes note of religious teachings and the religious\nbackground of women who had abortions, it does not focus on religious opinion.\nOrganized religion had little interest in abortion until it entered the public,\npolitical arena in the late 1950s and early 1960s. There was no reason to\nenergetically fight abortion when, for nearly a century, abortion was a crime\nand no social movement suggested otherwise. From the 1920s on, however, there\nwas much religious interest in, and division over, another method of\nreproductive control: contraception. Birth control became a topic of interest\nbecause a movement advocated women's right to reproductive control. Further, it\nis incorrect to assume that the Catholic Church has always organized against\nabortion or that all Catholics subscribe to the views of their church leaders.\nIndeed, many Catholics shared what I have described as a popular ethic\naccepting abortion. A good history of religion and reproductive control would\nexamine not only theology and sermons, but also the attitudes and actions of\nthe congregations, with particular attention to women. Women who had abortions did so within a context of illegality and religious\ndisapproval, but the prohibitions were ambiguous. Christian traditions had\ntabooed abortion since antiquity, but the acceptance of abortion in order to\nsave the life of a pregnant woman had a long tradition as well. Until the\nmid-nineteenth century, the Catholic Church implicitly accepted early abortions\nprior to ensoulment. Not until T869, at about the same time that abortion\nbecame politicized in this country, did the church condemn abortion; in 1895,\nit condemned therapeutic abortion. Protestant churches accepted abortion when\npregnancy threatened a woman's life, a view shared by the medical profession\nand written into the nation's laws. Jewish tradition clearly viewed the woman's\nlife as primary. The Mishnah, a code of ancient Jewish law that guided later\nrabbinic thought, required abortion when childbirth threatened a woman's life,\nfor \"her life takes precedence over its life.\" This study points to the importance of studying the social history of\nsexuality as well as the medical and legal discourse about it. These discourses\nregarding abortion are important because they introduced new meanings of\nabortion and shaped people's views (and fears) of abortion and sexuality. I\nanalyze the language women used to describe abortion and the production of\nstories about abortion in the press and in the courtroom. Yet exclusive\nattention to professional or even popular discourse about abortion would result\nin a distorted picture of that history. Medical discourse has convinced some\nscholars that physicians did not perform abortions in the period of illegal\nabortion, and most press coverage of abortion in the early twentieth century\ngives the misleading impression that abortion was universally condemned and\ngenerally fatal. These conclusions are not correct. Analysis of discourse alone\nwould miss the ongoing medical practice of abortion in total contradiction of\nofficial medical mores. As others have pointed out, Foucault's theory\nconcerning the production of sexuality through discourse ignores differences in\nthe power of individuals and social groups to enter and shape discourse. The\npublicly articulated and published discussion of abortion rarely included the\nvoices or perspectives of women who had abortions, except to provide shocking\nexamples of depraved womanhood. Women who had abortions did not intervene to\nexplain themselves, but instead, in other nonpublic arenas, made their\nperspectives known and acted to obtain a much-needed method for preventing\nbirths. More tolerant attitudes toward abortion, rooted in material\nexperiences, persisted in the face of a public discourse that denounced it. The\nhistory of sexuality and reproduction demands a combined analysis of ideas and\npractice. Common Law and the Criminalization of Abortion Abortion was not always a crime. During the eighteenth and early nineteenth\ncenturies, abortion of early pregnancy was legal under common law. Abortions\nwere illegal only after \"quickening,\" the point at which a pregnant woman could\nfeel the movements of the fetus (approximately the fourth month of pregnancy).\nThe common law's attitude toward pregnancy and abortion was based on an\nunderstanding of pregnancy and human development as a process rather than an\nabsolute moment. Indeed, the term abortion referred only to the miscarriages of\nlater pregnancies, after quickening. What we would now identify as an early\ninduced abortion was not called an abortion at all. If an early pregnancy\nended, it had \"slipp[ed] away,\" or the menses had been \"restored.\" At\nconception and the earliest stage of pregnancy before quickening, no one\nbelieved that a human life existed; not even the Catholic Church took this\nview. Rather, the popular ethic regarding abortion and common law were grounded\nin the female experience of their own bodies. Colonial and early-nineteenth-century women, historians have learned,\nperceived conception as the \"blocking\" or \"obstructing\" of menstruation, which\nrequired attention. The cessation of the menses indicated a worrisome imbalance\nin the body and the need to bring the body back into balance by restoring the\nflow. This idea of menstruation corresponded with medical and popular\nunderstanding of sickness and health. The body was a delicate system of\nequilibrium that could easily be thrown out of balance -- by a change\nin weather\nor diet, for example -- and that then needed to be restored through active\nintervention. A disruption in the healthy body, in the worldview of patients\nand physicians, required a visible, often violent, physical response to\ntreatment in order to restore equilibrium. This theory underlay eighteenth and\nnineteenth-century regular medical practice, which emphasized heroic\nmeasures -- bleeding, blistering, purging, and puking -- in\nresponse to sickness.\nThe response to the blocking of the menses was part of this shared\nunderstanding of the body: women took drugs in order to make their menses\nregular and regarded the ensuing vomiting and evacuation as evidence of the\ndrugs' effective action. Restoring the menses was a domestic practice. The power of certain herbs to\nrestore menstruation was widely known. One colonial woman who feared pregnancy\nhad \"twice taken Savin; once boyled in milk and the other time strayned through\na Cloath.\" Savin, derived from juniper bushes, was the most popular\nabortifacient and easily acquired since junipers grew wild throughout the\ncountry. Other herbs used as abortifacients included pennyroyal, tansy, ergot,\nand seneca snakeroot. Slave women used cottonroot. Many of these useful plants\ncould be found in the woods or cultivated. in gardens, and women could refer to\nhome medical guides for recipes for \"bringing on the menses.\" Both of these concepts, blocked menses and quickening, must be taken seriously\nby late-twentieth-century observers. Blocked menses cannot be dismissed as an\nexcuse made by women who knew they were pregnant. Quickening was a moment\nrecognized by women and by law as a defining moment in human development. Once\nquickening occurred, women recognized a moral obligation to carry the fetus to\nterm. This age-old idea underpinned the practice of abortion in America. The\nlegal acceptance of induced miscarriages before quickening tacitly assumed that\nwomen had a basic right to bodily integrity. By the mid-eighteenth century, the most common means of inducing\nabortion -- by\ntaking drugs was commercialized. The availability of abortifacients was so\nwell-known that a common euphemism described their use. When Sarah Grosvenor, a\nConnecticut farm girl, confided to her sister in 1742 that she was \"taking the\ntrade,\" her sister understood. That Grosvenor successfully conveyed her meaning\nto her sister in three metaphoric words tells us a great deal about the world\nof mid-eighteenth-century New England. Many New Englanders, including these\nsisters, knew of the possibility of inducing an abortion by purchasing and\ningesting drugs. The need for a euphemism tells of the difficulty of speaking\nopenly about sex and reproductive control and of the need for secrecy. Yet it\nreveals an awareness that women could and did regulate their own fertility\nthrough abortion. Furthermore, abortifacients had become a profitable product\nsold by doctors, apothecaries, and other healers. The first statutes governing abortion in the United States, James Mohr has\nfound, were poison control measures designed to protect pregnant women like\nGrosvenor by controlling the sale of abortifacient drugs, which often killed\nthe women who took them. The proliferation of entrepreneurs who openly sold and\nadvertised abortifacients may have inspired this early legislation, passed in\nthe 1820s and 1830s. The 18 Illinois law, which prohibited the provision of\nabortifacients, was listed under \"poisoning.\" It is crucial to recognize what these early-nineteenth-century laws did not\ncover: they did not punish women for inducing abortions, and they did not\neliminate the concept of quickening. Even as poison control measures, they said\nnothing about growing the plants needed in one's own garden or mixing together\none's own home remedy in order to induce an abortion. The legal silence on\ndomestic practices suggests that the new laws were aimed at the\ncommercialization of this practice and, implicitly, retained to women the right\nto make their own decisions about their pregnancies before quickening. By the 1840s, the abortion business boomed. Despite the laws forbidding the\nsale of abortifacients, they were advertised in the popular press and could be\npurchased from physicians or pharmacists or through the mail. If drugs failed,\nwomen could go to a practitioner who specialized in performing instrumental\nabortions. Advertisements and newspaper exposes made it appear that what had\nbeen an occasional domestic practice had become a daily occurrence performed\nfor profit in northern cities. Madame Restell, for example, openly advertised\nand provided abortion services for thirty-five years. Restell began her\nabortion business in New York City in the late 1830s; by the mid-1840s, she had\noffices in Boston and Philadelphia and traveling agents who sold her \"Female\nMonthly Pills.\" Restell became the most infamous abortionist in the country,\nbut she was not the only abortionist. The clientele of these busy clinics were\nprimarily married, white, native-born Protestant women of the upper and middle\nclasses. In 1857, the newly organized AMA initiated a crusade to make abortion at every\nstage of pregnancy illegal. The antiabortion campaign grew in part, James Mohr\nhas shown, out of regular physicians' desire to win professional power, control\nmedical practice, and restrict their competitors, particularly Homeopaths and\nmidwives. \"Regular,\" or \"orthodox,\" physicians, practitioners of \"heroic\"\nmedicine, had come under attack in the 1820s and 1830s as elitist. They faced\ncompetition from a variety of practitioners from other medical sects,\ncollectively known as \"Irregulars.\" Through the 1870S, regular physicians\nacross the country worked for the passage of new criminal abortion laws. In\nsecuring criminal abortion laws, the Regulars won recognition of their\nparticular views as well as some state control over the practice of\nmedicine. Though professional issues underlay the medical campaign, gender, racial, and\nclass anxieties pushed the criminalization of abortion forward. The visible use\nof abortion by middle-class married women, in conjunction with other challenges\nto gender norms and changes in the social makeup of the nation, generated\nanxieties among American men of the same class. Birth rates among the Yankee\nclasses had declined by mid-century while immigrants poured into the country.\nAntiabortion activists pointed out that immigrant families, many of them\nCatholic, were larger and would soon outpopulate native-born white Yankees and\nthreaten their political power. Dr. Horatio R Storer, the leader of the medical\ncampaign against abortion, envisioned the spread of \"civilization\" west and\nsouth by native-born white Americans, not Mexicans, Chinese, Blacks, Indians,\nor Catholics. \"Shall\" these regions, he asked, \"be filled by our own children\nor by those of aliens? This is a question our women must answer; upon their\nloins depends the future destiny of the nation.\" Hostility to immigrants,\nCatholics, and people of color fueled this campaign to criminalize abortion.\nWhite male patriotism demanded that maternity be enforced among white\nProtestant women. The antiabortion campaign was antifeminist at its core. Women were condemned\nfor following \"fashion\" and for avoiding the self-sacrifice expected of\nmothers. \"The true wife,\" Storer declared, did not seek `'undue power in public\nlife, . . . undue control in domestic affairs, . . . [or] privileges not her\nown.\" The antiabortion campaign was a reactionary response to two important\nefforts of the nineteenth-century women's movements: the fight to admit women\ninto the regular medical profession and the battle to make men conform to a\nsingle standard of sexual behavior. The antiabortion campaign coincided with\nthe fight by male Regulars to keep women out of their medical schools,\nsocieties, and hospitals. Boston and Harvard University, Storer's hometown and\nalma mater, were key sites of struggle over women's place in medicine, and\nStorer was personally engaged in the battle against female physicians.\nAdvocates of women in medicine argued that women doctors would protect women\npatients from sexual violation. Regular male doctors degraded female physicians\nby accusing them, along with midwives, of performing abortions. The relative morality of men and women was of crucial importance to this\ncampaign. For the specialists, whose interest in the female reproductive system\nraised questions about their sexual morality, the antiabortion campaign was a\nway to proclaim their own high morality in contrast to their competitors, their\nfemale patients, and even the ministers who tolerated abortion. It was at the\nsame time a backlash against the women's movement's critique of male sexual\nbehavior and feminist claims to political power. Nineteenth-century feminists\nexpressed their anger with male sexual domination and promiscuity in a number\nof movements, including the campaigns against prostitution and slavery and the\nfight for temperance. All sections of the women's movement advocated \"voluntary\nmotherhood,\" a slogan that addressed both men's sexual violation of their wives\nand women's desire to control childbearing. Women saw themselves as morally\nsuperior and urged men to adopt a single standard  --  the female\nstandard of\nchastity until marriage, followed by monogamy and moderation. The campaign\nagainst abortion challenged this feminist analysis of men by condemning women\nfor having abortions. Indeed, Storer compared abortion to prostitution and, in\nso doing, called into question all claims made by middle-class\nnineteenth-century women on the basis of moral superiority. \"There is little\ndifference,\" he proclaimed, \"between the immorality\" of the man who visited\nprostitutes and the woman who aborted. The nineteenth-century women's movements\nnever defended abortion, but activist women and women doctors were blamed for\nthe practice of abortion nonetheless. The antiabortion campaign attempted to destroy the idea of quickening. As\nphysicians targeted quickening, they discredited women's experiences of\npregnancy and claimed pregnancy as medical terrain. \"Quickening,\" as Storer\ndescribed it, \"is in fact but a sensation.\" A sensation that had emotional,\nsocial, and legal meaning was thus denigrated. Quickening was based on women's\nown bodily sensations -- not on medical diagnosis. It made physicians, and\nobstetricians in particular, dependent on female self-diagnosis and judgment.\nQuickening could not be relied upon as an indicator of fetal life because,\nStorer argued, it did not occur at a standard moment. \"Many women never quicken\nat all,\" he joked about women's perceptions, \"though their children are born\nliving.\" Storer's propaganda aimed to erase the distinctions between earlier\nand later stages of pregnancy, thereby redefining the restoration of the\nmenses. What had previously been understood as a blockage and a restoration of\nthe menses prior to quickening was now associated with inducing a miscarriage\nafter quickening by labeling it abortion. Furthermore, Storer equated abortion\nwith infanticide. Regular medical men had entered the debate about sexual politics by attacking\nthe female practice of abortion as immoral, unwomanly, and unpatriotic. In\ngiving abortion new meaning, the Regulars provided a weapon that white,\nnative-born, male legislators could use against the women of their own class\nwho had been agitating for personal and political reform. Regular physicians\nwon passage of new criminal abortion laws because their campaign appealed to a\nset of fears of white, nativeborn, male elites about losing political power to\nCatholic immigrants and to women. Class privilege did not protect middle-class\nwhite women from public policy designed to control them. Although the\ncriminalization of abortion was aimed at middle-class white women, it affected\nwomen of every class and race. The new laws passed across the country between\n1860 and 1880 regarded abortion in an entirely different light from common law\nand the statutes regulating abortifacients. In general, the laws included two\ninnovations: they eliminated the common-law idea of quickening and prohibited\nabortion at any point in pregnancy. Some included punishment for the women who\nhad abortions. The \"Comstock Law\" passed in 1873 included abortion and birth\ncontrol in federal antiobscenity legislation; states and municipalities passed\nsimilar ordinances. The antiabortion laws made one exception: physicians could perform therapeutic\nabortions if pregnancy and childbirth threatened the woman's life. A bill\ncriminalizing abortion unless done for \" bona fide medical or surgical\npurposes\" passed the Illinois state legislature unanimously and was signed into\nlaw in 1867. A few years later, Illinois passed another law prohibiting the\nsale of abortifacients but made an exception for \"the written prescription of\nsome well known and respectable practicing physician.\" Physicians had won the\ncriminalization of abortion and retained to themselves alone the right to\ninduce abortions when they determined it necessary. Through the antiabortion campaign, doctors claimed scientific authority to\ndefine life and death. In so doing, they claimed the authority of religious\nleaders. In leading this moral crusade and thoroughly criticizing the\nministry's lack of interest in abortion, regular doctors set themselves above\nreligious leaders as well as above the general populace. The medical\nprofession's claim to moral purity and the authority of the clergy was a\nstepping-stone to greater social authority. Regular physicians won an important\nvictory when they persuaded the nation's states to criminalize abortion.\nPhysicians entered a new partnership with the state and won the power to set\nreproductive policy. In the process, women's perceptions of pregnancy were\ndelegitimated and women lost what had been a common-law right. Periodization: Changing Patterns of Illegal Abortion During the more than one hundred years that abortion was illegal in the United\nStates, the patterns; practice, policing, and politics of abortion all changed\nover time, though not always simultaneously. I trace the history along several\nlines at once, according to the location, practice, and availability of\nabortion as well as its regulation. Abortion was widely available throughout\nmuch of the era when abortion was a crime. Yet periods of tolerance were\npunctuated by moments of severe repression. At some points the changing\nstructure of medicine brought about crucial changes in the history of abortion;\nat others, changes in women's lives or the political and economic context came\nto the fore. In the nineteenth century, abortion came under attack at a moment when women\nwere claiming political power; in the twentieth century, it came under attack\nwhen they claimed sexual freedom. Abortion, like contraception, means that\nwomen can separate sex and procreation -- still a controversial notion.\nAntiabortion campaigns developed when women asserted sexual independence, as\nduring the Progressive Era and since the 1970s. When abortion was most firmly\nlinked to the needs of family rather than the freedoms of women, as during the\nDepression, it was most ignored by those who would suppress it. Periods of\nantiabortion activity mark moments of hostility to female independence. The epoch of illegal abortion may be broken down into four periods. The first\ncovers the time from the criminalization of abortion state-by-state,\naccomplished nationwide by 1880, to 1930. This period, covering fifty years, is\nheavily marked by continuity. As other historians have also found, the\nreproductive lives of most women and the day-to-day practice of most physicians\nchanged slowly. In this period, abortion was widely accepted and was practiced\nin women's homes and in the offices of physicians and midwives. The diversity\nof practitioners, the privacy of medical practice, and the autonomy of\nphysicians in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries made the\nwidespread medical practice of abortion possible. A crackdown on abortion\noccurred between 1890 and 1920 as specialists in obstetrics renewed the earlier\ncampaign against abortion, and the medical profession was drawn into the\nstate's enforcement system. The structural transformation that occurred during the 1930s, the second\nperiod, was crucial for the history of abortion. Abortion became more available\nand changed location. As the practice moved from private offices and homes to\nhospitals and clinics, abortion was consolidated in medical hands and became\nmore visible. The changes wrought by the Depression accelerated the pace of\nchange in the coming decades, particularly in the methods of enforcing the\ncriminal abortion laws. The third period was marked by increasing restrictions on abortion by state\nand medical authorities and intensifying demand for abortion from women of all\ngroups. This period begins in 1940, when the new methods of controlling\nabortion were first instituted, and continues through 1973, when they were\ndismantled. In reaction to the growing practice of abortion as well as apparent\nchanges in female gender and reproductive patterns, a backlash against abortion\ndeveloped. 1940 marks a dividing line as hospitals instituted new policies, and\npolice and prosecutors changed their tactics. The repression of abortion was\npart of the repression of political and personal deviance that took place in\nthe 1940s and 1950s. Yet even in this period, the practice of abortion expanded\nin new directions in response to relentless demand. The new repression of\nabortion, however, was devastating for women. A dual system of abortion,\ndivided by race and class, developed. During the postwar period, the\ncriminalization of abortion produced its harshest results. A new stage in the history of abortion, the movement to legalize it, overlaps\nwith the third period. The movement to decriminalize abortion began in the\nmid-1950s and arose out of the difficult experiences resulting from the\nrepression of abortion in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1950s, a handful of\nphysicians began to challenge the very abortion laws their profession had\nadvocated a century earlier. The progress of that challenge attests to the\ncontinuing power of the medical profession to make public policy regarding\nreproduction. As legal reform moved forward, a new feminist movement arose,\nwhich radically transformed the movement for legal change. When the women's\nmovement described abortion as an aspect of sexual freedom, they articulated a\nnew feminist meaning for abortion; when they demanded abortion as a right, they\nechoed generations of women. The structure of this book follows this periodization. The first half of the\nbook uncovers the history of abortion from the late nineteenth century through\nthe 1920s. Chapters 1 through 4 each cover different aspects of abortion, from\nwomen's lives to practice to politics to enforcement, during the first\nhalf-century of illegal abortion. The changes of the 1930S, both medical and\nsocial, precipitated other changes. The second half of the book traces the\nhistory of abortion in chronologically ordered chapters concluding with the\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions that ended the era of illegal abortion. Women's history of abortion needs to be examined both as a commonly felt need\nto control reproduction, arising from women's biological capacity to bear\nchildren and social relations that assign childbearing to women, and in terms\nof differences among women. This book differentiates among women by class, race\nand ethnic identity, and marital status. Though class did not absolutely\ndetermine access to or safety of abortion, class position helped define when a\nwoman felt she needed an abortion and affected the type available to her. In\ngeneral, urban women had greater access to abortion than rural women, though\nsome rural women located abortionists in their areas or traveled to cities for\nabortions. Race played a less obvious role in access to abortion, though the\ngrim statistics of the postwar period show the connection between\ndiscrimination and death. I have made a specific effort to locate sources\nrelated to African Americans in order to learn more about black women's use of\nabortion and how race shaped the history of abortion. Evidence concerning women\nof color is meager, however, until the 1930s, when medical and sociological\nstudies began separating their findings by race. Before then, contemporary\nobservers tended to focus their attention on the differences among many (white)\nforeign-born ethnic groups. This book integrates a national analysis of the history of abortion with a\nlocal study. The advantage of this approach is that it connects everyday life\nand local medical and legal practice to national policy. It examines that\nrelationship rather than assuming that all the public policy action takes place\non the federal level without reference to local and \"private\" events. I select\na major metropolis in order to uncover the nature of both abortion practices\nand police enforcement of the criminal abortion laws. Chicago, the second\nlargest city in the nation, is the focus of my local study. Chicago, the city\nin \"the heartland\" that has of ten served as a metaphor for the spirit of\nAmerica, was also known as an important medical center (the home of the AMA)\nand as a regional center for abortion. Trains brought European immigrants, men\nand women migrating from farms to the city, African Americans moving from the\nSouth to the North, all going to live and work in Chicago. The same trains\nbrought women looking for abortions. Directing my attention to one city enabled\nme to uncover the nitty-gritty details of the practice and regulation of\nabortion. Though much of my analysis of the history of abortion draws on Chicago as a\ncase study, sources verify that my findings hold true for other cities, large\nand small. Throughout I present national data and trends as well as regional\nones and take note of patterns elsewhere. The book moves back and forth from a\nnational overview of abortion practices and politics to a close look at events\nin Chicago. As medical practice became more standardized in hospitals, the\nstory becomes a more national one and key events take place in other cities:\nNew York, Detroit, Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington, D.C.,\nand elsewhere. This is primarily a study of abortion in urban areas, where\nabortion was concentrated. I comment occasionally on practices in rural areas,\nbut the history of reproductive control and abortion is likely to be somewhat\ndifferent there. Legal records, most notably lower-level court and criminal trial records, and\nmedical literature make up the foundation of my research. I have also surveyed\nother government documents, newspapers, popular periodicals, hospital records,\nand manuscript collections. Using these materials, I have delineated how\nmedical thinking and state regulation have changed over time. Yet this is more\nthan a study of prescriptive literature or policy. I have uncovered the\ncircumstances of hundreds of actual induced abortions and reconstructed\nchanging abortion practices. This study periodizes the history of abortion for\nthe first time. This book presents the lives of many women and their abortions in rich detail\nin order to convey the variety and intricacy of the situations that made\nabortion necessary for women. It is in the minutiae of women's lives that we\ncan discover why women had abortions and how they won sympathy from physicians\nwho belonged to a profession dedicated to fighting abortion. Abortion was a\nmoment in a woman's reproductive life. It cannot be separated from sexual\nrelations or reproduction as a whole. Women themselves did not separate them,\nnor should we, whether analyzing abortion in the past or present. This book\ndeepens our understanding of the female experience of reproduction and the\nconnections between sexuality, contraception, pregnancy, and childbirth. At its\nmost fundamental, a policy that restricts abortion is one that forces women\ninto maternity. Without contraceptives and abortion, most women in heterosexual\nrelationships will become pregnant and bear children, whether they want to or\nnot. When women sought abortions, they often revealed the texture of\nheterosexual relations and the rest of their lives. Many situations made\nenduring pregnancy unbearable to women. In using abortion, women rebelled\nagainst the law and asserted their sense that the decision to carry a pregnancy\nto term or to abort was theirs to make. A few expressed in words as well as in\naction the view that abortion was their right. The experiences of women's\nprivate lives and private practices over the course of one hundred years\naltered medical thinking and reshaped public policy. Despite the fact that\nwomen's abortion narratives are part of our own contemporary discourse, the\nstories told here have long been hidden.

The antiabortion stance\nof organized medicine should not be mistaken for an accurate representation of\nthe views and practices of the entire profession. This study views the medical\nprofession as complex and composed of competing groups with opposing views and\npractices rather than as a unified whole. The medical profession was not\nmonolithic, but divided in its attitude toward abortion and in its treatment of\npatients. This book differentiates between organized medicine and individual\nphysicians. By \"organized medicine,\" I mean medicine's institutional\nstructures, such as the American Medical Association (AMA) and other medical\nsocieties, medical schools, and hospitals that produced the official, public\nimage of the profession and acted in concert with the state. Furthermore, this\nstudy distinguishes between prescriptive commentary about medical practices, as\nfound in the medical literature, and actual practice by physicians. These\nofficial and instructional materials reveal the thought, and perhaps the\npractice, of only a few. Finally, attention to specialization is crucial.\nSpecialists played critical public roles in the history of abortion, their\ninterests and those of general practitioners were not identical. This book is the first to chart the nation's enforcement of the criminal\nabortion laws. To understand the power of law in the lives of the masses of\nAmericans requires that one take seriously the experiences of ordinary people\ncaught in criminal investigations. Thus it is necessary to analyze the\nprocesses and routine procedures of the legal system that shape those\nexperiences. Most historians of crime and punishment have focused on police and\nprisons, while historians of women and the law have focused mainly on marriage\nand property rights, not crime. Surprisingly little historical work has\nexamined the relationship between medicine and law. Few have studied law in\npractice. Analysis of the day-to-day workings of the legal system, rather than\nstatutory changes, judicial rulings, or the volume of cases, reveals how the\nlaw intervened in the lives of ordinary citizens to regulate reproductive and\nsexual behavior.\" Punishment for violation of the law and sexual norms has been gendered. In\nabortion cases, the investigative procedures themselves constituted a form of\npunishment and control for women. Publicity and public exposure of women's\ntransgressions further served as punishment. This form of punishment served, in\nMichel Foucault's words, as \"a school.\" The shame of public exposure was for\nall of \"the potentially guilty,\" not only the individual who had been caught.\nThis eighteenth-century mode of punishment, thought to have been replaced by\nthe surveillance of the prison, persisted in the state's response to women and\ntheir sexual crimes. Without analyzing gender, we cannot fully understand the\nsystems of punishment. Even as the abortion statutes remained the same through this period, the\nmeaning of the law and the legality and illegality of abortion changed over\ntime. Law is not fixed, but fluid. The criminal abortion laws passed in every\nstate by T880 made exceptions for therapeutic abortions performed in order to\nsave a woman's life. Because the laws governing abortion did not precisely\ndefine what was criminal and what was not, this had to be worked out in\npractice, in policing, and in the courts. The complexity of defining \"legal\"\nand \"illegal\" abortions for medical practitioners and legal authorities alike,\nthe gray and ever-shifting nature of \"criminality,\" is an important theme in\nthis book. Nor was medical understanding of therapeutic abortion stable.\nMedicine too is interpretive and changing. Throughout the period of illegal\nabortion, physicians disagreed on the conditions that mandated a therapeutic\nabortion and on the methods: there was no consensus. Changes in medicine\ninfluenced legal definitions of crime; at the same time, the law shaped medical\nthinking and practice. The medical profession and the legal profession each\nlooked to the other to define the legality of abortion practices. Therapeutic\nabortion became increasingly important in the 1930s; by the 1960s the practice\n(and nonpractice) of therapeutic abortion was at the very heart of the campaign\nto reform and repeal the criminal abortion laws. The illegality of abortion has hidden the existence of an unarticulated,\nalternative, popular morality, which supported women who had abortions. This\npopular ethic contradicted the law, the official attitude of the medical\nprofession, and the teachings of some religions. Private discussions among\nfamily and friends, conversations between women and doctors, and the behavior\nof women (and the people who aided them) suggest that traditional ideas that\naccepted early abortions endured into the twentieth century. Furthermore,\nthrough the 1920s at least, working-class women did not make a distinction\nbetween contraceptives and abortion. What I call a popular morality that\naccepted abortion was almost never publicly expressed but was rooted in\npeople's daily lives. Americans have a long history of accepting abortion in\ncertain situations as a necessity and as a decision that, implicitly, belongs\nto women to make. This popular attitude made itself felt in the courts and in\ndoctors' offices: prosecutors found it difficult to convict abortionists\nbecause juries regularly nullified the law by acquitting abortionists,  and few\nphysicians escaped the pressure from women for abortions. Throughout the period\nof illegal abortion, women asserted their need for abortion and, in doing so,\nimplicitly asserted their sense of having a right to control their own\nreproduction. I am not suggesting a \"gap\" between people's beliefs and their ability to live\nup to them, but different, even oppositional, moral perspectives. The values\nexpressed by ordinary people deserve to be taken seriously rather than\ncategorized and dismissed as sinful or mistaken. Though some felt guilt about\nabortion and found ways to justify their behavior, others never held the\nofficial antiabortion views. Prescribed morality and popular morality may not\nbe identical. Analysis of women's practices and ideas -- popular\nbehavior and\nbelief -- rather than exclusive focus on the statements of male\ntheologians and\nphilosophers suggests that it is incorrect to conclude that hostility to\nabortion is \"almost an absolute value in history.\" The reverse may be more\naccurate. Although this book takes note of religious teachings and the religious\nbackground of women who had abortions, it does not focus on religious opinion.\nOrganized religion had little interest in abortion until it entered the public,\npolitical arena in the late 1950s and early 1960s. There was no reason to\nenergetically fight abortion when, for nearly a century, abortion was a crime\nand no social movement suggested otherwise. From the 1920s on, however, there\nwas much religious interest in, and division over, another method of\nreproductive control: contraception. Birth control became a topic of interest\nbecause a movement advocated women's right to reproductive control. Further, it\nis incorrect to assume that the Catholic Church has always organized against\nabortion or that all Catholics subscribe to the views of their church leaders.\nIndeed, many Catholics shared what I have described as a popular ethic\naccepting abortion. A good history of religion and reproductive control would\nexamine not only theology and sermons, but also the attitudes and actions of\nthe congregations, with particular attention to women. Women who had abortions did so within a context of illegality and religious\ndisapproval, but the prohibitions were ambiguous. Christian traditions had\ntabooed abortion since antiquity, but the acceptance of abortion in order to\nsave the life of a pregnant woman had a long tradition as well. Until the\nmid-nineteenth century, the Catholic Church implicitly accepted early abortions\nprior to ensoulment. Not until T869, at about the same time that abortion\nbecame politicized in this country, did the church condemn abortion; in 1895,\nit condemned therapeutic abortion. Protestant churches accepted abortion when\npregnancy threatened a woman's life, a view shared by the medical profession\nand written into the nation's laws. Jewish tradition clearly viewed the woman's\nlife as primary. The Mishnah, a code of ancient Jewish law that guided later\nrabbinic thought, required abortion when childbirth threatened a woman's life,\nfor \"her life takes precedence over its life.\" This study points to the importance of studying the social history of\nsexuality as well as the medical and legal discourse about it. These discourses\nregarding abortion are important because they introduced new meanings of\nabortion and shaped people's views (and fears) of abortion and sexuality. I\nanalyze the language women used to describe abortion and the production of\nstories about abortion in the press and in the courtroom. Yet exclusive\nattention to professional or even popular discourse about abortion would result\nin a distorted picture of that history. Medical discourse has convinced some\nscholars that physicians did not perform abortions in the period of illegal\nabortion, and most press coverage of abortion in the early twentieth century\ngives the misleading impression that abortion was universally condemned and\ngenerally fatal. These conclusions are not correct. Analysis of discourse alone\nwould miss the ongoing medical practice of abortion in total contradiction of\nofficial medical mores. As others have pointed out, Foucault's theory\nconcerning the production of sexuality through discourse ignores differences in\nthe power of individuals and social groups to enter and shape discourse. The\npublicly articulated and published discussion of abortion rarely included the\nvoices or perspectives of women who had abortions, except to provide shocking\nexamples of depraved womanhood. Women who had abortions did not intervene to\nexplain themselves, but instead, in other nonpublic arenas, made their\nperspectives known and acted to obtain a much-needed method for preventing\nbirths. More tolerant attitudes toward abortion, rooted in material\nexperiences, persisted in the face of a public discourse that denounced it. The\nhistory of sexuality and reproduction demands a combined analysis of ideas and\npractice. Common Law and the Criminalization of Abortion Abortion was not always a crime. During the eighteenth and early nineteenth\ncenturies, abortion of early pregnancy was legal under common law. Abortions\nwere illegal only after \"quickening,\" the point at which a pregnant woman could\nfeel the movements of the fetus (approximately the fourth month of pregnancy).\nThe common law's attitude toward pregnancy and abortion was based on an\nunderstanding of pregnancy and human development as a process rather than an\nabsolute moment. Indeed, the term abortion referred only to the miscarriages of\nlater pregnancies, after quickening. What we would now identify as an early\ninduced abortion was not called an abortion at all. If an early pregnancy\nended, it had \"slipp[ed] away,\" or the menses had been \"restored.\" At\nconception and the earliest stage of pregnancy before quickening, no one\nbelieved that a human life existed; not even the Catholic Church took this\nview. Rather, the popular ethic regarding abortion and common law were grounded\nin the female experience of their own bodies. Colonial and early-nineteenth-century women, historians have learned,\nperceived conception as the \"blocking\" or \"obstructing\" of menstruation, which\nrequired attention. The cessation of the menses indicated a worrisome imbalance\nin the body and the need to bring the body back into balance by restoring the\nflow. This idea of menstruation corresponded with medical and popular\nunderstanding of sickness and health. The body was a delicate system of\nequilibrium that could easily be thrown out of balance -- by a change\nin weather\nor diet, for example -- and that then needed to be restored through active\nintervention. A disruption in the healthy body, in the worldview of patients\nand physicians, required a visible, often violent, physical response to\ntreatment in order to restore equilibrium. This theory underlay eighteenth and\nnineteenth-century regular medical practice, which emphasized heroic\nmeasures -- bleeding, blistering, purging, and puking -- in\nresponse to sickness.\nThe response to the blocking of the menses was part of this shared\nunderstanding of the body: women took drugs in order to make their menses\nregular and regarded the ensuing vomiting and evacuation as evidence of the\ndrugs' effective action. Restoring the menses was a domestic practice. The power of certain herbs to\nrestore menstruation was widely known. One colonial woman who feared pregnancy\nhad \"twice taken Savin; once boyled in milk and the other time strayned through\na Cloath.\" Savin, derived from juniper bushes, was the most popular\nabortifacient and easily acquired since junipers grew wild throughout the\ncountry. Other herbs used as abortifacients included pennyroyal, tansy, ergot,\nand seneca snakeroot. Slave women used cottonroot. Many of these useful plants\ncould be found in the woods or cultivated. in gardens, and women could refer to\nhome medical guides for recipes for \"bringing on the menses.\" Both of these concepts, blocked menses and quickening, must be taken seriously\nby late-twentieth-century observers. Blocked menses cannot be dismissed as an\nexcuse made by women who knew they were pregnant. Quickening was a moment\nrecognized by women and by law as a defining moment in human development. Once\nquickening occurred, women recognized a moral obligation to carry the fetus to\nterm. This age-old idea underpinned the practice of abortion in America. The\nlegal acceptance of induced miscarriages before quickening tacitly assumed that\nwomen had a basic right to bodily integrity. By the mid-eighteenth century, the most common means of inducing\nabortion -- by\ntaking drugs was commercialized. The availability of abortifacients was so\nwell-known that a common euphemism described their use. When Sarah Grosvenor, a\nConnecticut farm girl, confided to her sister in 1742 that she was \"taking the\ntrade,\" her sister understood. That Grosvenor successfully conveyed her meaning\nto her sister in three metaphoric words tells us a great deal about the world\nof mid-eighteenth-century New England. Many New Englanders, including these\nsisters, knew of the possibility of inducing an abortion by purchasing and\ningesting drugs. The need for a euphemism tells of the difficulty of speaking\nopenly about sex and reproductive control and of the need for secrecy. Yet it\nreveals an awareness that women could and did regulate their own fertility\nthrough abortion. Furthermore, abortifacients had become a profitable product\nsold by doctors, apothecaries, and other healers. The first statutes governing abortion in the United States, James Mohr has\nfound, were poison control measures designed to protect pregnant women like\nGrosvenor by controlling the sale of abortifacient drugs, which often killed\nthe women who took them. The proliferation of entrepreneurs who openly sold and\nadvertised abortifacients may have inspired this early legislation, passed in\nthe 1820s and 1830s. The 18 Illinois law, which prohibited the provision of\nabortifacients, was listed under \"poisoning.\" It is crucial to recognize what these early-nineteenth-century laws did not\ncover: they did not punish women for inducing abortions, and they did not\neliminate the concept of quickening. Even as poison control measures, they said\nnothing about growing the plants needed in one's own garden or mixing together\none's own home remedy in order to induce an abortion. The legal silence on\ndomestic practices suggests that the new laws were aimed at the\ncommercialization of this practice and, implicitly, retained to women the right\nto make their own decisions about their pregnancies before quickening. By the 1840s, the abortion business boomed. Despite the laws forbidding the\nsale of abortifacients, they were advertised in the popular press and could be\npurchased from physicians or pharmacists or through the mail. If drugs failed,\nwomen could go to a practitioner who specialized in performing instrumental\nabortions. Advertisements and newspaper exposes made it appear that what had\nbeen an occasional domestic practice had become a daily occurrence performed\nfor profit in northern cities. Madame Restell, for example, openly advertised\nand provided abortion services for thirty-five years. Restell began her\nabortion business in New York City in the late 1830s; by the mid-1840s, she had\noffices in Boston and Philadelphia and traveling agents who sold her \"Female\nMonthly Pills.\" Restell became the most infamous abortionist in the country,\nbut she was not the only abortionist. The clientele of these busy clinics were\nprimarily married, white, native-born Protestant women of the upper and middle\nclasses. In 1857, the newly organized AMA initiated a crusade to make abortion at every\nstage of pregnancy illegal. The antiabortion campaign grew in part, James Mohr\nhas shown, out of regular physicians' desire to win professional power, control\nmedical practice, and restrict their competitors, particularly Homeopaths and\nmidwives. \"Regular,\" or \"orthodox,\" physicians, practitioners of \"heroic\"\nmedicine, had come under attack in the 1820s and 1830s as elitist. They faced\ncompetition from a variety of practitioners from other medical sects,\ncollectively known as \"Irregulars.\" Through the 1870S, regular physicians\nacross the country worked for the passage of new criminal abortion laws. In\nsecuring criminal abortion laws, the Regulars won recognition of their\nparticular views as well as some state control over the practice of\nmedicine. Though professional issues underlay the medical campaign, gender, racial, and\nclass anxieties pushed the criminalization of abortion forward. The visible use\nof abortion by middle-class married women, in conjunction with other challenges\nto gender norms and changes in the social makeup of the nation, generated\nanxieties among American men of the same class. Birth rates among the Yankee\nclasses had declined by mid-century while immigrants poured into the country.\nAntiabortion activists pointed out that immigrant families, many of them\nCatholic, were larger and would soon outpopulate native-born white Yankees and\nthreaten their political power. Dr. Horatio R Storer, the leader of the medical\ncampaign against abortion, envisioned the spread of \"civilization\" west and\nsouth by native-born white Americans, not Mexicans, Chinese, Blacks, Indians,\nor Catholics. \"Shall\" these regions, he asked, \"be filled by our own children\nor by those of aliens? This is a question our women must answer; upon their\nloins depends the future destiny of the nation.\" Hostility to immigrants,\nCatholics, and people of color fueled this campaign to criminalize abortion.\nWhite male patriotism demanded that maternity be enforced among white\nProtestant women. The antiabortion campaign was antifeminist at its core. Women were condemned\nfor following \"fashion\" and for avoiding the self-sacrifice expected of\nmothers. \"The true wife,\" Storer declared, did not seek `'undue power in public\nlife, . . . undue control in domestic affairs, . . . [or] privileges not her\nown.\" The antiabortion campaign was a reactionary response to two important\nefforts of the nineteenth-century women's movements: the fight to admit women\ninto the regular medical profession and the battle to make men conform to a\nsingle standard of sexual behavior. The antiabortion campaign coincided with\nthe fight by male Regulars to keep women out of their medical schools,\nsocieties, and hospitals. Boston and Harvard University, Storer's hometown and\nalma mater, were key sites of struggle over women's place in medicine, and\nStorer was personally engaged in the battle against female physicians.\nAdvocates of women in medicine argued that women doctors would protect women\npatients from sexual violation. Regular male doctors degraded female physicians\nby accusing them, along with midwives, of performing abortions. The relative morality of men and women was of crucial importance to this\ncampaign. For the specialists, whose interest in the female reproductive system\nraised questions about their sexual morality, the antiabortion campaign was a\nway to proclaim their own high morality in contrast to their competitors, their\nfemale patients, and even the ministers who tolerated abortion. It was at the\nsame time a backlash against the women's movement's critique of male sexual\nbehavior and feminist claims to political power. Nineteenth-century feminists\nexpressed their anger with male sexual domination and promiscuity in a number\nof movements, including the campaigns against prostitution and slavery and the\nfight for temperance. All sections of the women's movement advocated \"voluntary\nmotherhood,\" a slogan that addressed both men's sexual violation of their wives\nand women's desire to control childbearing. Women saw themselves as morally\nsuperior and urged men to adopt a single standard  --  the female\nstandard of\nchastity until marriage, followed by monogamy and moderation. The campaign\nagainst abortion challenged this feminist analysis of men by condemning women\nfor having abortions. Indeed, Storer compared abortion to prostitution and, in\nso doing, called into question all claims made by middle-class\nnineteenth-century women on the basis of moral superiority. \"There is little\ndifference,\" he proclaimed, \"between the immorality\" of the man who visited\nprostitutes and the woman who aborted. The nineteenth-century women's movements\nnever defended abortion, but activist women and women doctors were blamed for\nthe practice of abortion nonetheless. The antiabortion campaign attempted to destroy the idea of quickening. As\nphysicians targeted quickening, they discredited women's experiences of\npregnancy and claimed pregnancy as medical terrain. \"Quickening,\" as Storer\ndescribed it, \"is in fact but a sensation.\" A sensation that had emotional,\nsocial, and legal meaning was thus denigrated. Quickening was based on women's\nown bodily sensations -- not on medical diagnosis. It made physicians, and\nobstetricians in particular, dependent on female self-diagnosis and judgment.\nQuickening could not be relied upon as an indicator of fetal life because,\nStorer argued, it did not occur at a standard moment. \"Many women never quicken\nat all,\" he joked about women's perceptions, \"though their children are born\nliving.\" Storer's propaganda aimed to erase the distinctions between earlier\nand later stages of pregnancy, thereby redefining the restoration of the\nmenses. What had previously been understood as a blockage and a restoration of\nthe menses prior to quickening was now associated with inducing a miscarriage\nafter quickening by labeling it abortion. Furthermore, Storer equated abortion\nwith infanticide. Regular medical men had entered the debate about sexual politics by attacking\nthe female practice of abortion as immoral, unwomanly, and unpatriotic. In\ngiving abortion new meaning, the Regulars provided a weapon that white,\nnative-born, male legislators could use against the women of their own class\nwho had been agitating for personal and political reform. Regular physicians\nwon passage of new criminal abortion laws because their campaign appealed to a\nset of fears of white, nativeborn, male elites about losing political power to\nCatholic immigrants and to women. Class privilege did not protect middle-class\nwhite women from public policy designed to control them. Although the\ncriminalization of abortion was aimed at middle-class white women, it affected\nwomen of every class and race. The new laws passed across the country between\n1860 and 1880 regarded abortion in an entirely different light from common law\nand the statutes regulating abortifacients. In general, the laws included two\ninnovations: they eliminated the common-law idea of quickening and prohibited\nabortion at any point in pregnancy. Some included punishment for the women who\nhad abortions. The \"Comstock Law\" passed in 1873 included abortion and birth\ncontrol in federal antiobscenity legislation; states and municipalities passed\nsimilar ordinances. The antiabortion laws made one exception: physicians could perform therapeutic\nabortions if pregnancy and childbirth threatened the woman's life. A bill\ncriminalizing abortion unless done for \" bona fide medical or surgical\npurposes\" passed the Illinois state legislature unanimously and was signed into\nlaw in 1867. A few years later, Illinois passed another law prohibiting the\nsale of abortifacients but made an exception for \"the written prescription of\nsome well known and respectable practicing physician.\" Physicians had won the\ncriminalization of abortion and retained to themselves alone the right to\ninduce abortions when they determined it necessary. Through the antiabortion campaign, doctors claimed scientific authority to\ndefine life and death. In so doing, they claimed the authority of religious\nleaders. In leading this moral crusade and thoroughly criticizing the\nministry's lack of interest in abortion, regular doctors set themselves above\nreligious leaders as well as above the general populace. The medical\nprofession's claim to moral purity and the authority of the clergy was a\nstepping-stone to greater social authority. Regular physicians won an important\nvictory when they persuaded the nation's states to criminalize abortion.\nPhysicians entered a new partnership with the state and won the power to set\nreproductive policy. In the process, women's perceptions of pregnancy were\ndelegitimated and women lost what had been a common-law right. Periodization: Changing Patterns of Illegal Abortion During the more than one hundred years that abortion was illegal in the United\nStates, the patterns; practice, policing, and politics of abortion all changed\nover time, though not always simultaneously. I trace the history along several\nlines at once, according to the location, practice, and availability of\nabortion as well as its regulation. Abortion was widely available throughout\nmuch of the era when abortion was a crime. Yet periods of tolerance were\npunctuated by moments of severe repression. At some points the changing\nstructure of medicine brought about crucial changes in the history of abortion;\nat others, changes in women's lives or the political and economic context came\nto the fore. In the nineteenth century, abortion came under attack at a moment when women\nwere claiming political power; in the twentieth century, it came under attack\nwhen they claimed sexual freedom. Abortion, like contraception, means that\nwomen can separate sex and procreation -- still a controversial notion.\nAntiabortion campaigns developed when women asserted sexual independence, as\nduring the Progressive Era and since the 1970s. When abortion was most firmly\nlinked to the needs of family rather than the freedoms of women, as during the\nDepression, it was most ignored by those who would suppress it. Periods of\nantiabortion activity mark moments of hostility to female independence. The epoch of illegal abortion may be broken down into four periods. The first\ncovers the time from the criminalization of abortion state-by-state,\naccomplished nationwide by 1880, to 1930. This period, covering fifty years, is\nheavily marked by continuity. As other historians have also found, the\nreproductive lives of most women and the day-to-day practice of most physicians\nchanged slowly. In this period, abortion was widely accepted and was practiced\nin women's homes and in the offices of physicians and midwives. The diversity\nof practitioners, the privacy of medical practice, and the autonomy of\nphysicians in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries made the\nwidespread medical practice of abortion possible. A crackdown on abortion\noccurred between 1890 and 1920 as specialists in obstetrics renewed the earlier\ncampaign against abortion, and the medical profession was drawn into the\nstate's enforcement system. The structural transformation that occurred during the 1930s, the second\nperiod, was crucial for the history of abortion. Abortion became more available\nand changed location. As the practice moved from private offices and homes to\nhospitals and clinics, abortion was consolidated in medical hands and became\nmore visible. The changes wrought by the Depression accelerated the pace of\nchange in the coming decades, particularly in the methods of enforcing the\ncriminal abortion laws. The third period was marked by increasing restrictions on abortion by state\nand medical authorities and intensifying demand for abortion from women of all\ngroups. This period begins in 1940, when the new methods of controlling\nabortion were first instituted, and continues through 1973, when they were\ndismantled. In reaction to the growing practice of abortion as well as apparent\nchanges in female gender and reproductive patterns, a backlash against abortion\ndeveloped. 1940 marks a dividing line as hospitals instituted new policies, and\npolice and prosecutors changed their tactics. The repression of abortion was\npart of the repression of political and personal deviance that took place in\nthe 1940s and 1950s. Yet even in this period, the practice of abortion expanded\nin new directions in response to relentless demand. The new repression of\nabortion, however, was devastating for women. A dual system of abortion,\ndivided by race and class, developed. During the postwar period, the\ncriminalization of abortion produced its harshest results. A new stage in the history of abortion, the movement to legalize it, overlaps\nwith the third period. The movement to decriminalize abortion began in the\nmid-1950s and arose out of the difficult experiences resulting from the\nrepression of abortion in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1950s, a handful of\nphysicians began to challenge the very abortion laws their profession had\nadvocated a century earlier. The progress of that challenge attests to the\ncontinuing power of the medical profession to make public policy regarding\nreproduction. As legal reform moved forward, a new feminist movement arose,\nwhich radically transformed the movement for legal change. When the women's\nmovement described abortion as an aspect of sexual freedom, they articulated a\nnew feminist meaning for abortion; when they demanded abortion as a right, they\nechoed generations of women. The structure of this book follows this periodization. The first half of the\nbook uncovers the history of abortion from the late nineteenth century through\nthe 1920s. Chapters 1 through 4 each cover different aspects of abortion, from\nwomen's lives to practice to politics to enforcement, during the first\nhalf-century of illegal abortion. The changes of the 1930S, both medical and\nsocial, precipitated other changes. The second half of the book traces the\nhistory of abortion in chronologically ordered chapters concluding with the\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions that ended the era of illegal abortion. Women's history of abortion needs to be examined both as a commonly felt need\nto control reproduction, arising from women's biological capacity to bear\nchildren and social relations that assign childbearing to women, and in terms\nof differences among women. This book differentiates among women by class, race\nand ethnic identity, and marital status. Though class did not absolutely\ndetermine access to or safety of abortion, class position helped define when a\nwoman felt she needed an abortion and affected the type available to her. In\ngeneral, urban women had greater access to abortion than rural women, though\nsome rural women located abortionists in their areas or traveled to cities for\nabortions. Race played a less obvious role in access to abortion, though the\ngrim statistics of the postwar period show the connection between\ndiscrimination and death. I have made a specific effort to locate sources\nrelated to African Americans in order to learn more about black women's use of\nabortion and how race shaped the history of abortion. Evidence concerning women\nof color is meager, however, until the 1930s, when medical and sociological\nstudies began separating their findings by race. Before then, contemporary\nobservers tended to focus their attention on the differences among many (white)\nforeign-born ethnic groups. This book integrates a national analysis of the history of abortion with a\nlocal study. The advantage of this approach is that it connects everyday life\nand local medical and legal practice to national policy. It examines that\nrelationship rather than assuming that all the public policy action takes place\non the federal level without reference to local and \"private\" events. I select\na major metropolis in order to uncover the nature of both abortion practices\nand police enforcement of the criminal abortion laws. Chicago, the second\nlargest city in the nation, is the focus of my local study. Chicago, the city\nin \"the heartland\" that has of ten served as a metaphor for the spirit of\nAmerica, was also known as an important medical center (the home of the AMA)\nand as a regional center for abortion. Trains brought European immigrants, men\nand women migrating from farms to the city, African Americans moving from the\nSouth to the North, all going to live and work in Chicago. The same trains\nbrought women looking for abortions. Directing my attention to one city enabled\nme to uncover the nitty-gritty details of the practice and regulation of\nabortion. Though much of my analysis of the history of abortion draws on Chicago as a\ncase study, sources verify that my findings hold true for other cities, large\nand small. Throughout I present national data and trends as well as regional\nones and take note of patterns elsewhere. The book moves back and forth from a\nnational overview of abortion practices and politics to a close look at events\nin Chicago. As medical practice became more standardized in hospitals, the\nstory becomes a more national one and key events take place in other cities:\nNew York, Detroit, Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington, D.C.,\nand elsewhere. This is primarily a study of abortion in urban areas, where\nabortion was concentrated. I comment occasionally on practices in rural areas,\nbut the history of reproductive control and abortion is likely to be somewhat\ndifferent there. Legal records, most notably lower-level court and criminal trial records, and\nmedical literature make up the foundation of my research. I have also surveyed\nother government documents, newspapers, popular periodicals, hospital records,\nand manuscript collections. Using these materials, I have delineated how\nmedical thinking and state regulation have changed over time. Yet this is more\nthan a study of prescriptive literature or policy. I have uncovered the\ncircumstances of hundreds of actual induced abortions and reconstructed\nchanging abortion practices. This study periodizes the history of abortion for\nthe first time. This book presents the lives of many women and their abortions in rich detail\nin order to convey the variety and intricacy of the situations that made\nabortion necessary for women. It is in the minutiae of women's lives that we\ncan discover why women had abortions and how they won sympathy from physicians\nwho belonged to a profession dedicated to fighting abortion. Abortion was a\nmoment in a woman's reproductive life. It cannot be separated from sexual\nrelations or reproduction as a whole. Women themselves did not separate them,\nnor should we, whether analyzing abortion in the past or present. This book\ndeepens our understanding of the female experience of reproduction and the\nconnections between sexuality, contraception, pregnancy, and childbirth. At its\nmost fundamental, a policy that restricts abortion is one that forces women\ninto maternity. Without contraceptives and abortion, most women in heterosexual\nrelationships will become pregnant and bear children, whether they want to or\nnot. When women sought abortions, they often revealed the texture of\nheterosexual relations and the rest of their lives. Many situations made\nenduring pregnancy unbearable to women. In using abortion, women rebelled\nagainst the law and asserted their sense that the decision to carry a pregnancy\nto term or to abort was theirs to make. A few expressed in words as well as in\naction the view that abortion was their right. The experiences of women's\nprivate lives and private practices over the course of one hundred years\naltered medical thinking and reshaped public policy. Despite the fact that\nwomen's abortion narratives are part of our own contemporary discourse, the\nstories told here have long been hidden.

To understand the power of law in the lives of the masses of\nAmericans requires that one take seriously the experiences of ordinary people\ncaught in criminal investigations. Thus it is necessary to analyze the\nprocesses and routine procedures of the legal system that shape those\nexperiences. Most historians of crime and punishment have focused on police and\nprisons, while historians of women and the law have focused mainly on marriage\nand property rights, not crime. Surprisingly little historical work has\nexamined the relationship between medicine and law. Few have studied law in\npractice. Analysis of the day-to-day workings of the legal system, rather than\nstatutory changes, judicial rulings, or the volume of cases, reveals how the\nlaw intervened in the lives of ordinary citizens to regulate reproductive and\nsexual behavior.\" Punishment for violation of the law and sexual norms has been gendered. In\nabortion cases, the investigative procedures themselves constituted a form of\npunishment and control for women. Publicity and public exposure of women's\ntransgressions further served as punishment. This form of punishment served, in\nMichel Foucault's words, as \"a school.\" The shame of public exposure was for\nall of \"the potentially guilty,\" not only the individual who had been caught.\nThis eighteenth-century mode of punishment, thought to have been replaced by\nthe surveillance of the prison, persisted in the state's response to women and\ntheir sexual crimes. Without analyzing gender, we cannot fully understand the\nsystems of punishment. Even as the abortion statutes remained the same through this period, the\nmeaning of the law and the legality and illegality of abortion changed over\ntime. Law is not fixed, but fluid. The criminal abortion laws passed in every\nstate by T880 made exceptions for therapeutic abortions performed in order to\nsave a woman's life. Because the laws governing abortion did not precisely\ndefine what was criminal and what was not, this had to be worked out in\npractice, in policing, and in the courts. The complexity of defining \"legal\"\nand \"illegal\" abortions for medical practitioners and legal authorities alike,\nthe gray and ever-shifting nature of \"criminality,\" is an important theme in\nthis book. Nor was medical understanding of therapeutic abortion stable.\nMedicine too is interpretive and changing. Throughout the period of illegal\nabortion, physicians disagreed on the conditions that mandated a therapeutic\nabortion and on the methods: there was no consensus. Changes in medicine\ninfluenced legal definitions of crime; at the same time, the law shaped medical\nthinking and practice. The medical profession and the legal profession each\nlooked to the other to define the legality of abortion practices. Therapeutic\nabortion became increasingly important in the 1930s; by the 1960s the practice\n(and nonpractice) of therapeutic abortion was at the very heart of the campaign\nto reform and repeal the criminal abortion laws. The illegality of abortion has hidden the existence of an unarticulated,\nalternative, popular morality, which supported women who had abortions. This\npopular ethic contradicted the law, the official attitude of the medical\nprofession, and the teachings of some religions. Private discussions among\nfamily and friends, conversations between women and doctors, and the behavior\nof women (and the people who aided them) suggest that traditional ideas that\naccepted early abortions endured into the twentieth century. Furthermore,\nthrough the 1920s at least, working-class women did not make a distinction\nbetween contraceptives and abortion. What I call a popular morality that\naccepted abortion was almost never publicly expressed but was rooted in\npeople's daily lives. Americans have a long history of accepting abortion in\ncertain situations as a necessity and as a decision that, implicitly, belongs\nto women to make. This popular attitude made itself felt in the courts and in\ndoctors' offices: prosecutors found it difficult to convict abortionists\nbecause juries regularly nullified the law by acquitting abortionists,  and few\nphysicians escaped the pressure from women for abortions. Throughout the period\nof illegal abortion, women asserted their need for abortion and, in doing so,\nimplicitly asserted their sense of having a right to control their own\nreproduction. I am not suggesting a \"gap\" between people's beliefs and their ability to live\nup to them, but different, even oppositional, moral perspectives. The values\nexpressed by ordinary people deserve to be taken seriously rather than\ncategorized and dismissed as sinful or mistaken. Though some felt guilt about\nabortion and found ways to justify their behavior, others never held the\nofficial antiabortion views. Prescribed morality and popular morality may not\nbe identical. Analysis of women's practices and ideas -- popular\nbehavior and\nbelief -- rather than exclusive focus on the statements of male\ntheologians and\nphilosophers suggests that it is incorrect to conclude that hostility to\nabortion is \"almost an absolute value in history.\" The reverse may be more\naccurate. Although this book takes note of religious teachings and the religious\nbackground of women who had abortions, it does not focus on religious opinion.\nOrganized religion had little interest in abortion until it entered the public,\npolitical arena in the late 1950s and early 1960s. There was no reason to\nenergetically fight abortion when, for nearly a century, abortion was a crime\nand no social movement suggested otherwise. From the 1920s on, however, there\nwas much religious interest in, and division over, another method of\nreproductive control: contraception. Birth control became a topic of interest\nbecause a movement advocated women's right to reproductive control. Further, it\nis incorrect to assume that the Catholic Church has always organized against\nabortion or that all Catholics subscribe to the views of their church leaders.\nIndeed, many Catholics shared what I have described as a popular ethic\naccepting abortion. A good history of religion and reproductive control would\nexamine not only theology and sermons, but also the attitudes and actions of\nthe congregations, with particular attention to women. Women who had abortions did so within a context of illegality and religious\ndisapproval, but the prohibitions were ambiguous. Christian traditions had\ntabooed abortion since antiquity, but the acceptance of abortion in order to\nsave the life of a pregnant woman had a long tradition as well. Until the\nmid-nineteenth century, the Catholic Church implicitly accepted early abortions\nprior to ensoulment. Not until T869, at about the same time that abortion\nbecame politicized in this country, did the church condemn abortion; in 1895,\nit condemned therapeutic abortion. Protestant churches accepted abortion when\npregnancy threatened a woman's life, a view shared by the medical profession\nand written into the nation's laws. Jewish tradition clearly viewed the woman's\nlife as primary. The Mishnah, a code of ancient Jewish law that guided later\nrabbinic thought, required abortion when childbirth threatened a woman's life,\nfor \"her life takes precedence over its life.\" This study points to the importance of studying the social history of\nsexuality as well as the medical and legal discourse about it. These discourses\nregarding abortion are important because they introduced new meanings of\nabortion and shaped people's views (and fears) of abortion and sexuality. I\nanalyze the language women used to describe abortion and the production of\nstories about abortion in the press and in the courtroom. Yet exclusive\nattention to professional or even popular discourse about abortion would result\nin a distorted picture of that history. Medical discourse has convinced some\nscholars that physicians did not perform abortions in the period of illegal\nabortion, and most press coverage of abortion in the early twentieth century\ngives the misleading impression that abortion was universally condemned and\ngenerally fatal. These conclusions are not correct. Analysis of discourse alone\nwould miss the ongoing medical practice of abortion in total contradiction of\nofficial medical mores. As others have pointed out, Foucault's theory\nconcerning the production of sexuality through discourse ignores differences in\nthe power of individuals and social groups to enter and shape discourse. The\npublicly articulated and published discussion of abortion rarely included the\nvoices or perspectives of women who had abortions, except to provide shocking\nexamples of depraved womanhood. Women who had abortions did not intervene to\nexplain themselves, but instead, in other nonpublic arenas, made their\nperspectives known and acted to obtain a much-needed method for preventing\nbirths. More tolerant attitudes toward abortion, rooted in material\nexperiences, persisted in the face of a public discourse that denounced it. The\nhistory of sexuality and reproduction demands a combined analysis of ideas and\npractice. Common Law and the Criminalization of Abortion Abortion was not always a crime. During the eighteenth and early nineteenth\ncenturies, abortion of early pregnancy was legal under common law. Abortions\nwere illegal only after \"quickening,\" the point at which a pregnant woman could\nfeel the movements of the fetus (approximately the fourth month of pregnancy).\nThe common law's attitude toward pregnancy and abortion was based on an\nunderstanding of pregnancy and human development as a process rather than an\nabsolute moment. Indeed, the term abortion referred only to the miscarriages of\nlater pregnancies, after quickening. What we would now identify as an early\ninduced abortion was not called an abortion at all. If an early pregnancy\nended, it had \"slipp[ed] away,\" or the menses had been \"restored.\" At\nconception and the earliest stage of pregnancy before quickening, no one\nbelieved that a human life existed; not even the Catholic Church took this\nview. Rather, the popular ethic regarding abortion and common law were grounded\nin the female experience of their own bodies. Colonial and early-nineteenth-century women, historians have learned,\nperceived conception as the \"blocking\" or \"obstructing\" of menstruation, which\nrequired attention. The cessation of the menses indicated a worrisome imbalance\nin the body and the need to bring the body back into balance by restoring the\nflow. This idea of menstruation corresponded with medical and popular\nunderstanding of sickness and health. The body was a delicate system of\nequilibrium that could easily be thrown out of balance -- by a change\nin weather\nor diet, for example -- and that then needed to be restored through active\nintervention. A disruption in the healthy body, in the worldview of patients\nand physicians, required a visible, often violent, physical response to\ntreatment in order to restore equilibrium. This theory underlay eighteenth and\nnineteenth-century regular medical practice, which emphasized heroic\nmeasures -- bleeding, blistering, purging, and puking -- in\nresponse to sickness.\nThe response to the blocking of the menses was part of this shared\nunderstanding of the body: women took drugs in order to make their menses\nregular and regarded the ensuing vomiting and evacuation as evidence of the\ndrugs' effective action. Restoring the menses was a domestic practice. The power of certain herbs to\nrestore menstruation was widely known. One colonial woman who feared pregnancy\nhad \"twice taken Savin; once boyled in milk and the other time strayned through\na Cloath.\" Savin, derived from juniper bushes, was the most popular\nabortifacient and easily acquired since junipers grew wild throughout the\ncountry. Other herbs used as abortifacients included pennyroyal, tansy, ergot,\nand seneca snakeroot. Slave women used cottonroot. Many of these useful plants\ncould be found in the woods or cultivated. in gardens, and women could refer to\nhome medical guides for recipes for \"bringing on the menses.\" Both of these concepts, blocked menses and quickening, must be taken seriously\nby late-twentieth-century observers. Blocked menses cannot be dismissed as an\nexcuse made by women who knew they were pregnant. Quickening was a moment\nrecognized by women and by law as a defining moment in human development. Once\nquickening occurred, women recognized a moral obligation to carry the fetus to\nterm. This age-old idea underpinned the practice of abortion in America. The\nlegal acceptance of induced miscarriages before quickening tacitly assumed that\nwomen had a basic right to bodily integrity. By the mid-eighteenth century, the most common means of inducing\nabortion -- by\ntaking drugs was commercialized. The availability of abortifacients was so\nwell-known that a common euphemism described their use. When Sarah Grosvenor, a\nConnecticut farm girl, confided to her sister in 1742 that she was \"taking the\ntrade,\" her sister understood. That Grosvenor successfully conveyed her meaning\nto her sister in three metaphoric words tells us a great deal about the world\nof mid-eighteenth-century New England. Many New Englanders, including these\nsisters, knew of the possibility of inducing an abortion by purchasing and\ningesting drugs. The need for a euphemism tells of the difficulty of speaking\nopenly about sex and reproductive control and of the need for secrecy. Yet it\nreveals an awareness that women could and did regulate their own fertility\nthrough abortion. Furthermore, abortifacients had become a profitable product\nsold by doctors, apothecaries, and other healers. The first statutes governing abortion in the United States, James Mohr has\nfound, were poison control measures designed to protect pregnant women like\nGrosvenor by controlling the sale of abortifacient drugs, which often killed\nthe women who took them. The proliferation of entrepreneurs who openly sold and\nadvertised abortifacients may have inspired this early legislation, passed in\nthe 1820s and 1830s. The 18 Illinois law, which prohibited the provision of\nabortifacients, was listed under \"poisoning.\" It is crucial to recognize what these early-nineteenth-century laws did not\ncover: they did not punish women for inducing abortions, and they did not\neliminate the concept of quickening. Even as poison control measures, they said\nnothing about growing the plants needed in one's own garden or mixing together\none's own home remedy in order to induce an abortion. The legal silence on\ndomestic practices suggests that the new laws were aimed at the\ncommercialization of this practice and, implicitly, retained to women the right\nto make their own decisions about their pregnancies before quickening. By the 1840s, the abortion business boomed. Despite the laws forbidding the\nsale of abortifacients, they were advertised in the popular press and could be\npurchased from physicians or pharmacists or through the mail. If drugs failed,\nwomen could go to a practitioner who specialized in performing instrumental\nabortions. Advertisements and newspaper exposes made it appear that what had\nbeen an occasional domestic practice had become a daily occurrence performed\nfor profit in northern cities. Madame Restell, for example, openly advertised\nand provided abortion services for thirty-five years. Restell began her\nabortion business in New York City in the late 1830s; by the mid-1840s, she had\noffices in Boston and Philadelphia and traveling agents who sold her \"Female\nMonthly Pills.\" Restell became the most infamous abortionist in the country,\nbut she was not the only abortionist. The clientele of these busy clinics were\nprimarily married, white, native-born Protestant women of the upper and middle\nclasses. In 1857, the newly organized AMA initiated a crusade to make abortion at every\nstage of pregnancy illegal. The antiabortion campaign grew in part, James Mohr\nhas shown, out of regular physicians' desire to win professional power, control\nmedical practice, and restrict their competitors, particularly Homeopaths and\nmidwives. \"Regular,\" or \"orthodox,\" physicians, practitioners of \"heroic\"\nmedicine, had come under attack in the 1820s and 1830s as elitist. They faced\ncompetition from a variety of practitioners from other medical sects,\ncollectively known as \"Irregulars.\" Through the 1870S, regular physicians\nacross the country worked for the passage of new criminal abortion laws. In\nsecuring criminal abortion laws, the Regulars won recognition of their\nparticular views as well as some state control over the practice of\nmedicine. Though professional issues underlay the medical campaign, gender, racial, and\nclass anxieties pushed the criminalization of abortion forward. The visible use\nof abortion by middle-class married women, in conjunction with other challenges\nto gender norms and changes in the social makeup of the nation, generated\nanxieties among American men of the same class. Birth rates among the Yankee\nclasses had declined by mid-century while immigrants poured into the country.\nAntiabortion activists pointed out that immigrant families, many of them\nCatholic, were larger and would soon outpopulate native-born white Yankees and\nthreaten their political power. Dr. Horatio R Storer, the leader of the medical\ncampaign against abortion, envisioned the spread of \"civilization\" west and\nsouth by native-born white Americans, not Mexicans, Chinese, Blacks, Indians,\nor Catholics. \"Shall\" these regions, he asked, \"be filled by our own children\nor by those of aliens? This is a question our women must answer; upon their\nloins depends the future destiny of the nation.\" Hostility to immigrants,\nCatholics, and people of color fueled this campaign to criminalize abortion.\nWhite male patriotism demanded that maternity be enforced among white\nProtestant women. The antiabortion campaign was antifeminist at its core. Women were condemned\nfor following \"fashion\" and for avoiding the self-sacrifice expected of\nmothers. \"The true wife,\" Storer declared, did not seek `'undue power in public\nlife, . . . undue control in domestic affairs, . . . [or] privileges not her\nown.\" The antiabortion campaign was a reactionary response to two important\nefforts of the nineteenth-century women's movements: the fight to admit women\ninto the regular medical profession and the battle to make men conform to a\nsingle standard of sexual behavior. The antiabortion campaign coincided with\nthe fight by male Regulars to keep women out of their medical schools,\nsocieties, and hospitals. Boston and Harvard University, Storer's hometown and\nalma mater, were key sites of struggle over women's place in medicine, and\nStorer was personally engaged in the battle against female physicians.\nAdvocates of women in medicine argued that women doctors would protect women\npatients from sexual violation. Regular male doctors degraded female physicians\nby accusing them, along with midwives, of performing abortions. The relative morality of men and women was of crucial importance to this\ncampaign. For the specialists, whose interest in the female reproductive system\nraised questions about their sexual morality, the antiabortion campaign was a\nway to proclaim their own high morality in contrast to their competitors, their\nfemale patients, and even the ministers who tolerated abortion. It was at the\nsame time a backlash against the women's movement's critique of male sexual\nbehavior and feminist claims to political power. Nineteenth-century feminists\nexpressed their anger with male sexual domination and promiscuity in a number\nof movements, including the campaigns against prostitution and slavery and the\nfight for temperance. All sections of the women's movement advocated \"voluntary\nmotherhood,\" a slogan that addressed both men's sexual violation of their wives\nand women's desire to control childbearing. Women saw themselves as morally\nsuperior and urged men to adopt a single standard  --  the female\nstandard of\nchastity until marriage, followed by monogamy and moderation. The campaign\nagainst abortion challenged this feminist analysis of men by condemning women\nfor having abortions. Indeed, Storer compared abortion to prostitution and, in\nso doing, called into question all claims made by middle-class\nnineteenth-century women on the basis of moral superiority. \"There is little\ndifference,\" he proclaimed, \"between the immorality\" of the man who visited\nprostitutes and the woman who aborted. The nineteenth-century women's movements\nnever defended abortion, but activist women and women doctors were blamed for\nthe practice of abortion nonetheless. The antiabortion campaign attempted to destroy the idea of quickening. As\nphysicians targeted quickening, they discredited women's experiences of\npregnancy and claimed pregnancy as medical terrain. \"Quickening,\" as Storer\ndescribed it, \"is in fact but a sensation.\" A sensation that had emotional,\nsocial, and legal meaning was thus denigrated. Quickening was based on women's\nown bodily sensations -- not on medical diagnosis. It made physicians, and\nobstetricians in particular, dependent on female self-diagnosis and judgment.\nQuickening could not be relied upon as an indicator of fetal life because,\nStorer argued, it did not occur at a standard moment. \"Many women never quicken\nat all,\" he joked about women's perceptions, \"though their children are born\nliving.\" Storer's propaganda aimed to erase the distinctions between earlier\nand later stages of pregnancy, thereby redefining the restoration of the\nmenses. What had previously been understood as a blockage and a restoration of\nthe menses prior to quickening was now associated with inducing a miscarriage\nafter quickening by labeling it abortion. Furthermore, Storer equated abortion\nwith infanticide. Regular medical men had entered the debate about sexual politics by attacking\nthe female practice of abortion as immoral, unwomanly, and unpatriotic. In\ngiving abortion new meaning, the Regulars provided a weapon that white,\nnative-born, male legislators could use against the women of their own class\nwho had been agitating for personal and political reform. Regular physicians\nwon passage of new criminal abortion laws because their campaign appealed to a\nset of fears of white, nativeborn, male elites about losing political power to\nCatholic immigrants and to women. Class privilege did not protect middle-class\nwhite women from public policy designed to control them. Although the\ncriminalization of abortion was aimed at middle-class white women, it affected\nwomen of every class and race. The new laws passed across the country between\n1860 and 1880 regarded abortion in an entirely different light from common law\nand the statutes regulating abortifacients. In general, the laws included two\ninnovations: they eliminated the common-law idea of quickening and prohibited\nabortion at any point in pregnancy. Some included punishment for the women who\nhad abortions. The \"Comstock Law\" passed in 1873 included abortion and birth\ncontrol in federal antiobscenity legislation; states and municipalities passed\nsimilar ordinances. The antiabortion laws made one exception: physicians could perform therapeutic\nabortions if pregnancy and childbirth threatened the woman's life. A bill\ncriminalizing abortion unless done for \" bona fide medical or surgical\npurposes\" passed the Illinois state legislature unanimously and was signed into\nlaw in 1867. A few years later, Illinois passed another law prohibiting the\nsale of abortifacients but made an exception for \"the written prescription of\nsome well known and respectable practicing physician.\" Physicians had won the\ncriminalization of abortion and retained to themselves alone the right to\ninduce abortions when they determined it necessary. Through the antiabortion campaign, doctors claimed scientific authority to\ndefine life and death. In so doing, they claimed the authority of religious\nleaders. In leading this moral crusade and thoroughly criticizing the\nministry's lack of interest in abortion, regular doctors set themselves above\nreligious leaders as well as above the general populace. The medical\nprofession's claim to moral purity and the authority of the clergy was a\nstepping-stone to greater social authority. Regular physicians won an important\nvictory when they persuaded the nation's states to criminalize abortion.\nPhysicians entered a new partnership with the state and won the power to set\nreproductive policy. In the process, women's perceptions of pregnancy were\ndelegitimated and women lost what had been a common-law right. Periodization: Changing Patterns of Illegal Abortion During the more than one hundred years that abortion was illegal in the United\nStates, the patterns; practice, policing, and politics of abortion all changed\nover time, though not always simultaneously. I trace the history along several\nlines at once, according to the location, practice, and availability of\nabortion as well as its regulation. Abortion was widely available throughout\nmuch of the era when abortion was a crime. Yet periods of tolerance were\npunctuated by moments of severe repression. At some points the changing\nstructure of medicine brought about crucial changes in the history of abortion;\nat others, changes in women's lives or the political and economic context came\nto the fore. In the nineteenth century, abortion came under attack at a moment when women\nwere claiming political power; in the twentieth century, it came under attack\nwhen they claimed sexual freedom. Abortion, like contraception, means that\nwomen can separate sex and procreation -- still a controversial notion.\nAntiabortion campaigns developed when women asserted sexual independence, as\nduring the Progressive Era and since the 1970s. When abortion was most firmly\nlinked to the needs of family rather than the freedoms of women, as during the\nDepression, it was most ignored by those who would suppress it. Periods of\nantiabortion activity mark moments of hostility to female independence. The epoch of illegal abortion may be broken down into four periods. The first\ncovers the time from the criminalization of abortion state-by-state,\naccomplished nationwide by 1880, to 1930. This period, covering fifty years, is\nheavily marked by continuity. As other historians have also found, the\nreproductive lives of most women and the day-to-day practice of most physicians\nchanged slowly. In this period, abortion was widely accepted and was practiced\nin women's homes and in the offices of physicians and midwives. The diversity\nof practitioners, the privacy of medical practice, and the autonomy of\nphysicians in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries made the\nwidespread medical practice of abortion possible. A crackdown on abortion\noccurred between 1890 and 1920 as specialists in obstetrics renewed the earlier\ncampaign against abortion, and the medical profession was drawn into the\nstate's enforcement system. The structural transformation that occurred during the 1930s, the second\nperiod, was crucial for the history of abortion. Abortion became more available\nand changed location. As the practice moved from private offices and homes to\nhospitals and clinics, abortion was consolidated in medical hands and became\nmore visible. The changes wrought by the Depression accelerated the pace of\nchange in the coming decades, particularly in the methods of enforcing the\ncriminal abortion laws. The third period was marked by increasing restrictions on abortion by state\nand medical authorities and intensifying demand for abortion from women of all\ngroups. This period begins in 1940, when the new methods of controlling\nabortion were first instituted, and continues through 1973, when they were\ndismantled. In reaction to the growing practice of abortion as well as apparent\nchanges in female gender and reproductive patterns, a backlash against abortion\ndeveloped. 1940 marks a dividing line as hospitals instituted new policies, and\npolice and prosecutors changed their tactics. The repression of abortion was\npart of the repression of political and personal deviance that took place in\nthe 1940s and 1950s. Yet even in this period, the practice of abortion expanded\nin new directions in response to relentless demand. The new repression of\nabortion, however, was devastating for women. A dual system of abortion,\ndivided by race and class, developed. During the postwar period, the\ncriminalization of abortion produced its harshest results. A new stage in the history of abortion, the movement to legalize it, overlaps\nwith the third period. The movement to decriminalize abortion began in the\nmid-1950s and arose out of the difficult experiences resulting from the\nrepression of abortion in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1950s, a handful of\nphysicians began to challenge the very abortion laws their profession had\nadvocated a century earlier. The progress of that challenge attests to the\ncontinuing power of the medical profession to make public policy regarding\nreproduction. As legal reform moved forward, a new feminist movement arose,\nwhich radically transformed the movement for legal change. When the women's\nmovement described abortion as an aspect of sexual freedom, they articulated a\nnew feminist meaning for abortion; when they demanded abortion as a right, they\nechoed generations of women. The structure of this book follows this periodization. The first half of the\nbook uncovers the history of abortion from the late nineteenth century through\nthe 1920s. Chapters 1 through 4 each cover different aspects of abortion, from\nwomen's lives to practice to politics to enforcement, during the first\nhalf-century of illegal abortion. The changes of the 1930S, both medical and\nsocial, precipitated other changes. The second half of the book traces the\nhistory of abortion in chronologically ordered chapters concluding with the\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions that ended the era of illegal abortion. Women's history of abortion needs to be examined both as a commonly felt need\nto control reproduction, arising from women's biological capacity to bear\nchildren and social relations that assign childbearing to women, and in terms\nof differences among women. This book differentiates among women by class, race\nand ethnic identity, and marital status. Though class did not absolutely\ndetermine access to or safety of abortion, class position helped define when a\nwoman felt she needed an abortion and affected the type available to her. In\ngeneral, urban women had greater access to abortion than rural women, though\nsome rural women located abortionists in their areas or traveled to cities for\nabortions. Race played a less obvious role in access to abortion, though the\ngrim statistics of the postwar period show the connection between\ndiscrimination and death. I have made a specific effort to locate sources\nrelated to African Americans in order to learn more about black women's use of\nabortion and how race shaped the history of abortion. Evidence concerning women\nof color is meager, however, until the 1930s, when medical and sociological\nstudies began separating their findings by race. Before then, contemporary\nobservers tended to focus their attention on the differences among many (white)\nforeign-born ethnic groups. This book integrates a national analysis of the history of abortion with a\nlocal study. The advantage of this approach is that it connects everyday life\nand local medical and legal practice to national policy. It examines that\nrelationship rather than assuming that all the public policy action takes place\non the federal level without reference to local and \"private\" events. I select\na major metropolis in order to uncover the nature of both abortion practices\nand police enforcement of the criminal abortion laws. Chicago, the second\nlargest city in the nation, is the focus of my local study. Chicago, the city\nin \"the heartland\" that has of ten served as a metaphor for the spirit of\nAmerica, was also known as an important medical center (the home of the AMA)\nand as a regional center for abortion. Trains brought European immigrants, men\nand women migrating from farms to the city, African Americans moving from the\nSouth to the North, all going to live and work in Chicago. The same trains\nbrought women looking for abortions. Directing my attention to one city enabled\nme to uncover the nitty-gritty details of the practice and regulation of\nabortion. Though much of my analysis of the history of abortion draws on Chicago as a\ncase study, sources verify that my findings hold true for other cities, large\nand small. Throughout I present national data and trends as well as regional\nones and take note of patterns elsewhere. The book moves back and forth from a\nnational overview of abortion practices and politics to a close look at events\nin Chicago. As medical practice became more standardized in hospitals, the\nstory becomes a more national one and key events take place in other cities:\nNew York, Detroit, Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington, D.C.,\nand elsewhere. This is primarily a study of abortion in urban areas, where\nabortion was concentrated. I comment occasionally on practices in rural areas,\nbut the history of reproductive control and abortion is likely to be somewhat\ndifferent there. Legal records, most notably lower-level court and criminal trial records, and\nmedical literature make up the foundation of my research. I have also surveyed\nother government documents, newspapers, popular periodicals, hospital records,\nand manuscript collections. Using these materials, I have delineated how\nmedical thinking and state regulation have changed over time. Yet this is more\nthan a study of prescriptive literature or policy. I have uncovered the\ncircumstances of hundreds of actual induced abortions and reconstructed\nchanging abortion practices. This study periodizes the history of abortion for\nthe first time. This book presents the lives of many women and their abortions in rich detail\nin order to convey the variety and intricacy of the situations that made\nabortion necessary for women. It is in the minutiae of women's lives that we\ncan discover why women had abortions and how they won sympathy from physicians\nwho belonged to a profession dedicated to fighting abortion. Abortion was a\nmoment in a woman's reproductive life. It cannot be separated from sexual\nrelations or reproduction as a whole. Women themselves did not separate them,\nnor should we, whether analyzing abortion in the past or present. This book\ndeepens our understanding of the female experience of reproduction and the\nconnections between sexuality, contraception, pregnancy, and childbirth. At its\nmost fundamental, a policy that restricts abortion is one that forces women\ninto maternity. Without contraceptives and abortion, most women in heterosexual\nrelationships will become pregnant and bear children, whether they want to or\nnot. When women sought abortions, they often revealed the texture of\nheterosexual relations and the rest of their lives. Many situations made\nenduring pregnancy unbearable to women. In using abortion, women rebelled\nagainst the law and asserted their sense that the decision to carry a pregnancy\nto term or to abort was theirs to make. A few expressed in words as well as in\naction the view that abortion was their right. The experiences of women's\nprivate lives and private practices over the course of one hundred years\naltered medical thinking and reshaped public policy. Despite the fact that\nwomen's abortion narratives are part of our own contemporary discourse, the\nstories told here have long been hidden.

In\nabortion cases, the investigative procedures themselves constituted a form of\npunishment and control for women. Publicity and public exposure of women's\ntransgressions further served as punishment. This form of punishment served, in\nMichel Foucault's words, as \"a school.\" The shame of public exposure was for\nall of \"the potentially guilty,\" not only the individual who had been caught.\nThis eighteenth-century mode of punishment, thought to have been replaced by\nthe surveillance of the prison, persisted in the state's response to women and\ntheir sexual crimes. Without analyzing gender, we cannot fully understand the\nsystems of punishment. Even as the abortion statutes remained the same through this period, the\nmeaning of the law and the legality and illegality of abortion changed over\ntime. Law is not fixed, but fluid. The criminal abortion laws passed in every\nstate by T880 made exceptions for therapeutic abortions performed in order to\nsave a woman's life. Because the laws governing abortion did not precisely\ndefine what was criminal and what was not, this had to be worked out in\npractice, in policing, and in the courts. The complexity of defining \"legal\"\nand \"illegal\" abortions for medical practitioners and legal authorities alike,\nthe gray and ever-shifting nature of \"criminality,\" is an important theme in\nthis book. Nor was medical understanding of therapeutic abortion stable.\nMedicine too is interpretive and changing. Throughout the period of illegal\nabortion, physicians disagreed on the conditions that mandated a therapeutic\nabortion and on the methods: there was no consensus. Changes in medicine\ninfluenced legal definitions of crime; at the same time, the law shaped medical\nthinking and practice. The medical profession and the legal profession each\nlooked to the other to define the legality of abortion practices. Therapeutic\nabortion became increasingly important in the 1930s; by the 1960s the practice\n(and nonpractice) of therapeutic abortion was at the very heart of the campaign\nto reform and repeal the criminal abortion laws. The illegality of abortion has hidden the existence of an unarticulated,\nalternative, popular morality, which supported women who had abortions. This\npopular ethic contradicted the law, the official attitude of the medical\nprofession, and the teachings of some religions. Private discussions among\nfamily and friends, conversations between women and doctors, and the behavior\nof women (and the people who aided them) suggest that traditional ideas that\naccepted early abortions endured into the twentieth century. Furthermore,\nthrough the 1920s at least, working-class women did not make a distinction\nbetween contraceptives and abortion. What I call a popular morality that\naccepted abortion was almost never publicly expressed but was rooted in\npeople's daily lives. Americans have a long history of accepting abortion in\ncertain situations as a necessity and as a decision that, implicitly, belongs\nto women to make. This popular attitude made itself felt in the courts and in\ndoctors' offices: prosecutors found it difficult to convict abortionists\nbecause juries regularly nullified the law by acquitting abortionists,  and few\nphysicians escaped the pressure from women for abortions. Throughout the period\nof illegal abortion, women asserted their need for abortion and, in doing so,\nimplicitly asserted their sense of having a right to control their own\nreproduction. I am not suggesting a \"gap\" between people's beliefs and their ability to live\nup to them, but different, even oppositional, moral perspectives. The values\nexpressed by ordinary people deserve to be taken seriously rather than\ncategorized and dismissed as sinful or mistaken. Though some felt guilt about\nabortion and found ways to justify their behavior, others never held the\nofficial antiabortion views. Prescribed morality and popular morality may not\nbe identical. Analysis of women's practices and ideas -- popular\nbehavior and\nbelief -- rather than exclusive focus on the statements of male\ntheologians and\nphilosophers suggests that it is incorrect to conclude that hostility to\nabortion is \"almost an absolute value in history.\" The reverse may be more\naccurate. Although this book takes note of religious teachings and the religious\nbackground of women who had abortions, it does not focus on religious opinion.\nOrganized religion had little interest in abortion until it entered the public,\npolitical arena in the late 1950s and early 1960s. There was no reason to\nenergetically fight abortion when, for nearly a century, abortion was a crime\nand no social movement suggested otherwise. From the 1920s on, however, there\nwas much religious interest in, and division over, another method of\nreproductive control: contraception. Birth control became a topic of interest\nbecause a movement advocated women's right to reproductive control. Further, it\nis incorrect to assume that the Catholic Church has always organized against\nabortion or that all Catholics subscribe to the views of their church leaders.\nIndeed, many Catholics shared what I have described as a popular ethic\naccepting abortion. A good history of religion and reproductive control would\nexamine not only theology and sermons, but also the attitudes and actions of\nthe congregations, with particular attention to women. Women who had abortions did so within a context of illegality and religious\ndisapproval, but the prohibitions were ambiguous. Christian traditions had\ntabooed abortion since antiquity, but the acceptance of abortion in order to\nsave the life of a pregnant woman had a long tradition as well. Until the\nmid-nineteenth century, the Catholic Church implicitly accepted early abortions\nprior to ensoulment. Not until T869, at about the same time that abortion\nbecame politicized in this country, did the church condemn abortion; in 1895,\nit condemned therapeutic abortion. Protestant churches accepted abortion when\npregnancy threatened a woman's life, a view shared by the medical profession\nand written into the nation's laws. Jewish tradition clearly viewed the woman's\nlife as primary. The Mishnah, a code of ancient Jewish law that guided later\nrabbinic thought, required abortion when childbirth threatened a woman's life,\nfor \"her life takes precedence over its life.\" This study points to the importance of studying the social history of\nsexuality as well as the medical and legal discourse about it. These discourses\nregarding abortion are important because they introduced new meanings of\nabortion and shaped people's views (and fears) of abortion and sexuality. I\nanalyze the language women used to describe abortion and the production of\nstories about abortion in the press and in the courtroom. Yet exclusive\nattention to professional or even popular discourse about abortion would result\nin a distorted picture of that history. Medical discourse has convinced some\nscholars that physicians did not perform abortions in the period of illegal\nabortion, and most press coverage of abortion in the early twentieth century\ngives the misleading impression that abortion was universally condemned and\ngenerally fatal. These conclusions are not correct. Analysis of discourse alone\nwould miss the ongoing medical practice of abortion in total contradiction of\nofficial medical mores. As others have pointed out, Foucault's theory\nconcerning the production of sexuality through discourse ignores differences in\nthe power of individuals and social groups to enter and shape discourse. The\npublicly articulated and published discussion of abortion rarely included the\nvoices or perspectives of women who had abortions, except to provide shocking\nexamples of depraved womanhood. Women who had abortions did not intervene to\nexplain themselves, but instead, in other nonpublic arenas, made their\nperspectives known and acted to obtain a much-needed method for preventing\nbirths. More tolerant attitudes toward abortion, rooted in material\nexperiences, persisted in the face of a public discourse that denounced it. The\nhistory of sexuality and reproduction demands a combined analysis of ideas and\npractice. Common Law and the Criminalization of Abortion Abortion was not always a crime. During the eighteenth and early nineteenth\ncenturies, abortion of early pregnancy was legal under common law. Abortions\nwere illegal only after \"quickening,\" the point at which a pregnant woman could\nfeel the movements of the fetus (approximately the fourth month of pregnancy).\nThe common law's attitude toward pregnancy and abortion was based on an\nunderstanding of pregnancy and human development as a process rather than an\nabsolute moment. Indeed, the term abortion referred only to the miscarriages of\nlater pregnancies, after quickening. What we would now identify as an early\ninduced abortion was not called an abortion at all. If an early pregnancy\nended, it had \"slipp[ed] away,\" or the menses had been \"restored.\" At\nconception and the earliest stage of pregnancy before quickening, no one\nbelieved that a human life existed; not even the Catholic Church took this\nview. Rather, the popular ethic regarding abortion and common law were grounded\nin the female experience of their own bodies. Colonial and early-nineteenth-century women, historians have learned,\nperceived conception as the \"blocking\" or \"obstructing\" of menstruation, which\nrequired attention. The cessation of the menses indicated a worrisome imbalance\nin the body and the need to bring the body back into balance by restoring the\nflow. This idea of menstruation corresponded with medical and popular\nunderstanding of sickness and health. The body was a delicate system of\nequilibrium that could easily be thrown out of balance -- by a change\nin weather\nor diet, for example -- and that then needed to be restored through active\nintervention. A disruption in the healthy body, in the worldview of patients\nand physicians, required a visible, often violent, physical response to\ntreatment in order to restore equilibrium. This theory underlay eighteenth and\nnineteenth-century regular medical practice, which emphasized heroic\nmeasures -- bleeding, blistering, purging, and puking -- in\nresponse to sickness.\nThe response to the blocking of the menses was part of this shared\nunderstanding of the body: women took drugs in order to make their menses\nregular and regarded the ensuing vomiting and evacuation as evidence of the\ndrugs' effective action. Restoring the menses was a domestic practice. The power of certain herbs to\nrestore menstruation was widely known. One colonial woman who feared pregnancy\nhad \"twice taken Savin; once boyled in milk and the other time strayned through\na Cloath.\" Savin, derived from juniper bushes, was the most popular\nabortifacient and easily acquired since junipers grew wild throughout the\ncountry. Other herbs used as abortifacients included pennyroyal, tansy, ergot,\nand seneca snakeroot. Slave women used cottonroot. Many of these useful plants\ncould be found in the woods or cultivated. in gardens, and women could refer to\nhome medical guides for recipes for \"bringing on the menses.\" Both of these concepts, blocked menses and quickening, must be taken seriously\nby late-twentieth-century observers. Blocked menses cannot be dismissed as an\nexcuse made by women who knew they were pregnant. Quickening was a moment\nrecognized by women and by law as a defining moment in human development. Once\nquickening occurred, women recognized a moral obligation to carry the fetus to\nterm. This age-old idea underpinned the practice of abortion in America. The\nlegal acceptance of induced miscarriages before quickening tacitly assumed that\nwomen had a basic right to bodily integrity. By the mid-eighteenth century, the most common means of inducing\nabortion -- by\ntaking drugs was commercialized. The availability of abortifacients was so\nwell-known that a common euphemism described their use. When Sarah Grosvenor, a\nConnecticut farm girl, confided to her sister in 1742 that she was \"taking the\ntrade,\" her sister understood. That Grosvenor successfully conveyed her meaning\nto her sister in three metaphoric words tells us a great deal about the world\nof mid-eighteenth-century New England. Many New Englanders, including these\nsisters, knew of the possibility of inducing an abortion by purchasing and\ningesting drugs. The need for a euphemism tells of the difficulty of speaking\nopenly about sex and reproductive control and of the need for secrecy. Yet it\nreveals an awareness that women could and did regulate their own fertility\nthrough abortion. Furthermore, abortifacients had become a profitable product\nsold by doctors, apothecaries, and other healers. The first statutes governing abortion in the United States, James Mohr has\nfound, were poison control measures designed to protect pregnant women like\nGrosvenor by controlling the sale of abortifacient drugs, which often killed\nthe women who took them. The proliferation of entrepreneurs who openly sold and\nadvertised abortifacients may have inspired this early legislation, passed in\nthe 1820s and 1830s. The 18 Illinois law, which prohibited the provision of\nabortifacients, was listed under \"poisoning.\" It is crucial to recognize what these early-nineteenth-century laws did not\ncover: they did not punish women for inducing abortions, and they did not\neliminate the concept of quickening. Even as poison control measures, they said\nnothing about growing the plants needed in one's own garden or mixing together\none's own home remedy in order to induce an abortion. The legal silence on\ndomestic practices suggests that the new laws were aimed at the\ncommercialization of this practice and, implicitly, retained to women the right\nto make their own decisions about their pregnancies before quickening. By the 1840s, the abortion business boomed. Despite the laws forbidding the\nsale of abortifacients, they were advertised in the popular press and could be\npurchased from physicians or pharmacists or through the mail. If drugs failed,\nwomen could go to a practitioner who specialized in performing instrumental\nabortions. Advertisements and newspaper exposes made it appear that what had\nbeen an occasional domestic practice had become a daily occurrence performed\nfor profit in northern cities. Madame Restell, for example, openly advertised\nand provided abortion services for thirty-five years. Restell began her\nabortion business in New York City in the late 1830s; by the mid-1840s, she had\noffices in Boston and Philadelphia and traveling agents who sold her \"Female\nMonthly Pills.\" Restell became the most infamous abortionist in the country,\nbut she was not the only abortionist. The clientele of these busy clinics were\nprimarily married, white, native-born Protestant women of the upper and middle\nclasses. In 1857, the newly organized AMA initiated a crusade to make abortion at every\nstage of pregnancy illegal. The antiabortion campaign grew in part, James Mohr\nhas shown, out of regular physicians' desire to win professional power, control\nmedical practice, and restrict their competitors, particularly Homeopaths and\nmidwives. \"Regular,\" or \"orthodox,\" physicians, practitioners of \"heroic\"\nmedicine, had come under attack in the 1820s and 1830s as elitist. They faced\ncompetition from a variety of practitioners from other medical sects,\ncollectively known as \"Irregulars.\" Through the 1870S, regular physicians\nacross the country worked for the passage of new criminal abortion laws. In\nsecuring criminal abortion laws, the Regulars won recognition of their\nparticular views as well as some state control over the practice of\nmedicine. Though professional issues underlay the medical campaign, gender, racial, and\nclass anxieties pushed the criminalization of abortion forward. The visible use\nof abortion by middle-class married women, in conjunction with other challenges\nto gender norms and changes in the social makeup of the nation, generated\nanxieties among American men of the same class. Birth rates among the Yankee\nclasses had declined by mid-century while immigrants poured into the country.\nAntiabortion activists pointed out that immigrant families, many of them\nCatholic, were larger and would soon outpopulate native-born white Yankees and\nthreaten their political power. Dr. Horatio R Storer, the leader of the medical\ncampaign against abortion, envisioned the spread of \"civilization\" west and\nsouth by native-born white Americans, not Mexicans, Chinese, Blacks, Indians,\nor Catholics. \"Shall\" these regions, he asked, \"be filled by our own children\nor by those of aliens? This is a question our women must answer; upon their\nloins depends the future destiny of the nation.\" Hostility to immigrants,\nCatholics, and people of color fueled this campaign to criminalize abortion.\nWhite male patriotism demanded that maternity be enforced among white\nProtestant women. The antiabortion campaign was antifeminist at its core. Women were condemned\nfor following \"fashion\" and for avoiding the self-sacrifice expected of\nmothers. \"The true wife,\" Storer declared, did not seek `'undue power in public\nlife, . . . undue control in domestic affairs, . . . [or] privileges not her\nown.\" The antiabortion campaign was a reactionary response to two important\nefforts of the nineteenth-century women's movements: the fight to admit women\ninto the regular medical profession and the battle to make men conform to a\nsingle standard of sexual behavior. The antiabortion campaign coincided with\nthe fight by male Regulars to keep women out of their medical schools,\nsocieties, and hospitals. Boston and Harvard University, Storer's hometown and\nalma mater, were key sites of struggle over women's place in medicine, and\nStorer was personally engaged in the battle against female physicians.\nAdvocates of women in medicine argued that women doctors would protect women\npatients from sexual violation. Regular male doctors degraded female physicians\nby accusing them, along with midwives, of performing abortions. The relative morality of men and women was of crucial importance to this\ncampaign. For the specialists, whose interest in the female reproductive system\nraised questions about their sexual morality, the antiabortion campaign was a\nway to proclaim their own high morality in contrast to their competitors, their\nfemale patients, and even the ministers who tolerated abortion. It was at the\nsame time a backlash against the women's movement's critique of male sexual\nbehavior and feminist claims to political power. Nineteenth-century feminists\nexpressed their anger with male sexual domination and promiscuity in a number\nof movements, including the campaigns against prostitution and slavery and the\nfight for temperance. All sections of the women's movement advocated \"voluntary\nmotherhood,\" a slogan that addressed both men's sexual violation of their wives\nand women's desire to control childbearing. Women saw themselves as morally\nsuperior and urged men to adopt a single standard  --  the female\nstandard of\nchastity until marriage, followed by monogamy and moderation. The campaign\nagainst abortion challenged this feminist analysis of men by condemning women\nfor having abortions. Indeed, Storer compared abortion to prostitution and, in\nso doing, called into question all claims made by middle-class\nnineteenth-century women on the basis of moral superiority. \"There is little\ndifference,\" he proclaimed, \"between the immorality\" of the man who visited\nprostitutes and the woman who aborted. The nineteenth-century women's movements\nnever defended abortion, but activist women and women doctors were blamed for\nthe practice of abortion nonetheless. The antiabortion campaign attempted to destroy the idea of quickening. As\nphysicians targeted quickening, they discredited women's experiences of\npregnancy and claimed pregnancy as medical terrain. \"Quickening,\" as Storer\ndescribed it, \"is in fact but a sensation.\" A sensation that had emotional,\nsocial, and legal meaning was thus denigrated. Quickening was based on women's\nown bodily sensations -- not on medical diagnosis. It made physicians, and\nobstetricians in particular, dependent on female self-diagnosis and judgment.\nQuickening could not be relied upon as an indicator of fetal life because,\nStorer argued, it did not occur at a standard moment. \"Many women never quicken\nat all,\" he joked about women's perceptions, \"though their children are born\nliving.\" Storer's propaganda aimed to erase the distinctions between earlier\nand later stages of pregnancy, thereby redefining the restoration of the\nmenses. What had previously been understood as a blockage and a restoration of\nthe menses prior to quickening was now associated with inducing a miscarriage\nafter quickening by labeling it abortion. Furthermore, Storer equated abortion\nwith infanticide. Regular medical men had entered the debate about sexual politics by attacking\nthe female practice of abortion as immoral, unwomanly, and unpatriotic. In\ngiving abortion new meaning, the Regulars provided a weapon that white,\nnative-born, male legislators could use against the women of their own class\nwho had been agitating for personal and political reform. Regular physicians\nwon passage of new criminal abortion laws because their campaign appealed to a\nset of fears of white, nativeborn, male elites about losing political power to\nCatholic immigrants and to women. Class privilege did not protect middle-class\nwhite women from public policy designed to control them. Although the\ncriminalization of abortion was aimed at middle-class white women, it affected\nwomen of every class and race. The new laws passed across the country between\n1860 and 1880 regarded abortion in an entirely different light from common law\nand the statutes regulating abortifacients. In general, the laws included two\ninnovations: they eliminated the common-law idea of quickening and prohibited\nabortion at any point in pregnancy. Some included punishment for the women who\nhad abortions. The \"Comstock Law\" passed in 1873 included abortion and birth\ncontrol in federal antiobscenity legislation; states and municipalities passed\nsimilar ordinances. The antiabortion laws made one exception: physicians could perform therapeutic\nabortions if pregnancy and childbirth threatened the woman's life. A bill\ncriminalizing abortion unless done for \" bona fide medical or surgical\npurposes\" passed the Illinois state legislature unanimously and was signed into\nlaw in 1867. A few years later, Illinois passed another law prohibiting the\nsale of abortifacients but made an exception for \"the written prescription of\nsome well known and respectable practicing physician.\" Physicians had won the\ncriminalization of abortion and retained to themselves alone the right to\ninduce abortions when they determined it necessary. Through the antiabortion campaign, doctors claimed scientific authority to\ndefine life and death. In so doing, they claimed the authority of religious\nleaders. In leading this moral crusade and thoroughly criticizing the\nministry's lack of interest in abortion, regular doctors set themselves above\nreligious leaders as well as above the general populace. The medical\nprofession's claim to moral purity and the authority of the clergy was a\nstepping-stone to greater social authority. Regular physicians won an important\nvictory when they persuaded the nation's states to criminalize abortion.\nPhysicians entered a new partnership with the state and won the power to set\nreproductive policy. In the process, women's perceptions of pregnancy were\ndelegitimated and women lost what had been a common-law right. Periodization: Changing Patterns of Illegal Abortion During the more than one hundred years that abortion was illegal in the United\nStates, the patterns; practice, policing, and politics of abortion all changed\nover time, though not always simultaneously. I trace the history along several\nlines at once, according to the location, practice, and availability of\nabortion as well as its regulation. Abortion was widely available throughout\nmuch of the era when abortion was a crime. Yet periods of tolerance were\npunctuated by moments of severe repression. At some points the changing\nstructure of medicine brought about crucial changes in the history of abortion;\nat others, changes in women's lives or the political and economic context came\nto the fore. In the nineteenth century, abortion came under attack at a moment when women\nwere claiming political power; in the twentieth century, it came under attack\nwhen they claimed sexual freedom. Abortion, like contraception, means that\nwomen can separate sex and procreation -- still a controversial notion.\nAntiabortion campaigns developed when women asserted sexual independence, as\nduring the Progressive Era and since the 1970s. When abortion was most firmly\nlinked to the needs of family rather than the freedoms of women, as during the\nDepression, it was most ignored by those who would suppress it. Periods of\nantiabortion activity mark moments of hostility to female independence. The epoch of illegal abortion may be broken down into four periods. The first\ncovers the time from the criminalization of abortion state-by-state,\naccomplished nationwide by 1880, to 1930. This period, covering fifty years, is\nheavily marked by continuity. As other historians have also found, the\nreproductive lives of most women and the day-to-day practice of most physicians\nchanged slowly. In this period, abortion was widely accepted and was practiced\nin women's homes and in the offices of physicians and midwives. The diversity\nof practitioners, the privacy of medical practice, and the autonomy of\nphysicians in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries made the\nwidespread medical practice of abortion possible. A crackdown on abortion\noccurred between 1890 and 1920 as specialists in obstetrics renewed the earlier\ncampaign against abortion, and the medical profession was drawn into the\nstate's enforcement system. The structural transformation that occurred during the 1930s, the second\nperiod, was crucial for the history of abortion. Abortion became more available\nand changed location. As the practice moved from private offices and homes to\nhospitals and clinics, abortion was consolidated in medical hands and became\nmore visible. The changes wrought by the Depression accelerated the pace of\nchange in the coming decades, particularly in the methods of enforcing the\ncriminal abortion laws. The third period was marked by increasing restrictions on abortion by state\nand medical authorities and intensifying demand for abortion from women of all\ngroups. This period begins in 1940, when the new methods of controlling\nabortion were first instituted, and continues through 1973, when they were\ndismantled. In reaction to the growing practice of abortion as well as apparent\nchanges in female gender and reproductive patterns, a backlash against abortion\ndeveloped. 1940 marks a dividing line as hospitals instituted new policies, and\npolice and prosecutors changed their tactics. The repression of abortion was\npart of the repression of political and personal deviance that took place in\nthe 1940s and 1950s. Yet even in this period, the practice of abortion expanded\nin new directions in response to relentless demand. The new repression of\nabortion, however, was devastating for women. A dual system of abortion,\ndivided by race and class, developed. During the postwar period, the\ncriminalization of abortion produced its harshest results. A new stage in the history of abortion, the movement to legalize it, overlaps\nwith the third period. The movement to decriminalize abortion began in the\nmid-1950s and arose out of the difficult experiences resulting from the\nrepression of abortion in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1950s, a handful of\nphysicians began to challenge the very abortion laws their profession had\nadvocated a century earlier. The progress of that challenge attests to the\ncontinuing power of the medical profession to make public policy regarding\nreproduction. As legal reform moved forward, a new feminist movement arose,\nwhich radically transformed the movement for legal change. When the women's\nmovement described abortion as an aspect of sexual freedom, they articulated a\nnew feminist meaning for abortion; when they demanded abortion as a right, they\nechoed generations of women. The structure of this book follows this periodization. The first half of the\nbook uncovers the history of abortion from the late nineteenth century through\nthe 1920s. Chapters 1 through 4 each cover different aspects of abortion, from\nwomen's lives to practice to politics to enforcement, during the first\nhalf-century of illegal abortion. The changes of the 1930S, both medical and\nsocial, precipitated other changes. The second half of the book traces the\nhistory of abortion in chronologically ordered chapters concluding with the\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions that ended the era of illegal abortion. Women's history of abortion needs to be examined both as a commonly felt need\nto control reproduction, arising from women's biological capacity to bear\nchildren and social relations that assign childbearing to women, and in terms\nof differences among women. This book differentiates among women by class, race\nand ethnic identity, and marital status. Though class did not absolutely\ndetermine access to or safety of abortion, class position helped define when a\nwoman felt she needed an abortion and affected the type available to her. In\ngeneral, urban women had greater access to abortion than rural women, though\nsome rural women located abortionists in their areas or traveled to cities for\nabortions. Race played a less obvious role in access to abortion, though the\ngrim statistics of the postwar period show the connection between\ndiscrimination and death. I have made a specific effort to locate sources\nrelated to African Americans in order to learn more about black women's use of\nabortion and how race shaped the history of abortion. Evidence concerning women\nof color is meager, however, until the 1930s, when medical and sociological\nstudies began separating their findings by race. Before then, contemporary\nobservers tended to focus their attention on the differences among many (white)\nforeign-born ethnic groups. This book integrates a national analysis of the history of abortion with a\nlocal study. The advantage of this approach is that it connects everyday life\nand local medical and legal practice to national policy. It examines that\nrelationship rather than assuming that all the public policy action takes place\non the federal level without reference to local and \"private\" events. I select\na major metropolis in order to uncover the nature of both abortion practices\nand police enforcement of the criminal abortion laws. Chicago, the second\nlargest city in the nation, is the focus of my local study. Chicago, the city\nin \"the heartland\" that has of ten served as a metaphor for the spirit of\nAmerica, was also known as an important medical center (the home of the AMA)\nand as a regional center for abortion. Trains brought European immigrants, men\nand women migrating from farms to the city, African Americans moving from the\nSouth to the North, all going to live and work in Chicago. The same trains\nbrought women looking for abortions. Directing my attention to one city enabled\nme to uncover the nitty-gritty details of the practice and regulation of\nabortion. Though much of my analysis of the history of abortion draws on Chicago as a\ncase study, sources verify that my findings hold true for other cities, large\nand small. Throughout I present national data and trends as well as regional\nones and take note of patterns elsewhere. The book moves back and forth from a\nnational overview of abortion practices and politics to a close look at events\nin Chicago. As medical practice became more standardized in hospitals, the\nstory becomes a more national one and key events take place in other cities:\nNew York, Detroit, Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington, D.C.,\nand elsewhere. This is primarily a study of abortion in urban areas, where\nabortion was concentrated. I comment occasionally on practices in rural areas,\nbut the history of reproductive control and abortion is likely to be somewhat\ndifferent there. Legal records, most notably lower-level court and criminal trial records, and\nmedical literature make up the foundation of my research. I have also surveyed\nother government documents, newspapers, popular periodicals, hospital records,\nand manuscript collections. Using these materials, I have delineated how\nmedical thinking and state regulation have changed over time. Yet this is more\nthan a study of prescriptive literature or policy. I have uncovered the\ncircumstances of hundreds of actual induced abortions and reconstructed\nchanging abortion practices. This study periodizes the history of abortion for\nthe first time. This book presents the lives of many women and their abortions in rich detail\nin order to convey the variety and intricacy of the situations that made\nabortion necessary for women. It is in the minutiae of women's lives that we\ncan discover why women had abortions and how they won sympathy from physicians\nwho belonged to a profession dedicated to fighting abortion. Abortion was a\nmoment in a woman's reproductive life. It cannot be separated from sexual\nrelations or reproduction as a whole. Women themselves did not separate them,\nnor should we, whether analyzing abortion in the past or present. This book\ndeepens our understanding of the female experience of reproduction and the\nconnections between sexuality, contraception, pregnancy, and childbirth. At its\nmost fundamental, a policy that restricts abortion is one that forces women\ninto maternity. Without contraceptives and abortion, most women in heterosexual\nrelationships will become pregnant and bear children, whether they want to or\nnot. When women sought abortions, they often revealed the texture of\nheterosexual relations and the rest of their lives. Many situations made\nenduring pregnancy unbearable to women. In using abortion, women rebelled\nagainst the law and asserted their sense that the decision to carry a pregnancy\nto term or to abort was theirs to make. A few expressed in words as well as in\naction the view that abortion was their right. The experiences of women's\nprivate lives and private practices over the course of one hundred years\naltered medical thinking and reshaped public policy. Despite the fact that\nwomen's abortion narratives are part of our own contemporary discourse, the\nstories told here have long been hidden. Copyright © 1996  by the Regents of the University of California.\n\nEven as the abortion statutes remained the same through this period, the\nmeaning of the law and the legality and illegality of abortion changed over\ntime. Law is not fixed, but fluid. The criminal abortion laws passed in every\nstate by T880 made exceptions for therapeutic abortions performed in order to\nsave a woman's life. Because the laws governing abortion did not precisely\ndefine what was criminal and what was not, this had to be worked out in\npractice, in policing, and in the courts. The complexity of defining \"legal\"\nand \"illegal\" abortions for medical practitioners and legal authorities alike,\nthe gray and ever-shifting nature of \"criminality,\" is an important theme in\nthis book. Nor was medical understanding of therapeutic abortion stable.\nMedicine too is interpretive and changing. Throughout the period of illegal\nabortion, physicians disagreed on the conditions that mandated a therapeutic\nabortion and on the methods: there was no consensus. Changes in medicine\ninfluenced legal definitions of crime; at the same time, the law shaped medical\nthinking and practice. The medical profession and the legal profession each\nlooked to the other to define the legality of abortion practices. Therapeutic\nabortion became increasingly important in the 1930s; by the 1960s the practice\n(and nonpractice) of therapeutic abortion was at the very heart of the campaign\nto reform and repeal the criminal abortion laws. The illegality of abortion has hidden the existence of an unarticulated,\nalternative, popular morality, which supported women who had abortions. This\npopular ethic contradicted the law, the official attitude of the medical\nprofession, and the teachings of some religions. Private discussions among\nfamily and friends, conversations between women and doctors, and the behavior\nof women (and the people who aided them) suggest that traditional ideas that\naccepted early abortions endured into the twentieth century. Furthermore,\nthrough the 1920s at least, working-class women did not make a distinction\nbetween contraceptives and abortion. What I call a popular morality that\naccepted abortion was almost never publicly expressed but was rooted in\npeople's daily lives. Americans have a long history of accepting abortion in\ncertain situations as a necessity and as a decision that, implicitly, belongs\nto women to make. This popular attitude made itself felt in the courts and in\ndoctors' offices: prosecutors found it difficult to convict abortionists\nbecause juries regularly nullified the law by acquitting abortionists,  and few\nphysicians escaped the pressure from women for abortions. Throughout the period\nof illegal abortion, women asserted their need for abortion and, in doing so,\nimplicitly asserted their sense of having a right to control their own\nreproduction. I am not suggesting a \"gap\" between people's beliefs and their ability to live\nup to them, but different, even oppositional, moral perspectives. The values\nexpressed by ordinary people deserve to be taken seriously rather than\ncategorized and dismissed as sinful or mistaken. Though some felt guilt about\nabortion and found ways to justify their behavior, others never held the\nofficial antiabortion views. Prescribed morality and popular morality may not\nbe identical. Analysis of women's practices and ideas -- popular\nbehavior and\nbelief -- rather than exclusive focus on the statements of male\ntheologians and\nphilosophers suggests that it is incorrect to conclude that hostility to\nabortion is \"almost an absolute value in history.\" The reverse may be more\naccurate. Although this book takes note of religious teachings and the religious\nbackground of women who had abortions, it does not focus on religious opinion.\nOrganized religion had little interest in abortion until it entered the public,\npolitical arena in the late 1950s and early 1960s. There was no reason to\nenergetically fight abortion when, for nearly a century, abortion was a crime\nand no social movement suggested otherwise. From the 1920s on, however, there\nwas much religious interest in, and division over, another method of\nreproductive control: contraception. Birth control became a topic of interest\nbecause a movement advocated women's right to reproductive control. Further, it\nis incorrect to assume that the Catholic Church has always organized against\nabortion or that all Catholics subscribe to the views of their church leaders.\nIndeed, many Catholics shared what I have described as a popular ethic\naccepting abortion. A good history of religion and reproductive control would\nexamine not only theology and sermons, but also the attitudes and actions of\nthe congregations, with particular attention to women. Women who had abortions did so within a context of illegality and religious\ndisapproval, but the prohibitions were ambiguous. Christian traditions had\ntabooed abortion since antiquity, but the acceptance of abortion in order to\nsave the life of a pregnant woman had a long tradition as well. Until the\nmid-nineteenth century, the Catholic Church implicitly accepted early abortions\nprior to ensoulment. Not until T869, at about the same time that abortion\nbecame politicized in this country, did the church condemn abortion; in 1895,\nit condemned therapeutic abortion. Protestant churches accepted abortion when\npregnancy threatened a woman's life, a view shared by the medical profession\nand written into the nation's laws. Jewish tradition clearly viewed the woman's\nlife as primary. The Mishnah, a code of ancient Jewish law that guided later\nrabbinic thought, required abortion when childbirth threatened a woman's life,\nfor \"her life takes precedence over its life.\" This study points to the importance of studying the social history of\nsexuality as well as the medical and legal discourse about it. These discourses\nregarding abortion are important because they introduced new meanings of\nabortion and shaped people's views (and fears) of abortion and sexuality. I\nanalyze the language women used to describe abortion and the production of\nstories about abortion in the press and in the courtroom. Yet exclusive\nattention to professional or even popular discourse about abortion would result\nin a distorted picture of that history. Medical discourse has convinced some\nscholars that physicians did not perform abortions in the period of illegal\nabortion, and most press coverage of abortion in the early twentieth century\ngives the misleading impression that abortion was universally condemned and\ngenerally fatal. These conclusions are not correct. Analysis of discourse alone\nwould miss the ongoing medical practice of abortion in total contradiction of\nofficial medical mores. As others have pointed out, Foucault's theory\nconcerning the production of sexuality through discourse ignores differences in\nthe power of individuals and social groups to enter and shape discourse. The\npublicly articulated and published discussion of abortion rarely included the\nvoices or perspectives of women who had abortions, except to provide shocking\nexamples of depraved womanhood. Women who had abortions did not intervene to\nexplain themselves, but instead, in other nonpublic arenas, made their\nperspectives known and acted to obtain a much-needed method for preventing\nbirths. More tolerant attitudes toward abortion, rooted in material\nexperiences, persisted in the face of a public discourse that denounced it. The\nhistory of sexuality and reproduction demands a combined analysis of ideas and\npractice. Common Law and the Criminalization of Abortion Abortion was not always a crime. During the eighteenth and early nineteenth\ncenturies, abortion of early pregnancy was legal under common law. Abortions\nwere illegal only after \"quickening,\" the point at which a pregnant woman could\nfeel the movements of the fetus (approximately the fourth month of pregnancy).\nThe common law's attitude toward pregnancy and abortion was based on an\nunderstanding of pregnancy and human development as a process rather than an\nabsolute moment. Indeed, the term abortion referred only to the miscarriages of\nlater pregnancies, after quickening. What we would now identify as an early\ninduced abortion was not called an abortion at all. If an early pregnancy\nended, it had \"slipp[ed] away,\" or the menses had been \"restored.\" At\nconception and the earliest stage of pregnancy before quickening, no one\nbelieved that a human life existed; not even the Catholic Church took this\nview. Rather, the popular ethic regarding abortion and common law were grounded\nin the female experience of their own bodies. Colonial and early-nineteenth-century women, historians have learned,\nperceived conception as the \"blocking\" or \"obstructing\" of menstruation, which\nrequired attention. The cessation of the menses indicated a worrisome imbalance\nin the body and the need to bring the body back into balance by restoring the\nflow. This idea of menstruation corresponded with medical and popular\nunderstanding of sickness and health. The body was a delicate system of\nequilibrium that could easily be thrown out of balance -- by a change\nin weather\nor diet, for example -- and that then needed to be restored through active\nintervention. A disruption in the healthy body, in the worldview of patients\nand physicians, required a visible, often violent, physical response to\ntreatment in order to restore equilibrium. This theory underlay eighteenth and\nnineteenth-century regular medical practice, which emphasized heroic\nmeasures -- bleeding, blistering, purging, and puking -- in\nresponse to sickness.\nThe response to the blocking of the menses was part of this shared\nunderstanding of the body: women took drugs in order to make their menses\nregular and regarded the ensuing vomiting and evacuation as evidence of the\ndrugs' effective action. Restoring the menses was a domestic practice. The power of certain herbs to\nrestore menstruation was widely known. One colonial woman who feared pregnancy\nhad \"twice taken Savin; once boyled in milk and the other time strayned through\na Cloath.\" Savin, derived from juniper bushes, was the most popular\nabortifacient and easily acquired since junipers grew wild throughout the\ncountry. Other herbs used as abortifacients included pennyroyal, tansy, ergot,\nand seneca snakeroot. Slave women used cottonroot. Many of these useful plants\ncould be found in the woods or cultivated. in gardens, and women could refer to\nhome medical guides for recipes for \"bringing on the menses.\" Both of these concepts, blocked menses and quickening, must be taken seriously\nby late-twentieth-century observers. Blocked menses cannot be dismissed as an\nexcuse made by women who knew they were pregnant. Quickening was a moment\nrecognized by women and by law as a defining moment in human development. Once\nquickening occurred, women recognized a moral obligation to carry the fetus to\nterm. This age-old idea underpinned the practice of abortion in America. The\nlegal acceptance of induced miscarriages before quickening tacitly assumed that\nwomen had a basic right to bodily integrity. By the mid-eighteenth century, the most common means of inducing\nabortion -- by\ntaking drugs was commercialized. The availability of abortifacients was so\nwell-known that a common euphemism described their use. When Sarah Grosvenor, a\nConnecticut farm girl, confided to her sister in 1742 that she was \"taking the\ntrade,\" her sister understood. That Grosvenor successfully conveyed her meaning\nto her sister in three metaphoric words tells us a great deal about the world\nof mid-eighteenth-century New England. Many New Englanders, including these\nsisters, knew of the possibility of inducing an abortion by purchasing and\ningesting drugs. The need for a euphemism tells of the difficulty of speaking\nopenly about sex and reproductive control and of the need for secrecy. Yet it\nreveals an awareness that women could and did regulate their own fertility\nthrough abortion. Furthermore, abortifacients had become a profitable product\nsold by doctors, apothecaries, and other healers. The first statutes governing abortion in the United States, James Mohr has\nfound, were poison control measures designed to protect pregnant women like\nGrosvenor by controlling the sale of abortifacient drugs, which often killed\nthe women who took them. The proliferation of entrepreneurs who openly sold and\nadvertised abortifacients may have inspired this early legislation, passed in\nthe 1820s and 1830s. The 18 Illinois law, which prohibited the provision of\nabortifacients, was listed under \"poisoning.\" It is crucial to recognize what these early-nineteenth-century laws did not\ncover: they did not punish women for inducing abortions, and they did not\neliminate the concept of quickening. Even as poison control measures, they said\nnothing about growing the plants needed in one's own garden or mixing together\none's own home remedy in order to induce an abortion. The legal silence on\ndomestic practices suggests that the new laws were aimed at the\ncommercialization of this practice and, implicitly, retained to women the right\nto make their own decisions about their pregnancies before quickening. By the 1840s, the abortion business boomed. Despite the laws forbidding the\nsale of abortifacients, they were advertised in the popular press and could be\npurchased from physicians or pharmacists or through the mail. If drugs failed,\nwomen could go to a practitioner who specialized in performing instrumental\nabortions. Advertisements and newspaper exposes made it appear that what had\nbeen an occasional domestic practice had become a daily occurrence performed\nfor profit in northern cities. Madame Restell, for example, openly advertised\nand provided abortion services for thirty-five years. Restell began her\nabortion business in New York City in the late 1830s; by the mid-1840s, she had\noffices in Boston and Philadelphia and traveling agents who sold her \"Female\nMonthly Pills.\" Restell became the most infamous abortionist in the country,\nbut she was not the only abortionist. The clientele of these busy clinics were\nprimarily married, white, native-born Protestant women of the upper and middle\nclasses. In 1857, the newly organized AMA initiated a crusade to make abortion at every\nstage of pregnancy illegal. The antiabortion campaign grew in part, James Mohr\nhas shown, out of regular physicians' desire to win professional power, control\nmedical practice, and restrict their competitors, particularly Homeopaths and\nmidwives. \"Regular,\" or \"orthodox,\" physicians, practitioners of \"heroic\"\nmedicine, had come under attack in the 1820s and 1830s as elitist. They faced\ncompetition from a variety of practitioners from other medical sects,\ncollectively known as \"Irregulars.\" Through the 1870S, regular physicians\nacross the country worked for the passage of new criminal abortion laws. In\nsecuring criminal abortion laws, the Regulars won recognition of their\nparticular views as well as some state control over the practice of\nmedicine. Though professional issues underlay the medical campaign, gender, racial, and\nclass anxieties pushed the criminalization of abortion forward. The visible use\nof abortion by middle-class married women, in conjunction with other challenges\nto gender norms and changes in the social makeup of the nation, generated\nanxieties among American men of the same class. Birth rates among the Yankee\nclasses had declined by mid-century while immigrants poured into the country.\nAntiabortion activists pointed out that immigrant families, many of them\nCatholic, were larger and would soon outpopulate native-born white Yankees and\nthreaten their political power. Dr. Horatio R Storer, the leader of the medical\ncampaign against abortion, envisioned the spread of \"civilization\" west and\nsouth by native-born white Americans, not Mexicans, Chinese, Blacks, Indians,\nor Catholics. \"Shall\" these regions, he asked, \"be filled by our own children\nor by those of aliens? This is a question our women must answer; upon their\nloins depends the future destiny of the nation.\" Hostility to immigrants,\nCatholics, and people of color fueled this campaign to criminalize abortion.\nWhite male patriotism demanded that maternity be enforced among white\nProtestant women. The antiabortion campaign was antifeminist at its core. Women were condemned\nfor following \"fashion\" and for avoiding the self-sacrifice expected of\nmothers. \"The true wife,\" Storer declared, did not seek `'undue power in public\nlife, . . . undue control in domestic affairs, . . . [or] privileges not her\nown.\" The antiabortion campaign was a reactionary response to two important\nefforts of the nineteenth-century women's movements: the fight to admit women\ninto the regular medical profession and the battle to make men conform to a\nsingle standard of sexual behavior. The antiabortion campaign coincided with\nthe fight by male Regulars to keep women out of their medical schools,\nsocieties, and hospitals. Boston and Harvard University, Storer's hometown and\nalma mater, were key sites of struggle over women's place in medicine, and\nStorer was personally engaged in the battle against female physicians.\nAdvocates of women in medicine argued that women doctors would protect women\npatients from sexual violation. Regular male doctors degraded female physicians\nby accusing them, along with midwives, of performing abortions. The relative morality of men and women was of crucial importance to this\ncampaign. For the specialists, whose interest in the female reproductive system\nraised questions about their sexual morality, the antiabortion campaign was a\nway to proclaim their own high morality in contrast to their competitors, their\nfemale patients, and even the ministers who tolerated abortion. It was at the\nsame time a backlash against the women's movement's critique of male sexual\nbehavior and feminist claims to political power. Nineteenth-century feminists\nexpressed their anger with male sexual domination and promiscuity in a number\nof movements, including the campaigns against prostitution and slavery and the\nfight for temperance. All sections of the women's movement advocated \"voluntary\nmotherhood,\" a slogan that addressed both men's sexual violation of their wives\nand women's desire to control childbearing. Women saw themselves as morally\nsuperior and urged men to adopt a single standard  --  the female\nstandard of\nchastity until marriage, followed by monogamy and moderation. The campaign\nagainst abortion challenged this feminist analysis of men by condemning women\nfor having abortions. Indeed, Storer compared abortion to prostitution and, in\nso doing, called into question all claims made by middle-class\nnineteenth-century women on the basis of moral superiority. \"There is little\ndifference,\" he proclaimed, \"between the immorality\" of the man who visited\nprostitutes and the woman who aborted. The nineteenth-century women's movements\nnever defended abortion, but activist women and women doctors were blamed for\nthe practice of abortion nonetheless. The antiabortion campaign attempted to destroy the idea of quickening. As\nphysicians targeted quickening, they discredited women's experiences of\npregnancy and claimed pregnancy as medical terrain. \"Quickening,\" as Storer\ndescribed it, \"is in fact but a sensation.\" A sensation that had emotional,\nsocial, and legal meaning was thus denigrated. Quickening was based on women's\nown bodily sensations -- not on medical diagnosis. It made physicians, and\nobstetricians in particular, dependent on female self-diagnosis and judgment.\nQuickening could not be relied upon as an indicator of fetal life because,\nStorer argued, it did not occur at a standard moment. \"Many women never quicken\nat all,\" he joked about women's perceptions, \"though their children are born\nliving.\" Storer's propaganda aimed to erase the distinctions between earlier\nand later stages of pregnancy, thereby redefining the restoration of the\nmenses. What had previously been understood as a blockage and a restoration of\nthe menses prior to quickening was now associated with inducing a miscarriage\nafter quickening by labeling it abortion. Furthermore, Storer equated abortion\nwith infanticide. Regular medical men had entered the debate about sexual politics by attacking\nthe female practice of abortion as immoral, unwomanly, and unpatriotic. In\ngiving abortion new meaning, the Regulars provided a weapon that white,\nnative-born, male legislators could use against the women of their own class\nwho had been agitating for personal and political reform. Regular physicians\nwon passage of new criminal abortion laws because their campaign appealed to a\nset of fears of white, nativeborn, male elites about losing political power to\nCatholic immigrants and to women. Class privilege did not protect middle-class\nwhite women from public policy designed to control them. Although the\ncriminalization of abortion was aimed at middle-class white women, it affected\nwomen of every class and race. The new laws passed across the country between\n1860 and 1880 regarded abortion in an entirely different light from common law\nand the statutes regulating abortifacients. In general, the laws included two\ninnovations: they eliminated the common-law idea of quickening and prohibited\nabortion at any point in pregnancy. Some included punishment for the women who\nhad abortions. The \"Comstock Law\" passed in 1873 included abortion and birth\ncontrol in federal antiobscenity legislation; states and municipalities passed\nsimilar ordinances. The antiabortion laws made one exception: physicians could perform therapeutic\nabortions if pregnancy and childbirth threatened the woman's life. A bill\ncriminalizing abortion unless done for \" bona fide medical or surgical\npurposes\" passed the Illinois state legislature unanimously and was signed into\nlaw in 1867. A few years later, Illinois passed another law prohibiting the\nsale of abortifacients but made an exception for \"the written prescription of\nsome well known and respectable practicing physician.\" Physicians had won the\ncriminalization of abortion and retained to themselves alone the right to\ninduce abortions when they determined it necessary. Through the antiabortion campaign, doctors claimed scientific authority to\ndefine life and death. In so doing, they claimed the authority of religious\nleaders. In leading this moral crusade and thoroughly criticizing the\nministry's lack of interest in abortion, regular doctors set themselves above\nreligious leaders as well as above the general populace. The medical\nprofession's claim to moral purity and the authority of the clergy was a\nstepping-stone to greater social authority. Regular physicians won an important\nvictory when they persuaded the nation's states to criminalize abortion.\nPhysicians entered a new partnership with the state and won the power to set\nreproductive policy. In the process, women's perceptions of pregnancy were\ndelegitimated and women lost what had been a common-law right. Periodization: Changing Patterns of Illegal Abortion During the more than one hundred years that abortion was illegal in the United\nStates, the patterns; practice, policing, and politics of abortion all changed\nover time, though not always simultaneously. I trace the history along several\nlines at once, according to the location, practice, and availability of\nabortion as well as its regulation. Abortion was widely available throughout\nmuch of the era when abortion was a crime. Yet periods of tolerance were\npunctuated by moments of severe repression. At some points the changing\nstructure of medicine brought about crucial changes in the history of abortion;\nat others, changes in women's lives or the political and economic context came\nto the fore. In the nineteenth century, abortion came under attack at a moment when women\nwere claiming political power; in the twentieth century, it came under attack\nwhen they claimed sexual freedom. Abortion, like contraception, means that\nwomen can separate sex and procreation -- still a controversial notion.\nAntiabortion campaigns developed when women asserted sexual independence, as\nduring the Progressive Era and since the 1970s. When abortion was most firmly\nlinked to the needs of family rather than the freedoms of women, as during the\nDepression, it was most ignored by those who would suppress it. Periods of\nantiabortion activity mark moments of hostility to female independence. The epoch of illegal abortion may be broken down into four periods. The first\ncovers the time from the criminalization of abortion state-by-state,\naccomplished nationwide by 1880, to 1930. This period, covering fifty years, is\nheavily marked by continuity. As other historians have also found, the\nreproductive lives of most women and the day-to-day practice of most physicians\nchanged slowly. In this period, abortion was widely accepted and was practiced\nin women's homes and in the offices of physicians and midwives. The diversity\nof practitioners, the privacy of medical practice, and the autonomy of\nphysicians in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries made the\nwidespread medical practice of abortion possible. A crackdown on abortion\noccurred between 1890 and 1920 as specialists in obstetrics renewed the earlier\ncampaign against abortion, and the medical profession was drawn into the\nstate's enforcement system. The structural transformation that occurred during the 1930s, the second\nperiod, was crucial for the history of abortion. Abortion became more available\nand changed location. As the practice moved from private offices and homes to\nhospitals and clinics, abortion was consolidated in medical hands and became\nmore visible. The changes wrought by the Depression accelerated the pace of\nchange in the coming decades, particularly in the methods of enforcing the\ncriminal abortion laws. The third period was marked by increasing restrictions on abortion by state\nand medical authorities and intensifying demand for abortion from women of all\ngroups. This period begins in 1940, when the new methods of controlling\nabortion were first instituted, and continues through 1973, when they were\ndismantled. In reaction to the growing practice of abortion as well as apparent\nchanges in female gender and reproductive patterns, a backlash against abortion\ndeveloped. 1940 marks a dividing line as hospitals instituted new policies, and\npolice and prosecutors changed their tactics. The repression of abortion was\npart of the repression of political and personal deviance that took place in\nthe 1940s and 1950s. Yet even in this period, the practice of abortion expanded\nin new directions in response to relentless demand. The new repression of\nabortion, however, was devastating for women. A dual system of abortion,\ndivided by race and class, developed. During the postwar period, the\ncriminalization of abortion produced its harshest results. A new stage in the history of abortion, the movement to legalize it, overlaps\nwith the third period. The movement to decriminalize abortion began in the\nmid-1950s and arose out of the difficult experiences resulting from the\nrepression of abortion in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1950s, a handful of\nphysicians began to challenge the very abortion laws their profession had\nadvocated a century earlier. The progress of that challenge attests to the\ncontinuing power of the medical profession to make public policy regarding\nreproduction. As legal reform moved forward, a new feminist movement arose,\nwhich radically transformed the movement for legal change. When the women's\nmovement described abortion as an aspect of sexual freedom, they articulated a\nnew feminist meaning for abortion; when they demanded abortion as a right, they\nechoed generations of women. The structure of this book follows this periodization. The first half of the\nbook uncovers the history of abortion from the late nineteenth century through\nthe 1920s. Chapters 1 through 4 each cover different aspects of abortion, from\nwomen's lives to practice to politics to enforcement, during the first\nhalf-century of illegal abortion. The changes of the 1930S, both medical and\nsocial, precipitated other changes. The second half of the book traces the\nhistory of abortion in chronologically ordered chapters concluding with the\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions that ended the era of illegal abortion. Women's history of abortion needs to be examined both as a commonly felt need\nto control reproduction, arising from women's biological capacity to bear\nchildren and social relations that assign childbearing to women, and in terms\nof differences among women. This book differentiates among women by class, race\nand ethnic identity, and marital status. Though class did not absolutely\ndetermine access to or safety of abortion, class position helped define when a\nwoman felt she needed an abortion and affected the type available to her. In\ngeneral, urban women had greater access to abortion than rural women, though\nsome rural women located abortionists in their areas or traveled to cities for\nabortions. Race played a less obvious role in access to abortion, though the\ngrim statistics of the postwar period show the connection between\ndiscrimination and death. I have made a specific effort to locate sources\nrelated to African Americans in order to learn more about black women's use of\nabortion and how race shaped the history of abortion. Evidence concerning women\nof color is meager, however, until the 1930s, when medical and sociological\nstudies began separating their findings by race. Before then, contemporary\nobservers tended to focus their attention on the differences among many (white)\nforeign-born ethnic groups. This book integrates a national analysis of the history of abortion with a\nlocal study. The advantage of this approach is that it connects everyday life\nand local medical and legal practice to national policy. It examines that\nrelationship rather than assuming that all the public policy action takes place\non the federal level without reference to local and \"private\" events. I select\na major metropolis in order to uncover the nature of both abortion practices\nand police enforcement of the criminal abortion laws. Chicago, the second\nlargest city in the nation, is the focus of my local study. Chicago, the city\nin \"the heartland\" that has of ten served as a metaphor for the spirit of\nAmerica, was also known as an important medical center (the home of the AMA)\nand as a regional center for abortion. Trains brought European immigrants, men\nand women migrating from farms to the city, African Americans moving from the\nSouth to the North, all going to live and work in Chicago. The same trains\nbrought women looking for abortions. Directing my attention to one city enabled\nme to uncover the nitty-gritty details of the practice and regulation of\nabortion. Though much of my analysis of the history of abortion draws on Chicago as a\ncase study, sources verify that my findings hold true for other cities, large\nand small. Throughout I present national data and trends as well as regional\nones and take note of patterns elsewhere. The book moves back and forth from a\nnational overview of abortion practices and politics to a close look at events\nin Chicago. As medical practice became more standardized in hospitals, the\nstory becomes a more national one and key events take place in other cities:\nNew York, Detroit, Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington, D.C.,\nand elsewhere. This is primarily a study of abortion in urban areas, where\nabortion was concentrated. I comment occasionally on practices in rural areas,\nbut the history of reproductive control and abortion is likely to be somewhat\ndifferent there. Legal records, most notably lower-level court and criminal trial records, and\nmedical literature make up the foundation of my research. I have also surveyed\nother government documents, newspapers, popular periodicals, hospital records,\nand manuscript collections. Using these materials, I have delineated how\nmedical thinking and state regulation have changed over time. Yet this is more\nthan a study of prescriptive literature or policy. I have uncovered the\ncircumstances of hundreds of actual induced abortions and reconstructed\nchanging abortion practices. This study periodizes the history of abortion for\nthe first time. This book presents the lives of many women and their abortions in rich detail\nin order to convey the variety and intricacy of the situations that made\nabortion necessary for women. It is in the minutiae of women's lives that we\ncan discover why women had abortions and how they won sympathy from physicians\nwho belonged to a profession dedicated to fighting abortion. Abortion was a\nmoment in a woman's reproductive life. It cannot be separated from sexual\nrelations or reproduction as a whole. Women themselves did not separate them,\nnor should we, whether analyzing abortion in the past or present. This book\ndeepens our understanding of the female experience of reproduction and the\nconnections between sexuality, contraception, pregnancy, and childbirth. At its\nmost fundamental, a policy that restricts abortion is one that forces women\ninto maternity. Without contraceptives and abortion, most women in heterosexual\nrelationships will become pregnant and bear children, whether they want to or\nnot. When women sought abortions, they often revealed the texture of\nheterosexual relations and the rest of their lives. Many situations made\nenduring pregnancy unbearable to women. In using abortion, women rebelled\nagainst the law and asserted their sense that the decision to carry a pregnancy\nto term or to abort was theirs to make. A few expressed in words as well as in\naction the view that abortion was their right. The experiences of women's\nprivate lives and private practices over the course of one hundred years\naltered medical thinking and reshaped public policy. Despite the fact that\nwomen's abortion narratives are part of our own contemporary discourse, the\nstories told here have long been hidden. Copyright © 1996  by the Regents of the University of California.\n\nThe illegality of abortion has hidden the existence of an unarticulated,\nalternative, popular morality, which supported women who had abortions. This\npopular ethic contradicted the law, the official attitude of the medical\nprofession, and the teachings of some religions. Private discussions among\nfamily and friends, conversations between women and doctors, and the behavior\nof women (and the people who aided them) suggest that traditional ideas that\naccepted early abortions endured into the twentieth century. Furthermore,\nthrough the 1920s at least, working-class women did not make a distinction\nbetween contraceptives and abortion. What I call a popular morality that\naccepted abortion was almost never publicly expressed but was rooted in\npeople's daily lives. Americans have a long history of accepting abortion in\ncertain situations as a necessity and as a decision that, implicitly, belongs\nto women to make. This popular attitude made itself felt in the courts and in\ndoctors' offices: prosecutors found it difficult to convict abortionists\nbecause juries regularly nullified the law by acquitting abortionists,  and few\nphysicians escaped the pressure from women for abortions. Throughout the period\nof illegal abortion, women asserted their need for abortion and, in doing so,\nimplicitly asserted their sense of having a right to control their own\nreproduction. I am not suggesting a \"gap\" between people's beliefs and their ability to live\nup to them, but different, even oppositional, moral perspectives. The values\nexpressed by ordinary people deserve to be taken seriously rather than\ncategorized and dismissed as sinful or mistaken. Though some felt guilt about\nabortion and found ways to justify their behavior, others never held the\nofficial antiabortion views. Prescribed morality and popular morality may not\nbe identical. Analysis of women's practices and ideas -- popular\nbehavior and\nbelief -- rather than exclusive focus on the statements of male\ntheologians and\nphilosophers suggests that it is incorrect to conclude that hostility to\nabortion is \"almost an absolute value in history.\" The reverse may be more\naccurate. Although this book takes note of religious teachings and the religious\nbackground of women who had abortions, it does not focus on religious opinion.\nOrganized religion had little interest in abortion until it entered the public,\npolitical arena in the late 1950s and early 1960s. There was no reason to\nenergetically fight abortion when, for nearly a century, abortion was a crime\nand no social movement suggested otherwise. From the 1920s on, however, there\nwas much religious interest in, and division over, another method of\nreproductive control: contraception. Birth control became a topic of interest\nbecause a movement advocated women's right to reproductive control. Further, it\nis incorrect to assume that the Catholic Church has always organized against\nabortion or that all Catholics subscribe to the views of their church leaders.\nIndeed, many Catholics shared what I have described as a popular ethic\naccepting abortion. A good history of religion and reproductive control would\nexamine not only theology and sermons, but also the attitudes and actions of\nthe congregations, with particular attention to women. Women who had abortions did so within a context of illegality and religious\ndisapproval, but the prohibitions were ambiguous. Christian traditions had\ntabooed abortion since antiquity, but the acceptance of abortion in order to\nsave the life of a pregnant woman had a long tradition as well. Until the\nmid-nineteenth century, the Catholic Church implicitly accepted early abortions\nprior to ensoulment. Not until T869, at about the same time that abortion\nbecame politicized in this country, did the church condemn abortion; in 1895,\nit condemned therapeutic abortion. Protestant churches accepted abortion when\npregnancy threatened a woman's life, a view shared by the medical profession\nand written into the nation's laws. Jewish tradition clearly viewed the woman's\nlife as primary. The Mishnah, a code of ancient Jewish law that guided later\nrabbinic thought, required abortion when childbirth threatened a woman's life,\nfor \"her life takes precedence over its life.\" This study points to the importance of studying the social history of\nsexuality as well as the medical and legal discourse about it. These discourses\nregarding abortion are important because they introduced new meanings of\nabortion and shaped people's views (and fears) of abortion and sexuality. I\nanalyze the language women used to describe abortion and the production of\nstories about abortion in the press and in the courtroom. Yet exclusive\nattention to professional or even popular discourse about abortion would result\nin a distorted picture of that history. Medical discourse has convinced some\nscholars that physicians did not perform abortions in the period of illegal\nabortion, and most press coverage of abortion in the early twentieth century\ngives the misleading impression that abortion was universally condemned and\ngenerally fatal. These conclusions are not correct. Analysis of discourse alone\nwould miss the ongoing medical practice of abortion in total contradiction of\nofficial medical mores. As others have pointed out, Foucault's theory\nconcerning the production of sexuality through discourse ignores differences in\nthe power of individuals and social groups to enter and shape discourse. The\npublicly articulated and published discussion of abortion rarely included the\nvoices or perspectives of women who had abortions, except to provide shocking\nexamples of depraved womanhood. Women who had abortions did not intervene to\nexplain themselves, but instead, in other nonpublic arenas, made their\nperspectives known and acted to obtain a much-needed method for preventing\nbirths. More tolerant attitudes toward abortion, rooted in material\nexperiences, persisted in the face of a public discourse that denounced it. The\nhistory of sexuality and reproduction demands a combined analysis of ideas and\npractice. Common Law and the Criminalization of Abortion Abortion was not always a crime. During the eighteenth and early nineteenth\ncenturies, abortion of early pregnancy was legal under common law. Abortions\nwere illegal only after \"quickening,\" the point at which a pregnant woman could\nfeel the movements of the fetus (approximately the fourth month of pregnancy).\nThe common law's attitude toward pregnancy and abortion was based on an\nunderstanding of pregnancy and human development as a process rather than an\nabsolute moment. Indeed, the term abortion referred only to the miscarriages of\nlater pregnancies, after quickening. What we would now identify as an early\ninduced abortion was not called an abortion at all. If an early pregnancy\nended, it had \"slipp[ed] away,\" or the menses had been \"restored.\" At\nconception and the earliest stage of pregnancy before quickening, no one\nbelieved that a human life existed; not even the Catholic Church took this\nview. Rather, the popular ethic regarding abortion and common law were grounded\nin the female experience of their own bodies. Colonial and early-nineteenth-century women, historians have learned,\nperceived conception as the \"blocking\" or \"obstructing\" of menstruation, which\nrequired attention. The cessation of the menses indicated a worrisome imbalance\nin the body and the need to bring the body back into balance by restoring the\nflow. This idea of menstruation corresponded with medical and popular\nunderstanding of sickness and health. The body was a delicate system of\nequilibrium that could easily be thrown out of balance -- by a change\nin weather\nor diet, for example -- and that then needed to be restored through active\nintervention. A disruption in the healthy body, in the worldview of patients\nand physicians, required a visible, often violent, physical response to\ntreatment in order to restore equilibrium. This theory underlay eighteenth and\nnineteenth-century regular medical practice, which emphasized heroic\nmeasures -- bleeding, blistering, purging, and puking -- in\nresponse to sickness.\nThe response to the blocking of the menses was part of this shared\nunderstanding of the body: women took drugs in order to make their menses\nregular and regarded the ensuing vomiting and evacuation as evidence of the\ndrugs' effective action. Restoring the menses was a domestic practice. The power of certain herbs to\nrestore menstruation was widely known. One colonial woman who feared pregnancy\nhad \"twice taken Savin; once boyled in milk and the other time strayned through\na Cloath.\" Savin, derived from juniper bushes, was the most popular\nabortifacient and easily acquired since junipers grew wild throughout the\ncountry. Other herbs used as abortifacients included pennyroyal, tansy, ergot,\nand seneca snakeroot. Slave women used cottonroot. Many of these useful plants\ncould be found in the woods or cultivated. in gardens, and women could refer to\nhome medical guides for recipes for \"bringing on the menses.\" Both of these concepts, blocked menses and quickening, must be taken seriously\nby late-twentieth-century observers. Blocked menses cannot be dismissed as an\nexcuse made by women who knew they were pregnant. Quickening was a moment\nrecognized by women and by law as a defining moment in human development. Once\nquickening occurred, women recognized a moral obligation to carry the fetus to\nterm. This age-old idea underpinned the practice of abortion in America. The\nlegal acceptance of induced miscarriages before quickening tacitly assumed that\nwomen had a basic right to bodily integrity. By the mid-eighteenth century, the most common means of inducing\nabortion -- by\ntaking drugs was commercialized. The availability of abortifacients was so\nwell-known that a common euphemism described their use. When Sarah Grosvenor, a\nConnecticut farm girl, confided to her sister in 1742 that she was \"taking the\ntrade,\" her sister understood. That Grosvenor successfully conveyed her meaning\nto her sister in three metaphoric words tells us a great deal about the world\nof mid-eighteenth-century New England. Many New Englanders, including these\nsisters, knew of the possibility of inducing an abortion by purchasing and\ningesting drugs. The need for a euphemism tells of the difficulty of speaking\nopenly about sex and reproductive control and of the need for secrecy. Yet it\nreveals an awareness that women could and did regulate their own fertility\nthrough abortion. Furthermore, abortifacients had become a profitable product\nsold by doctors, apothecaries, and other healers. The first statutes governing abortion in the United States, James Mohr has\nfound, were poison control measures designed to protect pregnant women like\nGrosvenor by controlling the sale of abortifacient drugs, which often killed\nthe women who took them. The proliferation of entrepreneurs who openly sold and\nadvertised abortifacients may have inspired this early legislation, passed in\nthe 1820s and 1830s. The 18 Illinois law, which prohibited the provision of\nabortifacients, was listed under \"poisoning.\" It is crucial to recognize what these early-nineteenth-century laws did not\ncover: they did not punish women for inducing abortions, and they did not\neliminate the concept of quickening. Even as poison control measures, they said\nnothing about growing the plants needed in one's own garden or mixing together\none's own home remedy in order to induce an abortion. The legal silence on\ndomestic practices suggests that the new laws were aimed at the\ncommercialization of this practice and, implicitly, retained to women the right\nto make their own decisions about their pregnancies before quickening. By the 1840s, the abortion business boomed. Despite the laws forbidding the\nsale of abortifacients, they were advertised in the popular press and could be\npurchased from physicians or pharmacists or through the mail. If drugs failed,\nwomen could go to a practitioner who specialized in performing instrumental\nabortions. Advertisements and newspaper exposes made it appear that what had\nbeen an occasional domestic practice had become a daily occurrence performed\nfor profit in northern cities. Madame Restell, for example, openly advertised\nand provided abortion services for thirty-five years. Restell began her\nabortion business in New York City in the late 1830s; by the mid-1840s, she had\noffices in Boston and Philadelphia and traveling agents who sold her \"Female\nMonthly Pills.\" Restell became the most infamous abortionist in the country,\nbut she was not the only abortionist. The clientele of these busy clinics were\nprimarily married, white, native-born Protestant women of the upper and middle\nclasses. In 1857, the newly organized AMA initiated a crusade to make abortion at every\nstage of pregnancy illegal. The antiabortion campaign grew in part, James Mohr\nhas shown, out of regular physicians' desire to win professional power, control\nmedical practice, and restrict their competitors, particularly Homeopaths and\nmidwives. \"Regular,\" or \"orthodox,\" physicians, practitioners of \"heroic\"\nmedicine, had come under attack in the 1820s and 1830s as elitist. They faced\ncompetition from a variety of practitioners from other medical sects,\ncollectively known as \"Irregulars.\" Through the 1870S, regular physicians\nacross the country worked for the passage of new criminal abortion laws. In\nsecuring criminal abortion laws, the Regulars won recognition of their\nparticular views as well as some state control over the practice of\nmedicine. Though professional issues underlay the medical campaign, gender, racial, and\nclass anxieties pushed the criminalization of abortion forward. The visible use\nof abortion by middle-class married women, in conjunction with other challenges\nto gender norms and changes in the social makeup of the nation, generated\nanxieties among American men of the same class. Birth rates among the Yankee\nclasses had declined by mid-century while immigrants poured into the country.\nAntiabortion activists pointed out that immigrant families, many of them\nCatholic, were larger and would soon outpopulate native-born white Yankees and\nthreaten their political power. Dr. Horatio R Storer, the leader of the medical\ncampaign against abortion, envisioned the spread of \"civilization\" west and\nsouth by native-born white Americans, not Mexicans, Chinese, Blacks, Indians,\nor Catholics. \"Shall\" these regions, he asked, \"be filled by our own children\nor by those of aliens? This is a question our women must answer; upon their\nloins depends the future destiny of the nation.\" Hostility to immigrants,\nCatholics, and people of color fueled this campaign to criminalize abortion.\nWhite male patriotism demanded that maternity be enforced among white\nProtestant women. The antiabortion campaign was antifeminist at its core. Women were condemned\nfor following \"fashion\" and for avoiding the self-sacrifice expected of\nmothers. \"The true wife,\" Storer declared, did not seek `'undue power in public\nlife, . . . undue control in domestic affairs, . . . [or] privileges not her\nown.\" The antiabortion campaign was a reactionary response to two important\nefforts of the nineteenth-century women's movements: the fight to admit women\ninto the regular medical profession and the battle to make men conform to a\nsingle standard of sexual behavior. The antiabortion campaign coincided with\nthe fight by male Regulars to keep women out of their medical schools,\nsocieties, and hospitals. Boston and Harvard University, Storer's hometown and\nalma mater, were key sites of struggle over women's place in medicine, and\nStorer was personally engaged in the battle against female physicians.\nAdvocates of women in medicine argued that women doctors would protect women\npatients from sexual violation. Regular male doctors degraded female physicians\nby accusing them, along with midwives, of performing abortions. The relative morality of men and women was of crucial importance to this\ncampaign. For the specialists, whose interest in the female reproductive system\nraised questions about their sexual morality, the antiabortion campaign was a\nway to proclaim their own high morality in contrast to their competitors, their\nfemale patients, and even the ministers who tolerated abortion. It was at the\nsame time a backlash against the women's movement's critique of male sexual\nbehavior and feminist claims to political power. Nineteenth-century feminists\nexpressed their anger with male sexual domination and promiscuity in a number\nof movements, including the campaigns against prostitution and slavery and the\nfight for temperance. All sections of the women's movement advocated \"voluntary\nmotherhood,\" a slogan that addressed both men's sexual violation of their wives\nand women's desire to control childbearing. Women saw themselves as morally\nsuperior and urged men to adopt a single standard  --  the female\nstandard of\nchastity until marriage, followed by monogamy and moderation. The campaign\nagainst abortion challenged this feminist analysis of men by condemning women\nfor having abortions. Indeed, Storer compared abortion to prostitution and, in\nso doing, called into question all claims made by middle-class\nnineteenth-century women on the basis of moral superiority. \"There is little\ndifference,\" he proclaimed, \"between the immorality\" of the man who visited\nprostitutes and the woman who aborted. The nineteenth-century women's movements\nnever defended abortion, but activist women and women doctors were blamed for\nthe practice of abortion nonetheless. The antiabortion campaign attempted to destroy the idea of quickening. As\nphysicians targeted quickening, they discredited women's experiences of\npregnancy and claimed pregnancy as medical terrain. \"Quickening,\" as Storer\ndescribed it, \"is in fact but a sensation.\" A sensation that had emotional,\nsocial, and legal meaning was thus denigrated. Quickening was based on women's\nown bodily sensations -- not on medical diagnosis. It made physicians, and\nobstetricians in particular, dependent on female self-diagnosis and judgment.\nQuickening could not be relied upon as an indicator of fetal life because,\nStorer argued, it did not occur at a standard moment. \"Many women never quicken\nat all,\" he joked about women's perceptions, \"though their children are born\nliving.\" Storer's propaganda aimed to erase the distinctions between earlier\nand later stages of pregnancy, thereby redefining the restoration of the\nmenses. What had previously been understood as a blockage and a restoration of\nthe menses prior to quickening was now associated with inducing a miscarriage\nafter quickening by labeling it abortion. Furthermore, Storer equated abortion\nwith infanticide. Regular medical men had entered the debate about sexual politics by attacking\nthe female practice of abortion as immoral, unwomanly, and unpatriotic. In\ngiving abortion new meaning, the Regulars provided a weapon that white,\nnative-born, male legislators could use against the women of their own class\nwho had been agitating for personal and political reform. Regular physicians\nwon passage of new criminal abortion laws because their campaign appealed to a\nset of fears of white, nativeborn, male elites about losing political power to\nCatholic immigrants and to women. Class privilege did not protect middle-class\nwhite women from public policy designed to control them. Although the\ncriminalization of abortion was aimed at middle-class white women, it affected\nwomen of every class and race. The new laws passed across the country between\n1860 and 1880 regarded abortion in an entirely different light from common law\nand the statutes regulating abortifacients. In general, the laws included two\ninnovations: they eliminated the common-law idea of quickening and prohibited\nabortion at any point in pregnancy. Some included punishment for the women who\nhad abortions. The \"Comstock Law\" passed in 1873 included abortion and birth\ncontrol in federal antiobscenity legislation; states and municipalities passed\nsimilar ordinances. The antiabortion laws made one exception: physicians could perform therapeutic\nabortions if pregnancy and childbirth threatened the woman's life. A bill\ncriminalizing abortion unless done for \" bona fide medical or surgical\npurposes\" passed the Illinois state legislature unanimously and was signed into\nlaw in 1867. A few years later, Illinois passed another law prohibiting the\nsale of abortifacients but made an exception for \"the written prescription of\nsome well known and respectable practicing physician.\" Physicians had won the\ncriminalization of abortion and retained to themselves alone the right to\ninduce abortions when they determined it necessary. Through the antiabortion campaign, doctors claimed scientific authority to\ndefine life and death. In so doing, they claimed the authority of religious\nleaders. In leading this moral crusade and thoroughly criticizing the\nministry's lack of interest in abortion, regular doctors set themselves above\nreligious leaders as well as above the general populace. The medical\nprofession's claim to moral purity and the authority of the clergy was a\nstepping-stone to greater social authority. Regular physicians won an important\nvictory when they persuaded the nation's states to criminalize abortion.\nPhysicians entered a new partnership with the state and won the power to set\nreproductive policy. In the process, women's perceptions of pregnancy were\ndelegitimated and women lost what had been a common-law right. Periodization: Changing Patterns of Illegal Abortion During the more than one hundred years that abortion was illegal in the United\nStates, the patterns; practice, policing, and politics of abortion all changed\nover time, though not always simultaneously. I trace the history along several\nlines at once, according to the location, practice, and availability of\nabortion as well as its regulation. Abortion was widely available throughout\nmuch of the era when abortion was a crime. Yet periods of tolerance were\npunctuated by moments of severe repression. At some points the changing\nstructure of medicine brought about crucial changes in the history of abortion;\nat others, changes in women's lives or the political and economic context came\nto the fore. In the nineteenth century, abortion came under attack at a moment when women\nwere claiming political power; in the twentieth century, it came under attack\nwhen they claimed sexual freedom. Abortion, like contraception, means that\nwomen can separate sex and procreation -- still a controversial notion.\nAntiabortion campaigns developed when women asserted sexual independence, as\nduring the Progressive Era and since the 1970s. When abortion was most firmly\nlinked to the needs of family rather than the freedoms of women, as during the\nDepression, it was most ignored by those who would suppress it. Periods of\nantiabortion activity mark moments of hostility to female independence. The epoch of illegal abortion may be broken down into four periods. The first\ncovers the time from the criminalization of abortion state-by-state,\naccomplished nationwide by 1880, to 1930. This period, covering fifty years, is\nheavily marked by continuity. As other historians have also found, the\nreproductive lives of most women and the day-to-day practice of most physicians\nchanged slowly. In this period, abortion was widely accepted and was practiced\nin women's homes and in the offices of physicians and midwives. The diversity\nof practitioners, the privacy of medical practice, and the autonomy of\nphysicians in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries made the\nwidespread medical practice of abortion possible. A crackdown on abortion\noccurred between 1890 and 1920 as specialists in obstetrics renewed the earlier\ncampaign against abortion, and the medical profession was drawn into the\nstate's enforcement system. The structural transformation that occurred during the 1930s, the second\nperiod, was crucial for the history of abortion. Abortion became more available\nand changed location. As the practice moved from private offices and homes to\nhospitals and clinics, abortion was consolidated in medical hands and became\nmore visible. The changes wrought by the Depression accelerated the pace of\nchange in the coming decades, particularly in the methods of enforcing the\ncriminal abortion laws. The third period was marked by increasing restrictions on abortion by state\nand medical authorities and intensifying demand for abortion from women of all\ngroups. This period begins in 1940, when the new methods of controlling\nabortion were first instituted, and continues through 1973, when they were\ndismantled. In reaction to the growing practice of abortion as well as apparent\nchanges in female gender and reproductive patterns, a backlash against abortion\ndeveloped. 1940 marks a dividing line as hospitals instituted new policies, and\npolice and prosecutors changed their tactics. The repression of abortion was\npart of the repression of political and personal deviance that took place in\nthe 1940s and 1950s. Yet even in this period, the practice of abortion expanded\nin new directions in response to relentless demand. The new repression of\nabortion, however, was devastating for women. A dual system of abortion,\ndivided by race and class, developed. During the postwar period, the\ncriminalization of abortion produced its harshest results. A new stage in the history of abortion, the movement to legalize it, overlaps\nwith the third period. The movement to decriminalize abortion began in the\nmid-1950s and arose out of the difficult experiences resulting from the\nrepression of abortion in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1950s, a handful of\nphysicians began to challenge the very abortion laws their profession had\nadvocated a century earlier. The progress of that challenge attests to the\ncontinuing power of the medical profession to make public policy regarding\nreproduction. As legal reform moved forward, a new feminist movement arose,\nwhich radically transformed the movement for legal change. When the women's\nmovement described abortion as an aspect of sexual freedom, they articulated a\nnew feminist meaning for abortion; when they demanded abortion as a right, they\nechoed generations of women. The structure of this book follows this periodization. The first half of the\nbook uncovers the history of abortion from the late nineteenth century through\nthe 1920s. Chapters 1 through 4 each cover different aspects of abortion, from\nwomen's lives to practice to politics to enforcement, during the first\nhalf-century of illegal abortion. The changes of the 1930S, both medical and\nsocial, precipitated other changes. The second half of the book traces the\nhistory of abortion in chronologically ordered chapters concluding with the\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions that ended the era of illegal abortion. Women's history of abortion needs to be examined both as a commonly felt need\nto control reproduction, arising from women's biological capacity to bear\nchildren and social relations that assign childbearing to women, and in terms\nof differences among women. This book differentiates among women by class, race\nand ethnic identity, and marital status. Though class did not absolutely\ndetermine access to or safety of abortion, class position helped define when a\nwoman felt she needed an abortion and affected the type available to her. In\ngeneral, urban women had greater access to abortion than rural women, though\nsome rural women located abortionists in their areas or traveled to cities for\nabortions. Race played a less obvious role in access to abortion, though the\ngrim statistics of the postwar period show the connection between\ndiscrimination and death. I have made a specific effort to locate sources\nrelated to African Americans in order to learn more about black women's use of\nabortion and how race shaped the history of abortion. Evidence concerning women\nof color is meager, however, until the 1930s, when medical and sociological\nstudies began separating their findings by race. Before then, contemporary\nobservers tended to focus their attention on the differences among many (white)\nforeign-born ethnic groups. This book integrates a national analysis of the history of abortion with a\nlocal study. The advantage of this approach is that it connects everyday life\nand local medical and legal practice to national policy. It examines that\nrelationship rather than assuming that all the public policy action takes place\non the federal level without reference to local and \"private\" events. I select\na major metropolis in order to uncover the nature of both abortion practices\nand police enforcement of the criminal abortion laws. Chicago, the second\nlargest city in the nation, is the focus of my local study. Chicago, the city\nin \"the heartland\" that has of ten served as a metaphor for the spirit of\nAmerica, was also known as an important medical center (the home of the AMA)\nand as a regional center for abortion. Trains brought European immigrants, men\nand women migrating from farms to the city, African Americans moving from the\nSouth to the North, all going to live and work in Chicago. The same trains\nbrought women looking for abortions. Directing my attention to one city enabled\nme to uncover the nitty-gritty details of the practice and regulation of\nabortion. Though much of my analysis of the history of abortion draws on Chicago as a\ncase study, sources verify that my findings hold true for other cities, large\nand small. Throughout I present national data and trends as well as regional\nones and take note of patterns elsewhere. The book moves back and forth from a\nnational overview of abortion practices and politics to a close look at events\nin Chicago. As medical practice became more standardized in hospitals, the\nstory becomes a more national one and key events take place in other cities:\nNew York, Detroit, Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington, D.C.,\nand elsewhere. This is primarily a study of abortion in urban areas, where\nabortion was concentrated. I comment occasionally on practices in rural areas,\nbut the history of reproductive control and abortion is likely to be somewhat\ndifferent there. Legal records, most notably lower-level court and criminal trial records, and\nmedical literature make up the foundation of my research. I have also surveyed\nother government documents, newspapers, popular periodicals, hospital records,\nand manuscript collections. Using these materials, I have delineated how\nmedical thinking and state regulation have changed over time. Yet this is more\nthan a study of prescriptive literature or policy. I have uncovered the\ncircumstances of hundreds of actual induced abortions and reconstructed\nchanging abortion practices. This study periodizes the history of abortion for\nthe first time. This book presents the lives of many women and their abortions in rich detail\nin order to convey the variety and intricacy of the situations that made\nabortion necessary for women. It is in the minutiae of women's lives that we\ncan discover why women had abortions and how they won sympathy from physicians\nwho belonged to a profession dedicated to fighting abortion. Abortion was a\nmoment in a woman's reproductive life. It cannot be separated from sexual\nrelations or reproduction as a whole. Women themselves did not separate them,\nnor should we, whether analyzing abortion in the past or present. This book\ndeepens our understanding of the female experience of reproduction and the\nconnections between sexuality, contraception, pregnancy, and childbirth. At its\nmost fundamental, a policy that restricts abortion is one that forces women\ninto maternity. Without contraceptives and abortion, most women in heterosexual\nrelationships will become pregnant and bear children, whether they want to or\nnot. When women sought abortions, they often revealed the texture of\nheterosexual relations and the rest of their lives. Many situations made\nenduring pregnancy unbearable to women. In using abortion, women rebelled\nagainst the law and asserted their sense that the decision to carry a pregnancy\nto term or to abort was theirs to make. A few expressed in words as well as in\naction the view that abortion was their right. The experiences of women's\nprivate lives and private practices over the course of one hundred years\naltered medical thinking and reshaped public policy. Despite the fact that\nwomen's abortion narratives are part of our own contemporary discourse, the\nstories told here have long been hidden.

The values\nexpressed by ordinary people deserve to be taken seriously rather than\ncategorized and dismissed as sinful or mistaken. Though some felt guilt about\nabortion and found ways to justify their behavior, others never held the\nofficial antiabortion views. Prescribed morality and popular morality may not\nbe identical. Analysis of women's practices and ideas -- popular\nbehavior and\nbelief -- rather than exclusive focus on the statements of male\ntheologians and\nphilosophers suggests that it is incorrect to conclude that hostility to\nabortion is \"almost an absolute value in history.\" The reverse may be more\naccurate. Although this book takes note of religious teachings and the religious\nbackground of women who had abortions, it does not focus on religious opinion.\nOrganized religion had little interest in abortion until it entered the public,\npolitical arena in the late 1950s and early 1960s. There was no reason to\nenergetically fight abortion when, for nearly a century, abortion was a crime\nand no social movement suggested otherwise. From the 1920s on, however, there\nwas much religious interest in, and division over, another method of\nreproductive control: contraception. Birth control became a topic of interest\nbecause a movement advocated women's right to reproductive control. Further, it\nis incorrect to assume that the Catholic Church has always organized against\nabortion or that all Catholics subscribe to the views of their church leaders.\nIndeed, many Catholics shared what I have described as a popular ethic\naccepting abortion. A good history of religion and reproductive control would\nexamine not only theology and sermons, but also the attitudes and actions of\nthe congregations, with particular attention to women. Women who had abortions did so within a context of illegality and religious\ndisapproval, but the prohibitions were ambiguous. Christian traditions had\ntabooed abortion since antiquity, but the acceptance of abortion in order to\nsave the life of a pregnant woman had a long tradition as well. Until the\nmid-nineteenth century, the Catholic Church implicitly accepted early abortions\nprior to ensoulment. Not until T869, at about the same time that abortion\nbecame politicized in this country, did the church condemn abortion; in 1895,\nit condemned therapeutic abortion. Protestant churches accepted abortion when\npregnancy threatened a woman's life, a view shared by the medical profession\nand written into the nation's laws. Jewish tradition clearly viewed the woman's\nlife as primary. The Mishnah, a code of ancient Jewish law that guided later\nrabbinic thought, required abortion when childbirth threatened a woman's life,\nfor \"her life takes precedence over its life.\" This study points to the importance of studying the social history of\nsexuality as well as the medical and legal discourse about it. These discourses\nregarding abortion are important because they introduced new meanings of\nabortion and shaped people's views (and fears) of abortion and sexuality. I\nanalyze the language women used to describe abortion and the production of\nstories about abortion in the press and in the courtroom. Yet exclusive\nattention to professional or even popular discourse about abortion would result\nin a distorted picture of that history. Medical discourse has convinced some\nscholars that physicians did not perform abortions in the period of illegal\nabortion, and most press coverage of abortion in the early twentieth century\ngives the misleading impression that abortion was universally condemned and\ngenerally fatal. These conclusions are not correct. Analysis of discourse alone\nwould miss the ongoing medical practice of abortion in total contradiction of\nofficial medical mores. As others have pointed out, Foucault's theory\nconcerning the production of sexuality through discourse ignores differences in\nthe power of individuals and social groups to enter and shape discourse. The\npublicly articulated and published discussion of abortion rarely included the\nvoices or perspectives of women who had abortions, except to provide shocking\nexamples of depraved womanhood. Women who had abortions did not intervene to\nexplain themselves, but instead, in other nonpublic arenas, made their\nperspectives known and acted to obtain a much-needed method for preventing\nbirths. More tolerant attitudes toward abortion, rooted in material\nexperiences, persisted in the face of a public discourse that denounced it. The\nhistory of sexuality and reproduction demands a combined analysis of ideas and\npractice. Common Law and the Criminalization of Abortion Abortion was not always a crime. During the eighteenth and early nineteenth\ncenturies, abortion of early pregnancy was legal under common law. Abortions\nwere illegal only after \"quickening,\" the point at which a pregnant woman could\nfeel the movements of the fetus (approximately the fourth month of pregnancy).\nThe common law's attitude toward pregnancy and abortion was based on an\nunderstanding of pregnancy and human development as a process rather than an\nabsolute moment. Indeed, the term abortion referred only to the miscarriages of\nlater pregnancies, after quickening. What we would now identify as an early\ninduced abortion was not called an abortion at all. If an early pregnancy\nended, it had \"slipp[ed] away,\" or the menses had been \"restored.\" At\nconception and the earliest stage of pregnancy before quickening, no one\nbelieved that a human life existed; not even the Catholic Church took this\nview. Rather, the popular ethic regarding abortion and common law were grounded\nin the female experience of their own bodies. Colonial and early-nineteenth-century women, historians have learned,\nperceived conception as the \"blocking\" or \"obstructing\" of menstruation, which\nrequired attention. The cessation of the menses indicated a worrisome imbalance\nin the body and the need to bring the body back into balance by restoring the\nflow. This idea of menstruation corresponded with medical and popular\nunderstanding of sickness and health. The body was a delicate system of\nequilibrium that could easily be thrown out of balance -- by a change\nin weather\nor diet, for example -- and that then needed to be restored through active\nintervention. A disruption in the healthy body, in the worldview of patients\nand physicians, required a visible, often violent, physical response to\ntreatment in order to restore equilibrium. This theory underlay eighteenth and\nnineteenth-century regular medical practice, which emphasized heroic\nmeasures -- bleeding, blistering, purging, and puking -- in\nresponse to sickness.\nThe response to the blocking of the menses was part of this shared\nunderstanding of the body: women took drugs in order to make their menses\nregular and regarded the ensuing vomiting and evacuation as evidence of the\ndrugs' effective action. Restoring the menses was a domestic practice. The power of certain herbs to\nrestore menstruation was widely known. One colonial woman who feared pregnancy\nhad \"twice taken Savin; once boyled in milk and the other time strayned through\na Cloath.\" Savin, derived from juniper bushes, was the most popular\nabortifacient and easily acquired since junipers grew wild throughout the\ncountry. Other herbs used as abortifacients included pennyroyal, tansy, ergot,\nand seneca snakeroot. Slave women used cottonroot. Many of these useful plants\ncould be found in the woods or cultivated. in gardens, and women could refer to\nhome medical guides for recipes for \"bringing on the menses.\" Both of these concepts, blocked menses and quickening, must be taken seriously\nby late-twentieth-century observers. Blocked menses cannot be dismissed as an\nexcuse made by women who knew they were pregnant. Quickening was a moment\nrecognized by women and by law as a defining moment in human development. Once\nquickening occurred, women recognized a moral obligation to carry the fetus to\nterm. This age-old idea underpinned the practice of abortion in America. The\nlegal acceptance of induced miscarriages before quickening tacitly assumed that\nwomen had a basic right to bodily integrity. By the mid-eighteenth century, the most common means of inducing\nabortion -- by\ntaking drugs was commercialized. The availability of abortifacients was so\nwell-known that a common euphemism described their use. When Sarah Grosvenor, a\nConnecticut farm girl, confided to her sister in 1742 that she was \"taking the\ntrade,\" her sister understood. That Grosvenor successfully conveyed her meaning\nto her sister in three metaphoric words tells us a great deal about the world\nof mid-eighteenth-century New England. Many New Englanders, including these\nsisters, knew of the possibility of inducing an abortion by purchasing and\ningesting drugs. The need for a euphemism tells of the difficulty of speaking\nopenly about sex and reproductive control and of the need for secrecy. Yet it\nreveals an awareness that women could and did regulate their own fertility\nthrough abortion. Furthermore, abortifacients had become a profitable product\nsold by doctors, apothecaries, and other healers. The first statutes governing abortion in the United States, James Mohr has\nfound, were poison control measures designed to protect pregnant women like\nGrosvenor by controlling the sale of abortifacient drugs, which often killed\nthe women who took them. The proliferation of entrepreneurs who openly sold and\nadvertised abortifacients may have inspired this early legislation, passed in\nthe 1820s and 1830s. The 18 Illinois law, which prohibited the provision of\nabortifacients, was listed under \"poisoning.\" It is crucial to recognize what these early-nineteenth-century laws did not\ncover: they did not punish women for inducing abortions, and they did not\neliminate the concept of quickening. Even as poison control measures, they said\nnothing about growing the plants needed in one's own garden or mixing together\none's own home remedy in order to induce an abortion. The legal silence on\ndomestic practices suggests that the new laws were aimed at the\ncommercialization of this practice and, implicitly, retained to women the right\nto make their own decisions about their pregnancies before quickening. By the 1840s, the abortion business boomed. Despite the laws forbidding the\nsale of abortifacients, they were advertised in the popular press and could be\npurchased from physicians or pharmacists or through the mail. If drugs failed,\nwomen could go to a practitioner who specialized in performing instrumental\nabortions. Advertisements and newspaper exposes made it appear that what had\nbeen an occasional domestic practice had become a daily occurrence performed\nfor profit in northern cities. Madame Restell, for example, openly advertised\nand provided abortion services for thirty-five years. Restell began her\nabortion business in New York City in the late 1830s; by the mid-1840s, she had\noffices in Boston and Philadelphia and traveling agents who sold her \"Female\nMonthly Pills.\" Restell became the most infamous abortionist in the country,\nbut she was not the only abortionist. The clientele of these busy clinics were\nprimarily married, white, native-born Protestant women of the upper and middle\nclasses. In 1857, the newly organized AMA initiated a crusade to make abortion at every\nstage of pregnancy illegal. The antiabortion campaign grew in part, James Mohr\nhas shown, out of regular physicians' desire to win professional power, control\nmedical practice, and restrict their competitors, particularly Homeopaths and\nmidwives. \"Regular,\" or \"orthodox,\" physicians, practitioners of \"heroic\"\nmedicine, had come under attack in the 1820s and 1830s as elitist. They faced\ncompetition from a variety of practitioners from other medical sects,\ncollectively known as \"Irregulars.\" Through the 1870S, regular physicians\nacross the country worked for the passage of new criminal abortion laws. In\nsecuring criminal abortion laws, the Regulars won recognition of their\nparticular views as well as some state control over the practice of\nmedicine. Though professional issues underlay the medical campaign, gender, racial, and\nclass anxieties pushed the criminalization of abortion forward. The visible use\nof abortion by middle-class married women, in conjunction with other challenges\nto gender norms and changes in the social makeup of the nation, generated\nanxieties among American men of the same class. Birth rates among the Yankee\nclasses had declined by mid-century while immigrants poured into the country.\nAntiabortion activists pointed out that immigrant families, many of them\nCatholic, were larger and would soon outpopulate native-born white Yankees and\nthreaten their political power. Dr. Horatio R Storer, the leader of the medical\ncampaign against abortion, envisioned the spread of \"civilization\" west and\nsouth by native-born white Americans, not Mexicans, Chinese, Blacks, Indians,\nor Catholics. \"Shall\" these regions, he asked, \"be filled by our own children\nor by those of aliens? This is a question our women must answer; upon their\nloins depends the future destiny of the nation.\" Hostility to immigrants,\nCatholics, and people of color fueled this campaign to criminalize abortion.\nWhite male patriotism demanded that maternity be enforced among white\nProtestant women. The antiabortion campaign was antifeminist at its core. Women were condemned\nfor following \"fashion\" and for avoiding the self-sacrifice expected of\nmothers. \"The true wife,\" Storer declared, did not seek `'undue power in public\nlife, . . . undue control in domestic affairs, . . . [or] privileges not her\nown.\" The antiabortion campaign was a reactionary response to two important\nefforts of the nineteenth-century women's movements: the fight to admit women\ninto the regular medical profession and the battle to make men conform to a\nsingle standard of sexual behavior. The antiabortion campaign coincided with\nthe fight by male Regulars to keep women out of their medical schools,\nsocieties, and hospitals. Boston and Harvard University, Storer's hometown and\nalma mater, were key sites of struggle over women's place in medicine, and\nStorer was personally engaged in the battle against female physicians.\nAdvocates of women in medicine argued that women doctors would protect women\npatients from sexual violation. Regular male doctors degraded female physicians\nby accusing them, along with midwives, of performing abortions. The relative morality of men and women was of crucial importance to this\ncampaign. For the specialists, whose interest in the female reproductive system\nraised questions about their sexual morality, the antiabortion campaign was a\nway to proclaim their own high morality in contrast to their competitors, their\nfemale patients, and even the ministers who tolerated abortion. It was at the\nsame time a backlash against the women's movement's critique of male sexual\nbehavior and feminist claims to political power. Nineteenth-century feminists\nexpressed their anger with male sexual domination and promiscuity in a number\nof movements, including the campaigns against prostitution and slavery and the\nfight for temperance. All sections of the women's movement advocated \"voluntary\nmotherhood,\" a slogan that addressed both men's sexual violation of their wives\nand women's desire to control childbearing. Women saw themselves as morally\nsuperior and urged men to adopt a single standard  --  the female\nstandard of\nchastity until marriage, followed by monogamy and moderation. The campaign\nagainst abortion challenged this feminist analysis of men by condemning women\nfor having abortions. Indeed, Storer compared abortion to prostitution and, in\nso doing, called into question all claims made by middle-class\nnineteenth-century women on the basis of moral superiority. \"There is little\ndifference,\" he proclaimed, \"between the immorality\" of the man who visited\nprostitutes and the woman who aborted. The nineteenth-century women's movements\nnever defended abortion, but activist women and women doctors were blamed for\nthe practice of abortion nonetheless. The antiabortion campaign attempted to destroy the idea of quickening. As\nphysicians targeted quickening, they discredited women's experiences of\npregnancy and claimed pregnancy as medical terrain. \"Quickening,\" as Storer\ndescribed it, \"is in fact but a sensation.\" A sensation that had emotional,\nsocial, and legal meaning was thus denigrated. Quickening was based on women's\nown bodily sensations -- not on medical diagnosis. It made physicians, and\nobstetricians in particular, dependent on female self-diagnosis and judgment.\nQuickening could not be relied upon as an indicator of fetal life because,\nStorer argued, it did not occur at a standard moment. \"Many women never quicken\nat all,\" he joked about women's perceptions, \"though their children are born\nliving.\" Storer's propaganda aimed to erase the distinctions between earlier\nand later stages of pregnancy, thereby redefining the restoration of the\nmenses. What had previously been understood as a blockage and a restoration of\nthe menses prior to quickening was now associated with inducing a miscarriage\nafter quickening by labeling it abortion. Furthermore, Storer equated abortion\nwith infanticide. Regular medical men had entered the debate about sexual politics by attacking\nthe female practice of abortion as immoral, unwomanly, and unpatriotic. In\ngiving abortion new meaning, the Regulars provided a weapon that white,\nnative-born, male legislators could use against the women of their own class\nwho had been agitating for personal and political reform. Regular physicians\nwon passage of new criminal abortion laws because their campaign appealed to a\nset of fears of white, nativeborn, male elites about losing political power to\nCatholic immigrants and to women. Class privilege did not protect middle-class\nwhite women from public policy designed to control them. Although the\ncriminalization of abortion was aimed at middle-class white women, it affected\nwomen of every class and race. The new laws passed across the country between\n1860 and 1880 regarded abortion in an entirely different light from common law\nand the statutes regulating abortifacients. In general, the laws included two\ninnovations: they eliminated the common-law idea of quickening and prohibited\nabortion at any point in pregnancy. Some included punishment for the women who\nhad abortions. The \"Comstock Law\" passed in 1873 included abortion and birth\ncontrol in federal antiobscenity legislation; states and municipalities passed\nsimilar ordinances. The antiabortion laws made one exception: physicians could perform therapeutic\nabortions if pregnancy and childbirth threatened the woman's life. A bill\ncriminalizing abortion unless done for \" bona fide medical or surgical\npurposes\" passed the Illinois state legislature unanimously and was signed into\nlaw in 1867. A few years later, Illinois passed another law prohibiting the\nsale of abortifacients but made an exception for \"the written prescription of\nsome well known and respectable practicing physician.\" Physicians had won the\ncriminalization of abortion and retained to themselves alone the right to\ninduce abortions when they determined it necessary. Through the antiabortion campaign, doctors claimed scientific authority to\ndefine life and death. In so doing, they claimed the authority of religious\nleaders. In leading this moral crusade and thoroughly criticizing the\nministry's lack of interest in abortion, regular doctors set themselves above\nreligious leaders as well as above the general populace. The medical\nprofession's claim to moral purity and the authority of the clergy was a\nstepping-stone to greater social authority. Regular physicians won an important\nvictory when they persuaded the nation's states to criminalize abortion.\nPhysicians entered a new partnership with the state and won the power to set\nreproductive policy. In the process, women's perceptions of pregnancy were\ndelegitimated and women lost what had been a common-law right. Periodization: Changing Patterns of Illegal Abortion During the more than one hundred years that abortion was illegal in the United\nStates, the patterns; practice, policing, and politics of abortion all changed\nover time, though not always simultaneously. I trace the history along several\nlines at once, according to the location, practice, and availability of\nabortion as well as its regulation. Abortion was widely available throughout\nmuch of the era when abortion was a crime. Yet periods of tolerance were\npunctuated by moments of severe repression. At some points the changing\nstructure of medicine brought about crucial changes in the history of abortion;\nat others, changes in women's lives or the political and economic context came\nto the fore. In the nineteenth century, abortion came under attack at a moment when women\nwere claiming political power; in the twentieth century, it came under attack\nwhen they claimed sexual freedom. Abortion, like contraception, means that\nwomen can separate sex and procreation -- still a controversial notion.\nAntiabortion campaigns developed when women asserted sexual independence, as\nduring the Progressive Era and since the 1970s. When abortion was most firmly\nlinked to the needs of family rather than the freedoms of women, as during the\nDepression, it was most ignored by those who would suppress it. Periods of\nantiabortion activity mark moments of hostility to female independence. The epoch of illegal abortion may be broken down into four periods. The first\ncovers the time from the criminalization of abortion state-by-state,\naccomplished nationwide by 1880, to 1930. This period, covering fifty years, is\nheavily marked by continuity. As other historians have also found, the\nreproductive lives of most women and the day-to-day practice of most physicians\nchanged slowly. In this period, abortion was widely accepted and was practiced\nin women's homes and in the offices of physicians and midwives. The diversity\nof practitioners, the privacy of medical practice, and the autonomy of\nphysicians in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries made the\nwidespread medical practice of abortion possible. A crackdown on abortion\noccurred between 1890 and 1920 as specialists in obstetrics renewed the earlier\ncampaign against abortion, and the medical profession was drawn into the\nstate's enforcement system. The structural transformation that occurred during the 1930s, the second\nperiod, was crucial for the history of abortion. Abortion became more available\nand changed location. As the practice moved from private offices and homes to\nhospitals and clinics, abortion was consolidated in medical hands and became\nmore visible. The changes wrought by the Depression accelerated the pace of\nchange in the coming decades, particularly in the methods of enforcing the\ncriminal abortion laws. The third period was marked by increasing restrictions on abortion by state\nand medical authorities and intensifying demand for abortion from women of all\ngroups. This period begins in 1940, when the new methods of controlling\nabortion were first instituted, and continues through 1973, when they were\ndismantled. In reaction to the growing practice of abortion as well as apparent\nchanges in female gender and reproductive patterns, a backlash against abortion\ndeveloped. 1940 marks a dividing line as hospitals instituted new policies, and\npolice and prosecutors changed their tactics. The repression of abortion was\npart of the repression of political and personal deviance that took place in\nthe 1940s and 1950s. Yet even in this period, the practice of abortion expanded\nin new directions in response to relentless demand. The new repression of\nabortion, however, was devastating for women. A dual system of abortion,\ndivided by race and class, developed. During the postwar period, the\ncriminalization of abortion produced its harshest results. A new stage in the history of abortion, the movement to legalize it, overlaps\nwith the third period. The movement to decriminalize abortion began in the\nmid-1950s and arose out of the difficult experiences resulting from the\nrepression of abortion in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1950s, a handful of\nphysicians began to challenge the very abortion laws their profession had\nadvocated a century earlier. The progress of that challenge attests to the\ncontinuing power of the medical profession to make public policy regarding\nreproduction. As legal reform moved forward, a new feminist movement arose,\nwhich radically transformed the movement for legal change. When the women's\nmovement described abortion as an aspect of sexual freedom, they articulated a\nnew feminist meaning for abortion; when they demanded abortion as a right, they\nechoed generations of women. The structure of this book follows this periodization. The first half of the\nbook uncovers the history of abortion from the late nineteenth century through\nthe 1920s. Chapters 1 through 4 each cover different aspects of abortion, from\nwomen's lives to practice to politics to enforcement, during the first\nhalf-century of illegal abortion. The changes of the 1930S, both medical and\nsocial, precipitated other changes. The second half of the book traces the\nhistory of abortion in chronologically ordered chapters concluding with the\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions that ended the era of illegal abortion. Women's history of abortion needs to be examined both as a commonly felt need\nto control reproduction, arising from women's biological capacity to bear\nchildren and social relations that assign childbearing to women, and in terms\nof differences among women. This book differentiates among women by class, race\nand ethnic identity, and marital status. Though class did not absolutely\ndetermine access to or safety of abortion, class position helped define when a\nwoman felt she needed an abortion and affected the type available to her. In\ngeneral, urban women had greater access to abortion than rural women, though\nsome rural women located abortionists in their areas or traveled to cities for\nabortions. Race played a less obvious role in access to abortion, though the\ngrim statistics of the postwar period show the connection between\ndiscrimination and death. I have made a specific effort to locate sources\nrelated to African Americans in order to learn more about black women's use of\nabortion and how race shaped the history of abortion. Evidence concerning women\nof color is meager, however, until the 1930s, when medical and sociological\nstudies began separating their findings by race. Before then, contemporary\nobservers tended to focus their attention on the differences among many (white)\nforeign-born ethnic groups. This book integrates a national analysis of the history of abortion with a\nlocal study. The advantage of this approach is that it connects everyday life\nand local medical and legal practice to national policy. It examines that\nrelationship rather than assuming that all the public policy action takes place\non the federal level without reference to local and \"private\" events. I select\na major metropolis in order to uncover the nature of both abortion practices\nand police enforcement of the criminal abortion laws. Chicago, the second\nlargest city in the nation, is the focus of my local study. Chicago, the city\nin \"the heartland\" that has of ten served as a metaphor for the spirit of\nAmerica, was also known as an important medical center (the home of the AMA)\nand as a regional center for abortion. Trains brought European immigrants, men\nand women migrating from farms to the city, African Americans moving from the\nSouth to the North, all going to live and work in Chicago. The same trains\nbrought women looking for abortions. Directing my attention to one city enabled\nme to uncover the nitty-gritty details of the practice and regulation of\nabortion. Though much of my analysis of the history of abortion draws on Chicago as a\ncase study, sources verify that my findings hold true for other cities, large\nand small. Throughout I present national data and trends as well as regional\nones and take note of patterns elsewhere. The book moves back and forth from a\nnational overview of abortion practices and politics to a close look at events\nin Chicago. As medical practice became more standardized in hospitals, the\nstory becomes a more national one and key events take place in other cities:\nNew York, Detroit, Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington, D.C.,\nand elsewhere. This is primarily a study of abortion in urban areas, where\nabortion was concentrated. I comment occasionally on practices in rural areas,\nbut the history of reproductive control and abortion is likely to be somewhat\ndifferent there. Legal records, most notably lower-level court and criminal trial records, and\nmedical literature make up the foundation of my research. I have also surveyed\nother government documents, newspapers, popular periodicals, hospital records,\nand manuscript collections. Using these materials, I have delineated how\nmedical thinking and state regulation have changed over time. Yet this is more\nthan a study of prescriptive literature or policy. I have uncovered the\ncircumstances of hundreds of actual induced abortions and reconstructed\nchanging abortion practices. This study periodizes the history of abortion for\nthe first time. This book presents the lives of many women and their abortions in rich detail\nin order to convey the variety and intricacy of the situations that made\nabortion necessary for women. It is in the minutiae of women's lives that we\ncan discover why women had abortions and how they won sympathy from physicians\nwho belonged to a profession dedicated to fighting abortion. Abortion was a\nmoment in a woman's reproductive life. It cannot be separated from sexual\nrelations or reproduction as a whole. Women themselves did not separate them,\nnor should we, whether analyzing abortion in the past or present. This book\ndeepens our understanding of the female experience of reproduction and the\nconnections between sexuality, contraception, pregnancy, and childbirth. At its\nmost fundamental, a policy that restricts abortion is one that forces women\ninto maternity. Without contraceptives and abortion, most women in heterosexual\nrelationships will become pregnant and bear children, whether they want to or\nnot. When women sought abortions, they often revealed the texture of\nheterosexual relations and the rest of their lives. Many situations made\nenduring pregnancy unbearable to women. In using abortion, women rebelled\nagainst the law and asserted their sense that the decision to carry a pregnancy\nto term or to abort was theirs to make. A few expressed in words as well as in\naction the view that abortion was their right. The experiences of women's\nprivate lives and private practices over the course of one hundred years\naltered medical thinking and reshaped public policy. Despite the fact that\nwomen's abortion narratives are part of our own contemporary discourse, the\nstories told here have long been hidden.

There was no reason to\nenergetically fight abortion when, for nearly a century, abortion was a crime\nand no social movement suggested otherwise. From the 1920s on, however, there\nwas much religious interest in, and division over, another method of\nreproductive control: contraception. Birth control became a topic of interest\nbecause a movement advocated women's right to reproductive control. Further, it\nis incorrect to assume that the Catholic Church has always organized against\nabortion or that all Catholics subscribe to the views of their church leaders.\nIndeed, many Catholics shared what I have described as a popular ethic\naccepting abortion. A good history of religion and reproductive control would\nexamine not only theology and sermons, but also the attitudes and actions of\nthe congregations, with particular attention to women. Women who had abortions did so within a context of illegality and religious\ndisapproval, but the prohibitions were ambiguous. Christian traditions had\ntabooed abortion since antiquity, but the acceptance of abortion in order to\nsave the life of a pregnant woman had a long tradition as well. Until the\nmid-nineteenth century, the Catholic Church implicitly accepted early abortions\nprior to ensoulment. Not until T869, at about the same time that abortion\nbecame politicized in this country, did the church condemn abortion; in 1895,\nit condemned therapeutic abortion. Protestant churches accepted abortion when\npregnancy threatened a woman's life, a view shared by the medical profession\nand written into the nation's laws. Jewish tradition clearly viewed the woman's\nlife as primary. The Mishnah, a code of ancient Jewish law that guided later\nrabbinic thought, required abortion when childbirth threatened a woman's life,\nfor \"her life takes precedence over its life.\" This study points to the importance of studying the social history of\nsexuality as well as the medical and legal discourse about it. These discourses\nregarding abortion are important because they introduced new meanings of\nabortion and shaped people's views (and fears) of abortion and sexuality. I\nanalyze the language women used to describe abortion and the production of\nstories about abortion in the press and in the courtroom. Yet exclusive\nattention to professional or even popular discourse about abortion would result\nin a distorted picture of that history. Medical discourse has convinced some\nscholars that physicians did not perform abortions in the period of illegal\nabortion, and most press coverage of abortion in the early twentieth century\ngives the misleading impression that abortion was universally condemned and\ngenerally fatal. These conclusions are not correct. Analysis of discourse alone\nwould miss the ongoing medical practice of abortion in total contradiction of\nofficial medical mores. As others have pointed out, Foucault's theory\nconcerning the production of sexuality through discourse ignores differences in\nthe power of individuals and social groups to enter and shape discourse. The\npublicly articulated and published discussion of abortion rarely included the\nvoices or perspectives of women who had abortions, except to provide shocking\nexamples of depraved womanhood. Women who had abortions did not intervene to\nexplain themselves, but instead, in other nonpublic arenas, made their\nperspectives known and acted to obtain a much-needed method for preventing\nbirths. More tolerant attitudes toward abortion, rooted in material\nexperiences, persisted in the face of a public discourse that denounced it. The\nhistory of sexuality and reproduction demands a combined analysis of ideas and\npractice. Common Law and the Criminalization of Abortion Abortion was not always a crime. During the eighteenth and early nineteenth\ncenturies, abortion of early pregnancy was legal under common law. Abortions\nwere illegal only after \"quickening,\" the point at which a pregnant woman could\nfeel the movements of the fetus (approximately the fourth month of pregnancy).\nThe common law's attitude toward pregnancy and abortion was based on an\nunderstanding of pregnancy and human development as a process rather than an\nabsolute moment. Indeed, the term abortion referred only to the miscarriages of\nlater pregnancies, after quickening. What we would now identify as an early\ninduced abortion was not called an abortion at all. If an early pregnancy\nended, it had \"slipp[ed] away,\" or the menses had been \"restored.\" At\nconception and the earliest stage of pregnancy before quickening, no one\nbelieved that a human life existed; not even the Catholic Church took this\nview. Rather, the popular ethic regarding abortion and common law were grounded\nin the female experience of their own bodies. Colonial and early-nineteenth-century women, historians have learned,\nperceived conception as the \"blocking\" or \"obstructing\" of menstruation, which\nrequired attention. The cessation of the menses indicated a worrisome imbalance\nin the body and the need to bring the body back into balance by restoring the\nflow. This idea of menstruation corresponded with medical and popular\nunderstanding of sickness and health. The body was a delicate system of\nequilibrium that could easily be thrown out of balance -- by a change\nin weather\nor diet, for example -- and that then needed to be restored through active\nintervention. A disruption in the healthy body, in the worldview of patients\nand physicians, required a visible, often violent, physical response to\ntreatment in order to restore equilibrium. This theory underlay eighteenth and\nnineteenth-century regular medical practice, which emphasized heroic\nmeasures -- bleeding, blistering, purging, and puking -- in\nresponse to sickness.\nThe response to the blocking of the menses was part of this shared\nunderstanding of the body: women took drugs in order to make their menses\nregular and regarded the ensuing vomiting and evacuation as evidence of the\ndrugs' effective action. Restoring the menses was a domestic practice. The power of certain herbs to\nrestore menstruation was widely known. One colonial woman who feared pregnancy\nhad \"twice taken Savin; once boyled in milk and the other time strayned through\na Cloath.\" Savin, derived from juniper bushes, was the most popular\nabortifacient and easily acquired since junipers grew wild throughout the\ncountry. Other herbs used as abortifacients included pennyroyal, tansy, ergot,\nand seneca snakeroot. Slave women used cottonroot. Many of these useful plants\ncould be found in the woods or cultivated. in gardens, and women could refer to\nhome medical guides for recipes for \"bringing on the menses.\" Both of these concepts, blocked menses and quickening, must be taken seriously\nby late-twentieth-century observers. Blocked menses cannot be dismissed as an\nexcuse made by women who knew they were pregnant. Quickening was a moment\nrecognized by women and by law as a defining moment in human development. Once\nquickening occurred, women recognized a moral obligation to carry the fetus to\nterm. This age-old idea underpinned the practice of abortion in America. The\nlegal acceptance of induced miscarriages before quickening tacitly assumed that\nwomen had a basic right to bodily integrity. By the mid-eighteenth century, the most common means of inducing\nabortion -- by\ntaking drugs was commercialized. The availability of abortifacients was so\nwell-known that a common euphemism described their use. When Sarah Grosvenor, a\nConnecticut farm girl, confided to her sister in 1742 that she was \"taking the\ntrade,\" her sister understood. That Grosvenor successfully conveyed her meaning\nto her sister in three metaphoric words tells us a great deal about the world\nof mid-eighteenth-century New England. Many New Englanders, including these\nsisters, knew of the possibility of inducing an abortion by purchasing and\ningesting drugs. The need for a euphemism tells of the difficulty of speaking\nopenly about sex and reproductive control and of the need for secrecy. Yet it\nreveals an awareness that women could and did regulate their own fertility\nthrough abortion. Furthermore, abortifacients had become a profitable product\nsold by doctors, apothecaries, and other healers. The first statutes governing abortion in the United States, James Mohr has\nfound, were poison control measures designed to protect pregnant women like\nGrosvenor by controlling the sale of abortifacient drugs, which often killed\nthe women who took them. The proliferation of entrepreneurs who openly sold and\nadvertised abortifacients may have inspired this early legislation, passed in\nthe 1820s and 1830s. The 18 Illinois law, which prohibited the provision of\nabortifacients, was listed under \"poisoning.\" It is crucial to recognize what these early-nineteenth-century laws did not\ncover: they did not punish women for inducing abortions, and they did not\neliminate the concept of quickening. Even as poison control measures, they said\nnothing about growing the plants needed in one's own garden or mixing together\none's own home remedy in order to induce an abortion. The legal silence on\ndomestic practices suggests that the new laws were aimed at the\ncommercialization of this practice and, implicitly, retained to women the right\nto make their own decisions about their pregnancies before quickening. By the 1840s, the abortion business boomed. Despite the laws forbidding the\nsale of abortifacients, they were advertised in the popular press and could be\npurchased from physicians or pharmacists or through the mail. If drugs failed,\nwomen could go to a practitioner who specialized in performing instrumental\nabortions. Advertisements and newspaper exposes made it appear that what had\nbeen an occasional domestic practice had become a daily occurrence performed\nfor profit in northern cities. Madame Restell, for example, openly advertised\nand provided abortion services for thirty-five years. Restell began her\nabortion business in New York City in the late 1830s; by the mid-1840s, she had\noffices in Boston and Philadelphia and traveling agents who sold her \"Female\nMonthly Pills.\" Restell became the most infamous abortionist in the country,\nbut she was not the only abortionist. The clientele of these busy clinics were\nprimarily married, white, native-born Protestant women of the upper and middle\nclasses. In 1857, the newly organized AMA initiated a crusade to make abortion at every\nstage of pregnancy illegal. The antiabortion campaign grew in part, James Mohr\nhas shown, out of regular physicians' desire to win professional power, control\nmedical practice, and restrict their competitors, particularly Homeopaths and\nmidwives. \"Regular,\" or \"orthodox,\" physicians, practitioners of \"heroic\"\nmedicine, had come under attack in the 1820s and 1830s as elitist. They faced\ncompetition from a variety of practitioners from other medical sects,\ncollectively known as \"Irregulars.\" Through the 1870S, regular physicians\nacross the country worked for the passage of new criminal abortion laws. In\nsecuring criminal abortion laws, the Regulars won recognition of their\nparticular views as well as some state control over the practice of\nmedicine. Though professional issues underlay the medical campaign, gender, racial, and\nclass anxieties pushed the criminalization of abortion forward. The visible use\nof abortion by middle-class married women, in conjunction with other challenges\nto gender norms and changes in the social makeup of the nation, generated\nanxieties among American men of the same class. Birth rates among the Yankee\nclasses had declined by mid-century while immigrants poured into the country.\nAntiabortion activists pointed out that immigrant families, many of them\nCatholic, were larger and would soon outpopulate native-born white Yankees and\nthreaten their political power. Dr. Horatio R Storer, the leader of the medical\ncampaign against abortion, envisioned the spread of \"civilization\" west and\nsouth by native-born white Americans, not Mexicans, Chinese, Blacks, Indians,\nor Catholics. \"Shall\" these regions, he asked, \"be filled by our own children\nor by those of aliens? This is a question our women must answer; upon their\nloins depends the future destiny of the nation.\" Hostility to immigrants,\nCatholics, and people of color fueled this campaign to criminalize abortion.\nWhite male patriotism demanded that maternity be enforced among white\nProtestant women. The antiabortion campaign was antifeminist at its core. Women were condemned\nfor following \"fashion\" and for avoiding the self-sacrifice expected of\nmothers. \"The true wife,\" Storer declared, did not seek `'undue power in public\nlife, . . . undue control in domestic affairs, . . . [or] privileges not her\nown.\" The antiabortion campaign was a reactionary response to two important\nefforts of the nineteenth-century women's movements: the fight to admit women\ninto the regular medical profession and the battle to make men conform to a\nsingle standard of sexual behavior. The antiabortion campaign coincided with\nthe fight by male Regulars to keep women out of their medical schools,\nsocieties, and hospitals. Boston and Harvard University, Storer's hometown and\nalma mater, were key sites of struggle over women's place in medicine, and\nStorer was personally engaged in the battle against female physicians.\nAdvocates of women in medicine argued that women doctors would protect women\npatients from sexual violation. Regular male doctors degraded female physicians\nby accusing them, along with midwives, of performing abortions. The relative morality of men and women was of crucial importance to this\ncampaign. For the specialists, whose interest in the female reproductive system\nraised questions about their sexual morality, the antiabortion campaign was a\nway to proclaim their own high morality in contrast to their competitors, their\nfemale patients, and even the ministers who tolerated abortion. It was at the\nsame time a backlash against the women's movement's critique of male sexual\nbehavior and feminist claims to political power. Nineteenth-century feminists\nexpressed their anger with male sexual domination and promiscuity in a number\nof movements, including the campaigns against prostitution and slavery and the\nfight for temperance. All sections of the women's movement advocated \"voluntary\nmotherhood,\" a slogan that addressed both men's sexual violation of their wives\nand women's desire to control childbearing. Women saw themselves as morally\nsuperior and urged men to adopt a single standard  --  the female\nstandard of\nchastity until marriage, followed by monogamy and moderation. The campaign\nagainst abortion challenged this feminist analysis of men by condemning women\nfor having abortions. Indeed, Storer compared abortion to prostitution and, in\nso doing, called into question all claims made by middle-class\nnineteenth-century women on the basis of moral superiority. \"There is little\ndifference,\" he proclaimed, \"between the immorality\" of the man who visited\nprostitutes and the woman who aborted. The nineteenth-century women's movements\nnever defended abortion, but activist women and women doctors were blamed for\nthe practice of abortion nonetheless. The antiabortion campaign attempted to destroy the idea of quickening. As\nphysicians targeted quickening, they discredited women's experiences of\npregnancy and claimed pregnancy as medical terrain. \"Quickening,\" as Storer\ndescribed it, \"is in fact but a sensation.\" A sensation that had emotional,\nsocial, and legal meaning was thus denigrated. Quickening was based on women's\nown bodily sensations -- not on medical diagnosis. It made physicians, and\nobstetricians in particular, dependent on female self-diagnosis and judgment.\nQuickening could not be relied upon as an indicator of fetal life because,\nStorer argued, it did not occur at a standard moment. \"Many women never quicken\nat all,\" he joked about women's perceptions, \"though their children are born\nliving.\" Storer's propaganda aimed to erase the distinctions between earlier\nand later stages of pregnancy, thereby redefining the restoration of the\nmenses. What had previously been understood as a blockage and a restoration of\nthe menses prior to quickening was now associated with inducing a miscarriage\nafter quickening by labeling it abortion. Furthermore, Storer equated abortion\nwith infanticide. Regular medical men had entered the debate about sexual politics by attacking\nthe female practice of abortion as immoral, unwomanly, and unpatriotic. In\ngiving abortion new meaning, the Regulars provided a weapon that white,\nnative-born, male legislators could use against the women of their own class\nwho had been agitating for personal and political reform. Regular physicians\nwon passage of new criminal abortion laws because their campaign appealed to a\nset of fears of white, nativeborn, male elites about losing political power to\nCatholic immigrants and to women. Class privilege did not protect middle-class\nwhite women from public policy designed to control them. Although the\ncriminalization of abortion was aimed at middle-class white women, it affected\nwomen of every class and race. The new laws passed across the country between\n1860 and 1880 regarded abortion in an entirely different light from common law\nand the statutes regulating abortifacients. In general, the laws included two\ninnovations: they eliminated the common-law idea of quickening and prohibited\nabortion at any point in pregnancy. Some included punishment for the women who\nhad abortions. The \"Comstock Law\" passed in 1873 included abortion and birth\ncontrol in federal antiobscenity legislation; states and municipalities passed\nsimilar ordinances. The antiabortion laws made one exception: physicians could perform therapeutic\nabortions if pregnancy and childbirth threatened the woman's life. A bill\ncriminalizing abortion unless done for \" bona fide medical or surgical\npurposes\" passed the Illinois state legislature unanimously and was signed into\nlaw in 1867. A few years later, Illinois passed another law prohibiting the\nsale of abortifacients but made an exception for \"the written prescription of\nsome well known and respectable practicing physician.\" Physicians had won the\ncriminalization of abortion and retained to themselves alone the right to\ninduce abortions when they determined it necessary. Through the antiabortion campaign, doctors claimed scientific authority to\ndefine life and death. In so doing, they claimed the authority of religious\nleaders. In leading this moral crusade and thoroughly criticizing the\nministry's lack of interest in abortion, regular doctors set themselves above\nreligious leaders as well as above the general populace. The medical\nprofession's claim to moral purity and the authority of the clergy was a\nstepping-stone to greater social authority. Regular physicians won an important\nvictory when they persuaded the nation's states to criminalize abortion.\nPhysicians entered a new partnership with the state and won the power to set\nreproductive policy. In the process, women's perceptions of pregnancy were\ndelegitimated and women lost what had been a common-law right. Periodization: Changing Patterns of Illegal Abortion During the more than one hundred years that abortion was illegal in the United\nStates, the patterns; practice, policing, and politics of abortion all changed\nover time, though not always simultaneously. I trace the history along several\nlines at once, according to the location, practice, and availability of\nabortion as well as its regulation. Abortion was widely available throughout\nmuch of the era when abortion was a crime. Yet periods of tolerance were\npunctuated by moments of severe repression. At some points the changing\nstructure of medicine brought about crucial changes in the history of abortion;\nat others, changes in women's lives or the political and economic context came\nto the fore. In the nineteenth century, abortion came under attack at a moment when women\nwere claiming political power; in the twentieth century, it came under attack\nwhen they claimed sexual freedom. Abortion, like contraception, means that\nwomen can separate sex and procreation -- still a controversial notion.\nAntiabortion campaigns developed when women asserted sexual independence, as\nduring the Progressive Era and since the 1970s. When abortion was most firmly\nlinked to the needs of family rather than the freedoms of women, as during the\nDepression, it was most ignored by those who would suppress it. Periods of\nantiabortion activity mark moments of hostility to female independence. The epoch of illegal abortion may be broken down into four periods. The first\ncovers the time from the criminalization of abortion state-by-state,\naccomplished nationwide by 1880, to 1930. This period, covering fifty years, is\nheavily marked by continuity. As other historians have also found, the\nreproductive lives of most women and the day-to-day practice of most physicians\nchanged slowly. In this period, abortion was widely accepted and was practiced\nin women's homes and in the offices of physicians and midwives. The diversity\nof practitioners, the privacy of medical practice, and the autonomy of\nphysicians in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries made the\nwidespread medical practice of abortion possible. A crackdown on abortion\noccurred between 1890 and 1920 as specialists in obstetrics renewed the earlier\ncampaign against abortion, and the medical profession was drawn into the\nstate's enforcement system. The structural transformation that occurred during the 1930s, the second\nperiod, was crucial for the history of abortion. Abortion became more available\nand changed location. As the practice moved from private offices and homes to\nhospitals and clinics, abortion was consolidated in medical hands and became\nmore visible. The changes wrought by the Depression accelerated the pace of\nchange in the coming decades, particularly in the methods of enforcing the\ncriminal abortion laws. The third period was marked by increasing restrictions on abortion by state\nand medical authorities and intensifying demand for abortion from women of all\ngroups. This period begins in 1940, when the new methods of controlling\nabortion were first instituted, and continues through 1973, when they were\ndismantled. In reaction to the growing practice of abortion as well as apparent\nchanges in female gender and reproductive patterns, a backlash against abortion\ndeveloped. 1940 marks a dividing line as hospitals instituted new policies, and\npolice and prosecutors changed their tactics. The repression of abortion was\npart of the repression of political and personal deviance that took place in\nthe 1940s and 1950s. Yet even in this period, the practice of abortion expanded\nin new directions in response to relentless demand. The new repression of\nabortion, however, was devastating for women. A dual system of abortion,\ndivided by race and class, developed. During the postwar period, the\ncriminalization of abortion produced its harshest results. A new stage in the history of abortion, the movement to legalize it, overlaps\nwith the third period. The movement to decriminalize abortion began in the\nmid-1950s and arose out of the difficult experiences resulting from the\nrepression of abortion in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1950s, a handful of\nphysicians began to challenge the very abortion laws their profession had\nadvocated a century earlier. The progress of that challenge attests to the\ncontinuing power of the medical profession to make public policy regarding\nreproduction. As legal reform moved forward, a new feminist movement arose,\nwhich radically transformed the movement for legal change. When the women's\nmovement described abortion as an aspect of sexual freedom, they articulated a\nnew feminist meaning for abortion; when they demanded abortion as a right, they\nechoed generations of women. The structure of this book follows this periodization. The first half of the\nbook uncovers the history of abortion from the late nineteenth century through\nthe 1920s. Chapters 1 through 4 each cover different aspects of abortion, from\nwomen's lives to practice to politics to enforcement, during the first\nhalf-century of illegal abortion. The changes of the 1930S, both medical and\nsocial, precipitated other changes. The second half of the book traces the\nhistory of abortion in chronologically ordered chapters concluding with the\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions that ended the era of illegal abortion. Women's history of abortion needs to be examined both as a commonly felt need\nto control reproduction, arising from women's biological capacity to bear\nchildren and social relations that assign childbearing to women, and in terms\nof differences among women. This book differentiates among women by class, race\nand ethnic identity, and marital status. Though class did not absolutely\ndetermine access to or safety of abortion, class position helped define when a\nwoman felt she needed an abortion and affected the type available to her. In\ngeneral, urban women had greater access to abortion than rural women, though\nsome rural women located abortionists in their areas or traveled to cities for\nabortions. Race played a less obvious role in access to abortion, though the\ngrim statistics of the postwar period show the connection between\ndiscrimination and death. I have made a specific effort to locate sources\nrelated to African Americans in order to learn more about black women's use of\nabortion and how race shaped the history of abortion. Evidence concerning women\nof color is meager, however, until the 1930s, when medical and sociological\nstudies began separating their findings by race. Before then, contemporary\nobservers tended to focus their attention on the differences among many (white)\nforeign-born ethnic groups. This book integrates a national analysis of the history of abortion with a\nlocal study. The advantage of this approach is that it connects everyday life\nand local medical and legal practice to national policy. It examines that\nrelationship rather than assuming that all the public policy action takes place\non the federal level without reference to local and \"private\" events. I select\na major metropolis in order to uncover the nature of both abortion practices\nand police enforcement of the criminal abortion laws. Chicago, the second\nlargest city in the nation, is the focus of my local study. Chicago, the city\nin \"the heartland\" that has of ten served as a metaphor for the spirit of\nAmerica, was also known as an important medical center (the home of the AMA)\nand as a regional center for abortion. Trains brought European immigrants, men\nand women migrating from farms to the city, African Americans moving from the\nSouth to the North, all going to live and work in Chicago. The same trains\nbrought women looking for abortions. Directing my attention to one city enabled\nme to uncover the nitty-gritty details of the practice and regulation of\nabortion. Though much of my analysis of the history of abortion draws on Chicago as a\ncase study, sources verify that my findings hold true for other cities, large\nand small. Throughout I present national data and trends as well as regional\nones and take note of patterns elsewhere. The book moves back and forth from a\nnational overview of abortion practices and politics to a close look at events\nin Chicago. As medical practice became more standardized in hospitals, the\nstory becomes a more national one and key events take place in other cities:\nNew York, Detroit, Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington, D.C.,\nand elsewhere. This is primarily a study of abortion in urban areas, where\nabortion was concentrated. I comment occasionally on practices in rural areas,\nbut the history of reproductive control and abortion is likely to be somewhat\ndifferent there. Legal records, most notably lower-level court and criminal trial records, and\nmedical literature make up the foundation of my research. I have also surveyed\nother government documents, newspapers, popular periodicals, hospital records,\nand manuscript collections. Using these materials, I have delineated how\nmedical thinking and state regulation have changed over time. Yet this is more\nthan a study of prescriptive literature or policy. I have uncovered the\ncircumstances of hundreds of actual induced abortions and reconstructed\nchanging abortion practices. This study periodizes the history of abortion for\nthe first time. This book presents the lives of many women and their abortions in rich detail\nin order to convey the variety and intricacy of the situations that made\nabortion necessary for women. It is in the minutiae of women's lives that we\ncan discover why women had abortions and how they won sympathy from physicians\nwho belonged to a profession dedicated to fighting abortion. Abortion was a\nmoment in a woman's reproductive life. It cannot be separated from sexual\nrelations or reproduction as a whole. Women themselves did not separate them,\nnor should we, whether analyzing abortion in the past or present. This book\ndeepens our understanding of the female experience of reproduction and the\nconnections between sexuality, contraception, pregnancy, and childbirth. At its\nmost fundamental, a policy that restricts abortion is one that forces women\ninto maternity. Without contraceptives and abortion, most women in heterosexual\nrelationships will become pregnant and bear children, whether they want to or\nnot. When women sought abortions, they often revealed the texture of\nheterosexual relations and the rest of their lives. Many situations made\nenduring pregnancy unbearable to women. In using abortion, women rebelled\nagainst the law and asserted their sense that the decision to carry a pregnancy\nto term or to abort was theirs to make. A few expressed in words as well as in\naction the view that abortion was their right. The experiences of women's\nprivate lives and private practices over the course of one hundred years\naltered medical thinking and reshaped public policy. Despite the fact that\nwomen's abortion narratives are part of our own contemporary discourse, the\nstories told here have long been hidden.

More tolerant attitudes toward abortion, rooted in material\nexperiences, persisted in the face of a public discourse that denounced it. The\nhistory of sexuality and reproduction demands a combined analysis of ideas and\npractice. Common Law and the Criminalization of Abortion Abortion was not always a crime. During the eighteenth and early nineteenth\ncenturies, abortion of early pregnancy was legal under common law. Abortions\nwere illegal only after \"quickening,\" the point at which a pregnant woman could\nfeel the movements of the fetus (approximately the fourth month of pregnancy).\nThe common law's attitude toward pregnancy and abortion was based on an\nunderstanding of pregnancy and human development as a process rather than an\nabsolute moment. Indeed, the term abortion referred only to the miscarriages of\nlater pregnancies, after quickening. What we would now identify as an early\ninduced abortion was not called an abortion at all. If an early pregnancy\nended, it had \"slipp[ed] away,\" or the menses had been \"restored.\" At\nconception and the earliest stage of pregnancy before quickening, no one\nbelieved that a human life existed; not even the Catholic Church took this\nview. Rather, the popular ethic regarding abortion and common law were grounded\nin the female experience of their own bodies. Colonial and early-nineteenth-century women, historians have learned,\nperceived conception as the \"blocking\" or \"obstructing\" of menstruation, which\nrequired attention. The cessation of the menses indicated a worrisome imbalance\nin the body and the need to bring the body back into balance by restoring the\nflow. This idea of menstruation corresponded with medical and popular\nunderstanding of sickness and health. The body was a delicate system of\nequilibrium that could easily be thrown out of balance -- by a change\nin weather\nor diet, for example -- and that then needed to be restored through active\nintervention. A disruption in the healthy body, in the worldview of patients\nand physicians, required a visible, often violent, physical response to\ntreatment in order to restore equilibrium. This theory underlay eighteenth and\nnineteenth-century regular medical practice, which emphasized heroic\nmeasures -- bleeding, blistering, purging, and puking -- in\nresponse to sickness.\nThe response to the blocking of the menses was part of this shared\nunderstanding of the body: women took drugs in order to make their menses\nregular and regarded the ensuing vomiting and evacuation as evidence of the\ndrugs' effective action. Restoring the menses was a domestic practice. The power of certain herbs to\nrestore menstruation was widely known. One colonial woman who feared pregnancy\nhad \"twice taken Savin; once boyled in milk and the other time strayned through\na Cloath.\" Savin, derived from juniper bushes, was the most popular\nabortifacient and easily acquired since junipers grew wild throughout the\ncountry. Other herbs used as abortifacients included pennyroyal, tansy, ergot,\nand seneca snakeroot. Slave women used cottonroot. Many of these useful plants\ncould be found in the woods or cultivated. in gardens, and women could refer to\nhome medical guides for recipes for \"bringing on the menses.\" Both of these concepts, blocked menses and quickening, must be taken seriously\nby late-twentieth-century observers. Blocked menses cannot be dismissed as an\nexcuse made by women who knew they were pregnant. Quickening was a moment\nrecognized by women and by law as a defining moment in human development. Once\nquickening occurred, women recognized a moral obligation to carry the fetus to\nterm. This age-old idea underpinned the practice of abortion in America. The\nlegal acceptance of induced miscarriages before quickening tacitly assumed that\nwomen had a basic right to bodily integrity. By the mid-eighteenth century, the most common means of inducing\nabortion -- by\ntaking drugs was commercialized. The availability of abortifacients was so\nwell-known that a common euphemism described their use. When Sarah Grosvenor, a\nConnecticut farm girl, confided to her sister in 1742 that she was \"taking the\ntrade,\" her sister understood. That Grosvenor successfully conveyed her meaning\nto her sister in three metaphoric words tells us a great deal about the world\nof mid-eighteenth-century New England. Many New Englanders, including these\nsisters, knew of the possibility of inducing an abortion by purchasing and\ningesting drugs. The need for a euphemism tells of the difficulty of speaking\nopenly about sex and reproductive control and of the need for secrecy. Yet it\nreveals an awareness that women could and did regulate their own fertility\nthrough abortion. Furthermore, abortifacients had become a profitable product\nsold by doctors, apothecaries, and other healers. The first statutes governing abortion in the United States, James Mohr has\nfound, were poison control measures designed to protect pregnant women like\nGrosvenor by controlling the sale of abortifacient drugs, which often killed\nthe women who took them. The proliferation of entrepreneurs who openly sold and\nadvertised abortifacients may have inspired this early legislation, passed in\nthe 1820s and 1830s. The 18 Illinois law, which prohibited the provision of\nabortifacients, was listed under \"poisoning.\" It is crucial to recognize what these early-nineteenth-century laws did not\ncover: they did not punish women for inducing abortions, and they did not\neliminate the concept of quickening. Even as poison control measures, they said\nnothing about growing the plants needed in one's own garden or mixing together\none's own home remedy in order to induce an abortion. The legal silence on\ndomestic practices suggests that the new laws were aimed at the\ncommercialization of this practice and, implicitly, retained to women the right\nto make their own decisions about their pregnancies before quickening. By the 1840s, the abortion business boomed. Despite the laws forbidding the\nsale of abortifacients, they were advertised in the popular press and could be\npurchased from physicians or pharmacists or through the mail. If drugs failed,\nwomen could go to a practitioner who specialized in performing instrumental\nabortions. Advertisements and newspaper exposes made it appear that what had\nbeen an occasional domestic practice had become a daily occurrence performed\nfor profit in northern cities. Madame Restell, for example, openly advertised\nand provided abortion services for thirty-five years. Restell began her\nabortion business in New York City in the late 1830s; by the mid-1840s, she had\noffices in Boston and Philadelphia and traveling agents who sold her \"Female\nMonthly Pills.\" Restell became the most infamous abortionist in the country,\nbut she was not the only abortionist. The clientele of these busy clinics were\nprimarily married, white, native-born Protestant women of the upper and middle\nclasses. In 1857, the newly organized AMA initiated a crusade to make abortion at every\nstage of pregnancy illegal. The antiabortion campaign grew in part, James Mohr\nhas shown, out of regular physicians' desire to win professional power, control\nmedical practice, and restrict their competitors, particularly Homeopaths and\nmidwives. \"Regular,\" or \"orthodox,\" physicians, practitioners of \"heroic\"\nmedicine, had come under attack in the 1820s and 1830s as elitist. They faced\ncompetition from a variety of practitioners from other medical sects,\ncollectively known as \"Irregulars.\" Through the 1870S, regular physicians\nacross the country worked for the passage of new criminal abortion laws. In\nsecuring criminal abortion laws, the Regulars won recognition of their\nparticular views as well as some state control over the practice of\nmedicine. Though professional issues underlay the medical campaign, gender, racial, and\nclass anxieties pushed the criminalization of abortion forward. The visible use\nof abortion by middle-class married women, in conjunction with other challenges\nto gender norms and changes in the social makeup of the nation, generated\nanxieties among American men of the same class. Birth rates among the Yankee\nclasses had declined by mid-century while immigrants poured into the country.\nAntiabortion activists pointed out that immigrant families, many of them\nCatholic, were larger and would soon outpopulate native-born white Yankees and\nthreaten their political power. Dr. Horatio R Storer, the leader of the medical\ncampaign against abortion, envisioned the spread of \"civilization\" west and\nsouth by native-born white Americans, not Mexicans, Chinese, Blacks, Indians,\nor Catholics. \"Shall\" these regions, he asked, \"be filled by our own children\nor by those of aliens? This is a question our women must answer; upon their\nloins depends the future destiny of the nation.\" Hostility to immigrants,\nCatholics, and people of color fueled this campaign to criminalize abortion.\nWhite male patriotism demanded that maternity be enforced among white\nProtestant women. The antiabortion campaign was antifeminist at its core. Women were condemned\nfor following \"fashion\" and for avoiding the self-sacrifice expected of\nmothers. \"The true wife,\" Storer declared, did not seek `'undue power in public\nlife, . . . undue control in domestic affairs, . . . [or] privileges not her\nown.\" The antiabortion campaign was a reactionary response to two important\nefforts of the nineteenth-century women's movements: the fight to admit women\ninto the regular medical profession and the battle to make men conform to a\nsingle standard of sexual behavior. The antiabortion campaign coincided with\nthe fight by male Regulars to keep women out of their medical schools,\nsocieties, and hospitals. Boston and Harvard University, Storer's hometown and\nalma mater, were key sites of struggle over women's place in medicine, and\nStorer was personally engaged in the battle against female physicians.\nAdvocates of women in medicine argued that women doctors would protect women\npatients from sexual violation. Regular male doctors degraded female physicians\nby accusing them, along with midwives, of performing abortions. The relative morality of men and women was of crucial importance to this\ncampaign. For the specialists, whose interest in the female reproductive system\nraised questions about their sexual morality, the antiabortion campaign was a\nway to proclaim their own high morality in contrast to their competitors, their\nfemale patients, and even the ministers who tolerated abortion. It was at the\nsame time a backlash against the women's movement's critique of male sexual\nbehavior and feminist claims to political power. Nineteenth-century feminists\nexpressed their anger with male sexual domination and promiscuity in a number\nof movements, including the campaigns against prostitution and slavery and the\nfight for temperance. All sections of the women's movement advocated \"voluntary\nmotherhood,\" a slogan that addressed both men's sexual violation of their wives\nand women's desire to control childbearing. Women saw themselves as morally\nsuperior and urged men to adopt a single standard  --  the female\nstandard of\nchastity until marriage, followed by monogamy and moderation. The campaign\nagainst abortion challenged this feminist analysis of men by condemning women\nfor having abortions. Indeed, Storer compared abortion to prostitution and, in\nso doing, called into question all claims made by middle-class\nnineteenth-century women on the basis of moral superiority. \"There is little\ndifference,\" he proclaimed, \"between the immorality\" of the man who visited\nprostitutes and the woman who aborted. The nineteenth-century women's movements\nnever defended abortion, but activist women and women doctors were blamed for\nthe practice of abortion nonetheless. The antiabortion campaign attempted to destroy the idea of quickening. As\nphysicians targeted quickening, they discredited women's experiences of\npregnancy and claimed pregnancy as medical terrain. \"Quickening,\" as Storer\ndescribed it, \"is in fact but a sensation.\" A sensation that had emotional,\nsocial, and legal meaning was thus denigrated. Quickening was based on women's\nown bodily sensations -- not on medical diagnosis. It made physicians, and\nobstetricians in particular, dependent on female self-diagnosis and judgment.\nQuickening could not be relied upon as an indicator of fetal life because,\nStorer argued, it did not occur at a standard moment. \"Many women never quicken\nat all,\" he joked about women's perceptions, \"though their children are born\nliving.\" Storer's propaganda aimed to erase the distinctions between earlier\nand later stages of pregnancy, thereby redefining the restoration of the\nmenses. What had previously been understood as a blockage and a restoration of\nthe menses prior to quickening was now associated with inducing a miscarriage\nafter quickening by labeling it abortion. Furthermore, Storer equated abortion\nwith infanticide. Regular medical men had entered the debate about sexual politics by attacking\nthe female practice of abortion as immoral, unwomanly, and unpatriotic. In\ngiving abortion new meaning, the Regulars provided a weapon that white,\nnative-born, male legislators could use against the women of their own class\nwho had been agitating for personal and political reform. Regular physicians\nwon passage of new criminal abortion laws because their campaign appealed to a\nset of fears of white, nativeborn, male elites about losing political power to\nCatholic immigrants and to women. Class privilege did not protect middle-class\nwhite women from public policy designed to control them. Although the\ncriminalization of abortion was aimed at middle-class white women, it affected\nwomen of every class and race. The new laws passed across the country between\n1860 and 1880 regarded abortion in an entirely different light from common law\nand the statutes regulating abortifacients. In general, the laws included two\ninnovations: they eliminated the common-law idea of quickening and prohibited\nabortion at any point in pregnancy. Some included punishment for the women who\nhad abortions. The \"Comstock Law\" passed in 1873 included abortion and birth\ncontrol in federal antiobscenity legislation; states and municipalities passed\nsimilar ordinances. The antiabortion laws made one exception: physicians could perform therapeutic\nabortions if pregnancy and childbirth threatened the woman's life. A bill\ncriminalizing abortion unless done for \" bona fide medical or surgical\npurposes\" passed the Illinois state legislature unanimously and was signed into\nlaw in 1867. A few years later, Illinois passed another law prohibiting the\nsale of abortifacients but made an exception for \"the written prescription of\nsome well known and respectable practicing physician.\" Physicians had won the\ncriminalization of abortion and retained to themselves alone the right to\ninduce abortions when they determined it necessary. Through the antiabortion campaign, doctors claimed scientific authority to\ndefine life and death. In so doing, they claimed the authority of religious\nleaders. In leading this moral crusade and thoroughly criticizing the\nministry's lack of interest in abortion, regular doctors set themselves above\nreligious leaders as well as above the general populace. The medical\nprofession's claim to moral purity and the authority of the clergy was a\nstepping-stone to greater social authority. Regular physicians won an important\nvictory when they persuaded the nation's states to criminalize abortion.\nPhysicians entered a new partnership with the state and won the power to set\nreproductive policy. In the process, women's perceptions of pregnancy were\ndelegitimated and women lost what had been a common-law right. Periodization: Changing Patterns of Illegal Abortion During the more than one hundred years that abortion was illegal in the United\nStates, the patterns; practice, policing, and politics of abortion all changed\nover time, though not always simultaneously. I trace the history along several\nlines at once, according to the location, practice, and availability of\nabortion as well as its regulation. Abortion was widely available throughout\nmuch of the era when abortion was a crime. Yet periods of tolerance were\npunctuated by moments of severe repression. At some points the changing\nstructure of medicine brought about crucial changes in the history of abortion;\nat others, changes in women's lives or the political and economic context came\nto the fore. In the nineteenth century, abortion came under attack at a moment when women\nwere claiming political power; in the twentieth century, it came under attack\nwhen they claimed sexual freedom. Abortion, like contraception, means that\nwomen can separate sex and procreation -- still a controversial notion.\nAntiabortion campaigns developed when women asserted sexual independence, as\nduring the Progressive Era and since the 1970s. When abortion was most firmly\nlinked to the needs of family rather than the freedoms of women, as during the\nDepression, it was most ignored by those who would suppress it. Periods of\nantiabortion activity mark moments of hostility to female independence. The epoch of illegal abortion may be broken down into four periods. The first\ncovers the time from the criminalization of abortion state-by-state,\naccomplished nationwide by 1880, to 1930. This period, covering fifty years, is\nheavily marked by continuity. As other historians have also found, the\nreproductive lives of most women and the day-to-day practice of most physicians\nchanged slowly. In this period, abortion was widely accepted and was practiced\nin women's homes and in the offices of physicians and midwives. The diversity\nof practitioners, the privacy of medical practice, and the autonomy of\nphysicians in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries made the\nwidespread medical practice of abortion possible. A crackdown on abortion\noccurred between 1890 and 1920 as specialists in obstetrics renewed the earlier\ncampaign against abortion, and the medical profession was drawn into the\nstate's enforcement system. The structural transformation that occurred during the 1930s, the second\nperiod, was crucial for the history of abortion. Abortion became more available\nand changed location. As the practice moved from private offices and homes to\nhospitals and clinics, abortion was consolidated in medical hands and became\nmore visible. The changes wrought by the Depression accelerated the pace of\nchange in the coming decades, particularly in the methods of enforcing the\ncriminal abortion laws. The third period was marked by increasing restrictions on abortion by state\nand medical authorities and intensifying demand for abortion from women of all\ngroups. This period begins in 1940, when the new methods of controlling\nabortion were first instituted, and continues through 1973, when they were\ndismantled. In reaction to the growing practice of abortion as well as apparent\nchanges in female gender and reproductive patterns, a backlash against abortion\ndeveloped. 1940 marks a dividing line as hospitals instituted new policies, and\npolice and prosecutors changed their tactics. The repression of abortion was\npart of the repression of political and personal deviance that took place in\nthe 1940s and 1950s. Yet even in this period, the practice of abortion expanded\nin new directions in response to relentless demand. The new repression of\nabortion, however, was devastating for women. A dual system of abortion,\ndivided by race and class, developed. During the postwar period, the\ncriminalization of abortion produced its harshest results. A new stage in the history of abortion, the movement to legalize it, overlaps\nwith the third period. The movement to decriminalize abortion began in the\nmid-1950s and arose out of the difficult experiences resulting from the\nrepression of abortion in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1950s, a handful of\nphysicians began to challenge the very abortion laws their profession had\nadvocated a century earlier. The progress of that challenge attests to the\ncontinuing power of the medical profession to make public policy regarding\nreproduction. As legal reform moved forward, a new feminist movement arose,\nwhich radically transformed the movement for legal change. When the women's\nmovement described abortion as an aspect of sexual freedom, they articulated a\nnew feminist meaning for abortion; when they demanded abortion as a right, they\nechoed generations of women. The structure of this book follows this periodization. The first half of the\nbook uncovers the history of abortion from the late nineteenth century through\nthe 1920s. Chapters 1 through 4 each cover different aspects of abortion, from\nwomen's lives to practice to politics to enforcement, during the first\nhalf-century of illegal abortion. The changes of the 1930S, both medical and\nsocial, precipitated other changes. The second half of the book traces the\nhistory of abortion in chronologically ordered chapters concluding with the\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions that ended the era of illegal abortion. Women's history of abortion needs to be examined both as a commonly felt need\nto control reproduction, arising from women's biological capacity to bear\nchildren and social relations that assign childbearing to women, and in terms\nof differences among women. This book differentiates among women by class, race\nand ethnic identity, and marital status. Though class did not absolutely\ndetermine access to or safety of abortion, class position helped define when a\nwoman felt she needed an abortion and affected the type available to her. In\ngeneral, urban women had greater access to abortion than rural women, though\nsome rural women located abortionists in their areas or traveled to cities for\nabortions. Race played a less obvious role in access to abortion, though the\ngrim statistics of the postwar period show the connection between\ndiscrimination and death. I have made a specific effort to locate sources\nrelated to African Americans in order to learn more about black women's use of\nabortion and how race shaped the history of abortion. Evidence concerning women\nof color is meager, however, until the 1930s, when medical and sociological\nstudies began separating their findings by race. Before then, contemporary\nobservers tended to focus their attention on the differences among many (white)\nforeign-born ethnic groups. This book integrates a national analysis of the history of abortion with a\nlocal study. The advantage of this approach is that it connects everyday life\nand local medical and legal practice to national policy. It examines that\nrelationship rather than assuming that all the public policy action takes place\non the federal level without reference to local and \"private\" events. I select\na major metropolis in order to uncover the nature of both abortion practices\nand police enforcement of the criminal abortion laws. Chicago, the second\nlargest city in the nation, is the focus of my local study. Chicago, the city\nin \"the heartland\" that has of ten served as a metaphor for the spirit of\nAmerica, was also known as an important medical center (the home of the AMA)\nand as a regional center for abortion. Trains brought European immigrants, men\nand women migrating from farms to the city, African Americans moving from the\nSouth to the North, all going to live and work in Chicago. The same trains\nbrought women looking for abortions. Directing my attention to one city enabled\nme to uncover the nitty-gritty details of the practice and regulation of\nabortion. Though much of my analysis of the history of abortion draws on Chicago as a\ncase study, sources verify that my findings hold true for other cities, large\nand small. Throughout I present national data and trends as well as regional\nones and take note of patterns elsewhere. The book moves back and forth from a\nnational overview of abortion practices and politics to a close look at events\nin Chicago. As medical practice became more standardized in hospitals, the\nstory becomes a more national one and key events take place in other cities:\nNew York, Detroit, Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington, D.C.,\nand elsewhere. This is primarily a study of abortion in urban areas, where\nabortion was concentrated. I comment occasionally on practices in rural areas,\nbut the history of reproductive control and abortion is likely to be somewhat\ndifferent there. Legal records, most notably lower-level court and criminal trial records, and\nmedical literature make up the foundation of my research. I have also surveyed\nother government documents, newspapers, popular periodicals, hospital records,\nand manuscript collections. Using these materials, I have delineated how\nmedical thinking and state regulation have changed over time. Yet this is more\nthan a study of prescriptive literature or policy. I have uncovered the\ncircumstances of hundreds of actual induced abortions and reconstructed\nchanging abortion practices. This study periodizes the history of abortion for\nthe first time. This book presents the lives of many women and their abortions in rich detail\nin order to convey the variety and intricacy of the situations that made\nabortion necessary for women. It is in the minutiae of women's lives that we\ncan discover why women had abortions and how they won sympathy from physicians\nwho belonged to a profession dedicated to fighting abortion. Abortion was a\nmoment in a woman's reproductive life. It cannot be separated from sexual\nrelations or reproduction as a whole. Women themselves did not separate them,\nnor should we, whether analyzing abortion in the past or present. This book\ndeepens our understanding of the female experience of reproduction and the\nconnections between sexuality, contraception, pregnancy, and childbirth. At its\nmost fundamental, a policy that restricts abortion is one that forces women\ninto maternity. Without contraceptives and abortion, most women in heterosexual\nrelationships will become pregnant and bear children, whether they want to or\nnot. When women sought abortions, they often revealed the texture of\nheterosexual relations and the rest of their lives. Many situations made\nenduring pregnancy unbearable to women. In using abortion, women rebelled\nagainst the law and asserted their sense that the decision to carry a pregnancy\nto term or to abort was theirs to make. A few expressed in words as well as in\naction the view that abortion was their right. The experiences of women's\nprivate lives and private practices over the course of one hundred years\naltered medical thinking and reshaped public policy. Despite the fact that\nwomen's abortion narratives are part of our own contemporary discourse, the\nstories told here have long been hidden. Copyright © 1996  by the Regents of the University of California.\n\nThis study points to the importance of studying the social history of\nsexuality as well as the medical and legal discourse about it. These discourses\nregarding abortion are important because they introduced new meanings of\nabortion and shaped people's views (and fears) of abortion and sexuality. I\nanalyze the language women used to describe abortion and the production of\nstories about abortion in the press and in the courtroom. Yet exclusive\nattention to professional or even popular discourse about abortion would result\nin a distorted picture of that history. Medical discourse has convinced some\nscholars that physicians did not perform abortions in the period of illegal\nabortion, and most press coverage of abortion in the early twentieth century\ngives the misleading impression that abortion was universally condemned and\ngenerally fatal. These conclusions are not correct. Analysis of discourse alone\nwould miss the ongoing medical practice of abortion in total contradiction of\nofficial medical mores. As others have pointed out, Foucault's theory\nconcerning the production of sexuality through discourse ignores differences in\nthe power of individuals and social groups to enter and shape discourse. The\npublicly articulated and published discussion of abortion rarely included the\nvoices or perspectives of women who had abortions, except to provide shocking\nexamples of depraved womanhood. Women who had abortions did not intervene to\nexplain themselves, but instead, in other nonpublic arenas, made their\nperspectives known and acted to obtain a much-needed method for preventing\nbirths. More tolerant attitudes toward abortion, rooted in material\nexperiences, persisted in the face of a public discourse that denounced it. The\nhistory of sexuality and reproduction demands a combined analysis of ideas and\npractice. Common Law and the Criminalization of Abortion Abortion was not always a crime. During the eighteenth and early nineteenth\ncenturies, abortion of early pregnancy was legal under common law. Abortions\nwere illegal only after \"quickening,\" the point at which a pregnant woman could\nfeel the movements of the fetus (approximately the fourth month of pregnancy).\nThe common law's attitude toward pregnancy and abortion was based on an\nunderstanding of pregnancy and human development as a process rather than an\nabsolute moment. Indeed, the term abortion referred only to the miscarriages of\nlater pregnancies, after quickening. What we would now identify as an early\ninduced abortion was not called an abortion at all. If an early pregnancy\nended, it had \"slipp[ed] away,\" or the menses had been \"restored.\" At\nconception and the earliest stage of pregnancy before quickening, no one\nbelieved that a human life existed; not even the Catholic Church took this\nview. Rather, the popular ethic regarding abortion and common law were grounded\nin the female experience of their own bodies.

This idea of menstruation corresponded with medical and popular\nunderstanding of sickness and health. The body was a delicate system of\nequilibrium that could easily be thrown out of balance -- by a change\nin weather\nor diet, for example -- and that then needed to be restored through active\nintervention. A disruption in the healthy body, in the worldview of patients\nand physicians, required a visible, often violent, physical response to\ntreatment in order to restore equilibrium. This theory underlay eighteenth and\nnineteenth-century regular medical practice, which emphasized heroic\nmeasures -- bleeding, blistering, purging, and puking -- in\nresponse to sickness.\nThe response to the blocking of the menses was part of this shared\nunderstanding of the body: women took drugs in order to make their menses\nregular and regarded the ensuing vomiting and evacuation as evidence of the\ndrugs' effective action. Restoring the menses was a domestic practice. The power of certain herbs to\nrestore menstruation was widely known. One colonial woman who feared pregnancy\nhad \"twice taken Savin; once boyled in milk and the other time strayned through\na Cloath.\" Savin, derived from juniper bushes, was the most popular\nabortifacient and easily acquired since junipers grew wild throughout the\ncountry. Other herbs used as abortifacients included pennyroyal, tansy, ergot,\nand seneca snakeroot. Slave women used cottonroot. Many of these useful plants\ncould be found in the woods or cultivated. in gardens, and women could refer to\nhome medical guides for recipes for \"bringing on the menses.\" Both of these concepts, blocked menses and quickening, must be taken seriously\nby late-twentieth-century observers. Blocked menses cannot be dismissed as an\nexcuse made by women who knew they were pregnant. Quickening was a moment\nrecognized by women and by law as a defining moment in human development. Once\nquickening occurred, women recognized a moral obligation to carry the fetus to\nterm. This age-old idea underpinned the practice of abortion in America. The\nlegal acceptance of induced miscarriages before quickening tacitly assumed that\nwomen had a basic right to bodily integrity.

In 1857, the newly organized AMA initiated a crusade to make abortion at every\nstage of pregnancy illegal. The antiabortion campaign grew in part, James Mohr\nhas shown, out of regular physicians' desire to win professional power, control\nmedical practice, and restrict their competitors, particularly Homeopaths and\nmidwives. \"Regular,\" or \"orthodox,\" physicians, practitioners of \"heroic\"\nmedicine, had come under attack in the 1820s and 1830s as elitist. They faced\ncompetition from a variety of practitioners from other medical sects,\ncollectively known as \"Irregulars.\" Through the 1870S, regular physicians\nacross the country worked for the passage of new criminal abortion laws. In\nsecuring criminal abortion laws, the Regulars won recognition of their\nparticular views as well as some state control over the practice of\nmedicine. Though professional issues underlay the medical campaign, gender, racial, and\nclass anxieties pushed the criminalization of abortion forward. The visible use\nof abortion by middle-class married women, in conjunction with other challenges\nto gender norms and changes in the social makeup of the nation, generated\nanxieties among American men of the same class. Birth rates among the Yankee\nclasses had declined by mid-century while immigrants poured into the country.\nAntiabortion activists pointed out that immigrant families, many of them\nCatholic, were larger and would soon outpopulate native-born white Yankees and\nthreaten their political power. Dr. Horatio R Storer, the leader of the medical\ncampaign against abortion, envisioned the spread of \"civilization\" west and\nsouth by native-born white Americans, not Mexicans, Chinese, Blacks, Indians,\nor Catholics. \"Shall\" these regions, he asked, \"be filled by our own children\nor by those of aliens? This is a question our women must answer; upon their\nloins depends the future destiny of the nation.\" Hostility to immigrants,\nCatholics, and people of color fueled this campaign to criminalize abortion.\nWhite male patriotism demanded that maternity be enforced among white\nProtestant women. The antiabortion campaign was antifeminist at its core. Women were condemned\nfor following \"fashion\" and for avoiding the self-sacrifice expected of\nmothers. \"The true wife,\" Storer declared, did not seek `'undue power in public\nlife, . . . undue control in domestic affairs, . . . [or] privileges not her\nown.\" The antiabortion campaign was a reactionary response to two important\nefforts of the nineteenth-century women's movements: the fight to admit women\ninto the regular medical profession and the battle to make men conform to a\nsingle standard of sexual behavior. The antiabortion campaign coincided with\nthe fight by male Regulars to keep women out of their medical schools,\nsocieties, and hospitals. Boston and Harvard University, Storer's hometown and\nalma mater, were key sites of struggle over women's place in medicine, and\nStorer was personally engaged in the battle against female physicians.\nAdvocates of women in medicine argued that women doctors would protect women\npatients from sexual violation. Regular male doctors degraded female physicians\nby accusing them, along with midwives, of performing abortions. The relative morality of men and women was of crucial importance to this\ncampaign. For the specialists, whose interest in the female reproductive system\nraised questions about their sexual morality, the antiabortion campaign was a\nway to proclaim their own high morality in contrast to their competitors, their\nfemale patients, and even the ministers who tolerated abortion. It was at the\nsame time a backlash against the women's movement's critique of male sexual\nbehavior and feminist claims to political power. Nineteenth-century feminists\nexpressed their anger with male sexual domination and promiscuity in a number\nof movements, including the campaigns against prostitution and slavery and the\nfight for temperance. All sections of the women's movement advocated \"voluntary\nmotherhood,\" a slogan that addressed both men's sexual violation of their wives\nand women's desire to control childbearing. Women saw themselves as morally\nsuperior and urged men to adopt a single standard  --  the female\nstandard of\nchastity until marriage, followed by monogamy and moderation. The campaign\nagainst abortion challenged this feminist analysis of men by condemning women\nfor having abortions. Indeed, Storer compared abortion to prostitution and, in\nso doing, called into question all claims made by middle-class\nnineteenth-century women on the basis of moral superiority. \"There is little\ndifference,\" he proclaimed, \"between the immorality\" of the man who visited\nprostitutes and the woman who aborted. The nineteenth-century women's movements\nnever defended abortion, but activist women and women doctors were blamed for\nthe practice of abortion nonetheless. The antiabortion campaign attempted to destroy the idea of quickening. As\nphysicians targeted quickening, they discredited women's experiences of\npregnancy and claimed pregnancy as medical terrain. \"Quickening,\" as Storer\ndescribed it, \"is in fact but a sensation.\" A sensation that had emotional,\nsocial, and legal meaning was thus denigrated. Quickening was based on women's\nown bodily sensations -- not on medical diagnosis. It made physicians, and\nobstetricians in particular, dependent on female self-diagnosis and judgment.\nQuickening could not be relied upon as an indicator of fetal life because,\nStorer argued, it did not occur at a standard moment. \"Many women never quicken\nat all,\" he joked about women's perceptions, \"though their children are born\nliving.\" Storer's propaganda aimed to erase the distinctions between earlier\nand later stages of pregnancy, thereby redefining the restoration of the\nmenses. What had previously been understood as a blockage and a restoration of\nthe menses prior to quickening was now associated with inducing a miscarriage\nafter quickening by labeling it abortion. Furthermore, Storer equated abortion\nwith infanticide. Regular medical men had entered the debate about sexual politics by attacking\nthe female practice of abortion as immoral, unwomanly, and unpatriotic. In\ngiving abortion new meaning, the Regulars provided a weapon that white,\nnative-born, male legislators could use against the women of their own class\nwho had been agitating for personal and political reform. Regular physicians\nwon passage of new criminal abortion laws because their campaign appealed to a\nset of fears of white, nativeborn, male elites about losing political power to\nCatholic immigrants and to women. Class privilege did not protect middle-class\nwhite women from public policy designed to control them. Although the\ncriminalization of abortion was aimed at middle-class white women, it affected\nwomen of every class and race. The new laws passed across the country between\n1860 and 1880 regarded abortion in an entirely different light from common law\nand the statutes regulating abortifacients. In general, the laws included two\ninnovations: they eliminated the common-law idea of quickening and prohibited\nabortion at any point in pregnancy. Some included punishment for the women who\nhad abortions. The \"Comstock Law\" passed in 1873 included abortion and birth\ncontrol in federal antiobscenity legislation; states and municipalities passed\nsimilar ordinances. The antiabortion laws made one exception: physicians could perform therapeutic\nabortions if pregnancy and childbirth threatened the woman's life. A bill\ncriminalizing abortion unless done for \" bona fide medical or surgical\npurposes\" passed the Illinois state legislature unanimously and was signed into\nlaw in 1867. A few years later, Illinois passed another law prohibiting the\nsale of abortifacients but made an exception for \"the written prescription of\nsome well known and respectable practicing physician.\" Physicians had won the\ncriminalization of abortion and retained to themselves alone the right to\ninduce abortions when they determined it necessary. Through the antiabortion campaign, doctors claimed scientific authority to\ndefine life and death. In so doing, they claimed the authority of religious\nleaders. In leading this moral crusade and thoroughly criticizing the\nministry's lack of interest in abortion, regular doctors set themselves above\nreligious leaders as well as above the general populace. The medical\nprofession's claim to moral purity and the authority of the clergy was a\nstepping-stone to greater social authority. Regular physicians won an important\nvictory when they persuaded the nation's states to criminalize abortion.\nPhysicians entered a new partnership with the state and won the power to set\nreproductive policy. In the process, women's perceptions of pregnancy were\ndelegitimated and women lost what had been a common-law right. Periodization: Changing Patterns of Illegal Abortion During the more than one hundred years that abortion was illegal in the United\nStates, the patterns; practice, policing, and politics of abortion all changed\nover time, though not always simultaneously. I trace the history along several\nlines at once, according to the location, practice, and availability of\nabortion as well as its regulation. Abortion was widely available throughout\nmuch of the era when abortion was a crime. Yet periods of tolerance were\npunctuated by moments of severe repression. At some points the changing\nstructure of medicine brought about crucial changes in the history of abortion;\nat others, changes in women's lives or the political and economic context came\nto the fore. In the nineteenth century, abortion came under attack at a moment when women\nwere claiming political power; in the twentieth century, it came under attack\nwhen they claimed sexual freedom. Abortion, like contraception, means that\nwomen can separate sex and procreation -- still a controversial notion.\nAntiabortion campaigns developed when women asserted sexual independence, as\nduring the Progressive Era and since the 1970s. When abortion was most firmly\nlinked to the needs of family rather than the freedoms of women, as during the\nDepression, it was most ignored by those who would suppress it. Periods of\nantiabortion activity mark moments of hostility to female independence. The epoch of illegal abortion may be broken down into four periods. The first\ncovers the time from the criminalization of abortion state-by-state,\naccomplished nationwide by 1880, to 1930. This period, covering fifty years, is\nheavily marked by continuity. As other historians have also found, the\nreproductive lives of most women and the day-to-day practice of most physicians\nchanged slowly. In this period, abortion was widely accepted and was practiced\nin women's homes and in the offices of physicians and midwives. The diversity\nof practitioners, the privacy of medical practice, and the autonomy of\nphysicians in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries made the\nwidespread medical practice of abortion possible. A crackdown on abortion\noccurred between 1890 and 1920 as specialists in obstetrics renewed the earlier\ncampaign against abortion, and the medical profession was drawn into the\nstate's enforcement system. The structural transformation that occurred during the 1930s, the second\nperiod, was crucial for the history of abortion. Abortion became more available\nand changed location. As the practice moved from private offices and homes to\nhospitals and clinics, abortion was consolidated in medical hands and became\nmore visible. The changes wrought by the Depression accelerated the pace of\nchange in the coming decades, particularly in the methods of enforcing the\ncriminal abortion laws. The third period was marked by increasing restrictions on abortion by state\nand medical authorities and intensifying demand for abortion from women of all\ngroups. This period begins in 1940, when the new methods of controlling\nabortion were first instituted, and continues through 1973, when they were\ndismantled. In reaction to the growing practice of abortion as well as apparent\nchanges in female gender and reproductive patterns, a backlash against abortion\ndeveloped. 1940 marks a dividing line as hospitals instituted new policies, and\npolice and prosecutors changed their tactics. The repression of abortion was\npart of the repression of political and personal deviance that took place in\nthe 1940s and 1950s. Yet even in this period, the practice of abortion expanded\nin new directions in response to relentless demand. The new repression of\nabortion, however, was devastating for women. A dual system of abortion,\ndivided by race and class, developed. During the postwar period, the\ncriminalization of abortion produced its harshest results. A new stage in the history of abortion, the movement to legalize it, overlaps\nwith the third period. The movement to decriminalize abortion began in the\nmid-1950s and arose out of the difficult experiences resulting from the\nrepression of abortion in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1950s, a handful of\nphysicians began to challenge the very abortion laws their profession had\nadvocated a century earlier. The progress of that challenge attests to the\ncontinuing power of the medical profession to make public policy regarding\nreproduction. As legal reform moved forward, a new feminist movement arose,\nwhich radically transformed the movement for legal change. When the women's\nmovement described abortion as an aspect of sexual freedom, they articulated a\nnew feminist meaning for abortion; when they demanded abortion as a right, they\nechoed generations of women. The structure of this book follows this periodization. The first half of the\nbook uncovers the history of abortion from the late nineteenth century through\nthe 1920s. Chapters 1 through 4 each cover different aspects of abortion, from\nwomen's lives to practice to politics to enforcement, during the first\nhalf-century of illegal abortion. The changes of the 1930S, both medical and\nsocial, precipitated other changes. The second half of the book traces the\nhistory of abortion in chronologically ordered chapters concluding with the\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions that ended the era of illegal abortion. Women's history of abortion needs to be examined both as a commonly felt need\nto control reproduction, arising from women's biological capacity to bear\nchildren and social relations that assign childbearing to women, and in terms\nof differences among women. This book differentiates among women by class, race\nand ethnic identity, and marital status. Though class did not absolutely\ndetermine access to or safety of abortion, class position helped define when a\nwoman felt she needed an abortion and affected the type available to her. In\ngeneral, urban women had greater access to abortion than rural women, though\nsome rural women located abortionists in their areas or traveled to cities for\nabortions. Race played a less obvious role in access to abortion, though the\ngrim statistics of the postwar period show the connection between\ndiscrimination and death. I have made a specific effort to locate sources\nrelated to African Americans in order to learn more about black women's use of\nabortion and how race shaped the history of abortion. Evidence concerning women\nof color is meager, however, until the 1930s, when medical and sociological\nstudies began separating their findings by race. Before then, contemporary\nobservers tended to focus their attention on the differences among many (white)\nforeign-born ethnic groups. This book integrates a national analysis of the history of abortion with a\nlocal study. The advantage of this approach is that it connects everyday life\nand local medical and legal practice to national policy. It examines that\nrelationship rather than assuming that all the public policy action takes place\non the federal level without reference to local and \"private\" events. I select\na major metropolis in order to uncover the nature of both abortion practices\nand police enforcement of the criminal abortion laws. Chicago, the second\nlargest city in the nation, is the focus of my local study. Chicago, the city\nin \"the heartland\" that has of ten served as a metaphor for the spirit of\nAmerica, was also known as an important medical center (the home of the AMA)\nand as a regional center for abortion. Trains brought European immigrants, men\nand women migrating from farms to the city, African Americans moving from the\nSouth to the North, all going to live and work in Chicago. The same trains\nbrought women looking for abortions. Directing my attention to one city enabled\nme to uncover the nitty-gritty details of the practice and regulation of\nabortion. Though much of my analysis of the history of abortion draws on Chicago as a\ncase study, sources verify that my findings hold true for other cities, large\nand small. Throughout I present national data and trends as well as regional\nones and take note of patterns elsewhere. The book moves back and forth from a\nnational overview of abortion practices and politics to a close look at events\nin Chicago. As medical practice became more standardized in hospitals, the\nstory becomes a more national one and key events take place in other cities:\nNew York, Detroit, Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington, D.C.,\nand elsewhere. This is primarily a study of abortion in urban areas, where\nabortion was concentrated. I comment occasionally on practices in rural areas,\nbut the history of reproductive control and abortion is likely to be somewhat\ndifferent there. Legal records, most notably lower-level court and criminal trial records, and\nmedical literature make up the foundation of my research. I have also surveyed\nother government documents, newspapers, popular periodicals, hospital records,\nand manuscript collections. Using these materials, I have delineated how\nmedical thinking and state regulation have changed over time. Yet this is more\nthan a study of prescriptive literature or policy. I have uncovered the\ncircumstances of hundreds of actual induced abortions and reconstructed\nchanging abortion practices. This study periodizes the history of abortion for\nthe first time. This book presents the lives of many women and their abortions in rich detail\nin order to convey the variety and intricacy of the situations that made\nabortion necessary for women. It is in the minutiae of women's lives that we\ncan discover why women had abortions and how they won sympathy from physicians\nwho belonged to a profession dedicated to fighting abortion. Abortion was a\nmoment in a woman's reproductive life. It cannot be separated from sexual\nrelations or reproduction as a whole. Women themselves did not separate them,\nnor should we, whether analyzing abortion in the past or present. This book\ndeepens our understanding of the female experience of reproduction and the\nconnections between sexuality, contraception, pregnancy, and childbirth. At its\nmost fundamental, a policy that restricts abortion is one that forces women\ninto maternity. Without contraceptives and abortion, most women in heterosexual\nrelationships will become pregnant and bear children, whether they want to or\nnot. When women sought abortions, they often revealed the texture of\nheterosexual relations and the rest of their lives. Many situations made\nenduring pregnancy unbearable to women. In using abortion, women rebelled\nagainst the law and asserted their sense that the decision to carry a pregnancy\nto term or to abort was theirs to make. A few expressed in words as well as in\naction the view that abortion was their right. The experiences of women's\nprivate lives and private practices over the course of one hundred years\naltered medical thinking and reshaped public policy. Despite the fact that\nwomen's abortion narratives are part of our own contemporary discourse, the\nstories told here have long been hidden.

During the eighteenth and early nineteenth\ncenturies, abortion of early pregnancy was legal under common law. Abortions\nwere illegal only after \"quickening,\" the point at which a pregnant woman could\nfeel the movements of the fetus (approximately the fourth month of pregnancy).\nThe common law's attitude toward pregnancy and abortion was based on an\nunderstanding of pregnancy and human development as a process rather than an\nabsolute moment. Indeed, the term abortion referred only to the miscarriages of\nlater pregnancies, after quickening. What we would now identify as an early\ninduced abortion was not called an abortion at all. If an early pregnancy\nended, it had \"slipp[ed] away,\" or the menses had been \"restored.\" At\nconception and the earliest stage of pregnancy before quickening, no one\nbelieved that a human life existed; not even the Catholic Church took this\nview. Rather, the popular ethic regarding abortion and common law were grounded\nin the female experience of their own bodies. Colonial and early-nineteenth-century women, historians have learned,\nperceived conception as the \"blocking\" or \"obstructing\" of menstruation, which\nrequired attention. The cessation of the menses indicated a worrisome imbalance\nin the body and the need to bring the body back into balance by restoring the\nflow. This idea of menstruation corresponded with medical and popular\nunderstanding of sickness and health. The body was a delicate system of\nequilibrium that could easily be thrown out of balance -- by a change\nin weather\nor diet, for example -- and that then needed to be restored through active\nintervention. A disruption in the healthy body, in the worldview of patients\nand physicians, required a visible, often violent, physical response to\ntreatment in order to restore equilibrium. This theory underlay eighteenth and\nnineteenth-century regular medical practice, which emphasized heroic\nmeasures -- bleeding, blistering, purging, and puking -- in\nresponse to sickness.\nThe response to the blocking of the menses was part of this shared\nunderstanding of the body: women took drugs in order to make their menses\nregular and regarded the ensuing vomiting and evacuation as evidence of the\ndrugs' effective action. Restoring the menses was a domestic practice. The power of certain herbs to\nrestore menstruation was widely known. One colonial woman who feared pregnancy\nhad \"twice taken Savin; once boyled in milk and the other time strayned through\na Cloath.\" Savin, derived from juniper bushes, was the most popular\nabortifacient and easily acquired since junipers grew wild throughout the\ncountry. Other herbs used as abortifacients included pennyroyal, tansy, ergot,\nand seneca snakeroot. Slave women used cottonroot. Many of these useful plants\ncould be found in the woods or cultivated. in gardens, and women could refer to\nhome medical guides for recipes for \"bringing on the menses.\" Both of these concepts, blocked menses and quickening, must be taken seriously\nby late-twentieth-century observers. Blocked menses cannot be dismissed as an\nexcuse made by women who knew they were pregnant. Quickening was a moment\nrecognized by women and by law as a defining moment in human development. Once\nquickening occurred, women recognized a moral obligation to carry the fetus to\nterm. This age-old idea underpinned the practice of abortion in America. The\nlegal acceptance of induced miscarriages before quickening tacitly assumed that\nwomen had a basic right to bodily integrity. By the mid-eighteenth century, the most common means of inducing\nabortion -- by\ntaking drugs was commercialized. The availability of abortifacients was so\nwell-known that a common euphemism described their use. When Sarah Grosvenor, a\nConnecticut farm girl, confided to her sister in 1742 that she was \"taking the\ntrade,\" her sister understood. That Grosvenor successfully conveyed her meaning\nto her sister in three metaphoric words tells us a great deal about the world\nof mid-eighteenth-century New England. Many New Englanders, including these\nsisters, knew of the possibility of inducing an abortion by purchasing and\ningesting drugs. The need for a euphemism tells of the difficulty of speaking\nopenly about sex and reproductive control and of the need for secrecy. Yet it\nreveals an awareness that women could and did regulate their own fertility\nthrough abortion. Furthermore, abortifacients had become a profitable product\nsold by doctors, apothecaries, and other healers. The first statutes governing abortion in the United States, James Mohr has\nfound, were poison control measures designed to protect pregnant women like\nGrosvenor by controlling the sale of abortifacient drugs, which often killed\nthe women who took them. The proliferation of entrepreneurs who openly sold and\nadvertised abortifacients may have inspired this early legislation, passed in\nthe 1820s and 1830s. The 18 Illinois law, which prohibited the provision of\nabortifacients, was listed under \"poisoning.\" It is crucial to recognize what these early-nineteenth-century laws did not\ncover: they did not punish women for inducing abortions, and they did not\neliminate the concept of quickening. Even as poison control measures, they said\nnothing about growing the plants needed in one's own garden or mixing together\none's own home remedy in order to induce an abortion. The legal silence on\ndomestic practices suggests that the new laws were aimed at the\ncommercialization of this practice and, implicitly, retained to women the right\nto make their own decisions about their pregnancies before quickening. By the 1840s, the abortion business boomed. Despite the laws forbidding the\nsale of abortifacients, they were advertised in the popular press and could be\npurchased from physicians or pharmacists or through the mail. If drugs failed,\nwomen could go to a practitioner who specialized in performing instrumental\nabortions. Advertisements and newspaper exposes made it appear that what had\nbeen an occasional domestic practice had become a daily occurrence performed\nfor profit in northern cities. Madame Restell, for example, openly advertised\nand provided abortion services for thirty-five years. Restell began her\nabortion business in New York City in the late 1830s; by the mid-1840s, she had\noffices in Boston and Philadelphia and traveling agents who sold her \"Female\nMonthly Pills.\" Restell became the most infamous abortionist in the country,\nbut she was not the only abortionist. The clientele of these busy clinics were\nprimarily married, white, native-born Protestant women of the upper and middle\nclasses. In 1857, the newly organized AMA initiated a crusade to make abortion at every\nstage of pregnancy illegal. The antiabortion campaign grew in part, James Mohr\nhas shown, out of regular physicians' desire to win professional power, control\nmedical practice, and restrict their competitors, particularly Homeopaths and\nmidwives. \"Regular,\" or \"orthodox,\" physicians, practitioners of \"heroic\"\nmedicine, had come under attack in the 1820s and 1830s as elitist. They faced\ncompetition from a variety of practitioners from other medical sects,\ncollectively known as \"Irregulars.\" Through the 1870S, regular physicians\nacross the country worked for the passage of new criminal abortion laws.

Regular physicians won an important\nvictory when they persuaded the nation's states to criminalize abortion.\nPhysicians entered a new partnership with the state and won the power to set\nreproductive policy. In the process, women's perceptions of pregnancy were\ndelegitimated and women lost what had been a common-law right. Periodization: Changing Patterns of Illegal Abortion During the more than one hundred years that abortion was illegal in the United\nStates, the patterns; practice, policing, and politics of abortion all changed\nover time, though not always simultaneously. I trace the history along several\nlines at once, according to the location, practice, and availability of\nabortion as well as its regulation. Abortion was widely available throughout\nmuch of the era when abortion was a crime. Yet periods of tolerance were\npunctuated by moments of severe repression. At some points the changing\nstructure of medicine brought about crucial changes in the history of abortion;\nat others, changes in women's lives or the political and economic context came\nto the fore. In the nineteenth century, abortion came under attack at a moment when women\nwere claiming political power; in the twentieth century, it came under attack\nwhen they claimed sexual freedom. Abortion, like contraception, means that\nwomen can separate sex and procreation -- still a controversial notion.\nAntiabortion campaigns developed when women asserted sexual independence, as\nduring the Progressive Era and since the 1970s. When abortion was most firmly\nlinked to the needs of family rather than the freedoms of women, as during the\nDepression, it was most ignored by those who would suppress it. Periods of\nantiabortion activity mark moments of hostility to female independence. The epoch of illegal abortion may be broken down into four periods. The first\ncovers the time from the criminalization of abortion state-by-state,\naccomplished nationwide by 1880, to 1930. This period, covering fifty years, is\nheavily marked by continuity. As other historians have also found, the\nreproductive lives of most women and the day-to-day practice of most physicians\nchanged slowly. In this period, abortion was widely accepted and was practiced\nin women's homes and in the offices of physicians and midwives. The diversity\nof practitioners, the privacy of medical practice, and the autonomy of\nphysicians in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries made the\nwidespread medical practice of abortion possible. A crackdown on abortion\noccurred between 1890 and 1920 as specialists in obstetrics renewed the earlier\ncampaign against abortion, and the medical profession was drawn into the\nstate's enforcement system. The structural transformation that occurred during the 1930s, the second\nperiod, was crucial for the history of abortion. Abortion became more available\nand changed location. As the practice moved from private offices and homes to\nhospitals and clinics, abortion was consolidated in medical hands and became\nmore visible. The changes wrought by the Depression accelerated the pace of\nchange in the coming decades, particularly in the methods of enforcing the\ncriminal abortion laws. The third period was marked by increasing restrictions on abortion by state\nand medical authorities and intensifying demand for abortion from women of all\ngroups. This period begins in 1940, when the new methods of controlling\nabortion were first instituted, and continues through 1973, when they were\ndismantled. In reaction to the growing practice of abortion as well as apparent\nchanges in female gender and reproductive patterns, a backlash against abortion\ndeveloped. 1940 marks a dividing line as hospitals instituted new policies, and\npolice and prosecutors changed their tactics. The repression of abortion was\npart of the repression of political and personal deviance that took place in\nthe 1940s and 1950s. Yet even in this period, the practice of abortion expanded\nin new directions in response to relentless demand. The new repression of\nabortion, however, was devastating for women. A dual system of abortion,\ndivided by race and class, developed. During the postwar period, the\ncriminalization of abortion produced its harshest results. A new stage in the history of abortion, the movement to legalize it, overlaps\nwith the third period. The movement to decriminalize abortion began in the\nmid-1950s and arose out of the difficult experiences resulting from the\nrepression of abortion in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1950s, a handful of\nphysicians began to challenge the very abortion laws their profession had\nadvocated a century earlier. The progress of that challenge attests to the\ncontinuing power of the medical profession to make public policy regarding\nreproduction. As legal reform moved forward, a new feminist movement arose,\nwhich radically transformed the movement for legal change. When the women's\nmovement described abortion as an aspect of sexual freedom, they articulated a\nnew feminist meaning for abortion; when they demanded abortion as a right, they\nechoed generations of women. The structure of this book follows this periodization. The first half of the\nbook uncovers the history of abortion from the late nineteenth century through\nthe 1920s. Chapters 1 through 4 each cover different aspects of abortion, from\nwomen's lives to practice to politics to enforcement, during the first\nhalf-century of illegal abortion. The changes of the 1930S, both medical and\nsocial, precipitated other changes. The second half of the book traces the\nhistory of abortion in chronologically ordered chapters concluding with the\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions that ended the era of illegal abortion. Women's history of abortion needs to be examined both as a commonly felt need\nto control reproduction, arising from women's biological capacity to bear\nchildren and social relations that assign childbearing to women, and in terms\nof differences among women. This book differentiates among women by class, race\nand ethnic identity, and marital status. Though class did not absolutely\ndetermine access to or safety of abortion, class position helped define when a\nwoman felt she needed an abortion and affected the type available to her. In\ngeneral, urban women had greater access to abortion than rural women, though\nsome rural women located abortionists in their areas or traveled to cities for\nabortions. Race played a less obvious role in access to abortion, though the\ngrim statistics of the postwar period show the connection between\ndiscrimination and death. I have made a specific effort to locate sources\nrelated to African Americans in order to learn more about black women's use of\nabortion and how race shaped the history of abortion. Evidence concerning women\nof color is meager, however, until the 1930s, when medical and sociological\nstudies began separating their findings by race. Before then, contemporary\nobservers tended to focus their attention on the differences among many (white)\nforeign-born ethnic groups. This book integrates a national analysis of the history of abortion with a\nlocal study. The advantage of this approach is that it connects everyday life\nand local medical and legal practice to national policy. It examines that\nrelationship rather than assuming that all the public policy action takes place\non the federal level without reference to local and \"private\" events. I select\na major metropolis in order to uncover the nature of both abortion practices\nand police enforcement of the criminal abortion laws. Chicago, the second\nlargest city in the nation, is the focus of my local study. Chicago, the city\nin \"the heartland\" that has of ten served as a metaphor for the spirit of\nAmerica, was also known as an important medical center (the home of the AMA)\nand as a regional center for abortion. Trains brought European immigrants, men\nand women migrating from farms to the city, African Americans moving from the\nSouth to the North, all going to live and work in Chicago. The same trains\nbrought women looking for abortions. Directing my attention to one city enabled\nme to uncover the nitty-gritty details of the practice and regulation of\nabortion. Though much of my analysis of the history of abortion draws on Chicago as a\ncase study, sources verify that my findings hold true for other cities, large\nand small. Throughout I present national data and trends as well as regional\nones and take note of patterns elsewhere. The book moves back and forth from a\nnational overview of abortion practices and politics to a close look at events\nin Chicago. As medical practice became more standardized in hospitals, the\nstory becomes a more national one and key events take place in other cities:\nNew York, Detroit, Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington, D.C.,\nand elsewhere. This is primarily a study of abortion in urban areas, where\nabortion was concentrated. I comment occasionally on practices in rural areas,\nbut the history of reproductive control and abortion is likely to be somewhat\ndifferent there. Legal records, most notably lower-level court and criminal trial records, and\nmedical literature make up the foundation of my research. I have also surveyed\nother government documents, newspapers, popular periodicals, hospital records,\nand manuscript collections. Using these materials, I have delineated how\nmedical thinking and state regulation have changed over time. Yet this is more\nthan a study of prescriptive literature or policy. I have uncovered the\ncircumstances of hundreds of actual induced abortions and reconstructed\nchanging abortion practices. This study periodizes the history of abortion for\nthe first time. This book presents the lives of many women and their abortions in rich detail\nin order to convey the variety and intricacy of the situations that made\nabortion necessary for women. It is in the minutiae of women's lives that we\ncan discover why women had abortions and how they won sympathy from physicians\nwho belonged to a profession dedicated to fighting abortion. Abortion was a\nmoment in a woman's reproductive life. It cannot be separated from sexual\nrelations or reproduction as a whole. Women themselves did not separate them,\nnor should we, whether analyzing abortion in the past or present. This book\ndeepens our understanding of the female experience of reproduction and the\nconnections between sexuality, contraception, pregnancy, and childbirth. At its\nmost fundamental, a policy that restricts abortion is one that forces women\ninto maternity. Without contraceptives and abortion, most women in heterosexual\nrelationships will become pregnant and bear children, whether they want to or\nnot. When women sought abortions, they often revealed the texture of\nheterosexual relations and the rest of their lives. Many situations made\nenduring pregnancy unbearable to women. In using abortion, women rebelled\nagainst the law and asserted their sense that the decision to carry a pregnancy\nto term or to abort was theirs to make. A few expressed in words as well as in\naction the view that abortion was their right. The experiences of women's\nprivate lives and private practices over the course of one hundred years\naltered medical thinking and reshaped public policy. Despite the fact that\nwomen's abortion narratives are part of our own contemporary discourse, the\nstories told here have long been hidden.

The cessation of the menses indicated a worrisome imbalance\nin the body and the need to bring the body back into balance by restoring the\nflow. This idea of menstruation corresponded with medical and popular\nunderstanding of sickness and health. The body was a delicate system of\nequilibrium that could easily be thrown out of balance -- by a change\nin weather\nor diet, for example -- and that then needed to be restored through active\nintervention. A disruption in the healthy body, in the worldview of patients\nand physicians, required a visible, often violent, physical response to\ntreatment in order to restore equilibrium. This theory underlay eighteenth and\nnineteenth-century regular medical practice, which emphasized heroic\nmeasures -- bleeding, blistering, purging, and puking -- in\nresponse to sickness.\nThe response to the blocking of the menses was part of this shared\nunderstanding of the body: women took drugs in order to make their menses\nregular and regarded the ensuing vomiting and evacuation as evidence of the\ndrugs' effective action. Restoring the menses was a domestic practice. The power of certain herbs to\nrestore menstruation was widely known. One colonial woman who feared pregnancy\nhad \"twice taken Savin; once boyled in milk and the other time strayned through\na Cloath.\" Savin, derived from juniper bushes, was the most popular\nabortifacient and easily acquired since junipers grew wild throughout the\ncountry. Other herbs used as abortifacients included pennyroyal, tansy, ergot,\nand seneca snakeroot. Slave women used cottonroot. Many of these useful plants\ncould be found in the woods or cultivated. in gardens, and women could refer to\nhome medical guides for recipes for \"bringing on the menses.\" Both of these concepts, blocked menses and quickening, must be taken seriously\nby late-twentieth-century observers. Blocked menses cannot be dismissed as an\nexcuse made by women who knew they were pregnant. Quickening was a moment\nrecognized by women and by law as a defining moment in human development. Once\nquickening occurred, women recognized a moral obligation to carry the fetus to\nterm. This age-old idea underpinned the practice of abortion in America. The\nlegal acceptance of induced miscarriages before quickening tacitly assumed that\nwomen had a basic right to bodily integrity. By the mid-eighteenth century, the most common means of inducing\nabortion -- by\ntaking drugs was commercialized. The availability of abortifacients was so\nwell-known that a common euphemism described their use. When Sarah Grosvenor, a\nConnecticut farm girl, confided to her sister in 1742 that she was \"taking the\ntrade,\" her sister understood. That Grosvenor successfully conveyed her meaning\nto her sister in three metaphoric words tells us a great deal about the world\nof mid-eighteenth-century New England. Many New Englanders, including these\nsisters, knew of the possibility of inducing an abortion by purchasing and\ningesting drugs. The need for a euphemism tells of the difficulty of speaking\nopenly about sex and reproductive control and of the need for secrecy. Yet it\nreveals an awareness that women could and did regulate their own fertility\nthrough abortion. Furthermore, abortifacients had become a profitable product\nsold by doctors, apothecaries, and other healers. The first statutes governing abortion in the United States, James Mohr has\nfound, were poison control measures designed to protect pregnant women like\nGrosvenor by controlling the sale of abortifacient drugs, which often killed\nthe women who took them. The proliferation of entrepreneurs who openly sold and\nadvertised abortifacients may have inspired this early legislation, passed in\nthe 1820s and 1830s. The 18 Illinois law, which prohibited the provision of\nabortifacients, was listed under \"poisoning.\" It is crucial to recognize what these early-nineteenth-century laws did not\ncover: they did not punish women for inducing abortions, and they did not\neliminate the concept of quickening. Even as poison control measures, they said\nnothing about growing the plants needed in one's own garden or mixing together\none's own home remedy in order to induce an abortion. The legal silence on\ndomestic practices suggests that the new laws were aimed at the\ncommercialization of this practice and, implicitly, retained to women the right\nto make their own decisions about their pregnancies before quickening. By the 1840s, the abortion business boomed. Despite the laws forbidding the\nsale of abortifacients, they were advertised in the popular press and could be\npurchased from physicians or pharmacists or through the mail. If drugs failed,\nwomen could go to a practitioner who specialized in performing instrumental\nabortions. Advertisements and newspaper exposes made it appear that what had\nbeen an occasional domestic practice had become a daily occurrence performed\nfor profit in northern cities. Madame Restell, for example, openly advertised\nand provided abortion services for thirty-five years. Restell began her\nabortion business in New York City in the late 1830s; by the mid-1840s, she had\noffices in Boston and Philadelphia and traveling agents who sold her \"Female\nMonthly Pills.\" Restell became the most infamous abortionist in the country,\nbut she was not the only abortionist. The clientele of these busy clinics were\nprimarily married, white, native-born Protestant women of the upper and middle\nclasses. In 1857, the newly organized AMA initiated a crusade to make abortion at every\nstage of pregnancy illegal. The antiabortion campaign grew in part, James Mohr\nhas shown, out of regular physicians' desire to win professional power, control\nmedical practice, and restrict their competitors, particularly Homeopaths and\nmidwives. \"Regular,\" or \"orthodox,\" physicians, practitioners of \"heroic\"\nmedicine, had come under attack in the 1820s and 1830s as elitist. They faced\ncompetition from a variety of practitioners from other medical sects,\ncollectively known as \"Irregulars.\" Through the 1870S, regular physicians\nacross the country worked for the passage of new criminal abortion laws. In\nsecuring criminal abortion laws, the Regulars won recognition of their\nparticular views as well as some state control over the practice of\nmedicine. Though professional issues underlay the medical campaign, gender, racial, and\nclass anxieties pushed the criminalization of abortion forward. The visible use\nof abortion by middle-class married women, in conjunction with other challenges\nto gender norms and changes in the social makeup of the nation, generated\nanxieties among American men of the same class. Birth rates among the Yankee\nclasses had declined by mid-century while immigrants poured into the country.\nAntiabortion activists pointed out that immigrant families, many of them\nCatholic, were larger and would soon outpopulate native-born white Yankees and\nthreaten their political power. Dr. Horatio R Storer, the leader of the medical\ncampaign against abortion, envisioned the spread of \"civilization\" west and\nsouth by native-born white Americans, not Mexicans, Chinese, Blacks, Indians,\nor Catholics. \"Shall\" these regions, he asked, \"be filled by our own children\nor by those of aliens? This is a question our women must answer; upon their\nloins depends the future destiny of the nation.\" Hostility to immigrants,\nCatholics, and people of color fueled this campaign to criminalize abortion.\nWhite male patriotism demanded that maternity be enforced among white\nProtestant women. The antiabortion campaign was antifeminist at its core. Women were condemned\nfor following \"fashion\" and for avoiding the self-sacrifice expected of\nmothers. \"The true wife,\" Storer declared, did not seek `'undue power in public\nlife, . . . undue control in domestic affairs, . . . [or] privileges not her\nown.\" The antiabortion campaign was a reactionary response to two important\nefforts of the nineteenth-century women's movements: the fight to admit women\ninto the regular medical profession and the battle to make men conform to a\nsingle standard of sexual behavior. The antiabortion campaign coincided with\nthe fight by male Regulars to keep women out of their medical schools,\nsocieties, and hospitals. Boston and Harvard University, Storer's hometown and\nalma mater, were key sites of struggle over women's place in medicine, and\nStorer was personally engaged in the battle against female physicians.\nAdvocates of women in medicine argued that women doctors would protect women\npatients from sexual violation. Regular male doctors degraded female physicians\nby accusing them, along with midwives, of performing abortions. The relative morality of men and women was of crucial importance to this\ncampaign. For the specialists, whose interest in the female reproductive system\nraised questions about their sexual morality, the antiabortion campaign was a\nway to proclaim their own high morality in contrast to their competitors, their\nfemale patients, and even the ministers who tolerated abortion. It was at the\nsame time a backlash against the women's movement's critique of male sexual\nbehavior and feminist claims to political power. Nineteenth-century feminists\nexpressed their anger with male sexual domination and promiscuity in a number\nof movements, including the campaigns against prostitution and slavery and the\nfight for temperance. All sections of the women's movement advocated \"voluntary\nmotherhood,\" a slogan that addressed both men's sexual violation of their wives\nand women's desire to control childbearing. Women saw themselves as morally\nsuperior and urged men to adopt a single standard  --  the female\nstandard of\nchastity until marriage, followed by monogamy and moderation. The campaign\nagainst abortion challenged this feminist analysis of men by condemning women\nfor having abortions. Indeed, Storer compared abortion to prostitution and, in\nso doing, called into question all claims made by middle-class\nnineteenth-century women on the basis of moral superiority. \"There is little\ndifference,\" he proclaimed, \"between the immorality\" of the man who visited\nprostitutes and the woman who aborted. The nineteenth-century women's movements\nnever defended abortion, but activist women and women doctors were blamed for\nthe practice of abortion nonetheless. The antiabortion campaign attempted to destroy the idea of quickening. As\nphysicians targeted quickening, they discredited women's experiences of\npregnancy and claimed pregnancy as medical terrain. \"Quickening,\" as Storer\ndescribed it, \"is in fact but a sensation.\" A sensation that had emotional,\nsocial, and legal meaning was thus denigrated. Quickening was based on women's\nown bodily sensations -- not on medical diagnosis. It made physicians, and\nobstetricians in particular, dependent on female self-diagnosis and judgment.\nQuickening could not be relied upon as an indicator of fetal life because,\nStorer argued, it did not occur at a standard moment. \"Many women never quicken\nat all,\" he joked about women's perceptions, \"though their children are born\nliving.\" Storer's propaganda aimed to erase the distinctions between earlier\nand later stages of pregnancy, thereby redefining the restoration of the\nmenses. What had previously been understood as a blockage and a restoration of\nthe menses prior to quickening was now associated with inducing a miscarriage\nafter quickening by labeling it abortion. Furthermore, Storer equated abortion\nwith infanticide. Regular medical men had entered the debate about sexual politics by attacking\nthe female practice of abortion as immoral, unwomanly, and unpatriotic. In\ngiving abortion new meaning, the Regulars provided a weapon that white,\nnative-born, male legislators could use against the women of their own class\nwho had been agitating for personal and political reform. Regular physicians\nwon passage of new criminal abortion laws because their campaign appealed to a\nset of fears of white, nativeborn, male elites about losing political power to\nCatholic immigrants and to women. Class privilege did not protect middle-class\nwhite women from public policy designed to control them. Although the\ncriminalization of abortion was aimed at middle-class white women, it affected\nwomen of every class and race. The new laws passed across the country between\n1860 and 1880 regarded abortion in an entirely different light from common law\nand the statutes regulating abortifacients. In general, the laws included two\ninnovations: they eliminated the common-law idea of quickening and prohibited\nabortion at any point in pregnancy. Some included punishment for the women who\nhad abortions. The \"Comstock Law\" passed in 1873 included abortion and birth\ncontrol in federal antiobscenity legislation; states and municipalities passed\nsimilar ordinances. The antiabortion laws made one exception: physicians could perform therapeutic\nabortions if pregnancy and childbirth threatened the woman's life. A bill\ncriminalizing abortion unless done for \" bona fide medical or surgical\npurposes\" passed the Illinois state legislature unanimously and was signed into\nlaw in 1867. A few years later, Illinois passed another law prohibiting the\nsale of abortifacients but made an exception for \"the written prescription of\nsome well known and respectable practicing physician.\" Physicians had won the\ncriminalization of abortion and retained to themselves alone the right to\ninduce abortions when they determined it necessary. Through the antiabortion campaign, doctors claimed scientific authority to\ndefine life and death. In so doing, they claimed the authority of religious\nleaders. In leading this moral crusade and thoroughly criticizing the\nministry's lack of interest in abortion, regular doctors set themselves above\nreligious leaders as well as above the general populace. The medical\nprofession's claim to moral purity and the authority of the clergy was a\nstepping-stone to greater social authority. Regular physicians won an important\nvictory when they persuaded the nation's states to criminalize abortion.\nPhysicians entered a new partnership with the state and won the power to set\nreproductive policy. In the process, women's perceptions of pregnancy were\ndelegitimated and women lost what had been a common-law right.

It is in the minutiae of women's lives that we\ncan discover why women had abortions and how they won sympathy from physicians\nwho belonged to a profession dedicated to fighting abortion. Abortion was a\nmoment in a woman's reproductive life. It cannot be separated from sexual\nrelations or reproduction as a whole. Women themselves did not separate them,\nnor should we, whether analyzing abortion in the past or present. This book\ndeepens our understanding of the female experience of reproduction and the\nconnections between sexuality, contraception, pregnancy, and childbirth. At its\nmost fundamental, a policy that restricts abortion is one that forces women\ninto maternity. Without contraceptives and abortion, most women in heterosexual\nrelationships will become pregnant and bear children, whether they want to or\nnot. When women sought abortions, they often revealed the texture of\nheterosexual relations and the rest of their lives. Many situations made\nenduring pregnancy unbearable to women. In using abortion, women rebelled\nagainst the law and asserted their sense that the decision to carry a pregnancy\nto term or to abort was theirs to make. A few expressed in words as well as in\naction the view that abortion was their right. The experiences of women's\nprivate lives and private practices over the course of one hundred years\naltered medical thinking and reshaped public policy. Despite the fact that\nwomen's abortion narratives are part of our own contemporary discourse, the\nstories told here have long been hidden.

One colonial woman who feared pregnancy\nhad \"twice taken Savin; once boyled in milk and the other time strayned through\na Cloath.\" Savin, derived from juniper bushes, was the most popular\nabortifacient and easily acquired since junipers grew wild throughout the\ncountry. Other herbs used as abortifacients included pennyroyal, tansy, ergot,\nand seneca snakeroot. Slave women used cottonroot. Many of these useful plants\ncould be found in the woods or cultivated. in gardens, and women could refer to\nhome medical guides for recipes for \"bringing on the menses.\" Both of these concepts, blocked menses and quickening, must be taken seriously\nby late-twentieth-century observers. Blocked menses cannot be dismissed as an\nexcuse made by women who knew they were pregnant. Quickening was a moment\nrecognized by women and by law as a defining moment in human development. Once\nquickening occurred, women recognized a moral obligation to carry the fetus to\nterm. This age-old idea underpinned the practice of abortion in America. The\nlegal acceptance of induced miscarriages before quickening tacitly assumed that\nwomen had a basic right to bodily integrity. By the mid-eighteenth century, the most common means of inducing\nabortion -- by\ntaking drugs was commercialized. The availability of abortifacients was so\nwell-known that a common euphemism described their use. When Sarah Grosvenor, a\nConnecticut farm girl, confided to her sister in 1742 that she was \"taking the\ntrade,\" her sister understood. That Grosvenor successfully conveyed her meaning\nto her sister in three metaphoric words tells us a great deal about the world\nof mid-eighteenth-century New England. Many New Englanders, including these\nsisters, knew of the possibility of inducing an abortion by purchasing and\ningesting drugs. The need for a euphemism tells of the difficulty of speaking\nopenly about sex and reproductive control and of the need for secrecy. Yet it\nreveals an awareness that women could and did regulate their own fertility\nthrough abortion. Furthermore, abortifacients had become a profitable product\nsold by doctors, apothecaries, and other healers. The first statutes governing abortion in the United States, James Mohr has\nfound, were poison control measures designed to protect pregnant women like\nGrosvenor by controlling the sale of abortifacient drugs, which often killed\nthe women who took them. The proliferation of entrepreneurs who openly sold and\nadvertised abortifacients may have inspired this early legislation, passed in\nthe 1820s and 1830s. The 18 Illinois law, which prohibited the provision of\nabortifacients, was listed under \"poisoning.\" It is crucial to recognize what these early-nineteenth-century laws did not\ncover: they did not punish women for inducing abortions, and they did not\neliminate the concept of quickening. Even as poison control measures, they said\nnothing about growing the plants needed in one's own garden or mixing together\none's own home remedy in order to induce an abortion. The legal silence on\ndomestic practices suggests that the new laws were aimed at the\ncommercialization of this practice and, implicitly, retained to women the right\nto make their own decisions about their pregnancies before quickening. By the 1840s, the abortion business boomed. Despite the laws forbidding the\nsale of abortifacients, they were advertised in the popular press and could be\npurchased from physicians or pharmacists or through the mail. If drugs failed,\nwomen could go to a practitioner who specialized in performing instrumental\nabortions. Advertisements and newspaper exposes made it appear that what had\nbeen an occasional domestic practice had become a daily occurrence performed\nfor profit in northern cities. Madame Restell, for example, openly advertised\nand provided abortion services for thirty-five years. Restell began her\nabortion business in New York City in the late 1830s; by the mid-1840s, she had\noffices in Boston and Philadelphia and traveling agents who sold her \"Female\nMonthly Pills.\" Restell became the most infamous abortionist in the country,\nbut she was not the only abortionist. The clientele of these busy clinics were\nprimarily married, white, native-born Protestant women of the upper and middle\nclasses. In 1857, the newly organized AMA initiated a crusade to make abortion at every\nstage of pregnancy illegal. The antiabortion campaign grew in part, James Mohr\nhas shown, out of regular physicians' desire to win professional power, control\nmedical practice, and restrict their competitors, particularly Homeopaths and\nmidwives. \"Regular,\" or \"orthodox,\" physicians, practitioners of \"heroic\"\nmedicine, had come under attack in the 1820s and 1830s as elitist. They faced\ncompetition from a variety of practitioners from other medical sects,\ncollectively known as \"Irregulars.\" Through the 1870S, regular physicians\nacross the country worked for the passage of new criminal abortion laws. In\nsecuring criminal abortion laws, the Regulars won recognition of their\nparticular views as well as some state control over the practice of\nmedicine. Though professional issues underlay the medical campaign, gender, racial, and\nclass anxieties pushed the criminalization of abortion forward. The visible use\nof abortion by middle-class married women, in conjunction with other challenges\nto gender norms and changes in the social makeup of the nation, generated\nanxieties among American men of the same class. Birth rates among the Yankee\nclasses had declined by mid-century while immigrants poured into the country.\nAntiabortion activists pointed out that immigrant families, many of them\nCatholic, were larger and would soon outpopulate native-born white Yankees and\nthreaten their political power. Dr. Horatio R Storer, the leader of the medical\ncampaign against abortion, envisioned the spread of \"civilization\" west and\nsouth by native-born white Americans, not Mexicans, Chinese, Blacks, Indians,\nor Catholics. \"Shall\" these regions, he asked, \"be filled by our own children\nor by those of aliens? This is a question our women must answer; upon their\nloins depends the future destiny of the nation.\" Hostility to immigrants,\nCatholics, and people of color fueled this campaign to criminalize abortion.\nWhite male patriotism demanded that maternity be enforced among white\nProtestant women. The antiabortion campaign was antifeminist at its core. Women were condemned\nfor following \"fashion\" and for avoiding the self-sacrifice expected of\nmothers. \"The true wife,\" Storer declared, did not seek `'undue power in public\nlife, . . . undue control in domestic affairs, . . . [or] privileges not her\nown.\" The antiabortion campaign was a reactionary response to two important\nefforts of the nineteenth-century women's movements: the fight to admit women\ninto the regular medical profession and the battle to make men conform to a\nsingle standard of sexual behavior. The antiabortion campaign coincided with\nthe fight by male Regulars to keep women out of their medical schools,\nsocieties, and hospitals. Boston and Harvard University, Storer's hometown and\nalma mater, were key sites of struggle over women's place in medicine, and\nStorer was personally engaged in the battle against female physicians.\nAdvocates of women in medicine argued that women doctors would protect women\npatients from sexual violation. Regular male doctors degraded female physicians\nby accusing them, along with midwives, of performing abortions. The relative morality of men and women was of crucial importance to this\ncampaign. For the specialists, whose interest in the female reproductive system\nraised questions about their sexual morality, the antiabortion campaign was a\nway to proclaim their own high morality in contrast to their competitors, their\nfemale patients, and even the ministers who tolerated abortion. It was at the\nsame time a backlash against the women's movement's critique of male sexual\nbehavior and feminist claims to political power. Nineteenth-century feminists\nexpressed their anger with male sexual domination and promiscuity in a number\nof movements, including the campaigns against prostitution and slavery and the\nfight for temperance. All sections of the women's movement advocated \"voluntary\nmotherhood,\" a slogan that addressed both men's sexual violation of their wives\nand women's desire to control childbearing. Women saw themselves as morally\nsuperior and urged men to adopt a single standard  --  the female\nstandard of\nchastity until marriage, followed by monogamy and moderation. The campaign\nagainst abortion challenged this feminist analysis of men by condemning women\nfor having abortions. Indeed, Storer compared abortion to prostitution and, in\nso doing, called into question all claims made by middle-class\nnineteenth-century women on the basis of moral superiority. \"There is little\ndifference,\" he proclaimed, \"between the immorality\" of the man who visited\nprostitutes and the woman who aborted. The nineteenth-century women's movements\nnever defended abortion, but activist women and women doctors were blamed for\nthe practice of abortion nonetheless. The antiabortion campaign attempted to destroy the idea of quickening. As\nphysicians targeted quickening, they discredited women's experiences of\npregnancy and claimed pregnancy as medical terrain. \"Quickening,\" as Storer\ndescribed it, \"is in fact but a sensation.\" A sensation that had emotional,\nsocial, and legal meaning was thus denigrated. Quickening was based on women's\nown bodily sensations -- not on medical diagnosis. It made physicians, and\nobstetricians in particular, dependent on female self-diagnosis and judgment.\nQuickening could not be relied upon as an indicator of fetal life because,\nStorer argued, it did not occur at a standard moment. \"Many women never quicken\nat all,\" he joked about women's perceptions, \"though their children are born\nliving.\" Storer's propaganda aimed to erase the distinctions between earlier\nand later stages of pregnancy, thereby redefining the restoration of the\nmenses. What had previously been understood as a blockage and a restoration of\nthe menses prior to quickening was now associated with inducing a miscarriage\nafter quickening by labeling it abortion. Furthermore, Storer equated abortion\nwith infanticide. Regular medical men had entered the debate about sexual politics by attacking\nthe female practice of abortion as immoral, unwomanly, and unpatriotic. In\ngiving abortion new meaning, the Regulars provided a weapon that white,\nnative-born, male legislators could use against the women of their own class\nwho had been agitating for personal and political reform. Regular physicians\nwon passage of new criminal abortion laws because their campaign appealed to a\nset of fears of white, nativeborn, male elites about losing political power to\nCatholic immigrants and to women. Class privilege did not protect middle-class\nwhite women from public policy designed to control them. Although the\ncriminalization of abortion was aimed at middle-class white women, it affected\nwomen of every class and race. The new laws passed across the country between\n1860 and 1880 regarded abortion in an entirely different light from common law\nand the statutes regulating abortifacients. In general, the laws included two\ninnovations: they eliminated the common-law idea of quickening and prohibited\nabortion at any point in pregnancy. Some included punishment for the women who\nhad abortions. The \"Comstock Law\" passed in 1873 included abortion and birth\ncontrol in federal antiobscenity legislation; states and municipalities passed\nsimilar ordinances. The antiabortion laws made one exception: physicians could perform therapeutic\nabortions if pregnancy and childbirth threatened the woman's life. A bill\ncriminalizing abortion unless done for \" bona fide medical or surgical\npurposes\" passed the Illinois state legislature unanimously and was signed into\nlaw in 1867. A few years later, Illinois passed another law prohibiting the\nsale of abortifacients but made an exception for \"the written prescription of\nsome well known and respectable practicing physician.\" Physicians had won the\ncriminalization of abortion and retained to themselves alone the right to\ninduce abortions when they determined it necessary. Through the antiabortion campaign, doctors claimed scientific authority to\ndefine life and death. In so doing, they claimed the authority of religious\nleaders. In leading this moral crusade and thoroughly criticizing the\nministry's lack of interest in abortion, regular doctors set themselves above\nreligious leaders as well as above the general populace. The medical\nprofession's claim to moral purity and the authority of the clergy was a\nstepping-stone to greater social authority. Regular physicians won an important\nvictory when they persuaded the nation's states to criminalize abortion.\nPhysicians entered a new partnership with the state and won the power to set\nreproductive policy. In the process, women's perceptions of pregnancy were\ndelegitimated and women lost what had been a common-law right. Periodization: Changing Patterns of Illegal Abortion During the more than one hundred years that abortion was illegal in the United\nStates, the patterns; practice, policing, and politics of abortion all changed\nover time, though not always simultaneously. I trace the history along several\nlines at once, according to the location, practice, and availability of\nabortion as well as its regulation. Abortion was widely available throughout\nmuch of the era when abortion was a crime. Yet periods of tolerance were\npunctuated by moments of severe repression. At some points the changing\nstructure of medicine brought about crucial changes in the history of abortion;\nat others, changes in women's lives or the political and economic context came\nto the fore. In the nineteenth century, abortion came under attack at a moment when women\nwere claiming political power; in the twentieth century, it came under attack\nwhen they claimed sexual freedom. Abortion, like contraception, means that\nwomen can separate sex and procreation -- still a controversial notion.\nAntiabortion campaigns developed when women asserted sexual independence, as\nduring the Progressive Era and since the 1970s. When abortion was most firmly\nlinked to the needs of family rather than the freedoms of women, as during the\nDepression, it was most ignored by those who would suppress it. Periods of\nantiabortion activity mark moments of hostility to female independence. The epoch of illegal abortion may be broken down into four periods. The first\ncovers the time from the criminalization of abortion state-by-state,\naccomplished nationwide by 1880, to 1930. This period, covering fifty years, is\nheavily marked by continuity. As other historians have also found, the\nreproductive lives of most women and the day-to-day practice of most physicians\nchanged slowly. In this period, abortion was widely accepted and was practiced\nin women's homes and in the offices of physicians and midwives. The diversity\nof practitioners, the privacy of medical practice, and the autonomy of\nphysicians in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries made the\nwidespread medical practice of abortion possible. A crackdown on abortion\noccurred between 1890 and 1920 as specialists in obstetrics renewed the earlier\ncampaign against abortion, and the medical profession was drawn into the\nstate's enforcement system. The structural transformation that occurred during the 1930s, the second\nperiod, was crucial for the history of abortion. Abortion became more available\nand changed location. As the practice moved from private offices and homes to\nhospitals and clinics, abortion was consolidated in medical hands and became\nmore visible. The changes wrought by the Depression accelerated the pace of\nchange in the coming decades, particularly in the methods of enforcing the\ncriminal abortion laws. The third period was marked by increasing restrictions on abortion by state\nand medical authorities and intensifying demand for abortion from women of all\ngroups. This period begins in 1940, when the new methods of controlling\nabortion were first instituted, and continues through 1973, when they were\ndismantled. In reaction to the growing practice of abortion as well as apparent\nchanges in female gender and reproductive patterns, a backlash against abortion\ndeveloped. 1940 marks a dividing line as hospitals instituted new policies, and\npolice and prosecutors changed their tactics. The repression of abortion was\npart of the repression of political and personal deviance that took place in\nthe 1940s and 1950s. Yet even in this period, the practice of abortion expanded\nin new directions in response to relentless demand. The new repression of\nabortion, however, was devastating for women. A dual system of abortion,\ndivided by race and class, developed. During the postwar period, the\ncriminalization of abortion produced its harshest results. A new stage in the history of abortion, the movement to legalize it, overlaps\nwith the third period. The movement to decriminalize abortion began in the\nmid-1950s and arose out of the difficult experiences resulting from the\nrepression of abortion in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1950s, a handful of\nphysicians began to challenge the very abortion laws their profession had\nadvocated a century earlier. The progress of that challenge attests to the\ncontinuing power of the medical profession to make public policy regarding\nreproduction. As legal reform moved forward, a new feminist movement arose,\nwhich radically transformed the movement for legal change. When the women's\nmovement described abortion as an aspect of sexual freedom, they articulated a\nnew feminist meaning for abortion; when they demanded abortion as a right, they\nechoed generations of women. The structure of this book follows this periodization. The first half of the\nbook uncovers the history of abortion from the late nineteenth century through\nthe 1920s. Chapters 1 through 4 each cover different aspects of abortion, from\nwomen's lives to practice to politics to enforcement, during the first\nhalf-century of illegal abortion. The changes of the 1930S, both medical and\nsocial, precipitated other changes. The second half of the book traces the\nhistory of abortion in chronologically ordered chapters concluding with the\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions that ended the era of illegal abortion. Women's history of abortion needs to be examined both as a commonly felt need\nto control reproduction, arising from women's biological capacity to bear\nchildren and social relations that assign childbearing to women, and in terms\nof differences among women. This book differentiates among women by class, race\nand ethnic identity, and marital status. Though class did not absolutely\ndetermine access to or safety of abortion, class position helped define when a\nwoman felt she needed an abortion and affected the type available to her. In\ngeneral, urban women had greater access to abortion than rural women, though\nsome rural women located abortionists in their areas or traveled to cities for\nabortions. Race played a less obvious role in access to abortion, though the\ngrim statistics of the postwar period show the connection between\ndiscrimination and death. I have made a specific effort to locate sources\nrelated to African Americans in order to learn more about black women's use of\nabortion and how race shaped the history of abortion. Evidence concerning women\nof color is meager, however, until the 1930s, when medical and sociological\nstudies began separating their findings by race. Before then, contemporary\nobservers tended to focus their attention on the differences among many (white)\nforeign-born ethnic groups. This book integrates a national analysis of the history of abortion with a\nlocal study. The advantage of this approach is that it connects everyday life\nand local medical and legal practice to national policy. It examines that\nrelationship rather than assuming that all the public policy action takes place\non the federal level without reference to local and \"private\" events. I select\na major metropolis in order to uncover the nature of both abortion practices\nand police enforcement of the criminal abortion laws. Chicago, the second\nlargest city in the nation, is the focus of my local study. Chicago, the city\nin \"the heartland\" that has of ten served as a metaphor for the spirit of\nAmerica, was also known as an important medical center (the home of the AMA)\nand as a regional center for abortion. Trains brought European immigrants, men\nand women migrating from farms to the city, African Americans moving from the\nSouth to the North, all going to live and work in Chicago. The same trains\nbrought women looking for abortions. Directing my attention to one city enabled\nme to uncover the nitty-gritty details of the practice and regulation of\nabortion. Though much of my analysis of the history of abortion draws on Chicago as a\ncase study, sources verify that my findings hold true for other cities, large\nand small. Throughout I present national data and trends as well as regional\nones and take note of patterns elsewhere. The book moves back and forth from a\nnational overview of abortion practices and politics to a close look at events\nin Chicago. As medical practice became more standardized in hospitals, the\nstory becomes a more national one and key events take place in other cities:\nNew York, Detroit, Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington, D.C.,\nand elsewhere. This is primarily a study of abortion in urban areas, where\nabortion was concentrated. I comment occasionally on practices in rural areas,\nbut the history of reproductive control and abortion is likely to be somewhat\ndifferent there. Legal records, most notably lower-level court and criminal trial records, and\nmedical literature make up the foundation of my research. I have also surveyed\nother government documents, newspapers, popular periodicals, hospital records,\nand manuscript collections. Using these materials, I have delineated how\nmedical thinking and state regulation have changed over time. Yet this is more\nthan a study of prescriptive literature or policy. I have uncovered the\ncircumstances of hundreds of actual induced abortions and reconstructed\nchanging abortion practices. This study periodizes the history of abortion for\nthe first time. This book presents the lives of many women and their abortions in rich detail\nin order to convey the variety and intricacy of the situations that made\nabortion necessary for women. It is in the minutiae of women's lives that we\ncan discover why women had abortions and how they won sympathy from physicians\nwho belonged to a profession dedicated to fighting abortion.

It made physicians, and\nobstetricians in particular, dependent on female self-diagnosis and judgment.\nQuickening could not be relied upon as an indicator of fetal life because,\nStorer argued, it did not occur at a standard moment. \"Many women never quicken\nat all,\" he joked about women's perceptions, \"though their children are born\nliving.\" Storer's propaganda aimed to erase the distinctions between earlier\nand later stages of pregnancy, thereby redefining the restoration of the\nmenses. What had previously been understood as a blockage and a restoration of\nthe menses prior to quickening was now associated with inducing a miscarriage\nafter quickening by labeling it abortion. Furthermore, Storer equated abortion\nwith infanticide. Regular medical men had entered the debate about sexual politics by attacking\nthe female practice of abortion as immoral, unwomanly, and unpatriotic. In\ngiving abortion new meaning, the Regulars provided a weapon that white,\nnative-born, male legislators could use against the women of their own class\nwho had been agitating for personal and political reform. Regular physicians\nwon passage of new criminal abortion laws because their campaign appealed to a\nset of fears of white, nativeborn, male elites about losing political power to\nCatholic immigrants and to women. Class privilege did not protect middle-class\nwhite women from public policy designed to control them. Although the\ncriminalization of abortion was aimed at middle-class white women, it affected\nwomen of every class and race. The new laws passed across the country between\n1860 and 1880 regarded abortion in an entirely different light from common law\nand the statutes regulating abortifacients. In general, the laws included two\ninnovations: they eliminated the common-law idea of quickening and prohibited\nabortion at any point in pregnancy. Some included punishment for the women who\nhad abortions. The \"Comstock Law\" passed in 1873 included abortion and birth\ncontrol in federal antiobscenity legislation; states and municipalities passed\nsimilar ordinances. The antiabortion laws made one exception: physicians could perform therapeutic\nabortions if pregnancy and childbirth threatened the woman's life. A bill\ncriminalizing abortion unless done for \" bona fide medical or surgical\npurposes\" passed the Illinois state legislature unanimously and was signed into\nlaw in 1867. A few years later, Illinois passed another law prohibiting the\nsale of abortifacients but made an exception for \"the written prescription of\nsome well known and respectable practicing physician.\" Physicians had won the\ncriminalization of abortion and retained to themselves alone the right to\ninduce abortions when they determined it necessary. Through the antiabortion campaign, doctors claimed scientific authority to\ndefine life and death. In so doing, they claimed the authority of religious\nleaders. In leading this moral crusade and thoroughly criticizing the\nministry's lack of interest in abortion, regular doctors set themselves above\nreligious leaders as well as above the general populace. The medical\nprofession's claim to moral purity and the authority of the clergy was a\nstepping-stone to greater social authority. Regular physicians won an important\nvictory when they persuaded the nation's states to criminalize abortion.\nPhysicians entered a new partnership with the state and won the power to set\nreproductive policy. In the process, women's perceptions of pregnancy were\ndelegitimated and women lost what had been a common-law right. Periodization: Changing Patterns of Illegal Abortion During the more than one hundred years that abortion was illegal in the United\nStates, the patterns; practice, policing, and politics of abortion all changed\nover time, though not always simultaneously. I trace the history along several\nlines at once, according to the location, practice, and availability of\nabortion as well as its regulation. Abortion was widely available throughout\nmuch of the era when abortion was a crime. Yet periods of tolerance were\npunctuated by moments of severe repression. At some points the changing\nstructure of medicine brought about crucial changes in the history of abortion;\nat others, changes in women's lives or the political and economic context came\nto the fore. In the nineteenth century, abortion came under attack at a moment when women\nwere claiming political power; in the twentieth century, it came under attack\nwhen they claimed sexual freedom. Abortion, like contraception, means that\nwomen can separate sex and procreation -- still a controversial notion.\nAntiabortion campaigns developed when women asserted sexual independence, as\nduring the Progressive Era and since the 1970s. When abortion was most firmly\nlinked to the needs of family rather than the freedoms of women, as during the\nDepression, it was most ignored by those who would suppress it. Periods of\nantiabortion activity mark moments of hostility to female independence. The epoch of illegal abortion may be broken down into four periods. The first\ncovers the time from the criminalization of abortion state-by-state,\naccomplished nationwide by 1880, to 1930. This period, covering fifty years, is\nheavily marked by continuity. As other historians have also found, the\nreproductive lives of most women and the day-to-day practice of most physicians\nchanged slowly. In this period, abortion was widely accepted and was practiced\nin women's homes and in the offices of physicians and midwives. The diversity\nof practitioners, the privacy of medical practice, and the autonomy of\nphysicians in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries made the\nwidespread medical practice of abortion possible. A crackdown on abortion\noccurred between 1890 and 1920 as specialists in obstetrics renewed the earlier\ncampaign against abortion, and the medical profession was drawn into the\nstate's enforcement system. The structural transformation that occurred during the 1930s, the second\nperiod, was crucial for the history of abortion. Abortion became more available\nand changed location. As the practice moved from private offices and homes to\nhospitals and clinics, abortion was consolidated in medical hands and became\nmore visible. The changes wrought by the Depression accelerated the pace of\nchange in the coming decades, particularly in the methods of enforcing the\ncriminal abortion laws. The third period was marked by increasing restrictions on abortion by state\nand medical authorities and intensifying demand for abortion from women of all\ngroups. This period begins in 1940, when the new methods of controlling\nabortion were first instituted, and continues through 1973, when they were\ndismantled. In reaction to the growing practice of abortion as well as apparent\nchanges in female gender and reproductive patterns, a backlash against abortion\ndeveloped. 1940 marks a dividing line as hospitals instituted new policies, and\npolice and prosecutors changed their tactics. The repression of abortion was\npart of the repression of political and personal deviance that took place in\nthe 1940s and 1950s. Yet even in this period, the practice of abortion expanded\nin new directions in response to relentless demand. The new repression of\nabortion, however, was devastating for women. A dual system of abortion,\ndivided by race and class, developed. During the postwar period, the\ncriminalization of abortion produced its harshest results. A new stage in the history of abortion, the movement to legalize it, overlaps\nwith the third period. The movement to decriminalize abortion began in the\nmid-1950s and arose out of the difficult experiences resulting from the\nrepression of abortion in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1950s, a handful of\nphysicians began to challenge the very abortion laws their profession had\nadvocated a century earlier. The progress of that challenge attests to the\ncontinuing power of the medical profession to make public policy regarding\nreproduction. As legal reform moved forward, a new feminist movement arose,\nwhich radically transformed the movement for legal change. When the women's\nmovement described abortion as an aspect of sexual freedom, they articulated a\nnew feminist meaning for abortion; when they demanded abortion as a right, they\nechoed generations of women. The structure of this book follows this periodization. The first half of the\nbook uncovers the history of abortion from the late nineteenth century through\nthe 1920s. Chapters 1 through 4 each cover different aspects of abortion, from\nwomen's lives to practice to politics to enforcement, during the first\nhalf-century of illegal abortion. The changes of the 1930S, both medical and\nsocial, precipitated other changes. The second half of the book traces the\nhistory of abortion in chronologically ordered chapters concluding with the\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions that ended the era of illegal abortion. Women's history of abortion needs to be examined both as a commonly felt need\nto control reproduction, arising from women's biological capacity to bear\nchildren and social relations that assign childbearing to women, and in terms\nof differences among women. This book differentiates among women by class, race\nand ethnic identity, and marital status. Though class did not absolutely\ndetermine access to or safety of abortion, class position helped define when a\nwoman felt she needed an abortion and affected the type available to her. In\ngeneral, urban women had greater access to abortion than rural women, though\nsome rural women located abortionists in their areas or traveled to cities for\nabortions. Race played a less obvious role in access to abortion, though the\ngrim statistics of the postwar period show the connection between\ndiscrimination and death. I have made a specific effort to locate sources\nrelated to African Americans in order to learn more about black women's use of\nabortion and how race shaped the history of abortion. Evidence concerning women\nof color is meager, however, until the 1930s, when medical and sociological\nstudies began separating their findings by race. Before then, contemporary\nobservers tended to focus their attention on the differences among many (white)\nforeign-born ethnic groups. This book integrates a national analysis of the history of abortion with a\nlocal study. The advantage of this approach is that it connects everyday life\nand local medical and legal practice to national policy. It examines that\nrelationship rather than assuming that all the public policy action takes place\non the federal level without reference to local and \"private\" events. I select\na major metropolis in order to uncover the nature of both abortion practices\nand police enforcement of the criminal abortion laws. Chicago, the second\nlargest city in the nation, is the focus of my local study. Chicago, the city\nin \"the heartland\" that has of ten served as a metaphor for the spirit of\nAmerica, was also known as an important medical center (the home of the AMA)\nand as a regional center for abortion. Trains brought European immigrants, men\nand women migrating from farms to the city, African Americans moving from the\nSouth to the North, all going to live and work in Chicago. The same trains\nbrought women looking for abortions. Directing my attention to one city enabled\nme to uncover the nitty-gritty details of the practice and regulation of\nabortion. Though much of my analysis of the history of abortion draws on Chicago as a\ncase study, sources verify that my findings hold true for other cities, large\nand small. Throughout I present national data and trends as well as regional\nones and take note of patterns elsewhere. The book moves back and forth from a\nnational overview of abortion practices and politics to a close look at events\nin Chicago. As medical practice became more standardized in hospitals, the\nstory becomes a more national one and key events take place in other cities:\nNew York, Detroit, Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington, D.C.,\nand elsewhere. This is primarily a study of abortion in urban areas, where\nabortion was concentrated. I comment occasionally on practices in rural areas,\nbut the history of reproductive control and abortion is likely to be somewhat\ndifferent there. Legal records, most notably lower-level court and criminal trial records, and\nmedical literature make up the foundation of my research. I have also surveyed\nother government documents, newspapers, popular periodicals, hospital records,\nand manuscript collections. Using these materials, I have delineated how\nmedical thinking and state regulation have changed over time. Yet this is more\nthan a study of prescriptive literature or policy. I have uncovered the\ncircumstances of hundreds of actual induced abortions and reconstructed\nchanging abortion practices. This study periodizes the history of abortion for\nthe first time. This book presents the lives of many women and their abortions in rich detail\nin order to convey the variety and intricacy of the situations that made\nabortion necessary for women. It is in the minutiae of women's lives that we\ncan discover why women had abortions and how they won sympathy from physicians\nwho belonged to a profession dedicated to fighting abortion. Abortion was a\nmoment in a woman's reproductive life. It cannot be separated from sexual\nrelations or reproduction as a whole. Women themselves did not separate them,\nnor should we, whether analyzing abortion in the past or present. This book\ndeepens our understanding of the female experience of reproduction and the\nconnections between sexuality, contraception, pregnancy, and childbirth. At its\nmost fundamental, a policy that restricts abortion is one that forces women\ninto maternity. Without contraceptives and abortion, most women in heterosexual\nrelationships will become pregnant and bear children, whether they want to or\nnot. When women sought abortions, they often revealed the texture of\nheterosexual relations and the rest of their lives. Many situations made\nenduring pregnancy unbearable to women. In using abortion, women rebelled\nagainst the law and asserted their sense that the decision to carry a pregnancy\nto term or to abort was theirs to make. A few expressed in words as well as in\naction the view that abortion was their right. The experiences of women's\nprivate lives and private practices over the course of one hundred years\naltered medical thinking and reshaped public policy. Despite the fact that\nwomen's abortion narratives are part of our own contemporary discourse, the\nstories told here have long been hidden. Copyright © 1996  by the Regents of the University of California.\n\nBy the mid-eighteenth century, the most common means of inducing\nabortion -- by\ntaking drugs was commercialized. The availability of abortifacients was so\nwell-known that a common euphemism described their use. When Sarah Grosvenor, a\nConnecticut farm girl, confided to her sister in 1742 that she was \"taking the\ntrade,\" her sister understood. That Grosvenor successfully conveyed her meaning\nto her sister in three metaphoric words tells us a great deal about the world\nof mid-eighteenth-century New England. Many New Englanders, including these\nsisters, knew of the possibility of inducing an abortion by purchasing and\ningesting drugs. The need for a euphemism tells of the difficulty of speaking\nopenly about sex and reproductive control and of the need for secrecy. Yet it\nreveals an awareness that women could and did regulate their own fertility\nthrough abortion. Furthermore, abortifacients had become a profitable product\nsold by doctors, apothecaries, and other healers. The first statutes governing abortion in the United States, James Mohr has\nfound, were poison control measures designed to protect pregnant women like\nGrosvenor by controlling the sale of abortifacient drugs, which often killed\nthe women who took them. The proliferation of entrepreneurs who openly sold and\nadvertised abortifacients may have inspired this early legislation, passed in\nthe 1820s and 1830s. The 18 Illinois law, which prohibited the provision of\nabortifacients, was listed under \"poisoning.\" It is crucial to recognize what these early-nineteenth-century laws did not\ncover: they did not punish women for inducing abortions, and they did not\neliminate the concept of quickening. Even as poison control measures, they said\nnothing about growing the plants needed in one's own garden or mixing together\none's own home remedy in order to induce an abortion. The legal silence on\ndomestic practices suggests that the new laws were aimed at the\ncommercialization of this practice and, implicitly, retained to women the right\nto make their own decisions about their pregnancies before quickening. By the 1840s, the abortion business boomed. Despite the laws forbidding the\nsale of abortifacients, they were advertised in the popular press and could be\npurchased from physicians or pharmacists or through the mail. If drugs failed,\nwomen could go to a practitioner who specialized in performing instrumental\nabortions. Advertisements and newspaper exposes made it appear that what had\nbeen an occasional domestic practice had become a daily occurrence performed\nfor profit in northern cities. Madame Restell, for example, openly advertised\nand provided abortion services for thirty-five years. Restell began her\nabortion business in New York City in the late 1830s; by the mid-1840s, she had\noffices in Boston and Philadelphia and traveling agents who sold her \"Female\nMonthly Pills.\" Restell became the most infamous abortionist in the country,\nbut she was not the only abortionist. The clientele of these busy clinics were\nprimarily married, white, native-born Protestant women of the upper and middle\nclasses. In 1857, the newly organized AMA initiated a crusade to make abortion at every\nstage of pregnancy illegal. The antiabortion campaign grew in part, James Mohr\nhas shown, out of regular physicians' desire to win professional power, control\nmedical practice, and restrict their competitors, particularly Homeopaths and\nmidwives. \"Regular,\" or \"orthodox,\" physicians, practitioners of \"heroic\"\nmedicine, had come under attack in the 1820s and 1830s as elitist. They faced\ncompetition from a variety of practitioners from other medical sects,\ncollectively known as \"Irregulars.\" Through the 1870S, regular physicians\nacross the country worked for the passage of new criminal abortion laws. In\nsecuring criminal abortion laws, the Regulars won recognition of their\nparticular views as well as some state control over the practice of\nmedicine. Though professional issues underlay the medical campaign, gender, racial, and\nclass anxieties pushed the criminalization of abortion forward. The visible use\nof abortion by middle-class married women, in conjunction with other challenges\nto gender norms and changes in the social makeup of the nation, generated\nanxieties among American men of the same class. Birth rates among the Yankee\nclasses had declined by mid-century while immigrants poured into the country.\nAntiabortion activists pointed out that immigrant families, many of them\nCatholic, were larger and would soon outpopulate native-born white Yankees and\nthreaten their political power. Dr. Horatio R Storer, the leader of the medical\ncampaign against abortion, envisioned the spread of \"civilization\" west and\nsouth by native-born white Americans, not Mexicans, Chinese, Blacks, Indians,\nor Catholics. \"Shall\" these regions, he asked, \"be filled by our own children\nor by those of aliens? This is a question our women must answer; upon their\nloins depends the future destiny of the nation.\" Hostility to immigrants,\nCatholics, and people of color fueled this campaign to criminalize abortion.\nWhite male patriotism demanded that maternity be enforced among white\nProtestant women. The antiabortion campaign was antifeminist at its core. Women were condemned\nfor following \"fashion\" and for avoiding the self-sacrifice expected of\nmothers. \"The true wife,\" Storer declared, did not seek `'undue power in public\nlife, . . . undue control in domestic affairs, . . . [or] privileges not her\nown.\" The antiabortion campaign was a reactionary response to two important\nefforts of the nineteenth-century women's movements: the fight to admit women\ninto the regular medical profession and the battle to make men conform to a\nsingle standard of sexual behavior. The antiabortion campaign coincided with\nthe fight by male Regulars to keep women out of their medical schools,\nsocieties, and hospitals. Boston and Harvard University, Storer's hometown and\nalma mater, were key sites of struggle over women's place in medicine, and\nStorer was personally engaged in the battle against female physicians.\nAdvocates of women in medicine argued that women doctors would protect women\npatients from sexual violation. Regular male doctors degraded female physicians\nby accusing them, along with midwives, of performing abortions. The relative morality of men and women was of crucial importance to this\ncampaign. For the specialists, whose interest in the female reproductive system\nraised questions about their sexual morality, the antiabortion campaign was a\nway to proclaim their own high morality in contrast to their competitors, their\nfemale patients, and even the ministers who tolerated abortion. It was at the\nsame time a backlash against the women's movement's critique of male sexual\nbehavior and feminist claims to political power. Nineteenth-century feminists\nexpressed their anger with male sexual domination and promiscuity in a number\nof movements, including the campaigns against prostitution and slavery and the\nfight for temperance. All sections of the women's movement advocated \"voluntary\nmotherhood,\" a slogan that addressed both men's sexual violation of their wives\nand women's desire to control childbearing. Women saw themselves as morally\nsuperior and urged men to adopt a single standard  --  the female\nstandard of\nchastity until marriage, followed by monogamy and moderation. The campaign\nagainst abortion challenged this feminist analysis of men by condemning women\nfor having abortions. Indeed, Storer compared abortion to prostitution and, in\nso doing, called into question all claims made by middle-class\nnineteenth-century women on the basis of moral superiority. \"There is little\ndifference,\" he proclaimed, \"between the immorality\" of the man who visited\nprostitutes and the woman who aborted. The nineteenth-century women's movements\nnever defended abortion, but activist women and women doctors were blamed for\nthe practice of abortion nonetheless. The antiabortion campaign attempted to destroy the idea of quickening. As\nphysicians targeted quickening, they discredited women's experiences of\npregnancy and claimed pregnancy as medical terrain. \"Quickening,\" as Storer\ndescribed it, \"is in fact but a sensation.\" A sensation that had emotional,\nsocial, and legal meaning was thus denigrated. Quickening was based on women's\nown bodily sensations -- not on medical diagnosis. It made physicians, and\nobstetricians in particular, dependent on female self-diagnosis and judgment.\nQuickening could not be relied upon as an indicator of fetal life because,\nStorer argued, it did not occur at a standard moment. \"Many women never quicken\nat all,\" he joked about women's perceptions, \"though their children are born\nliving.\" Storer's propaganda aimed to erase the distinctions between earlier\nand later stages of pregnancy, thereby redefining the restoration of the\nmenses. What had previously been understood as a blockage and a restoration of\nthe menses prior to quickening was now associated with inducing a miscarriage\nafter quickening by labeling it abortion. Furthermore, Storer equated abortion\nwith infanticide. Regular medical men had entered the debate about sexual politics by attacking\nthe female practice of abortion as immoral, unwomanly, and unpatriotic. In\ngiving abortion new meaning, the Regulars provided a weapon that white,\nnative-born, male legislators could use against the women of their own class\nwho had been agitating for personal and political reform. Regular physicians\nwon passage of new criminal abortion laws because their campaign appealed to a\nset of fears of white, nativeborn, male elites about losing political power to\nCatholic immigrants and to women. Class privilege did not protect middle-class\nwhite women from public policy designed to control them. Although the\ncriminalization of abortion was aimed at middle-class white women, it affected\nwomen of every class and race.

In the process, women's perceptions of pregnancy were\ndelegitimated and women lost what had been a common-law right. Periodization: Changing Patterns of Illegal Abortion During the more than one hundred years that abortion was illegal in the United\nStates, the patterns; practice, policing, and politics of abortion all changed\nover time, though not always simultaneously. I trace the history along several\nlines at once, according to the location, practice, and availability of\nabortion as well as its regulation. Abortion was widely available throughout\nmuch of the era when abortion was a crime. Yet periods of tolerance were\npunctuated by moments of severe repression.

This is primarily a study of abortion in urban areas, where\nabortion was concentrated. I comment occasionally on practices in rural areas,\nbut the history of reproductive control and abortion is likely to be somewhat\ndifferent there. Legal records, most notably lower-level court and criminal trial records, and\nmedical literature make up the foundation of my research. I have also surveyed\nother government documents, newspapers, popular periodicals, hospital records,\nand manuscript collections. Using these materials, I have delineated how\nmedical thinking and state regulation have changed over time. Yet this is more\nthan a study of prescriptive literature or policy. I have uncovered the\ncircumstances of hundreds of actual induced abortions and reconstructed\nchanging abortion practices. This study periodizes the history of abortion for\nthe first time. This book presents the lives of many women and their abortions in rich detail\nin order to convey the variety and intricacy of the situations that made\nabortion necessary for women. It is in the minutiae of women's lives that we\ncan discover why women had abortions and how they won sympathy from physicians\nwho belonged to a profession dedicated to fighting abortion. Abortion was a\nmoment in a woman's reproductive life. It cannot be separated from sexual\nrelations or reproduction as a whole. Women themselves did not separate them,\nnor should we, whether analyzing abortion in the past or present. This book\ndeepens our understanding of the female experience of reproduction and the\nconnections between sexuality, contraception, pregnancy, and childbirth. At its\nmost fundamental, a policy that restricts abortion is one that forces women\ninto maternity. Without contraceptives and abortion, most women in heterosexual\nrelationships will become pregnant and bear children, whether they want to or\nnot. When women sought abortions, they often revealed the texture of\nheterosexual relations and the rest of their lives. Many situations made\nenduring pregnancy unbearable to women. In using abortion, women rebelled\nagainst the law and asserted their sense that the decision to carry a pregnancy\nto term or to abort was theirs to make. A few expressed in words as well as in\naction the view that abortion was their right. The experiences of women's\nprivate lives and private practices over the course of one hundred years\naltered medical thinking and reshaped public policy. Despite the fact that\nwomen's abortion narratives are part of our own contemporary discourse, the\nstories told here have long been hidden.

The proliferation of entrepreneurs who openly sold and\nadvertised abortifacients may have inspired this early legislation, passed in\nthe 1820s and 1830s. The 18 Illinois law, which prohibited the provision of\nabortifacients, was listed under \"poisoning.\" It is crucial to recognize what these early-nineteenth-century laws did not\ncover: they did not punish women for inducing abortions, and they did not\neliminate the concept of quickening. Even as poison control measures, they said\nnothing about growing the plants needed in one's own garden or mixing together\none's own home remedy in order to induce an abortion. The legal silence on\ndomestic practices suggests that the new laws were aimed at the\ncommercialization of this practice and, implicitly, retained to women the right\nto make their own decisions about their pregnancies before quickening. By the 1840s, the abortion business boomed. Despite the laws forbidding the\nsale of abortifacients, they were advertised in the popular press and could be\npurchased from physicians or pharmacists or through the mail. If drugs failed,\nwomen could go to a practitioner who specialized in performing instrumental\nabortions. Advertisements and newspaper exposes made it appear that what had\nbeen an occasional domestic practice had become a daily occurrence performed\nfor profit in northern cities. Madame Restell, for example, openly advertised\nand provided abortion services for thirty-five years. Restell began her\nabortion business in New York City in the late 1830s; by the mid-1840s, she had\noffices in Boston and Philadelphia and traveling agents who sold her \"Female\nMonthly Pills.\" Restell became the most infamous abortionist in the country,\nbut she was not the only abortionist. The clientele of these busy clinics were\nprimarily married, white, native-born Protestant women of the upper and middle\nclasses. In 1857, the newly organized AMA initiated a crusade to make abortion at every\nstage of pregnancy illegal. The antiabortion campaign grew in part, James Mohr\nhas shown, out of regular physicians' desire to win professional power, control\nmedical practice, and restrict their competitors, particularly Homeopaths and\nmidwives. \"Regular,\" or \"orthodox,\" physicians, practitioners of \"heroic\"\nmedicine, had come under attack in the 1820s and 1830s as elitist. They faced\ncompetition from a variety of practitioners from other medical sects,\ncollectively known as \"Irregulars.\" Through the 1870S, regular physicians\nacross the country worked for the passage of new criminal abortion laws. In\nsecuring criminal abortion laws, the Regulars won recognition of their\nparticular views as well as some state control over the practice of\nmedicine. Though professional issues underlay the medical campaign, gender, racial, and\nclass anxieties pushed the criminalization of abortion forward. The visible use\nof abortion by middle-class married women, in conjunction with other challenges\nto gender norms and changes in the social makeup of the nation, generated\nanxieties among American men of the same class. Birth rates among the Yankee\nclasses had declined by mid-century while immigrants poured into the country.\nAntiabortion activists pointed out that immigrant families, many of them\nCatholic, were larger and would soon outpopulate native-born white Yankees and\nthreaten their political power. Dr. Horatio R Storer, the leader of the medical\ncampaign against abortion, envisioned the spread of \"civilization\" west and\nsouth by native-born white Americans, not Mexicans, Chinese, Blacks, Indians,\nor Catholics. \"Shall\" these regions, he asked, \"be filled by our own children\nor by those of aliens? This is a question our women must answer; upon their\nloins depends the future destiny of the nation.\" Hostility to immigrants,\nCatholics, and people of color fueled this campaign to criminalize abortion.\nWhite male patriotism demanded that maternity be enforced among white\nProtestant women. The antiabortion campaign was antifeminist at its core. Women were condemned\nfor following \"fashion\" and for avoiding the self-sacrifice expected of\nmothers. \"The true wife,\" Storer declared, did not seek `'undue power in public\nlife, . . . undue control in domestic affairs, . . . [or] privileges not her\nown.\" The antiabortion campaign was a reactionary response to two important\nefforts of the nineteenth-century women's movements: the fight to admit women\ninto the regular medical profession and the battle to make men conform to a\nsingle standard of sexual behavior. The antiabortion campaign coincided with\nthe fight by male Regulars to keep women out of their medical schools,\nsocieties, and hospitals. Boston and Harvard University, Storer's hometown and\nalma mater, were key sites of struggle over women's place in medicine, and\nStorer was personally engaged in the battle against female physicians.\nAdvocates of women in medicine argued that women doctors would protect women\npatients from sexual violation. Regular male doctors degraded female physicians\nby accusing them, along with midwives, of performing abortions. The relative morality of men and women was of crucial importance to this\ncampaign. For the specialists, whose interest in the female reproductive system\nraised questions about their sexual morality, the antiabortion campaign was a\nway to proclaim their own high morality in contrast to their competitors, their\nfemale patients, and even the ministers who tolerated abortion. It was at the\nsame time a backlash against the women's movement's critique of male sexual\nbehavior and feminist claims to political power. Nineteenth-century feminists\nexpressed their anger with male sexual domination and promiscuity in a number\nof movements, including the campaigns against prostitution and slavery and the\nfight for temperance. All sections of the women's movement advocated \"voluntary\nmotherhood,\" a slogan that addressed both men's sexual violation of their wives\nand women's desire to control childbearing. Women saw themselves as morally\nsuperior and urged men to adopt a single standard  --  the female\nstandard of\nchastity until marriage, followed by monogamy and moderation. The campaign\nagainst abortion challenged this feminist analysis of men by condemning women\nfor having abortions. Indeed, Storer compared abortion to prostitution and, in\nso doing, called into question all claims made by middle-class\nnineteenth-century women on the basis of moral superiority. \"There is little\ndifference,\" he proclaimed, \"between the immorality\" of the man who visited\nprostitutes and the woman who aborted. The nineteenth-century women's movements\nnever defended abortion, but activist women and women doctors were blamed for\nthe practice of abortion nonetheless. The antiabortion campaign attempted to destroy the idea of quickening. As\nphysicians targeted quickening, they discredited women's experiences of\npregnancy and claimed pregnancy as medical terrain. \"Quickening,\" as Storer\ndescribed it, \"is in fact but a sensation.\" A sensation that had emotional,\nsocial, and legal meaning was thus denigrated. Quickening was based on women's\nown bodily sensations -- not on medical diagnosis. It made physicians, and\nobstetricians in particular, dependent on female self-diagnosis and judgment.\nQuickening could not be relied upon as an indicator of fetal life because,\nStorer argued, it did not occur at a standard moment. \"Many women never quicken\nat all,\" he joked about women's perceptions, \"though their children are born\nliving.\" Storer's propaganda aimed to erase the distinctions between earlier\nand later stages of pregnancy, thereby redefining the restoration of the\nmenses. What had previously been understood as a blockage and a restoration of\nthe menses prior to quickening was now associated with inducing a miscarriage\nafter quickening by labeling it abortion. Furthermore, Storer equated abortion\nwith infanticide. Regular medical men had entered the debate about sexual politics by attacking\nthe female practice of abortion as immoral, unwomanly, and unpatriotic. In\ngiving abortion new meaning, the Regulars provided a weapon that white,\nnative-born, male legislators could use against the women of their own class\nwho had been agitating for personal and political reform. Regular physicians\nwon passage of new criminal abortion laws because their campaign appealed to a\nset of fears of white, nativeborn, male elites about losing political power to\nCatholic immigrants and to women. Class privilege did not protect middle-class\nwhite women from public policy designed to control them. Although the\ncriminalization of abortion was aimed at middle-class white women, it affected\nwomen of every class and race. The new laws passed across the country between\n1860 and 1880 regarded abortion in an entirely different light from common law\nand the statutes regulating abortifacients. In general, the laws included two\ninnovations: they eliminated the common-law idea of quickening and prohibited\nabortion at any point in pregnancy. Some included punishment for the women who\nhad abortions. The \"Comstock Law\" passed in 1873 included abortion and birth\ncontrol in federal antiobscenity legislation; states and municipalities passed\nsimilar ordinances. The antiabortion laws made one exception: physicians could perform therapeutic\nabortions if pregnancy and childbirth threatened the woman's life. A bill\ncriminalizing abortion unless done for \" bona fide medical or surgical\npurposes\" passed the Illinois state legislature unanimously and was signed into\nlaw in 1867. A few years later, Illinois passed another law prohibiting the\nsale of abortifacients but made an exception for \"the written prescription of\nsome well known and respectable practicing physician.\" Physicians had won the\ncriminalization of abortion and retained to themselves alone the right to\ninduce abortions when they determined it necessary. Through the antiabortion campaign, doctors claimed scientific authority to\ndefine life and death. In so doing, they claimed the authority of religious\nleaders. In leading this moral crusade and thoroughly criticizing the\nministry's lack of interest in abortion, regular doctors set themselves above\nreligious leaders as well as above the general populace. The medical\nprofession's claim to moral purity and the authority of the clergy was a\nstepping-stone to greater social authority. Regular physicians won an important\nvictory when they persuaded the nation's states to criminalize abortion.\nPhysicians entered a new partnership with the state and won the power to set\nreproductive policy. In the process, women's perceptions of pregnancy were\ndelegitimated and women lost what had been a common-law right. Periodization: Changing Patterns of Illegal Abortion During the more than one hundred years that abortion was illegal in the United\nStates, the patterns; practice, policing, and politics of abortion all changed\nover time, though not always simultaneously. I trace the history along several\nlines at once, according to the location, practice, and availability of\nabortion as well as its regulation. Abortion was widely available throughout\nmuch of the era when abortion was a crime. Yet periods of tolerance were\npunctuated by moments of severe repression. At some points the changing\nstructure of medicine brought about crucial changes in the history of abortion;\nat others, changes in women's lives or the political and economic context came\nto the fore. In the nineteenth century, abortion came under attack at a moment when women\nwere claiming political power; in the twentieth century, it came under attack\nwhen they claimed sexual freedom. Abortion, like contraception, means that\nwomen can separate sex and procreation -- still a controversial notion.\nAntiabortion campaigns developed when women asserted sexual independence, as\nduring the Progressive Era and since the 1970s. When abortion was most firmly\nlinked to the needs of family rather than the freedoms of women, as during the\nDepression, it was most ignored by those who would suppress it. Periods of\nantiabortion activity mark moments of hostility to female independence. The epoch of illegal abortion may be broken down into four periods. The first\ncovers the time from the criminalization of abortion state-by-state,\naccomplished nationwide by 1880, to 1930. This period, covering fifty years, is\nheavily marked by continuity. As other historians have also found, the\nreproductive lives of most women and the day-to-day practice of most physicians\nchanged slowly. In this period, abortion was widely accepted and was practiced\nin women's homes and in the offices of physicians and midwives. The diversity\nof practitioners, the privacy of medical practice, and the autonomy of\nphysicians in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries made the\nwidespread medical practice of abortion possible. A crackdown on abortion\noccurred between 1890 and 1920 as specialists in obstetrics renewed the earlier\ncampaign against abortion, and the medical profession was drawn into the\nstate's enforcement system. The structural transformation that occurred during the 1930s, the second\nperiod, was crucial for the history of abortion. Abortion became more available\nand changed location. As the practice moved from private offices and homes to\nhospitals and clinics, abortion was consolidated in medical hands and became\nmore visible. The changes wrought by the Depression accelerated the pace of\nchange in the coming decades, particularly in the methods of enforcing the\ncriminal abortion laws. The third period was marked by increasing restrictions on abortion by state\nand medical authorities and intensifying demand for abortion from women of all\ngroups. This period begins in 1940, when the new methods of controlling\nabortion were first instituted, and continues through 1973, when they were\ndismantled. In reaction to the growing practice of abortion as well as apparent\nchanges in female gender and reproductive patterns, a backlash against abortion\ndeveloped. 1940 marks a dividing line as hospitals instituted new policies, and\npolice and prosecutors changed their tactics. The repression of abortion was\npart of the repression of political and personal deviance that took place in\nthe 1940s and 1950s. Yet even in this period, the practice of abortion expanded\nin new directions in response to relentless demand. The new repression of\nabortion, however, was devastating for women. A dual system of abortion,\ndivided by race and class, developed. During the postwar period, the\ncriminalization of abortion produced its harshest results. A new stage in the history of abortion, the movement to legalize it, overlaps\nwith the third period. The movement to decriminalize abortion began in the\nmid-1950s and arose out of the difficult experiences resulting from the\nrepression of abortion in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1950s, a handful of\nphysicians began to challenge the very abortion laws their profession had\nadvocated a century earlier. The progress of that challenge attests to the\ncontinuing power of the medical profession to make public policy regarding\nreproduction. As legal reform moved forward, a new feminist movement arose,\nwhich radically transformed the movement for legal change. When the women's\nmovement described abortion as an aspect of sexual freedom, they articulated a\nnew feminist meaning for abortion; when they demanded abortion as a right, they\nechoed generations of women. The structure of this book follows this periodization. The first half of the\nbook uncovers the history of abortion from the late nineteenth century through\nthe 1920s. Chapters 1 through 4 each cover different aspects of abortion, from\nwomen's lives to practice to politics to enforcement, during the first\nhalf-century of illegal abortion. The changes of the 1930S, both medical and\nsocial, precipitated other changes. The second half of the book traces the\nhistory of abortion in chronologically ordered chapters concluding with the\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions that ended the era of illegal abortion. Women's history of abortion needs to be examined both as a commonly felt need\nto control reproduction, arising from women's biological capacity to bear\nchildren and social relations that assign childbearing to women, and in terms\nof differences among women. This book differentiates among women by class, race\nand ethnic identity, and marital status. Though class did not absolutely\ndetermine access to or safety of abortion, class position helped define when a\nwoman felt she needed an abortion and affected the type available to her. In\ngeneral, urban women had greater access to abortion than rural women, though\nsome rural women located abortionists in their areas or traveled to cities for\nabortions. Race played a less obvious role in access to abortion, though the\ngrim statistics of the postwar period show the connection between\ndiscrimination and death. I have made a specific effort to locate sources\nrelated to African Americans in order to learn more about black women's use of\nabortion and how race shaped the history of abortion. Evidence concerning women\nof color is meager, however, until the 1930s, when medical and sociological\nstudies began separating their findings by race. Before then, contemporary\nobservers tended to focus their attention on the differences among many (white)\nforeign-born ethnic groups. This book integrates a national analysis of the history of abortion with a\nlocal study. The advantage of this approach is that it connects everyday life\nand local medical and legal practice to national policy. It examines that\nrelationship rather than assuming that all the public policy action takes place\non the federal level without reference to local and \"private\" events. I select\na major metropolis in order to uncover the nature of both abortion practices\nand police enforcement of the criminal abortion laws. Chicago, the second\nlargest city in the nation, is the focus of my local study. Chicago, the city\nin \"the heartland\" that has of ten served as a metaphor for the spirit of\nAmerica, was also known as an important medical center (the home of the AMA)\nand as a regional center for abortion. Trains brought European immigrants, men\nand women migrating from farms to the city, African Americans moving from the\nSouth to the North, all going to live and work in Chicago. The same trains\nbrought women looking for abortions. Directing my attention to one city enabled\nme to uncover the nitty-gritty details of the practice and regulation of\nabortion. Though much of my analysis of the history of abortion draws on Chicago as a\ncase study, sources verify that my findings hold true for other cities, large\nand small. Throughout I present national data and trends as well as regional\nones and take note of patterns elsewhere. The book moves back and forth from a\nnational overview of abortion practices and politics to a close look at events\nin Chicago. As medical practice became more standardized in hospitals, the\nstory becomes a more national one and key events take place in other cities:\nNew York, Detroit, Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington, D.C.,\nand elsewhere. This is primarily a study of abortion in urban areas, where\nabortion was concentrated. I comment occasionally on practices in rural areas,\nbut the history of reproductive control and abortion is likely to be somewhat\ndifferent there. Legal records, most notably lower-level court and criminal trial records, and\nmedical literature make up the foundation of my research. I have also surveyed\nother government documents, newspapers, popular periodicals, hospital records,\nand manuscript collections. Using these materials, I have delineated how\nmedical thinking and state regulation have changed over time. Yet this is more\nthan a study of prescriptive literature or policy. I have uncovered the\ncircumstances of hundreds of actual induced abortions and reconstructed\nchanging abortion practices. This study periodizes the history of abortion for\nthe first time. This book presents the lives of many women and their abortions in rich detail\nin order to convey the variety and intricacy of the situations that made\nabortion necessary for women. It is in the minutiae of women's lives that we\ncan discover why women had abortions and how they won sympathy from physicians\nwho belonged to a profession dedicated to fighting abortion. Abortion was a\nmoment in a woman's reproductive life. It cannot be separated from sexual\nrelations or reproduction as a whole. Women themselves did not separate them,\nnor should we, whether analyzing abortion in the past or present. This book\ndeepens our understanding of the female experience of reproduction and the\nconnections between sexuality, contraception, pregnancy, and childbirth. At its\nmost fundamental, a policy that restricts abortion is one that forces women\ninto maternity. Without contraceptives and abortion, most women in heterosexual\nrelationships will become pregnant and bear children, whether they want to or\nnot. When women sought abortions, they often revealed the texture of\nheterosexual relations and the rest of their lives. Many situations made\nenduring pregnancy unbearable to women. In using abortion, women rebelled\nagainst the law and asserted their sense that the decision to carry a pregnancy\nto term or to abort was theirs to make. A few expressed in words as well as in\naction the view that abortion was their right. The experiences of women's\nprivate lives and private practices over the course of one hundred years\naltered medical thinking and reshaped public policy. Despite the fact that\nwomen's abortion narratives are part of our own contemporary discourse, the\nstories told here have long been hidden.

Periodization: Changing Patterns of Illegal Abortion During the more than one hundred years that abortion was illegal in the United\nStates, the patterns; practice, policing, and politics of abortion all changed\nover time, though not always simultaneously. I trace the history along several\nlines at once, according to the location, practice, and availability of\nabortion as well as its regulation. Abortion was widely available throughout\nmuch of the era when abortion was a crime. Yet periods of tolerance were\npunctuated by moments of severe repression. At some points the changing\nstructure of medicine brought about crucial changes in the history of abortion;\nat others, changes in women's lives or the political and economic context came\nto the fore. In the nineteenth century, abortion came under attack at a moment when women\nwere claiming political power; in the twentieth century, it came under attack\nwhen they claimed sexual freedom. Abortion, like contraception, means that\nwomen can separate sex and procreation -- still a controversial notion.\nAntiabortion campaigns developed when women asserted sexual independence, as\nduring the Progressive Era and since the 1970s. When abortion was most firmly\nlinked to the needs of family rather than the freedoms of women, as during the\nDepression, it was most ignored by those who would suppress it. Periods of\nantiabortion activity mark moments of hostility to female independence. The epoch of illegal abortion may be broken down into four periods. The first\ncovers the time from the criminalization of abortion state-by-state,\naccomplished nationwide by 1880, to 1930. This period, covering fifty years, is\nheavily marked by continuity. As other historians have also found, the\nreproductive lives of most women and the day-to-day practice of most physicians\nchanged slowly. In this period, abortion was widely accepted and was practiced\nin women's homes and in the offices of physicians and midwives. The diversity\nof practitioners, the privacy of medical practice, and the autonomy of\nphysicians in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries made the\nwidespread medical practice of abortion possible. A crackdown on abortion\noccurred between 1890 and 1920 as specialists in obstetrics renewed the earlier\ncampaign against abortion, and the medical profession was drawn into the\nstate's enforcement system. The structural transformation that occurred during the 1930s, the second\nperiod, was crucial for the history of abortion. Abortion became more available\nand changed location. As the practice moved from private offices and homes to\nhospitals and clinics, abortion was consolidated in medical hands and became\nmore visible. The changes wrought by the Depression accelerated the pace of\nchange in the coming decades, particularly in the methods of enforcing the\ncriminal abortion laws. The third period was marked by increasing restrictions on abortion by state\nand medical authorities and intensifying demand for abortion from women of all\ngroups. This period begins in 1940, when the new methods of controlling\nabortion were first instituted, and continues through 1973, when they were\ndismantled. In reaction to the growing practice of abortion as well as apparent\nchanges in female gender and reproductive patterns, a backlash against abortion\ndeveloped. 1940 marks a dividing line as hospitals instituted new policies, and\npolice and prosecutors changed their tactics. The repression of abortion was\npart of the repression of political and personal deviance that took place in\nthe 1940s and 1950s. Yet even in this period, the practice of abortion expanded\nin new directions in response to relentless demand. The new repression of\nabortion, however, was devastating for women. A dual system of abortion,\ndivided by race and class, developed. During the postwar period, the\ncriminalization of abortion produced its harshest results. A new stage in the history of abortion, the movement to legalize it, overlaps\nwith the third period. The movement to decriminalize abortion began in the\nmid-1950s and arose out of the difficult experiences resulting from the\nrepression of abortion in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1950s, a handful of\nphysicians began to challenge the very abortion laws their profession had\nadvocated a century earlier. The progress of that challenge attests to the\ncontinuing power of the medical profession to make public policy regarding\nreproduction. As legal reform moved forward, a new feminist movement arose,\nwhich radically transformed the movement for legal change. When the women's\nmovement described abortion as an aspect of sexual freedom, they articulated a\nnew feminist meaning for abortion; when they demanded abortion as a right, they\nechoed generations of women. The structure of this book follows this periodization. The first half of the\nbook uncovers the history of abortion from the late nineteenth century through\nthe 1920s. Chapters 1 through 4 each cover different aspects of abortion, from\nwomen's lives to practice to politics to enforcement, during the first\nhalf-century of illegal abortion. The changes of the 1930S, both medical and\nsocial, precipitated other changes. The second half of the book traces the\nhistory of abortion in chronologically ordered chapters concluding with the\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions that ended the era of illegal abortion. Women's history of abortion needs to be examined both as a commonly felt need\nto control reproduction, arising from women's biological capacity to bear\nchildren and social relations that assign childbearing to women, and in terms\nof differences among women. This book differentiates among women by class, race\nand ethnic identity, and marital status. Though class did not absolutely\ndetermine access to or safety of abortion, class position helped define when a\nwoman felt she needed an abortion and affected the type available to her. In\ngeneral, urban women had greater access to abortion than rural women, though\nsome rural women located abortionists in their areas or traveled to cities for\nabortions. Race played a less obvious role in access to abortion, though the\ngrim statistics of the postwar period show the connection between\ndiscrimination and death. I have made a specific effort to locate sources\nrelated to African Americans in order to learn more about black women's use of\nabortion and how race shaped the history of abortion. Evidence concerning women\nof color is meager, however, until the 1930s, when medical and sociological\nstudies began separating their findings by race. Before then, contemporary\nobservers tended to focus their attention on the differences among many (white)\nforeign-born ethnic groups. This book integrates a national analysis of the history of abortion with a\nlocal study. The advantage of this approach is that it connects everyday life\nand local medical and legal practice to national policy. It examines that\nrelationship rather than assuming that all the public policy action takes place\non the federal level without reference to local and \"private\" events. I select\na major metropolis in order to uncover the nature of both abortion practices\nand police enforcement of the criminal abortion laws. Chicago, the second\nlargest city in the nation, is the focus of my local study. Chicago, the city\nin \"the heartland\" that has of ten served as a metaphor for the spirit of\nAmerica, was also known as an important medical center (the home of the AMA)\nand as a regional center for abortion. Trains brought European immigrants, men\nand women migrating from farms to the city, African Americans moving from the\nSouth to the North, all going to live and work in Chicago. The same trains\nbrought women looking for abortions. Directing my attention to one city enabled\nme to uncover the nitty-gritty details of the practice and regulation of\nabortion. Though much of my analysis of the history of abortion draws on Chicago as a\ncase study, sources verify that my findings hold true for other cities, large\nand small. Throughout I present national data and trends as well as regional\nones and take note of patterns elsewhere. The book moves back and forth from a\nnational overview of abortion practices and politics to a close look at events\nin Chicago. As medical practice became more standardized in hospitals, the\nstory becomes a more national one and key events take place in other cities:\nNew York, Detroit, Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington, D.C.,\nand elsewhere. This is primarily a study of abortion in urban areas, where\nabortion was concentrated. I comment occasionally on practices in rural areas,\nbut the history of reproductive control and abortion is likely to be somewhat\ndifferent there. Legal records, most notably lower-level court and criminal trial records, and\nmedical literature make up the foundation of my research. I have also surveyed\nother government documents, newspapers, popular periodicals, hospital records,\nand manuscript collections. Using these materials, I have delineated how\nmedical thinking and state regulation have changed over time. Yet this is more\nthan a study of prescriptive literature or policy. I have uncovered the\ncircumstances of hundreds of actual induced abortions and reconstructed\nchanging abortion practices. This study periodizes the history of abortion for\nthe first time. This book presents the lives of many women and their abortions in rich detail\nin order to convey the variety and intricacy of the situations that made\nabortion necessary for women. It is in the minutiae of women's lives that we\ncan discover why women had abortions and how they won sympathy from physicians\nwho belonged to a profession dedicated to fighting abortion. Abortion was a\nmoment in a woman's reproductive life. It cannot be separated from sexual\nrelations or reproduction as a whole. Women themselves did not separate them,\nnor should we, whether analyzing abortion in the past or present. This book\ndeepens our understanding of the female experience of reproduction and the\nconnections between sexuality, contraception, pregnancy, and childbirth. At its\nmost fundamental, a policy that restricts abortion is one that forces women\ninto maternity. Without contraceptives and abortion, most women in heterosexual\nrelationships will become pregnant and bear children, whether they want to or\nnot. When women sought abortions, they often revealed the texture of\nheterosexual relations and the rest of their lives. Many situations made\nenduring pregnancy unbearable to women. In using abortion, women rebelled\nagainst the law and asserted their sense that the decision to carry a pregnancy\nto term or to abort was theirs to make. A few expressed in words as well as in\naction the view that abortion was their right. The experiences of women's\nprivate lives and private practices over the course of one hundred years\naltered medical thinking and reshaped public policy. Despite the fact that\nwomen's abortion narratives are part of our own contemporary discourse, the\nstories told here have long been hidden.

Despite the laws forbidding the\nsale of abortifacients, they were advertised in the popular press and could be\npurchased from physicians or pharmacists or through the mail. If drugs failed,\nwomen could go to a practitioner who specialized in performing instrumental\nabortions. Advertisements and newspaper exposes made it appear that what had\nbeen an occasional domestic practice had become a daily occurrence performed\nfor profit in northern cities. Madame Restell, for example, openly advertised\nand provided abortion services for thirty-five years. Restell began her\nabortion business in New York City in the late 1830s; by the mid-1840s, she had\noffices in Boston and Philadelphia and traveling agents who sold her \"Female\nMonthly Pills.\" Restell became the most infamous abortionist in the country,\nbut she was not the only abortionist. The clientele of these busy clinics were\nprimarily married, white, native-born Protestant women of the upper and middle\nclasses. In 1857, the newly organized AMA initiated a crusade to make abortion at every\nstage of pregnancy illegal. The antiabortion campaign grew in part, James Mohr\nhas shown, out of regular physicians' desire to win professional power, control\nmedical practice, and restrict their competitors, particularly Homeopaths and\nmidwives. \"Regular,\" or \"orthodox,\" physicians, practitioners of \"heroic\"\nmedicine, had come under attack in the 1820s and 1830s as elitist. They faced\ncompetition from a variety of practitioners from other medical sects,\ncollectively known as \"Irregulars.\" Through the 1870S, regular physicians\nacross the country worked for the passage of new criminal abortion laws. In\nsecuring criminal abortion laws, the Regulars won recognition of their\nparticular views as well as some state control over the practice of\nmedicine. Though professional issues underlay the medical campaign, gender, racial, and\nclass anxieties pushed the criminalization of abortion forward. The visible use\nof abortion by middle-class married women, in conjunction with other challenges\nto gender norms and changes in the social makeup of the nation, generated\nanxieties among American men of the same class. Birth rates among the Yankee\nclasses had declined by mid-century while immigrants poured into the country.\nAntiabortion activists pointed out that immigrant families, many of them\nCatholic, were larger and would soon outpopulate native-born white Yankees and\nthreaten their political power. Dr. Horatio R Storer, the leader of the medical\ncampaign against abortion, envisioned the spread of \"civilization\" west and\nsouth by native-born white Americans, not Mexicans, Chinese, Blacks, Indians,\nor Catholics. \"Shall\" these regions, he asked, \"be filled by our own children\nor by those of aliens? This is a question our women must answer; upon their\nloins depends the future destiny of the nation.\" Hostility to immigrants,\nCatholics, and people of color fueled this campaign to criminalize abortion.\nWhite male patriotism demanded that maternity be enforced among white\nProtestant women. The antiabortion campaign was antifeminist at its core. Women were condemned\nfor following \"fashion\" and for avoiding the self-sacrifice expected of\nmothers. \"The true wife,\" Storer declared, did not seek `'undue power in public\nlife, . . . undue control in domestic affairs, . . . [or] privileges not her\nown.\" The antiabortion campaign was a reactionary response to two important\nefforts of the nineteenth-century women's movements: the fight to admit women\ninto the regular medical profession and the battle to make men conform to a\nsingle standard of sexual behavior. The antiabortion campaign coincided with\nthe fight by male Regulars to keep women out of their medical schools,\nsocieties, and hospitals. Boston and Harvard University, Storer's hometown and\nalma mater, were key sites of struggle over women's place in medicine, and\nStorer was personally engaged in the battle against female physicians.\nAdvocates of women in medicine argued that women doctors would protect women\npatients from sexual violation. Regular male doctors degraded female physicians\nby accusing them, along with midwives, of performing abortions. The relative morality of men and women was of crucial importance to this\ncampaign. For the specialists, whose interest in the female reproductive system\nraised questions about their sexual morality, the antiabortion campaign was a\nway to proclaim their own high morality in contrast to their competitors, their\nfemale patients, and even the ministers who tolerated abortion. It was at the\nsame time a backlash against the women's movement's critique of male sexual\nbehavior and feminist claims to political power. Nineteenth-century feminists\nexpressed their anger with male sexual domination and promiscuity in a number\nof movements, including the campaigns against prostitution and slavery and the\nfight for temperance. All sections of the women's movement advocated \"voluntary\nmotherhood,\" a slogan that addressed both men's sexual violation of their wives\nand women's desire to control childbearing. Women saw themselves as morally\nsuperior and urged men to adopt a single standard  --  the female\nstandard of\nchastity until marriage, followed by monogamy and moderation. The campaign\nagainst abortion challenged this feminist analysis of men by condemning women\nfor having abortions. Indeed, Storer compared abortion to prostitution and, in\nso doing, called into question all claims made by middle-class\nnineteenth-century women on the basis of moral superiority. \"There is little\ndifference,\" he proclaimed, \"between the immorality\" of the man who visited\nprostitutes and the woman who aborted. The nineteenth-century women's movements\nnever defended abortion, but activist women and women doctors were blamed for\nthe practice of abortion nonetheless. The antiabortion campaign attempted to destroy the idea of quickening. As\nphysicians targeted quickening, they discredited women's experiences of\npregnancy and claimed pregnancy as medical terrain. \"Quickening,\" as Storer\ndescribed it, \"is in fact but a sensation.\" A sensation that had emotional,\nsocial, and legal meaning was thus denigrated. Quickening was based on women's\nown bodily sensations -- not on medical diagnosis. It made physicians, and\nobstetricians in particular, dependent on female self-diagnosis and judgment.\nQuickening could not be relied upon as an indicator of fetal life because,\nStorer argued, it did not occur at a standard moment. \"Many women never quicken\nat all,\" he joked about women's perceptions, \"though their children are born\nliving.\" Storer's propaganda aimed to erase the distinctions between earlier\nand later stages of pregnancy, thereby redefining the restoration of the\nmenses. What had previously been understood as a blockage and a restoration of\nthe menses prior to quickening was now associated with inducing a miscarriage\nafter quickening by labeling it abortion. Furthermore, Storer equated abortion\nwith infanticide. Regular medical men had entered the debate about sexual politics by attacking\nthe female practice of abortion as immoral, unwomanly, and unpatriotic. In\ngiving abortion new meaning, the Regulars provided a weapon that white,\nnative-born, male legislators could use against the women of their own class\nwho had been agitating for personal and political reform. Regular physicians\nwon passage of new criminal abortion laws because their campaign appealed to a\nset of fears of white, nativeborn, male elites about losing political power to\nCatholic immigrants and to women. Class privilege did not protect middle-class\nwhite women from public policy designed to control them. Although the\ncriminalization of abortion was aimed at middle-class white women, it affected\nwomen of every class and race. The new laws passed across the country between\n1860 and 1880 regarded abortion in an entirely different light from common law\nand the statutes regulating abortifacients. In general, the laws included two\ninnovations: they eliminated the common-law idea of quickening and prohibited\nabortion at any point in pregnancy. Some included punishment for the women who\nhad abortions. The \"Comstock Law\" passed in 1873 included abortion and birth\ncontrol in federal antiobscenity legislation; states and municipalities passed\nsimilar ordinances. The antiabortion laws made one exception: physicians could perform therapeutic\nabortions if pregnancy and childbirth threatened the woman's life. A bill\ncriminalizing abortion unless done for \" bona fide medical or surgical\npurposes\" passed the Illinois state legislature unanimously and was signed into\nlaw in 1867. A few years later, Illinois passed another law prohibiting the\nsale of abortifacients but made an exception for \"the written prescription of\nsome well known and respectable practicing physician.\" Physicians had won the\ncriminalization of abortion and retained to themselves alone the right to\ninduce abortions when they determined it necessary. Through the antiabortion campaign, doctors claimed scientific authority to\ndefine life and death. In so doing, they claimed the authority of religious\nleaders. In leading this moral crusade and thoroughly criticizing the\nministry's lack of interest in abortion, regular doctors set themselves above\nreligious leaders as well as above the general populace. The medical\nprofession's claim to moral purity and the authority of the clergy was a\nstepping-stone to greater social authority. Regular physicians won an important\nvictory when they persuaded the nation's states to criminalize abortion.\nPhysicians entered a new partnership with the state and won the power to set\nreproductive policy. In the process, women's perceptions of pregnancy were\ndelegitimated and women lost what had been a common-law right. Periodization: Changing Patterns of Illegal Abortion During the more than one hundred years that abortion was illegal in the United\nStates, the patterns; practice, policing, and politics of abortion all changed\nover time, though not always simultaneously. I trace the history along several\nlines at once, according to the location, practice, and availability of\nabortion as well as its regulation. Abortion was widely available throughout\nmuch of the era when abortion was a crime. Yet periods of tolerance were\npunctuated by moments of severe repression. At some points the changing\nstructure of medicine brought about crucial changes in the history of abortion;\nat others, changes in women's lives or the political and economic context came\nto the fore.

Women saw themselves as morally\nsuperior and urged men to adopt a single standard  --  the female\nstandard of\nchastity until marriage, followed by monogamy and moderation. The campaign\nagainst abortion challenged this feminist analysis of men by condemning women\nfor having abortions. Indeed, Storer compared abortion to prostitution and, in\nso doing, called into question all claims made by middle-class\nnineteenth-century women on the basis of moral superiority. \"There is little\ndifference,\" he proclaimed, \"between the immorality\" of the man who visited\nprostitutes and the woman who aborted. The nineteenth-century women's movements\nnever defended abortion, but activist women and women doctors were blamed for\nthe practice of abortion nonetheless. The antiabortion campaign attempted to destroy the idea of quickening. As\nphysicians targeted quickening, they discredited women's experiences of\npregnancy and claimed pregnancy as medical terrain. \"Quickening,\" as Storer\ndescribed it, \"is in fact but a sensation.\" A sensation that had emotional,\nsocial, and legal meaning was thus denigrated. Quickening was based on women's\nown bodily sensations -- not on medical diagnosis. It made physicians, and\nobstetricians in particular, dependent on female self-diagnosis and judgment.\nQuickening could not be relied upon as an indicator of fetal life because,\nStorer argued, it did not occur at a standard moment. \"Many women never quicken\nat all,\" he joked about women's perceptions, \"though their children are born\nliving.\" Storer's propaganda aimed to erase the distinctions between earlier\nand later stages of pregnancy, thereby redefining the restoration of the\nmenses. What had previously been understood as a blockage and a restoration of\nthe menses prior to quickening was now associated with inducing a miscarriage\nafter quickening by labeling it abortion. Furthermore, Storer equated abortion\nwith infanticide. Regular medical men had entered the debate about sexual politics by attacking\nthe female practice of abortion as immoral, unwomanly, and unpatriotic. In\ngiving abortion new meaning, the Regulars provided a weapon that white,\nnative-born, male legislators could use against the women of their own class\nwho had been agitating for personal and political reform. Regular physicians\nwon passage of new criminal abortion laws because their campaign appealed to a\nset of fears of white, nativeborn, male elites about losing political power to\nCatholic immigrants and to women. Class privilege did not protect middle-class\nwhite women from public policy designed to control them. Although the\ncriminalization of abortion was aimed at middle-class white women, it affected\nwomen of every class and race. The new laws passed across the country between\n1860 and 1880 regarded abortion in an entirely different light from common law\nand the statutes regulating abortifacients. In general, the laws included two\ninnovations: they eliminated the common-law idea of quickening and prohibited\nabortion at any point in pregnancy. Some included punishment for the women who\nhad abortions. The \"Comstock Law\" passed in 1873 included abortion and birth\ncontrol in federal antiobscenity legislation; states and municipalities passed\nsimilar ordinances. The antiabortion laws made one exception: physicians could perform therapeutic\nabortions if pregnancy and childbirth threatened the woman's life. A bill\ncriminalizing abortion unless done for \" bona fide medical or surgical\npurposes\" passed the Illinois state legislature unanimously and was signed into\nlaw in 1867. A few years later, Illinois passed another law prohibiting the\nsale of abortifacients but made an exception for \"the written prescription of\nsome well known and respectable practicing physician.\" Physicians had won the\ncriminalization of abortion and retained to themselves alone the right to\ninduce abortions when they determined it necessary. Through the antiabortion campaign, doctors claimed scientific authority to\ndefine life and death. In so doing, they claimed the authority of religious\nleaders. In leading this moral crusade and thoroughly criticizing the\nministry's lack of interest in abortion, regular doctors set themselves above\nreligious leaders as well as above the general populace. The medical\nprofession's claim to moral purity and the authority of the clergy was a\nstepping-stone to greater social authority. Regular physicians won an important\nvictory when they persuaded the nation's states to criminalize abortion.\nPhysicians entered a new partnership with the state and won the power to set\nreproductive policy. In the process, women's perceptions of pregnancy were\ndelegitimated and women lost what had been a common-law right. Periodization: Changing Patterns of Illegal Abortion During the more than one hundred years that abortion was illegal in the United\nStates, the patterns; practice, policing, and politics of abortion all changed\nover time, though not always simultaneously. I trace the history along several\nlines at once, according to the location, practice, and availability of\nabortion as well as its regulation. Abortion was widely available throughout\nmuch of the era when abortion was a crime. Yet periods of tolerance were\npunctuated by moments of severe repression. At some points the changing\nstructure of medicine brought about crucial changes in the history of abortion;\nat others, changes in women's lives or the political and economic context came\nto the fore. In the nineteenth century, abortion came under attack at a moment when women\nwere claiming political power; in the twentieth century, it came under attack\nwhen they claimed sexual freedom. Abortion, like contraception, means that\nwomen can separate sex and procreation -- still a controversial notion.\nAntiabortion campaigns developed when women asserted sexual independence, as\nduring the Progressive Era and since the 1970s. When abortion was most firmly\nlinked to the needs of family rather than the freedoms of women, as during the\nDepression, it was most ignored by those who would suppress it. Periods of\nantiabortion activity mark moments of hostility to female independence. The epoch of illegal abortion may be broken down into four periods. The first\ncovers the time from the criminalization of abortion state-by-state,\naccomplished nationwide by 1880, to 1930. This period, covering fifty years, is\nheavily marked by continuity. As other historians have also found, the\nreproductive lives of most women and the day-to-day practice of most physicians\nchanged slowly. In this period, abortion was widely accepted and was practiced\nin women's homes and in the offices of physicians and midwives. The diversity\nof practitioners, the privacy of medical practice, and the autonomy of\nphysicians in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries made the\nwidespread medical practice of abortion possible. A crackdown on abortion\noccurred between 1890 and 1920 as specialists in obstetrics renewed the earlier\ncampaign against abortion, and the medical profession was drawn into the\nstate's enforcement system. The structural transformation that occurred during the 1930s, the second\nperiod, was crucial for the history of abortion. Abortion became more available\nand changed location. As the practice moved from private offices and homes to\nhospitals and clinics, abortion was consolidated in medical hands and became\nmore visible. The changes wrought by the Depression accelerated the pace of\nchange in the coming decades, particularly in the methods of enforcing the\ncriminal abortion laws. The third period was marked by increasing restrictions on abortion by state\nand medical authorities and intensifying demand for abortion from women of all\ngroups. This period begins in 1940, when the new methods of controlling\nabortion were first instituted, and continues through 1973, when they were\ndismantled. In reaction to the growing practice of abortion as well as apparent\nchanges in female gender and reproductive patterns, a backlash against abortion\ndeveloped. 1940 marks a dividing line as hospitals instituted new policies, and\npolice and prosecutors changed their tactics. The repression of abortion was\npart of the repression of political and personal deviance that took place in\nthe 1940s and 1950s. Yet even in this period, the practice of abortion expanded\nin new directions in response to relentless demand. The new repression of\nabortion, however, was devastating for women. A dual system of abortion,\ndivided by race and class, developed. During the postwar period, the\ncriminalization of abortion produced its harshest results. A new stage in the history of abortion, the movement to legalize it, overlaps\nwith the third period. The movement to decriminalize abortion began in the\nmid-1950s and arose out of the difficult experiences resulting from the\nrepression of abortion in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1950s, a handful of\nphysicians began to challenge the very abortion laws their profession had\nadvocated a century earlier. The progress of that challenge attests to the\ncontinuing power of the medical profession to make public policy regarding\nreproduction. As legal reform moved forward, a new feminist movement arose,\nwhich radically transformed the movement for legal change. When the women's\nmovement described abortion as an aspect of sexual freedom, they articulated a\nnew feminist meaning for abortion; when they demanded abortion as a right, they\nechoed generations of women. The structure of this book follows this periodization. The first half of the\nbook uncovers the history of abortion from the late nineteenth century through\nthe 1920s. Chapters 1 through 4 each cover different aspects of abortion, from\nwomen's lives to practice to politics to enforcement, during the first\nhalf-century of illegal abortion. The changes of the 1930S, both medical and\nsocial, precipitated other changes. The second half of the book traces the\nhistory of abortion in chronologically ordered chapters concluding with the\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions that ended the era of illegal abortion. Women's history of abortion needs to be examined both as a commonly felt need\nto control reproduction, arising from women's biological capacity to bear\nchildren and social relations that assign childbearing to women, and in terms\nof differences among women. This book differentiates among women by class, race\nand ethnic identity, and marital status. Though class did not absolutely\ndetermine access to or safety of abortion, class position helped define when a\nwoman felt she needed an abortion and affected the type available to her. In\ngeneral, urban women had greater access to abortion than rural women, though\nsome rural women located abortionists in their areas or traveled to cities for\nabortions. Race played a less obvious role in access to abortion, though the\ngrim statistics of the postwar period show the connection between\ndiscrimination and death. I have made a specific effort to locate sources\nrelated to African Americans in order to learn more about black women's use of\nabortion and how race shaped the history of abortion. Evidence concerning women\nof color is meager, however, until the 1930s, when medical and sociological\nstudies began separating their findings by race. Before then, contemporary\nobservers tended to focus their attention on the differences among many (white)\nforeign-born ethnic groups. This book integrates a national analysis of the history of abortion with a\nlocal study. The advantage of this approach is that it connects everyday life\nand local medical and legal practice to national policy. It examines that\nrelationship rather than assuming that all the public policy action takes place\non the federal level without reference to local and \"private\" events. I select\na major metropolis in order to uncover the nature of both abortion practices\nand police enforcement of the criminal abortion laws. Chicago, the second\nlargest city in the nation, is the focus of my local study. Chicago, the city\nin \"the heartland\" that has of ten served as a metaphor for the spirit of\nAmerica, was also known as an important medical center (the home of the AMA)\nand as a regional center for abortion. Trains brought European immigrants, men\nand women migrating from farms to the city, African Americans moving from the\nSouth to the North, all going to live and work in Chicago. The same trains\nbrought women looking for abortions. Directing my attention to one city enabled\nme to uncover the nitty-gritty details of the practice and regulation of\nabortion. Though much of my analysis of the history of abortion draws on Chicago as a\ncase study, sources verify that my findings hold true for other cities, large\nand small. Throughout I present national data and trends as well as regional\nones and take note of patterns elsewhere. The book moves back and forth from a\nnational overview of abortion practices and politics to a close look at events\nin Chicago. As medical practice became more standardized in hospitals, the\nstory becomes a more national one and key events take place in other cities:\nNew York, Detroit, Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington, D.C.,\nand elsewhere. This is primarily a study of abortion in urban areas, where\nabortion was concentrated. I comment occasionally on practices in rural areas,\nbut the history of reproductive control and abortion is likely to be somewhat\ndifferent there. Legal records, most notably lower-level court and criminal trial records, and\nmedical literature make up the foundation of my research. I have also surveyed\nother government documents, newspapers, popular periodicals, hospital records,\nand manuscript collections. Using these materials, I have delineated how\nmedical thinking and state regulation have changed over time. Yet this is more\nthan a study of prescriptive literature or policy. I have uncovered the\ncircumstances of hundreds of actual induced abortions and reconstructed\nchanging abortion practices. This study periodizes the history of abortion for\nthe first time. This book presents the lives of many women and their abortions in rich detail\nin order to convey the variety and intricacy of the situations that made\nabortion necessary for women. It is in the minutiae of women's lives that we\ncan discover why women had abortions and how they won sympathy from physicians\nwho belonged to a profession dedicated to fighting abortion. Abortion was a\nmoment in a woman's reproductive life. It cannot be separated from sexual\nrelations or reproduction as a whole. Women themselves did not separate them,\nnor should we, whether analyzing abortion in the past or present. This book\ndeepens our understanding of the female experience of reproduction and the\nconnections between sexuality, contraception, pregnancy, and childbirth. At its\nmost fundamental, a policy that restricts abortion is one that forces women\ninto maternity. Without contraceptives and abortion, most women in heterosexual\nrelationships will become pregnant and bear children, whether they want to or\nnot. When women sought abortions, they often revealed the texture of\nheterosexual relations and the rest of their lives. Many situations made\nenduring pregnancy unbearable to women. In using abortion, women rebelled\nagainst the law and asserted their sense that the decision to carry a pregnancy\nto term or to abort was theirs to make. A few expressed in words as well as in\naction the view that abortion was their right. The experiences of women's\nprivate lives and private practices over the course of one hundred years\naltered medical thinking and reshaped public policy. Despite the fact that\nwomen's abortion narratives are part of our own contemporary discourse, the\nstories told here have long been hidden. Copyright © 1996  by the Regents of the University of California.\n\nThough professional issues underlay the medical campaign, gender, racial, and\nclass anxieties pushed the criminalization of abortion forward. The visible use\nof abortion by middle-class married women, in conjunction with other challenges\nto gender norms and changes in the social makeup of the nation, generated\nanxieties among American men of the same class. Birth rates among the Yankee\nclasses had declined by mid-century while immigrants poured into the country.\nAntiabortion activists pointed out that immigrant families, many of them\nCatholic, were larger and would soon outpopulate native-born white Yankees and\nthreaten their political power. Dr. Horatio R Storer, the leader of the medical\ncampaign against abortion, envisioned the spread of \"civilization\" west and\nsouth by native-born white Americans, not Mexicans, Chinese, Blacks, Indians,\nor Catholics. \"Shall\" these regions, he asked, \"be filled by our own children\nor by those of aliens? This is a question our women must answer; upon their\nloins depends the future destiny of the nation.\" Hostility to immigrants,\nCatholics, and people of color fueled this campaign to criminalize abortion.\nWhite male patriotism demanded that maternity be enforced among white\nProtestant women. The antiabortion campaign was antifeminist at its core. Women were condemned\nfor following \"fashion\" and for avoiding the self-sacrifice expected of\nmothers. \"The true wife,\" Storer declared, did not seek `'undue power in public\nlife, . . . undue control in domestic affairs, . . . [or] privileges not her\nown.\" The antiabortion campaign was a reactionary response to two important\nefforts of the nineteenth-century women's movements: the fight to admit women\ninto the regular medical profession and the battle to make men conform to a\nsingle standard of sexual behavior. The antiabortion campaign coincided with\nthe fight by male Regulars to keep women out of their medical schools,\nsocieties, and hospitals. Boston and Harvard University, Storer's hometown and\nalma mater, were key sites of struggle over women's place in medicine, and\nStorer was personally engaged in the battle against female physicians.\nAdvocates of women in medicine argued that women doctors would protect women\npatients from sexual violation. Regular male doctors degraded female physicians\nby accusing them, along with midwives, of performing abortions. The relative morality of men and women was of crucial importance to this\ncampaign. For the specialists, whose interest in the female reproductive system\nraised questions about their sexual morality, the antiabortion campaign was a\nway to proclaim their own high morality in contrast to their competitors, their\nfemale patients, and even the ministers who tolerated abortion. It was at the\nsame time a backlash against the women's movement's critique of male sexual\nbehavior and feminist claims to political power. Nineteenth-century feminists\nexpressed their anger with male sexual domination and promiscuity in a number\nof movements, including the campaigns against prostitution and slavery and the\nfight for temperance. All sections of the women's movement advocated \"voluntary\nmotherhood,\" a slogan that addressed both men's sexual violation of their wives\nand women's desire to control childbearing. Women saw themselves as morally\nsuperior and urged men to adopt a single standard  --  the female\nstandard of\nchastity until marriage, followed by monogamy and moderation.

As\nphysicians targeted quickening, they discredited women's experiences of\npregnancy and claimed pregnancy as medical terrain. \"Quickening,\" as Storer\ndescribed it, \"is in fact but a sensation.\" A sensation that had emotional,\nsocial, and legal meaning was thus denigrated. Quickening was based on women's\nown bodily sensations -- not on medical diagnosis. It made physicians, and\nobstetricians in particular, dependent on female self-diagnosis and judgment.\nQuickening could not be relied upon as an indicator of fetal life because,\nStorer argued, it did not occur at a standard moment. \"Many women never quicken\nat all,\" he joked about women's perceptions, \"though their children are born\nliving.\" Storer's propaganda aimed to erase the distinctions between earlier\nand later stages of pregnancy, thereby redefining the restoration of the\nmenses.

Boston and Harvard University, Storer's hometown and\nalma mater, were key sites of struggle over women's place in medicine, and\nStorer was personally engaged in the battle against female physicians.\nAdvocates of women in medicine argued that women doctors would protect women\npatients from sexual violation. Regular male doctors degraded female physicians\nby accusing them, along with midwives, of performing abortions. The relative morality of men and women was of crucial importance to this\ncampaign. For the specialists, whose interest in the female reproductive system\nraised questions about their sexual morality, the antiabortion campaign was a\nway to proclaim their own high morality in contrast to their competitors, their\nfemale patients, and even the ministers who tolerated abortion. It was at the\nsame time a backlash against the women's movement's critique of male sexual\nbehavior and feminist claims to political power. Nineteenth-century feminists\nexpressed their anger with male sexual domination and promiscuity in a number\nof movements, including the campaigns against prostitution and slavery and the\nfight for temperance. All sections of the women's movement advocated \"voluntary\nmotherhood,\" a slogan that addressed both men's sexual violation of their wives\nand women's desire to control childbearing. Women saw themselves as morally\nsuperior and urged men to adopt a single standard  --  the female\nstandard of\nchastity until marriage, followed by monogamy and moderation. The campaign\nagainst abortion challenged this feminist analysis of men by condemning women\nfor having abortions. Indeed, Storer compared abortion to prostitution and, in\nso doing, called into question all claims made by middle-class\nnineteenth-century women on the basis of moral superiority. \"There is little\ndifference,\" he proclaimed, \"between the immorality\" of the man who visited\nprostitutes and the woman who aborted. The nineteenth-century women's movements\nnever defended abortion, but activist women and women doctors were blamed for\nthe practice of abortion nonetheless. The antiabortion campaign attempted to destroy the idea of quickening. As\nphysicians targeted quickening, they discredited women's experiences of\npregnancy and claimed pregnancy as medical terrain. \"Quickening,\" as Storer\ndescribed it, \"is in fact but a sensation.\" A sensation that had emotional,\nsocial, and legal meaning was thus denigrated. Quickening was based on women's\nown bodily sensations -- not on medical diagnosis. It made physicians, and\nobstetricians in particular, dependent on female self-diagnosis and judgment.\nQuickening could not be relied upon as an indicator of fetal life because,\nStorer argued, it did not occur at a standard moment. \"Many women never quicken\nat all,\" he joked about women's perceptions, \"though their children are born\nliving.\" Storer's propaganda aimed to erase the distinctions between earlier\nand later stages of pregnancy, thereby redefining the restoration of the\nmenses. What had previously been understood as a blockage and a restoration of\nthe menses prior to quickening was now associated with inducing a miscarriage\nafter quickening by labeling it abortion. Furthermore, Storer equated abortion\nwith infanticide. Regular medical men had entered the debate about sexual politics by attacking\nthe female practice of abortion as immoral, unwomanly, and unpatriotic. In\ngiving abortion new meaning, the Regulars provided a weapon that white,\nnative-born, male legislators could use against the women of their own class\nwho had been agitating for personal and political reform. Regular physicians\nwon passage of new criminal abortion laws because their campaign appealed to a\nset of fears of white, nativeborn, male elites about losing political power to\nCatholic immigrants and to women. Class privilege did not protect middle-class\nwhite women from public policy designed to control them. Although the\ncriminalization of abortion was aimed at middle-class white women, it affected\nwomen of every class and race. The new laws passed across the country between\n1860 and 1880 regarded abortion in an entirely different light from common law\nand the statutes regulating abortifacients. In general, the laws included two\ninnovations: they eliminated the common-law idea of quickening and prohibited\nabortion at any point in pregnancy. Some included punishment for the women who\nhad abortions. The \"Comstock Law\" passed in 1873 included abortion and birth\ncontrol in federal antiobscenity legislation; states and municipalities passed\nsimilar ordinances. The antiabortion laws made one exception: physicians could perform therapeutic\nabortions if pregnancy and childbirth threatened the woman's life. A bill\ncriminalizing abortion unless done for \" bona fide medical or surgical\npurposes\" passed the Illinois state legislature unanimously and was signed into\nlaw in 1867. A few years later, Illinois passed another law prohibiting the\nsale of abortifacients but made an exception for \"the written prescription of\nsome well known and respectable practicing physician.\" Physicians had won the\ncriminalization of abortion and retained to themselves alone the right to\ninduce abortions when they determined it necessary. Through the antiabortion campaign, doctors claimed scientific authority to\ndefine life and death. In so doing, they claimed the authority of religious\nleaders. In leading this moral crusade and thoroughly criticizing the\nministry's lack of interest in abortion, regular doctors set themselves above\nreligious leaders as well as above the general populace. The medical\nprofession's claim to moral purity and the authority of the clergy was a\nstepping-stone to greater social authority. Regular physicians won an important\nvictory when they persuaded the nation's states to criminalize abortion.\nPhysicians entered a new partnership with the state and won the power to set\nreproductive policy. In the process, women's perceptions of pregnancy were\ndelegitimated and women lost what had been a common-law right. Periodization: Changing Patterns of Illegal Abortion During the more than one hundred years that abortion was illegal in the United\nStates, the patterns; practice, policing, and politics of abortion all changed\nover time, though not always simultaneously. I trace the history along several\nlines at once, according to the location, practice, and availability of\nabortion as well as its regulation. Abortion was widely available throughout\nmuch of the era when abortion was a crime. Yet periods of tolerance were\npunctuated by moments of severe repression. At some points the changing\nstructure of medicine brought about crucial changes in the history of abortion;\nat others, changes in women's lives or the political and economic context came\nto the fore. In the nineteenth century, abortion came under attack at a moment when women\nwere claiming political power; in the twentieth century, it came under attack\nwhen they claimed sexual freedom. Abortion, like contraception, means that\nwomen can separate sex and procreation -- still a controversial notion.\nAntiabortion campaigns developed when women asserted sexual independence, as\nduring the Progressive Era and since the 1970s. When abortion was most firmly\nlinked to the needs of family rather than the freedoms of women, as during the\nDepression, it was most ignored by those who would suppress it. Periods of\nantiabortion activity mark moments of hostility to female independence. The epoch of illegal abortion may be broken down into four periods. The first\ncovers the time from the criminalization of abortion state-by-state,\naccomplished nationwide by 1880, to 1930. This period, covering fifty years, is\nheavily marked by continuity. As other historians have also found, the\nreproductive lives of most women and the day-to-day practice of most physicians\nchanged slowly. In this period, abortion was widely accepted and was practiced\nin women's homes and in the offices of physicians and midwives. The diversity\nof practitioners, the privacy of medical practice, and the autonomy of\nphysicians in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries made the\nwidespread medical practice of abortion possible. A crackdown on abortion\noccurred between 1890 and 1920 as specialists in obstetrics renewed the earlier\ncampaign against abortion, and the medical profession was drawn into the\nstate's enforcement system. The structural transformation that occurred during the 1930s, the second\nperiod, was crucial for the history of abortion. Abortion became more available\nand changed location. As the practice moved from private offices and homes to\nhospitals and clinics, abortion was consolidated in medical hands and became\nmore visible. The changes wrought by the Depression accelerated the pace of\nchange in the coming decades, particularly in the methods of enforcing the\ncriminal abortion laws. The third period was marked by increasing restrictions on abortion by state\nand medical authorities and intensifying demand for abortion from women of all\ngroups. This period begins in 1940, when the new methods of controlling\nabortion were first instituted, and continues through 1973, when they were\ndismantled. In reaction to the growing practice of abortion as well as apparent\nchanges in female gender and reproductive patterns, a backlash against abortion\ndeveloped. 1940 marks a dividing line as hospitals instituted new policies, and\npolice and prosecutors changed their tactics. The repression of abortion was\npart of the repression of political and personal deviance that took place in\nthe 1940s and 1950s. Yet even in this period, the practice of abortion expanded\nin new directions in response to relentless demand. The new repression of\nabortion, however, was devastating for women. A dual system of abortion,\ndivided by race and class, developed. During the postwar period, the\ncriminalization of abortion produced its harshest results. A new stage in the history of abortion, the movement to legalize it, overlaps\nwith the third period. The movement to decriminalize abortion began in the\nmid-1950s and arose out of the difficult experiences resulting from the\nrepression of abortion in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1950s, a handful of\nphysicians began to challenge the very abortion laws their profession had\nadvocated a century earlier. The progress of that challenge attests to the\ncontinuing power of the medical profession to make public policy regarding\nreproduction. As legal reform moved forward, a new feminist movement arose,\nwhich radically transformed the movement for legal change. When the women's\nmovement described abortion as an aspect of sexual freedom, they articulated a\nnew feminist meaning for abortion; when they demanded abortion as a right, they\nechoed generations of women. The structure of this book follows this periodization. The first half of the\nbook uncovers the history of abortion from the late nineteenth century through\nthe 1920s. Chapters 1 through 4 each cover different aspects of abortion, from\nwomen's lives to practice to politics to enforcement, during the first\nhalf-century of illegal abortion. The changes of the 1930S, both medical and\nsocial, precipitated other changes. The second half of the book traces the\nhistory of abortion in chronologically ordered chapters concluding with the\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions that ended the era of illegal abortion. Women's history of abortion needs to be examined both as a commonly felt need\nto control reproduction, arising from women's biological capacity to bear\nchildren and social relations that assign childbearing to women, and in terms\nof differences among women. This book differentiates among women by class, race\nand ethnic identity, and marital status. Though class did not absolutely\ndetermine access to or safety of abortion, class position helped define when a\nwoman felt she needed an abortion and affected the type available to her. In\ngeneral, urban women had greater access to abortion than rural women, though\nsome rural women located abortionists in their areas or traveled to cities for\nabortions. Race played a less obvious role in access to abortion, though the\ngrim statistics of the postwar period show the connection between\ndiscrimination and death. I have made a specific effort to locate sources\nrelated to African Americans in order to learn more about black women's use of\nabortion and how race shaped the history of abortion. Evidence concerning women\nof color is meager, however, until the 1930s, when medical and sociological\nstudies began separating their findings by race. Before then, contemporary\nobservers tended to focus their attention on the differences among many (white)\nforeign-born ethnic groups. This book integrates a national analysis of the history of abortion with a\nlocal study. The advantage of this approach is that it connects everyday life\nand local medical and legal practice to national policy. It examines that\nrelationship rather than assuming that all the public policy action takes place\non the federal level without reference to local and \"private\" events. I select\na major metropolis in order to uncover the nature of both abortion practices\nand police enforcement of the criminal abortion laws. Chicago, the second\nlargest city in the nation, is the focus of my local study. Chicago, the city\nin \"the heartland\" that has of ten served as a metaphor for the spirit of\nAmerica, was also known as an important medical center (the home of the AMA)\nand as a regional center for abortion. Trains brought European immigrants, men\nand women migrating from farms to the city, African Americans moving from the\nSouth to the North, all going to live and work in Chicago. The same trains\nbrought women looking for abortions. Directing my attention to one city enabled\nme to uncover the nitty-gritty details of the practice and regulation of\nabortion. Though much of my analysis of the history of abortion draws on Chicago as a\ncase study, sources verify that my findings hold true for other cities, large\nand small. Throughout I present national data and trends as well as regional\nones and take note of patterns elsewhere. The book moves back and forth from a\nnational overview of abortion practices and politics to a close look at events\nin Chicago. As medical practice became more standardized in hospitals, the\nstory becomes a more national one and key events take place in other cities:\nNew York, Detroit, Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington, D.C.,\nand elsewhere. This is primarily a study of abortion in urban areas, where\nabortion was concentrated. I comment occasionally on practices in rural areas,\nbut the history of reproductive control and abortion is likely to be somewhat\ndifferent there. Legal records, most notably lower-level court and criminal trial records, and\nmedical literature make up the foundation of my research. I have also surveyed\nother government documents, newspapers, popular periodicals, hospital records,\nand manuscript collections. Using these materials, I have delineated how\nmedical thinking and state regulation have changed over time. Yet this is more\nthan a study of prescriptive literature or policy. I have uncovered the\ncircumstances of hundreds of actual induced abortions and reconstructed\nchanging abortion practices. This study periodizes the history of abortion for\nthe first time. This book presents the lives of many women and their abortions in rich detail\nin order to convey the variety and intricacy of the situations that made\nabortion necessary for women. It is in the minutiae of women's lives that we\ncan discover why women had abortions and how they won sympathy from physicians\nwho belonged to a profession dedicated to fighting abortion. Abortion was a\nmoment in a woman's reproductive life. It cannot be separated from sexual\nrelations or reproduction as a whole. Women themselves did not separate them,\nnor should we, whether analyzing abortion in the past or present. This book\ndeepens our understanding of the female experience of reproduction and the\nconnections between sexuality, contraception, pregnancy, and childbirth. At its\nmost fundamental, a policy that restricts abortion is one that forces women\ninto maternity. Without contraceptives and abortion, most women in heterosexual\nrelationships will become pregnant and bear children, whether they want to or\nnot. When women sought abortions, they often revealed the texture of\nheterosexual relations and the rest of their lives. Many situations made\nenduring pregnancy unbearable to women. In using abortion, women rebelled\nagainst the law and asserted their sense that the decision to carry a pregnancy\nto term or to abort was theirs to make. A few expressed in words as well as in\naction the view that abortion was their right. The experiences of women's\nprivate lives and private practices over the course of one hundred years\naltered medical thinking and reshaped public policy. Despite the fact that\nwomen's abortion narratives are part of our own contemporary discourse, the\nstories told here have long been hidden.

Class privilege did not protect middle-class\nwhite women from public policy designed to control them. Although the\ncriminalization of abortion was aimed at middle-class white women, it affected\nwomen of every class and race. The new laws passed across the country between\n1860 and 1880 regarded abortion in an entirely different light from common law\nand the statutes regulating abortifacients. In general, the laws included two\ninnovations: they eliminated the common-law idea of quickening and prohibited\nabortion at any point in pregnancy. Some included punishment for the women who\nhad abortions. The \"Comstock Law\" passed in 1873 included abortion and birth\ncontrol in federal antiobscenity legislation; states and municipalities passed\nsimilar ordinances. The antiabortion laws made one exception: physicians could perform therapeutic\nabortions if pregnancy and childbirth threatened the woman's life. A bill\ncriminalizing abortion unless done for \" bona fide medical or surgical\npurposes\" passed the Illinois state legislature unanimously and was signed into\nlaw in 1867. A few years later, Illinois passed another law prohibiting the\nsale of abortifacients but made an exception for \"the written prescription of\nsome well known and respectable practicing physician.\" Physicians had won the\ncriminalization of abortion and retained to themselves alone the right to\ninduce abortions when they determined it necessary. Through the antiabortion campaign, doctors claimed scientific authority to\ndefine life and death. In so doing, they claimed the authority of religious\nleaders. In leading this moral crusade and thoroughly criticizing the\nministry's lack of interest in abortion, regular doctors set themselves above\nreligious leaders as well as above the general populace. The medical\nprofession's claim to moral purity and the authority of the clergy was a\nstepping-stone to greater social authority. Regular physicians won an important\nvictory when they persuaded the nation's states to criminalize abortion.\nPhysicians entered a new partnership with the state and won the power to set\nreproductive policy. In the process, women's perceptions of pregnancy were\ndelegitimated and women lost what had been a common-law right. Periodization: Changing Patterns of Illegal Abortion During the more than one hundred years that abortion was illegal in the United\nStates, the patterns; practice, policing, and politics of abortion all changed\nover time, though not always simultaneously. I trace the history along several\nlines at once, according to the location, practice, and availability of\nabortion as well as its regulation. Abortion was widely available throughout\nmuch of the era when abortion was a crime. Yet periods of tolerance were\npunctuated by moments of severe repression. At some points the changing\nstructure of medicine brought about crucial changes in the history of abortion;\nat others, changes in women's lives or the political and economic context came\nto the fore. In the nineteenth century, abortion came under attack at a moment when women\nwere claiming political power; in the twentieth century, it came under attack\nwhen they claimed sexual freedom. Abortion, like contraception, means that\nwomen can separate sex and procreation -- still a controversial notion.\nAntiabortion campaigns developed when women asserted sexual independence, as\nduring the Progressive Era and since the 1970s. When abortion was most firmly\nlinked to the needs of family rather than the freedoms of women, as during the\nDepression, it was most ignored by those who would suppress it. Periods of\nantiabortion activity mark moments of hostility to female independence. The epoch of illegal abortion may be broken down into four periods. The first\ncovers the time from the criminalization of abortion state-by-state,\naccomplished nationwide by 1880, to 1930. This period, covering fifty years, is\nheavily marked by continuity. As other historians have also found, the\nreproductive lives of most women and the day-to-day practice of most physicians\nchanged slowly. In this period, abortion was widely accepted and was practiced\nin women's homes and in the offices of physicians and midwives. The diversity\nof practitioners, the privacy of medical practice, and the autonomy of\nphysicians in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries made the\nwidespread medical practice of abortion possible. A crackdown on abortion\noccurred between 1890 and 1920 as specialists in obstetrics renewed the earlier\ncampaign against abortion, and the medical profession was drawn into the\nstate's enforcement system. The structural transformation that occurred during the 1930s, the second\nperiod, was crucial for the history of abortion. Abortion became more available\nand changed location. As the practice moved from private offices and homes to\nhospitals and clinics, abortion was consolidated in medical hands and became\nmore visible. The changes wrought by the Depression accelerated the pace of\nchange in the coming decades, particularly in the methods of enforcing the\ncriminal abortion laws. The third period was marked by increasing restrictions on abortion by state\nand medical authorities and intensifying demand for abortion from women of all\ngroups. This period begins in 1940, when the new methods of controlling\nabortion were first instituted, and continues through 1973, when they were\ndismantled. In reaction to the growing practice of abortion as well as apparent\nchanges in female gender and reproductive patterns, a backlash against abortion\ndeveloped. 1940 marks a dividing line as hospitals instituted new policies, and\npolice and prosecutors changed their tactics. The repression of abortion was\npart of the repression of political and personal deviance that took place in\nthe 1940s and 1950s. Yet even in this period, the practice of abortion expanded\nin new directions in response to relentless demand. The new repression of\nabortion, however, was devastating for women. A dual system of abortion,\ndivided by race and class, developed. During the postwar period, the\ncriminalization of abortion produced its harshest results. A new stage in the history of abortion, the movement to legalize it, overlaps\nwith the third period. The movement to decriminalize abortion began in the\nmid-1950s and arose out of the difficult experiences resulting from the\nrepression of abortion in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1950s, a handful of\nphysicians began to challenge the very abortion laws their profession had\nadvocated a century earlier. The progress of that challenge attests to the\ncontinuing power of the medical profession to make public policy regarding\nreproduction. As legal reform moved forward, a new feminist movement arose,\nwhich radically transformed the movement for legal change. When the women's\nmovement described abortion as an aspect of sexual freedom, they articulated a\nnew feminist meaning for abortion; when they demanded abortion as a right, they\nechoed generations of women. The structure of this book follows this periodization. The first half of the\nbook uncovers the history of abortion from the late nineteenth century through\nthe 1920s. Chapters 1 through 4 each cover different aspects of abortion, from\nwomen's lives to practice to politics to enforcement, during the first\nhalf-century of illegal abortion. The changes of the 1930S, both medical and\nsocial, precipitated other changes. The second half of the book traces the\nhistory of abortion in chronologically ordered chapters concluding with the\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions that ended the era of illegal abortion. Women's history of abortion needs to be examined both as a commonly felt need\nto control reproduction, arising from women's biological capacity to bear\nchildren and social relations that assign childbearing to women, and in terms\nof differences among women. This book differentiates among women by class, race\nand ethnic identity, and marital status. Though class did not absolutely\ndetermine access to or safety of abortion, class position helped define when a\nwoman felt she needed an abortion and affected the type available to her. In\ngeneral, urban women had greater access to abortion than rural women, though\nsome rural women located abortionists in their areas or traveled to cities for\nabortions. Race played a less obvious role in access to abortion, though the\ngrim statistics of the postwar period show the connection between\ndiscrimination and death. I have made a specific effort to locate sources\nrelated to African Americans in order to learn more about black women's use of\nabortion and how race shaped the history of abortion. Evidence concerning women\nof color is meager, however, until the 1930s, when medical and sociological\nstudies began separating their findings by race. Before then, contemporary\nobservers tended to focus their attention on the differences among many (white)\nforeign-born ethnic groups. This book integrates a national analysis of the history of abortion with a\nlocal study. The advantage of this approach is that it connects everyday life\nand local medical and legal practice to national policy. It examines that\nrelationship rather than assuming that all the public policy action takes place\non the federal level without reference to local and \"private\" events. I select\na major metropolis in order to uncover the nature of both abortion practices\nand police enforcement of the criminal abortion laws. Chicago, the second\nlargest city in the nation, is the focus of my local study. Chicago, the city\nin \"the heartland\" that has of ten served as a metaphor for the spirit of\nAmerica, was also known as an important medical center (the home of the AMA)\nand as a regional center for abortion. Trains brought European immigrants, men\nand women migrating from farms to the city, African Americans moving from the\nSouth to the North, all going to live and work in Chicago. The same trains\nbrought women looking for abortions. Directing my attention to one city enabled\nme to uncover the nitty-gritty details of the practice and regulation of\nabortion. Though much of my analysis of the history of abortion draws on Chicago as a\ncase study, sources verify that my findings hold true for other cities, large\nand small. Throughout I present national data and trends as well as regional\nones and take note of patterns elsewhere. The book moves back and forth from a\nnational overview of abortion practices and politics to a close look at events\nin Chicago. As medical practice became more standardized in hospitals, the\nstory becomes a more national one and key events take place in other cities:\nNew York, Detroit, Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington, D.C.,\nand elsewhere. This is primarily a study of abortion in urban areas, where\nabortion was concentrated. I comment occasionally on practices in rural areas,\nbut the history of reproductive control and abortion is likely to be somewhat\ndifferent there. Legal records, most notably lower-level court and criminal trial records, and\nmedical literature make up the foundation of my research. I have also surveyed\nother government documents, newspapers, popular periodicals, hospital records,\nand manuscript collections. Using these materials, I have delineated how\nmedical thinking and state regulation have changed over time. Yet this is more\nthan a study of prescriptive literature or policy. I have uncovered the\ncircumstances of hundreds of actual induced abortions and reconstructed\nchanging abortion practices. This study periodizes the history of abortion for\nthe first time. This book presents the lives of many women and their abortions in rich detail\nin order to convey the variety and intricacy of the situations that made\nabortion necessary for women. It is in the minutiae of women's lives that we\ncan discover why women had abortions and how they won sympathy from physicians\nwho belonged to a profession dedicated to fighting abortion. Abortion was a\nmoment in a woman's reproductive life. It cannot be separated from sexual\nrelations or reproduction as a whole. Women themselves did not separate them,\nnor should we, whether analyzing abortion in the past or present. This book\ndeepens our understanding of the female experience of reproduction and the\nconnections between sexuality, contraception, pregnancy, and childbirth. At its\nmost fundamental, a policy that restricts abortion is one that forces women\ninto maternity. Without contraceptives and abortion, most women in heterosexual\nrelationships will become pregnant and bear children, whether they want to or\nnot. When women sought abortions, they often revealed the texture of\nheterosexual relations and the rest of their lives. Many situations made\nenduring pregnancy unbearable to women. In using abortion, women rebelled\nagainst the law and asserted their sense that the decision to carry a pregnancy\nto term or to abort was theirs to make. A few expressed in words as well as in\naction the view that abortion was their right. The experiences of women's\nprivate lives and private practices over the course of one hundred years\naltered medical thinking and reshaped public policy. Despite the fact that\nwomen's abortion narratives are part of our own contemporary discourse, the\nstories told here have long been hidden.

It examines that\nrelationship rather than assuming that all the public policy action takes place\non the federal level without reference to local and \"private\" events. I select\na major metropolis in order to uncover the nature of both abortion practices\nand police enforcement of the criminal abortion laws. Chicago, the second\nlargest city in the nation, is the focus of my local study. Chicago, the city\nin \"the heartland\" that has of ten served as a metaphor for the spirit of\nAmerica, was also known as an important medical center (the home of the AMA)\nand as a regional center for abortion. Trains brought European immigrants, men\nand women migrating from farms to the city, African Americans moving from the\nSouth to the North, all going to live and work in Chicago. The same trains\nbrought women looking for abortions. Directing my attention to one city enabled\nme to uncover the nitty-gritty details of the practice and regulation of\nabortion. Though much of my analysis of the history of abortion draws on Chicago as a\ncase study, sources verify that my findings hold true for other cities, large\nand small. Throughout I present national data and trends as well as regional\nones and take note of patterns elsewhere. The book moves back and forth from a\nnational overview of abortion practices and politics to a close look at events\nin Chicago. As medical practice became more standardized in hospitals, the\nstory becomes a more national one and key events take place in other cities:\nNew York, Detroit, Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington, D.C.,\nand elsewhere. This is primarily a study of abortion in urban areas, where\nabortion was concentrated. I comment occasionally on practices in rural areas,\nbut the history of reproductive control and abortion is likely to be somewhat\ndifferent there. Legal records, most notably lower-level court and criminal trial records, and\nmedical literature make up the foundation of my research. I have also surveyed\nother government documents, newspapers, popular periodicals, hospital records,\nand manuscript collections. Using these materials, I have delineated how\nmedical thinking and state regulation have changed over time. Yet this is more\nthan a study of prescriptive literature or policy. I have uncovered the\ncircumstances of hundreds of actual induced abortions and reconstructed\nchanging abortion practices. This study periodizes the history of abortion for\nthe first time. This book presents the lives of many women and their abortions in rich detail\nin order to convey the variety and intricacy of the situations that made\nabortion necessary for women. It is in the minutiae of women's lives that we\ncan discover why women had abortions and how they won sympathy from physicians\nwho belonged to a profession dedicated to fighting abortion. Abortion was a\nmoment in a woman's reproductive life. It cannot be separated from sexual\nrelations or reproduction as a whole. Women themselves did not separate them,\nnor should we, whether analyzing abortion in the past or present. This book\ndeepens our understanding of the female experience of reproduction and the\nconnections between sexuality, contraception, pregnancy, and childbirth. At its\nmost fundamental, a policy that restricts abortion is one that forces women\ninto maternity. Without contraceptives and abortion, most women in heterosexual\nrelationships will become pregnant and bear children, whether they want to or\nnot. When women sought abortions, they often revealed the texture of\nheterosexual relations and the rest of their lives. Many situations made\nenduring pregnancy unbearable to women. In using abortion, women rebelled\nagainst the law and asserted their sense that the decision to carry a pregnancy\nto term or to abort was theirs to make. A few expressed in words as well as in\naction the view that abortion was their right. The experiences of women's\nprivate lives and private practices over the course of one hundred years\naltered medical thinking and reshaped public policy. Despite the fact that\nwomen's abortion narratives are part of our own contemporary discourse, the\nstories told here have long been hidden.

In so doing, they claimed the authority of religious\nleaders. In leading this moral crusade and thoroughly criticizing the\nministry's lack of interest in abortion, regular doctors set themselves above\nreligious leaders as well as above the general populace. The medical\nprofession's claim to moral purity and the authority of the clergy was a\nstepping-stone to greater social authority. Regular physicians won an important\nvictory when they persuaded the nation's states to criminalize abortion.\nPhysicians entered a new partnership with the state and won the power to set\nreproductive policy. In the process, women's perceptions of pregnancy were\ndelegitimated and women lost what had been a common-law right. Periodization: Changing Patterns of Illegal Abortion During the more than one hundred years that abortion was illegal in the United\nStates, the patterns; practice, policing, and politics of abortion all changed\nover time, though not always simultaneously. I trace the history along several\nlines at once, according to the location, practice, and availability of\nabortion as well as its regulation. Abortion was widely available throughout\nmuch of the era when abortion was a crime. Yet periods of tolerance were\npunctuated by moments of severe repression. At some points the changing\nstructure of medicine brought about crucial changes in the history of abortion;\nat others, changes in women's lives or the political and economic context came\nto the fore. In the nineteenth century, abortion came under attack at a moment when women\nwere claiming political power; in the twentieth century, it came under attack\nwhen they claimed sexual freedom. Abortion, like contraception, means that\nwomen can separate sex and procreation -- still a controversial notion.\nAntiabortion campaigns developed when women asserted sexual independence, as\nduring the Progressive Era and since the 1970s. When abortion was most firmly\nlinked to the needs of family rather than the freedoms of women, as during the\nDepression, it was most ignored by those who would suppress it. Periods of\nantiabortion activity mark moments of hostility to female independence. The epoch of illegal abortion may be broken down into four periods. The first\ncovers the time from the criminalization of abortion state-by-state,\naccomplished nationwide by 1880, to 1930. This period, covering fifty years, is\nheavily marked by continuity. As other historians have also found, the\nreproductive lives of most women and the day-to-day practice of most physicians\nchanged slowly. In this period, abortion was widely accepted and was practiced\nin women's homes and in the offices of physicians and midwives. The diversity\nof practitioners, the privacy of medical practice, and the autonomy of\nphysicians in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries made the\nwidespread medical practice of abortion possible. A crackdown on abortion\noccurred between 1890 and 1920 as specialists in obstetrics renewed the earlier\ncampaign against abortion, and the medical profession was drawn into the\nstate's enforcement system. The structural transformation that occurred during the 1930s, the second\nperiod, was crucial for the history of abortion. Abortion became more available\nand changed location. As the practice moved from private offices and homes to\nhospitals and clinics, abortion was consolidated in medical hands and became\nmore visible. The changes wrought by the Depression accelerated the pace of\nchange in the coming decades, particularly in the methods of enforcing the\ncriminal abortion laws. The third period was marked by increasing restrictions on abortion by state\nand medical authorities and intensifying demand for abortion from women of all\ngroups. This period begins in 1940, when the new methods of controlling\nabortion were first instituted, and continues through 1973, when they were\ndismantled. In reaction to the growing practice of abortion as well as apparent\nchanges in female gender and reproductive patterns, a backlash against abortion\ndeveloped. 1940 marks a dividing line as hospitals instituted new policies, and\npolice and prosecutors changed their tactics. The repression of abortion was\npart of the repression of political and personal deviance that took place in\nthe 1940s and 1950s. Yet even in this period, the practice of abortion expanded\nin new directions in response to relentless demand. The new repression of\nabortion, however, was devastating for women. A dual system of abortion,\ndivided by race and class, developed. During the postwar period, the\ncriminalization of abortion produced its harshest results. A new stage in the history of abortion, the movement to legalize it, overlaps\nwith the third period. The movement to decriminalize abortion began in the\nmid-1950s and arose out of the difficult experiences resulting from the\nrepression of abortion in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1950s, a handful of\nphysicians began to challenge the very abortion laws their profession had\nadvocated a century earlier. The progress of that challenge attests to the\ncontinuing power of the medical profession to make public policy regarding\nreproduction. As legal reform moved forward, a new feminist movement arose,\nwhich radically transformed the movement for legal change. When the women's\nmovement described abortion as an aspect of sexual freedom, they articulated a\nnew feminist meaning for abortion; when they demanded abortion as a right, they\nechoed generations of women. The structure of this book follows this periodization. The first half of the\nbook uncovers the history of abortion from the late nineteenth century through\nthe 1920s. Chapters 1 through 4 each cover different aspects of abortion, from\nwomen's lives to practice to politics to enforcement, during the first\nhalf-century of illegal abortion. The changes of the 1930S, both medical and\nsocial, precipitated other changes. The second half of the book traces the\nhistory of abortion in chronologically ordered chapters concluding with the\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions that ended the era of illegal abortion. Women's history of abortion needs to be examined both as a commonly felt need\nto control reproduction, arising from women's biological capacity to bear\nchildren and social relations that assign childbearing to women, and in terms\nof differences among women. This book differentiates among women by class, race\nand ethnic identity, and marital status. Though class did not absolutely\ndetermine access to or safety of abortion, class position helped define when a\nwoman felt she needed an abortion and affected the type available to her. In\ngeneral, urban women had greater access to abortion than rural women, though\nsome rural women located abortionists in their areas or traveled to cities for\nabortions. Race played a less obvious role in access to abortion, though the\ngrim statistics of the postwar period show the connection between\ndiscrimination and death. I have made a specific effort to locate sources\nrelated to African Americans in order to learn more about black women's use of\nabortion and how race shaped the history of abortion. Evidence concerning women\nof color is meager, however, until the 1930s, when medical and sociological\nstudies began separating their findings by race. Before then, contemporary\nobservers tended to focus their attention on the differences among many (white)\nforeign-born ethnic groups.

The first\ncovers the time from the criminalization of abortion state-by-state,\naccomplished nationwide by 1880, to 1930. This period, covering fifty years, is\nheavily marked by continuity. As other historians have also found, the\nreproductive lives of most women and the day-to-day practice of most physicians\nchanged slowly. In this period, abortion was widely accepted and was practiced\nin women's homes and in the offices of physicians and midwives. The diversity\nof practitioners, the privacy of medical practice, and the autonomy of\nphysicians in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries made the\nwidespread medical practice of abortion possible. A crackdown on abortion\noccurred between 1890 and 1920 as specialists in obstetrics renewed the earlier\ncampaign against abortion, and the medical profession was drawn into the\nstate's enforcement system. The structural transformation that occurred during the 1930s, the second\nperiod, was crucial for the history of abortion. Abortion became more available\nand changed location. As the practice moved from private offices and homes to\nhospitals and clinics, abortion was consolidated in medical hands and became\nmore visible. The changes wrought by the Depression accelerated the pace of\nchange in the coming decades, particularly in the methods of enforcing the\ncriminal abortion laws. The third period was marked by increasing restrictions on abortion by state\nand medical authorities and intensifying demand for abortion from women of all\ngroups. This period begins in 1940, when the new methods of controlling\nabortion were first instituted, and continues through 1973, when they were\ndismantled. In reaction to the growing practice of abortion as well as apparent\nchanges in female gender and reproductive patterns, a backlash against abortion\ndeveloped. 1940 marks a dividing line as hospitals instituted new policies, and\npolice and prosecutors changed their tactics. The repression of abortion was\npart of the repression of political and personal deviance that took place in\nthe 1940s and 1950s. Yet even in this period, the practice of abortion expanded\nin new directions in response to relentless demand. The new repression of\nabortion, however, was devastating for women. A dual system of abortion,\ndivided by race and class, developed. During the postwar period, the\ncriminalization of abortion produced its harshest results. A new stage in the history of abortion, the movement to legalize it, overlaps\nwith the third period. The movement to decriminalize abortion began in the\nmid-1950s and arose out of the difficult experiences resulting from the\nrepression of abortion in the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1950s, a handful of\nphysicians began to challenge the very abortion laws their profession had\nadvocated a century earlier. The progress of that challenge attests to the\ncontinuing power of the medical profession to make public policy regarding\nreproduction. As legal reform moved forward, a new feminist movement arose,\nwhich radically transformed the movement for legal change. When the women's\nmovement described abortion as an aspect of sexual freedom, they articulated a\nnew feminist meaning for abortion; when they demanded abortion as a right, they\nechoed generations of women. The structure of this book follows this periodization. The first half of the\nbook uncovers the history of abortion from the late nineteenth century through\nthe 1920s. Chapters 1 through 4 each cover different aspects of abortion, from\nwomen's lives to practice to politics to enforcement, during the first\nhalf-century of illegal abortion. The changes of the 1930S, both medical and\nsocial, precipitated other changes. The second half of the book traces the\nhistory of abortion in chronologically ordered chapters concluding with the\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions that ended the era of illegal abortion. Women's history of abortion needs to be examined both as a commonly felt need\nto control reproduction, arising from women's biological capacity to bear\nchildren and social relations that assign childbearing to women, and in terms\nof differences among women. This book differentiates among women by class, race\nand ethnic identity, and marital status. Though class did not absolutely\ndetermine access to or safety of abortion, class position helped define when a\nwoman felt she needed an abortion and affected the type available to her. In\ngeneral, urban women had greater access to abortion than rural women, though\nsome rural women located abortionists in their areas or traveled to cities for\nabortions. Race played a less obvious role in access to abortion, though the\ngrim statistics of the postwar period show the connection between\ndiscrimination and death. I have made a specific effort to locate sources\nrelated to African Americans in order to learn more about black women's use of\nabortion and how race shaped the history of abortion. Evidence concerning women\nof color is meager, however, until the 1930s, when medical and sociological\nstudies began separating their findings by race. Before then, contemporary\nobservers tended to focus their attention on the differences among many (white)\nforeign-born ethnic groups. This book integrates a national analysis of the history of abortion with a\nlocal study. The advantage of this approach is that it connects everyday life\nand local medical and legal practice to national policy. It examines that\nrelationship rather than assuming that all the public policy action takes place\non the federal level without reference to local and \"private\" events. I select\na major metropolis in order to uncover the nature of both abortion practices\nand police enforcement of the criminal abortion laws. Chicago, the second\nlargest city in the nation, is the focus of my local study. Chicago, the city\nin \"the heartland\" that has of ten served as a metaphor for the spirit of\nAmerica, was also known as an important medical center (the home of the AMA)\nand as a regional center for abortion. Trains brought European immigrants, men\nand women migrating from farms to the city, African Americans moving from the\nSouth to the North, all going to live and work in Chicago. The same trains\nbrought women looking for abortions. Directing my attention to one city enabled\nme to uncover the nitty-gritty details of the practice and regulation of\nabortion. Though much of my analysis of the history of abortion draws on Chicago as a\ncase study, sources verify that my findings hold true for other cities, large\nand small. Throughout I present national data and trends as well as regional\nones and take note of patterns elsewhere. The book moves back and forth from a\nnational overview of abortion practices and politics to a close look at events\nin Chicago. As medical practice became more standardized in hospitals, the\nstory becomes a more national one and key events take place in other cities:\nNew York, Detroit, Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington, D.C.,\nand elsewhere. This is primarily a study of abortion in urban areas, where\nabortion was concentrated. I comment occasionally on practices in rural areas,\nbut the history of reproductive control and abortion is likely to be somewhat\ndifferent there. Legal records, most notably lower-level court and criminal trial records, and\nmedical literature make up the foundation of my research. I have also surveyed\nother government documents, newspapers, popular periodicals, hospital records,\nand manuscript collections. Using these materials, I have delineated how\nmedical thinking and state regulation have changed over time. Yet this is more\nthan a study of prescriptive literature or policy.

Copyright © 1996  by the Regents of the University of California.\n\nThe structure of this book follows this periodization. The first half of the\nbook uncovers the history of abortion from the late nineteenth century through\nthe 1920s. Chapters 1 through 4 each cover different aspects of abortion, from\nwomen's lives to practice to politics to enforcement, during the first\nhalf-century of illegal abortion. The changes of the 1930S, both medical and\nsocial, precipitated other changes. The second half of the book traces the\nhistory of abortion in chronologically ordered chapters concluding with the\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions that ended the era of illegal abortion. Women's history of abortion needs to be examined both as a commonly felt need\nto control reproduction, arising from women's biological capacity to bear\nchildren and social relations that assign childbearing to women, and in terms\nof differences among women. This book differentiates among women by class, race\nand ethnic identity, and marital status. Though class did not absolutely\ndetermine access to or safety of abortion, class position helped define when a\nwoman felt she needed an abortion and affected the type available to her. In\ngeneral, urban women had greater access to abortion than rural women, though\nsome rural women located abortionists in their areas or traveled to cities for\nabortions. Race played a less obvious role in access to abortion, though the\ngrim statistics of the postwar period show the connection between\ndiscrimination and death. I have made a specific effort to locate sources\nrelated to African Americans in order to learn more about black women's use of\nabortion and how race shaped the history of abortion. Evidence concerning women\nof color is meager, however, until the 1930s, when medical and sociological\nstudies began separating their findings by race. Before then, contemporary\nobservers tended to focus their attention on the differences among many (white)\nforeign-born ethnic groups. This book integrates a national analysis of the history of abortion with a\nlocal study. The advantage of this approach is that it connects everyday life\nand local medical and legal practice to national policy. It examines that\nrelationship rather than assuming that all the public policy action takes place\non the federal level without reference to local and \"private\" events. I select\na major metropolis in order to uncover the nature of both abortion practices\nand police enforcement of the criminal abortion laws. Chicago, the second\nlargest city in the nation, is the focus of my local study. Chicago, the city\nin \"the heartland\" that has of ten served as a metaphor for the spirit of\nAmerica, was also known as an important medical center (the home of the AMA)\nand as a regional center for abortion. Trains brought European immigrants, men\nand women migrating from farms to the city, African Americans moving from the\nSouth to the North, all going to live and work in Chicago. The same trains\nbrought women looking for abortions. Directing my attention to one city enabled\nme to uncover the nitty-gritty details of the practice and regulation of\nabortion. Though much of my analysis of the history of abortion draws on Chicago as a\ncase study, sources verify that my findings hold true for other cities, large\nand small. Throughout I present national data and trends as well as regional\nones and take note of patterns elsewhere. The book moves back and forth from a\nnational overview of abortion practices and politics to a close look at events\nin Chicago. As medical practice became more standardized in hospitals, the\nstory becomes a more national one and key events take place in other cities:\nNew York, Detroit, Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington, D.C.,\nand elsewhere. This is primarily a study of abortion in urban areas, where\nabortion was concentrated. I comment occasionally on practices in rural areas,\nbut the history of reproductive control and abortion is likely to be somewhat\ndifferent there. Legal records, most notably lower-level court and criminal trial records, and\nmedical literature make up the foundation of my research. I have also surveyed\nother government documents, newspapers, popular periodicals, hospital records,\nand manuscript collections. Using these materials, I have delineated how\nmedical thinking and state regulation have changed over time. Yet this is more\nthan a study of prescriptive literature or policy. I have uncovered the\ncircumstances of hundreds of actual induced abortions and reconstructed\nchanging abortion practices. This study periodizes the history of abortion for\nthe first time. This book presents the lives of many women and their abortions in rich detail\nin order to convey the variety and intricacy of the situations that made\nabortion necessary for women. It is in the minutiae of women's lives that we\ncan discover why women had abortions and how they won sympathy from physicians\nwho belonged to a profession dedicated to fighting abortion. Abortion was a\nmoment in a woman's reproductive life. It cannot be separated from sexual\nrelations or reproduction as a whole. Women themselves did not separate them,\nnor should we, whether analyzing abortion in the past or present. This book\ndeepens our understanding of the female experience of reproduction and the\nconnections between sexuality, contraception, pregnancy, and childbirth. At its\nmost fundamental, a policy that restricts abortion is one that forces women\ninto maternity. Without contraceptives and abortion, most women in heterosexual\nrelationships will become pregnant and bear children, whether they want to or\nnot. When women sought abortions, they often revealed the texture of\nheterosexual relations and the rest of their lives. Many situations made\nenduring pregnancy unbearable to women. In using abortion, women rebelled\nagainst the law and asserted their sense that the decision to carry a pregnancy\nto term or to abort was theirs to make.

      "text": "The Next Abortion Battlefront\n\nPlane tickets and gas money will shape the future of abortion in the United States.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nAbortion policy in America is at a stalemate. Republicans will take control of Congress in January, ready to block any national protections-but with a slim majority, making a national ban unlikely. At the state level, pro-choice advocates have focused for the past two years on ballot measures to protect abortion rights. Most of those measures have passed; now there are only two states left that have severe restrictions , allow constitutional amendments, and haven't already failed to pass constitutional protections.\n\nSince Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022, U.S. abortion rates have held steady, or even risen. That's in part because tens of thousands of women in states with extensive restrictions have ordered the two-pill medication-abortion regimen, mifepristone and misoprostol, by mail. Many thousands more have sought out procedural abortions in states with more lenient rules, and that number may soon begin to rise more steeply. The pills don't work in every scenario, many women who use them to circumvent restrictions fear being prosecuted, and a lawsuit brought by the attorneys general of three conservative states seeks to both outlaw mifepristone for minors and prevent it from being mailed. Project 2025, a blueprint for Donald Trump's second term created by people with close ties to his incoming administration, outlines a plan to have the FDA pull mifepristone from the market. (Trump himself has flip-flopped repeatedly on whether he might try curbing access to the pill.)\n\nFurther restrictions on abortion pills could push more women to cross state lines to receive an abortion. That travel can cost thousands of dollars. Since Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , a network of so-called practical-support groups has played a growing role booking and funding abortion-related travel. Their work is quieter than the fights in courts and legislatures, but perhaps as crucial to determining the future of abortion in America. As options for major policy changes winnow, this approach is likely to play an even more important role in maintaining access to abortion in the U.S.-and to attract more opposition. Abortion care, like virtually all medical treatment in America, has always been geographically fractured, with people in poor and rural areas traveling farther to reach services. A study published last month found that people who travel out of state for an abortion are more likely to face expenses that threaten their ability to pay for basic needs. The tighter restrictions get, and the more states put them in place, the greater the distance the average patient must cross, and the greater the average cost of doing so. Practical-support organizations might provide gas money, arrange airport pickups and drop-offs, or even fund the purchase of a winter coat if the travel involves a colder climate. Nancy Davis , a Louisiana resident, sought help from a group called the Brigid Alliance in 2022 when an ultrasound revealed at about 10 weeks that her fetus had acrania, a rare and fatal condition in which the skull does not fully form. Her doctor recommended ending her pregnancy, but abortion had just been banned in Louisiana, so Davis booked an appointment in New York. Brigid took care of the cost of plane tickets, a hotel, and food for Davis and her fiancé, as well as funding child care for her three kids at home. Megan Kovacs, a volunteer and board member with the Northwest Abortion Access Fund, told me that this level of logistical support is becoming more and more necessary.\n\nUntil recently, practical-support organizations such as the Northwest Abortion Access Fund existed mainly to help, say, someone in rural eastern Oregon travel a few hours to a clinic in Boise, Idaho. But when Dobbs overturned Roe in 2022, aid organizations' work became more in demand, more expensive, and more complicated, Marisa Falcon, the executive director of a hub for practical-support groups called Apiary, told me. A patient from Arkansas who has scheduled a procedure in Chicago, for example, might rely on a group in Illinois to book flights and hotels and another in Arkansas to drive them to the airport. Because of new restrictions in Idaho, the Northwest Abortion Access Fund spends more money sending patients from eastern Oregon to farther-away urban areas like Portland, as well as helping patients in Idaho leave the state. According to data that Kovacs shared with me, the organization spent an average of $585 on things like hotels and gas money per client in the two years before Dobbs ; since Dobbs , the average is nearly $875. The number of clients seeking practical support has almost tripled.\n\nRead: There's no coming back from Dobbs\n\nSupport groups also told me that costs are rising because, as the number of clinics dwindles, appointment waiting lists are getting longer, so people wind up having abortions further into pregnancy. The longer a person waits to end their pregnancy, the more complicated and expensive abortion becomes; patients also take longer to recover. \"What used to be a one-day activity is now a four-day activity where people need to leave their kids behind,\" Falcon said. \"Not only are the logistics more complicated, but it costs significantly more.\"\n\nIn the Dobbs decision, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that U.S. citizens have a \"constitutional right to interstate travel,\" including for abortions. But abortion opponents are nonetheless trying to prevent people from crossing state lines for care that they see as a threat to unborn life. In Alabama, for example , Attorney General Steve Marshall has said helping someone travel for an abortion is akin to a \"criminal conspiracy.\" Last year, Idaho outlawed helping a minor travel out of state for an abortion without parental permission. Tennessee passed a copycat law this year. So far both of these efforts have faced legal challenges, and similar bills introduced in other states have failed to advance. Texas has taken a different approach: Some local laws allow residents to sue anyone who assists a woman in traveling through their city or county to get an abortion in another state. At least one Texas man has already taken legal action against his former girlfriend, expressing an intent to file a wrongful-death suit against anyone who assisted her in allegedly pursuing an abortion out of state.\n\nEven if none of these legal efforts succeed, abortion opponents can try to limit the work of practical-support groups by restricting their funding. The organization representatives I spoke with said that the pace of their funding has not kept up with demand for their services. Some smaller groups simply don't have enough money to meet demand. If abortion is further restricted-if, for example, mifepristone's FDA approval is revoked, or if the lawsuit challenging it succeeds-demand for out-of-state travel will skyrocket again.\n\nRead: Abortion pills have changed the post- Roe calculus\n\nAbortion support services rely mostly on donations, but some also receive funding from state or local governments. That government money has already become a target for anti-abortion groups seeking to curtail abortion travel. In 2023, for example, Ohio voters approved a constitutional amendment enshrining the right to an abortion; in response, a state legislator introduced a bill that would withhold state funding from cities and counties that give money to practical-support groups. Last month, ballot measures protecting abortion rights passed in seven states, and legislators in some of them may attempt to repeat the Ohio strategy. Kristi Hamrick, the vice president of media and policy for the anti-abortion group Students for Life Action, told me that the group opposes using any taxpayer funding for abortion travel and has already asked that Trump restrict the military's funding of travel for service members seeking abortions.\n\nAs travel plays a larger role in how Americans access abortions, it will also inevitably become a bigger target for abortion opponents. Practical-support groups told me that in recent years, abortion-rights advocates have focused on funding campaigns to pass legislation, leaving practical support groups short of the money necessary to serve a growing number of would-be travelers. People still need to travel or obtain medication to end their pregnancy in huge swaths of the country-even in places where abortion rights have notched recent victories. In Missouri, for example, a November ballot initiative made abortion legal, but a host of other laws could mean a long wait before abortions are widely available there. \"Without abortion support organizations, people just won't access abortion,\" Serra Sippel, the executive director of the Brigid Alliance, told me. If advocates could wave a magic wand and reinstitute Roe tomorrow , it wouldn't make a difference if people can't get to a clinic-many of which no longer exist post- Dobbs . The most consequential fights, for now, may be the practical ones, even if they're just about some gas money, a babysitter, and a winter coat."

      "text": "The Future of Abortion in a Post- Roe America\n\nInside the covert network preparing to circumvent restrictions\n\nListen to more stories on audm\n\nUpdated at 9:22 a.m. ET on April 5, 2022.\n\nOne bright afternoon in early January, on a beach in Southern California, a young woman spread what looked like a very strange picnic across an orange polka-dot towel: A mason jar. A rubber stopper with two holes. A syringe without a needle. A coil of aquarium tubing and a one-way valve. A plastic speculum. Several individually wrapped sterile cannulas-thin tubes designed to be inserted into the body-which resembled long soda straws. And, finally, a three-dimensional scale model of the female reproductive system.\n\nCheck out more from this issue and find your next story to read.\n\nThe two of us were sitting on the sand. The woman, whom I'll call Ellie, had suggested that we meet at the beach; she had recently recovered from COVID-19, and proposed the open-air setting for my safety. She also didn't want to risk revealing where she lives-and asked me to withhold her name-because of concerns about harassment or violence from anti-abortion extremists.\n\nEllie snugged the rubber stopper into the mason jar. She snipped the aquarium tubing into a pair of foot-long segments and attached the valve to the syringe's plastic tip. In less than 10 minutes, Ellie had finished the project: a simple abortion device. It looked like a cross between an at-home beer-brewing kit and a seventh-grade science experiment.\n\nThe two segments of tubing protruded from the holes in the stopper. One was connected to a cannula, the other to the syringe. Holding the anatomical model, Ellie traced a path with the tip of the cannula into the vagina and through the cervix, positioning it to suction out the contents of the uterus. Next, to show more clearly how the suction process works, she placed the cannula into her coffee. When she drew back the plunger on the syringe, dark fluid coursed through the aquarium tubing and into the mason jar, collecting slowly within the diamond-patterned glass.\n\nI had read about such devices before. But watching the scene on the beach towel brought history into focus with startling clarity: Women did this the last time abortion was illegal.\n\nEllie didn't invent this device. That distinction goes to Lorraine Rothman, an Orange County public-school teacher and activist. In 1971, members of her feminist self-help group had been familiarizing themselves with the work of an illegal abortion clinic in Santa Monica. The owner, a psychologist named Harvey Karman , had designed a slender, flexible straw-now known as a Karman cannula, and a standard piece of medical equipment-which he used to draw the contents of a uterus into a large syringe. Karman's method took only a few minutes and had been nicknamed a \"lunch-hour abortion\" because patients could return to regular activities afterward. It was less invasive than dilation and curettage, a procedure that uses a surgical instrument to scrape the uterine walls.\n\nTwo years before the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade changed the legal landscape for abortion in the United States, Rothman was developing her own version of Karman's apparatus, rummaging around aquarium stores and chemistry labs for parts . She added a bypass valve to prevent air from accidentally being pumped back into the uterus, and a mason jar to increase the holding capacity. The result was an abortion device that was easy to make and suitable for ending pregnancies during most of the first trimester.\n\nFor purposes of plausible deniability, Rothman promoted the device as a tool for what she referred to as \" menstrual extraction \": a technique a woman could use to pass her entire period at once, rather than over several days. In October 1971, she embarked on a Greyhound-bus tour with a fellow activist, Carol Downer , to spread the word. In six weeks, they visited 23 cities, traveling from Los Angeles to Manhattan and calling themselves the West Coast Sisters. Soon women all over the country were making the device, which Rothman and Downer had called a Del-Em. (When I met Downer, now 88, earlier this year, I asked her about the meaning of the name; she said it was an \"inside thing\" and \"not to be shared.\")\n\nOne might have expected the Del-Em to have disappeared after Roe affirmed the constitutional right to an abortion everywhere in America. Yet the Del-Em remained quietly in use here and there, conveyed from one generation to the next. This was in part because of continued fears that abortion rights would again be curtailed-an event that may now be imminent if the Supreme Court upholds statewide bans. But it was also because of a desire among some women to maintain control over their bodies, without oversight from the medical profession, regardless of Roe 's status.\n\nActivists are still tinkering with Rothman's design. One added a second valve. Another upgraded the suction using a penis pump (a vacuum device used to stimulate an erection), explaining, \"It's like going from a pogo stick to a Lamborghini.\" An American midwife living in Canada told me about repurposing an automotive brake-bleeding kit: \"You just add a cannula onto the end.\" She estimated that she had performed hundreds of abortions, using the Del-Em but also other methods, including medical-grade manual vacuum-aspiration kits and pharmaceuticals. The midwife is part of a network of self-described \"community providers\"-a term for people who perform abortions and offer other reproductive-health-care services outside the medical system. Before the coronavirus pandemic, she traveled and taught in-person workshops throughout the U.S. and Canada. She now teaches online. Ellie learned to build a Del-Em in one of her classes.\n\nFor Ellie, the Del-Em was more symbolic than pragmatic-an amulet from the past to carry into an uncertain future. After all, pharmaceuticals can now be used to end pregnancies in the first trimester, when more than 90 percent of legal abortions occur. (Almost 99 percent of abortions occur within the first 20 weeks.) There are also modern, mass-produced manual vacuum-aspiration devices for doing what the Del-Em does. Community providers have talked about stockpiling such supplies in case Roe falls. Ellie has coined a term for people who share that outlook: \"vaginal preppers.\"\n\nGiven the uncertainties, she suggested, it couldn't hurt to have a do-it-yourself tool like the Del-Em. \"Just knowing the people who came before you had other ways of managing these things, not necessarily through a doctor or condoned by a government-there's something really powerful in that,\" she said.\n\nAs Ellie packed her supplies back into a tote bag, she told me to take the Del-Em. She gave me the speculum, too.\n\nListen to The Experiment podcast: The reporter Jessica Bruder speaks with activists prepared to take abortion into their own hands.\n\nListen and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | Google Podcasts\n\nThere is a lot of talk about prepping these days. Roe v. Wade could well be further weakened or overturned by late June, when the Supreme Court is expected to hand down a decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization . At issue is a Mississippi law banning nearly all abortions past 15 weeks of pregnancy. This is a direct challenge to both Roe and the Court's follow-on decision, nearly two decades later, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey . In these two decisions, the Court has held that states can ban abortion (except when the mother's health or life is threatened) only past the point of fetal viability, which Casey found to be when a woman is roughly 23 to 24 weeks pregnant. Prior to that point, the Court's holdings permit states to impose limited restrictions on abortion, so long as they don't pose an \"undue burden\" on a woman's right to an abortion. The Court now has a 6-3 conservative majority. By upholding the Mississippi ban, it would, in essence, nullify Roe 's recognition of the constitutional right to an abortion prior to viability. According to a 2021 Gallup poll, fewer than one in three Americans supports that outcome. The legality of abortion would largely be left to the states. Thirteen states have \"trigger bans\" on the books-laws that will take effect the moment Roe is overturned.* More than half of all states are certain or likely to attempt to ban abortion if the Supreme Court provides legal space to do so, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion-rights research organization.\n\nFor many Americans, Roe already feels meaningless. Nearly 90 percent of U.S. counties lack a clinic that offers abortions. States have passed more than 1,300 restrictions on abortion since it was made a constitutional right; for people struggling to get by, those restrictions can be insurmountable. Obtaining an abortion often means traveling long distances , which also means finding money for transportation, lodging, and child care, not to mention taking time off from work. In some states, people may reach a clinic only to learn that they are legally required to make two visits-one for counseling, the second for the abortion-with a mandatory waiting period of up to three days in between. The cost of an in-clinic abortion ranges from about $500 in the first trimester to more than $1,000 if the pregnancy is further along; that expense is ineligible for federal funding under a long-standing restriction called the Hyde Amendment , which makes abortions inaccessible for many low-income people.\n\nA sprawling grassroots infrastructure has already grown in the cracks created by such challenges, even with Roe still the law of the land. More than 90 local organizations known as abortion funds raise money to pay for procedures and related expenses. Practical-support groups offer rides to medical facilities, along with housing, child care, and translation services. Clinic escorts guide patients past throngs of angry protesters. Doctors and other abortion providers travel hundreds of miles to work in underserved areas that are openly hostile to abortion.\n\nThis improvised safety net doesn't catch everyone, though. Below the grass roots is the underground: a small network of community providers who connect with abortion seekers by word of mouth. This network, too, is growing. Its ranks include midwives, herbalists, doulas, and educators. When necessary, they are often willing to work around the law.\n\nEven before the pandemic, with state restrictions mounting, the grass roots and the underground struggled to meet the demand for help. Then, as the coronavirus was first surging, a dozen states-most of them in the South, but also including Alaska, Iowa, and Ohio- moved to suspend nearly all access to abortion, describing it as a nonessential procedure. A handful of those efforts were temporarily successful, creating what felt to some like a dress rehearsal for the end of Roe . That feeling returned last fall when Texas used a creative legal strategy to ban most abortions after roughly six weeks' gestation. Legal challenges to the law have so far failed.\n\nThe impact of the Texas law was immediate. Neighboring states experienced a swell of people seeking help, creating bottlenecks and forcing local patients to go out of state themselves in a secondary wave of migration. A term gained currency: \" abortion refugees .\"\n\nEllie told me she was disgusted by the developments in Texas. \"Our reproductive rights are not given to us by the government,\" she said. \"They're not given to us by anyone. We inherently have them.\" Her belief in that sort of independence was formed long before the current debate; her family, she explained, was always interested in alternative medicine and, by age 7 or 8, she wanted to become a midwife. As a preteen, she read a novel called The Red Tent , set in biblical times, whose title refers to a place where women find refuge during menstruation and childbirth. In high school, classmates brought her their awkward questions about sex. After college, Ellie attended a retreat for sex educators that rekindled her old interests. She took jobs providing midwives and doulas with logistical support and eventually started a business in reproductive health-a red tent of her own.\n\nIt seems hard to imagine now, but America was not always so sharply divided over abortion. In the early decades of American independence, the states drew guidance from traditional British common law, which did not recognize the existence of a fetus until the \"quickening\": the moment a woman felt the fetus move, usually during the second trimester. Before that, even if pregnancy was suspected, there was no way to confirm it. Women could legally seek relief from what doctors characterized as an \"obstructed menses,\" soliciting treatments from midwives or home-health manuals and in many cases making use of herbs that had been employed since antiquity (and that are sometimes used today).\n\nRead: Bringing down the flowers: The controversial history of abortion\n\nThrough the first third of the 19th century, as the historian James Mohr has noted, abortion was widely seen as the last resort of women desperate to avoid the disgrace of an illegitimate child. Over the next few decades, the incidence of abortion rose. Mohr explains that the impetus came largely from \"white, married, Protestant, native-born women of the middle and upper classes who either wished to delay their childbearing or already had all the children they wanted.\" By mid-century, newspapers were full of advertisements for patent medicines such as Dr. Vandenburgh's Female Renovating Pills and Madame Drunette's Lunar Pills, which claimed-with a knowing arch of the eyebrow-to restore menstrual cycles. Some of the commercial preparations were dangerous; the first abortion statutes, passed in the 1820s and '30s, were mostly poison-control measures aimed at regulating these products.\n\nThe effort to regulate abortion more explicitly, which began some years later, was less civic-minded. At the time, American physicians were working to organize and consolidate their profession. After forming the American Medical Association, in 1847, they began lobbying against abortion-ostensibly on moral grounds but also in part to neutralize some of the competition from midwives and homeopaths. Within a generation, every state had laws criminalizing the practice, pushing it into a netherworld and inviting dangerous procedures. In 1930, some 2,700 women died from abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute . While some providers-including physicians-managed to offer safe, sometimes clandestine care, many women resorted to shady practitioners or self-managed abortions . By 1965, fatalities caused by illegal abortions still accounted for nearly a fifth of maternal deaths.\n\nAs the women's-rights movement gained momentum, doctors, lawyers, and public-health advocates began lobbying to reform abortion laws . Some activists, tired of waiting for change, took matters into their own hands. Underground abortion-referral services began to operate across the country. The Army of Three, a trio of California activists, traveled nationwide, holding workshops; they also distributed lists of well-vetted abortion providers in other countries. The Clergy Consultation Service-a group numbering 1,400, mainly Protestant ministers but also including rabbis and Catholic priests- connected countless women with abortion providers . Their work is a reminder that the abortion debate, often presented in stark terms of religious faith versus personal freedom, has always been one where people weigh competing values in complex ways.\n\nFrom the December 2019 issue: Caitlin Flanagan on the dishonesty of the abortion debate\n\nWomen like Lorraine Rothman and Carol Downer, meanwhile, were spreading the news about the Del-Em; before Roe , menstrual-extraction groups were active all across the country. Such work was part of a larger mission that activists called self-help: teaching women how to take charge of their own reproductive health. In Chicago, volunteers with a group called the Jane Collective started out by referring patients to abortion providers, then learned how to perform the procedure themselves. The group performed about 12,000 abortions from 1969 to 1973.\n\nAmerican women weren't alone in pushing back against abortion restrictions. In Brazil, where abortion has been a crime since the late 19th century, women found another way to resist. In the 1980s, they discovered an off-label use for a drug called misoprostol, sold under the brand name Cytotec, which was marketed for treating stomach ulcers. It had a potent side effect: heavy uterine contractions that could expel an early pregnancy. This discovery led to misoprostol's adoption as an abortifacient by the medical community. In 2005, the World Health Organization added misoprostol to its list of essential medicines, along with another abortifacient, mifepristone, better known as RU-486. The drugs have become a major focus of the American abortion underground today.\n\nOne December afternoon on a Zoom call conducted from Cambridge, Massachusetts, a dozen participants tucked Skittles and M&M's into their cheeks, then looked at one another awkwardly. I was among them. We had been told to position the Skittles and M&M's with care: two on each side of the lower jaw, nestled into the buccal cavity, the pouch running along the gums. This is a method for taking misoprostol. Absorbing the drug in this manner-or alternatively, by means of vaginal insertion-means it bypasses the digestive system, going directly into the bloodstream. Chipmunk-faced, we awaited further instructions.\n\nRead: Women in the U.S. can now get safe abortions by mail\n\n\"Keep them there for 30 minutes,\" instructed Susan Yanow, a reproductive-rights advocate. \"What we're going to learn right now is that's easier said than done-to not chew, to not swallow.\" In real life, she added, the pills would melt even more slowly than the candies. And they would taste like cardboard.\n\nThe audience had logged on from eight states, as well as from Poland and Peru, to learn about ending pregnancies with legal drugs and without medical supervision. In other words: self-managed abortion by means of pharmaceuticals. \"The knowledge you're going to get today is very empowering,\" Yanow told the group. \"But the real power is in sharing it.\" If Roe is overturned, she said, more people will need access to this information, and fast. Part of Yanow's job is spreading the word. She is the spokesperson for SASS- Self-Managed Abortion; Safe and Supported -a project of the global advocacy group Women Help Women, which had developed the day's curriculum. The class was designed to self-replicate with a model called \"train the trainer,\" turning students into future teachers.\n\nAbortion pills-mifepristone and misoprostol, colloquially called \"mife\" (pronounced \"miffy\") and \"miso\"-are remarkably effective and medically safer than acetaminophen and Viagra. They're FDA-approved for ending pregnancies up to 10 weeks' gestation. The WHO has protocols for using them to end pregnancies up to 12 weeks' gestation, and even later. (Taking them further along, however, can raise the risk of complications.) Misoprostol is often used on its own to induce an abortion. But the most effective protocol calls for both drugs in sequence, and with time in between-first mifepristone, then misoprostol. The combination is available online, for prices that typically range from $150 to as much as $600, depending on one's state and insurance. In many states, it can legally be prescribed by telemedicine and delivered by mail.\n\nSome reproductive-rights activists point to pharmaceuticals as the best fallback plan for a post- Roe era. Ending a pregnancy with pills, also known as medication abortion, already accounts for more than half of all abortions in the U.S. But most American adults don't even know the option exists. Only about one in five has heard of medication abortion, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey published in 2020. Among adult women of reproductive age, it's about one in three.\n\nThat knowledge gap can have serious consequences. Laurie Bertram Roberts is the executive director of the Alabama-based Yellowhammer Fund , which offers financial support for abortion seekers. In recent years, she told me, she has encountered or heard about situations in which pregnant women drink bleach or turpentine, \"jab a coat hanger up into themselves,\" or \"ask their boyfriends to beat them up.\" She believes that if more people knew about abortion pills-particularly women of color and the poor, who will be disproportionately affected by a Roe reversal-they would be far safer. \"To me, as a Black person, it just makes sense,\" she said.\n\nPills are not a one-size-fits-all solution-no drug or medical procedure ever is. Any form of intervention requires care and common sense, and attention to other health issues. People with certain medical conditions, including bleeding disorders and adrenal failure, are unable to use abortion pills. And not everyone reacts to the medication the same way. In most cases, the contents of the uterus are expelled within four hours, and almost certainly within two days, but the process can take as long as a week. (In contrast, vacuum-aspiration methods are also used for terminating early pregnancies, but typically take less than 30 minutes.)\n\nLaws governing access to the medications are in constant flux and differ wildly around the country; erecting roadblocks to abortion is a clear motivation behind much of the legislation. Thus, 19 states bar the use of telehealth for medication abortion or require patients to consume mifepristone in the physical presence of a clinician; some do both. That eliminates the cheaper and more convenient option: a consultation online or by phone, then receiving pharmaceuticals in the mail. In Texas, patients seeking a medication abortion must make three in-person visits: one for counseling, another to receive the pills, and a third for a medical check afterward.\n\nSelf-managed abortion is currently banned outright in three states. Its status is legally murky in many others. At the start of her three-hour class, Yanow opened a PowerPoint presentation. She showed us a map of the U.S. with 22 states shaded in orange. In those places, Yanow said, self-managed abortion had led to people being investigated. Some were charged with felonies under laws that were not actually intended to target abortion, including murder in Georgia and abuse of a corpse in Arkansas. In Indiana, a woman named Purvi Patel was convicted of feticide and given a 20-year sentence. The conviction was later overturned, but only after Patel had already served three years in prison. Yanow drove the message home: Anyone who helped those people could have been charged, too, as accessories to a crime.\n\nIf it were possible to feel the air go out of a Zoom room, we would have felt it then. But, Yanow continued, there was a simple way to stay safe legally. That was to only share information, rather than give explicit advice, encouragement, or assistance.\n\nYanow described the availability of misoprostol and mifepristone. Mife is tightly regulated and can cost more than $100 a pill. Miso is much cheaper and easier to find. It is used to treat stomach ulcers in humans as well as in cats, dogs, and horses. Pharmacies in Mexico sell misoprostol under its Cytotec brand name. The pills come in blue-and-white boxes with fuchsia accents and have a shelf life of about two years. \"The last time I was in Nuevo Progreso, a tiny border town, they were stacked up on the counter like chocolate bars would be here,\" Yanow recalled. \"As if for an impulse buy.\"\n\nYanow matter-of-factly described what people taking the two-drug combination can expect. The regimen starts with mife, a progesterone blocker that stops the pregnancy from growing. It continues one or two days later with miso, which makes the uterus contract and expel gestational tissue. The experience is like having a spontaneous miscarriage. There can be heavy cramping and bleeding, with the possibility of passing clots up to the size of a lemon. The possible side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue. Complications are very rare, and generally resemble those associated with a miscarriage; there is a small risk of hemorrhage or retaining tissue (which may have to be removed by a medical provider). Bleeding through more than two maxi pads in an hour for more than two hours is considered excessive, warranting medical attention.* For the unprepared, a hospital visit could mean legal complications, too.\n\nYanow told the story of a woman named Jennifer Whalen, in Pennsylvania, who bought mife and miso online for her pregnant 16-year-old daughter. After the teenager took the pills, her miscarriage began. She became frightened when stomach pains hit, so Whalen drove her to an emergency room and told doctors about the pills. The daughter was fine, but Whalen was charged and pleaded guilty to offering medical advice without a license. She was given a jail sentence of nine to 18 months.\n\nPeople in similar situations need to know how to present themselves to doctors, Yanow said. \"They can say they're having a miscarriage, or they're bleeding and they don't know why,\" she explained. According to Paul Blumenthal, a professor emeritus of obstetrics and gynecology at Stanford University, it is safe for patients to self-report this way; a medication abortion is clinically indistinguishable from a spontaneous miscarriage and treated in the same fashion.\n\nLater in the class, it was time to role-play. Yanow gave each of us a part. Some of us were six weeks pregnant and seeking abortion pills. Others had information to share and a mission: Pass it along. The goal was to avoid giving direct advice, because that could be construed as the unauthorized practice of medicine, a criminal offense. The key, Yanow said, was avoiding \"that forbidden three-letter word: y-o-u .\"\n\nNo matter how the word is passed, more autonomy is coming, at least eventually-both in places that attempt outright bans and also where abortion remains legal. The weakening or overturning of Roe would of course have an impact, and it would be significant. Statewide bans on abortion would cause a rise in maternal deaths-of women with complicating health issues and of women who resort to dangerous methods. Maternal deaths will also rise because women who want an abortion can't get one-childbirth is far riskier than ending a pregnancy.\n\nBut other forces are also at play. A post- Roe world will not resemble a pre- Roe world. Women already have different options. In Blumenthal's view, the future doesn't lie in Planned Parenthood (which in addition to education and advocacy offers abortion services through a network of clinics). \"I think the future lies in more self-managed care and alternative distribution schemes,\" he told me. Pharmaceuticals are a big part of that future-the work-around of first resort and one that's hard for authorities to stop. Blumenthal's confidence in the safety of medication abortion, including when it is self-managed, is the medical consensus, supported by the WHO, the FDA, and numerous studies.\n\nIn circumstances where pharmaceuticals may not be appropriate, he believes that laypeople can be instructed to wield manual vacuum-aspiration devices, including the Del-Em, with little risk of infection. Technicians without medical degrees, he added, have been using such tools safely for decades in South and Southeast Asia. \"This is not a complicated procedure,\" Blumenthal said. Vacuum aspiration outside a clinical setting is not \"self-managed\" the way pills can be-it requires assistance. Although specific studies are few, they suggest that outcomes involving trained nonphysicians are comparable to those involving physicians (and in either case, the risks are very low).\n\nEven clinical abortion providers who work directly with patients acknowledge that the future may involve them less. Asked about this, Danika Severino Wynn, the vice president of abortion access for Planned Parenthood, replied in a written statement: \"Some people may choose to self-manage their abortion with pills, and this may become more common as laws increasingly restrict access to legal care. Planned Parenthood honors and respects this decision and will provide education, support, and any needed clinical care to anyone who seeks it-no matter what.\"\n\nSome patients can't-or don't want to-manage their own abortions. For them, and for those seeking the dilation-and-evacuation abortions that are most commonly used in the second trimester, the services provided by Planned Parenthood and independent clinics will remain necessary. But for a variety of reasons, including legal restrictions on abortion, the number of brick-and-mortar clinics has been dwindling for years.\n\nEfforts to prepare for a post- Roe future have been undertaken in unexpected places. In 2020, a hackers' convention called HOPE included talks on coding and digital privacy along with something quite different: A speaker using the alias Maggie Mayhem showed how to build and operate a Del-Em in a workshop titled \"Hackers in a Post Roe v. Wade World.\" In her presentation, Mayhem employed a demonstration method that has been used for training clinicians and medical residents: evacuating a papaya. (According to research published in the journal Family Medicine , \"Papayas resemble the early pregnant uterus in size, shape, and consistency, and their softness makes them somewhat more realistic models than durable plastic devices.\")\n\nIn December, when the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Dobbs , post- Roe prepping intensified. Volunteers across the country handed out thousands of boxes labeled Abortion Pills . (Rather than actual medication, they contained cards with a link to shareabortionpill.info, a website that does what the name suggests.) The pro-pill message was amplified with posters, yard signs, stencils, a mural, a digital-billboard truck, and a plane towing a banner over Arizona. The campaign was run by Shout Your Abortion, a nonprofit that aims to destigmatize the procedure by helping people speak publicly about their experiences.\n\nWhatever the laws may say, history has shown that women will continue to have abortions. The spread of pills and devices like the Del-Em-discreet, inexpensive, and fast-could, if nothing else, help ensure that abortions are done safely and, because of their accessibility, on average earlier in a pregnancy than is the norm today.\n\nEven so, pill proselytizers and Del-Em makers are not the only ones prepping. A nonprofit called Abortion Delivered is planning to deploy mobile abortion vans. The first one was being readied when I spoke with a staff member at the organization who, like Ellie, did not wish to use her name. I'll call her Angela. The van was being bulletproofed, Angela told me. It would then be retrofitted with an ultrasound machine and a gynecological-exam table, so a doctor with a manual vacuum-aspiration device could perform first-trimester abortions inside. Abortion Delivered, which originated in Minnesota, planned to dispatch the van-and a second one, stocked with abortion pills-to just outside the Texas border.\n\n\"They are small and inconspicuous,\" Angela said. \"Part of the appeal of it is that we can pass unnoticed and not draw attention.\" She did worry about clinicians' and patients' safety along the edge of a heavily armed, anti-abortion state. Local FBI agents had been advising on security procedures, she said.\n\nI asked Angela what Abortion Delivered would do with the vans if the Supreme Court weakened or overturned Roe . \"Well, we're going to need more,\" she said. A cluster of nearby states-Wyoming, North and South Dakota, Nebraska-would likely also curtail abortion access. \"We will just be driving up and down the borders,\" she explained. \"With four fleets, we think we could cover them.\" She already has road experience, having delivered abortion pills throughout rural Minnesota in a rented Winnebago. \"We would be in one town for 20 minutes,\" Angela said, and then the Winnebago would move on. \"And no one knew our route.\" This may sound like the public-health version of Mad Max meets Station Eleven , but it's easy to see how such a scene could become part of the future. Abortion providers have been traveling from state to state for decades-they used to be called \"circuit riders\"-to work at understaffed abortion clinics, often in hostile territory.\n\nIf the abortion deserts of the Midwest and the South become even more arid than they already are, people will take to the road in ever-greater numbers. Clinicians got a preview of the abortion diaspora after Texas-home to one in 10 reproductive-aged American women-passed its ban. According to a study published earlier this year , clinics as far as Maryland and Washington State saw a rise in patients from Texas. The resulting backlog also created longer wait times. Pregnancies progressed. Some patients who would have otherwise been eligible for abortion pills or manual vacuum aspiration ended up requiring second-trimester surgeries instead.\n\nOther abortion seekers found themselves stuck in Texas. Some ended up having to give birth, unless they were among the lucky few to stumble on an underground provider network. One California activist described mailing misoprostol-something she'd never done before-after getting a panicked request from Texas. \"A friend of a friend of a friend reached out and said, 'There's a 13-year-old girl who needs access, like, right now. And I know that the timing is bad, but can you help?' \" Her package, which also included a greeting card, some coffee, and Naomi Alderman's novel The Power , about women taking over the world, arrived the day the ban took effect.\n\nMore of America may soon look like Texas-but in a post- Roe world, states where abortion remains accessible could look quite different too. The new infrastructure being put into place extends beyond the grassroots efforts of American abortion activists. California and New York-the two states with the most abortion clinics-have been preparing for an influx of patients. \"We'll be a sanctuary,\" California Governor Gavin Newsom stated in December. Planned Parenthood clinics in Orange and San Bernardino Counties are already staffing up , according to the Los Angeles Times . Political leaders pushed for public funds to cover the costs of low-income, out-of-state women visiting for abortions. In New York, Attorney General Letitia James proposed a similar fund to make the state a \"safe haven.\"\n\nActivists in Mexico, whose Supreme Court decriminalized abortion last year , have been planning to help Americans with access. Some are already getting misoprostol into the U.S., by foot and by mail. Aid Access , an Austrian nonprofit, now offers \"advance provision,\" allowing Americans who aren't pregnant to order mife and miso for possible future use. The organization serves all 50 states , including those with restrictions on medication abortion. The founder of Aid Access is Rebecca Gomperts, a physician who first gained prominence for creating the organization Women on Waves, which sailed to countries where abortion was illegal, picked up patients, then administered abortion pills in international waters. Similar methods-floating clinics in the Gulf of Mexico's federal waters; a cruise ship turned clinic anchored outside U.S. jurisdiction-are on the minds of American activists.\n\nIn late January, I visited three women from a West Coast menstrual-extraction group founded in 2017 by a sex educator I'll call Norah, who had organized it as a response to President Donald Trump's election on an anti- Roe platform. The four of us sat in a backyard bungalow, eating cheese and crackers as a fireplace crackled on a wall-mounted television. The group members talked about abortion access-which they hoped to expand by teaching menstrual extraction to activists in heavily regulated states. They had already trained visitors from Kentucky and Texas and had plans to host someone from Ohio.\n\nAfter talking for almost two hours, we filed into a bedroom for a demonstration. A woman I'll call Kira attached a Del-Em to a pink Spectra S2 breast pump. Once switched on, the machine began to purr and click at regular intervals; it sounded like a robot snoring.\n\nNorah, who was not pregnant but was menstruating, undressed from the waist down and lay on the bed. She expertly installed a speculum in her vaginal canal, creating a direct route to her cervix. Kira began to insert the cannula. \"I'm at your os,\" she said, referring to the cervical opening. \"Is it okay to enter?\"\n\n\"Go for it,\" Norah said. The group chatted to pass the time-why do faxes still exist?-until blood appeared in the aquarium tube.\n\nAfter 15 minutes of extraction, a small clot, nothing unusual, clogged the cannula. Because this was just a demonstration and Norah was getting crampy, they decided to stop. Kira removed the cannula and let the tube drain into the mason jar, where the contents settled: an inch of blood. And then it was over.\n\nI thought back to an afternoon I'd spent interviewing Carol Downer, who toured the Del-Em across America with Lorraine Rothman more than 50 years ago. On her porch in a quiet Los Angeles suburb, we talked about what might happen if the constitutional right to abortion was lost. Downer was glad pharmaceuticals had been added to the feminist toolbox, she told me, though she was concerned about the government finding a way to take them out of women's hands and she worried about people taking pills in isolation, without a context of friendly support. Downer still kept a Del-Em in her library, sitting on a table. She was confident the device would remain available. (\"It's a lot harder to ban mason jars,\" she observed.) She reflected on the new underground that was growing, and the variety of tools it was employing: \"We need all of these things,\" she explained.\n\nEfforts are expanding to provide the kind of friendly support spoken of by Downer. On a Saturday evening in early January, some 40 participants trickled into a conference room on Jitsi Meet, an encrypted, open-source Zoom alternative favored by the anti-surveillance set. We had been instructed beforehand: No real names. No audio, except for the presenters. No video. The screen filled up with blacked-out squares and aliases: Jolly Broccoli. Astronaut Witch. Blue Dinosaur. Tulip Jones. Adventurous Fern.\n\nZane (a pseudonym) was a volunteer with Autonomous Pelvic Care , an Appalachia-based reproductive-health organization that teaches courses for community-care providers on subjects such as self-managed abortion with pills, menstrual extraction, fertility tracking, and digital security. It had been a fraught week. Eight days earlier, on New Year's Eve, an arsonist had burned down the Planned Parenthood office in Knoxville, Tennessee. Ever since, Zane told me, they'd been preparing to host this evening while fielding panicky messages from community members asking, \"What do we do now?\"\n\nTonight's session featured four educators and was aimed at community providers and anyone else who might be supporting someone through a self-managed abortion. Zane started the session by talking through a protocol for mifepristone and misoprostol. One of the evening's presenters, an herbalist and doula with Holistic Abortions, offered ways to ease the process-before, during, and after-with the goal of improving the whole abortion experience.\n\nNext came a volunteer from Mountain Access Brigade , which runs a secure voice-and-text support line for abortion seekers in eastern Tennessee and Appalachia who need logistical, emotional, and financial assistance. She shared a website called Plan C , which includes a state-by-state directory for ordering pills online.\n\nThe last presenter was from If/When/How, a reproductive-justice legal-advocacy group that had recently announced a $2 million defense fund to cover bail, expert witnesses, and attorneys' fees for people who get arrested after managing their own abortions. Prosecutors, she noted, have been known to repurpose obscure laws-including some from the 18th century-that were not meant to criminalize self-managed abortion.\n\nMuch of the material in this workshop and Susan Yanow's session was new to me. But the tone felt familiar: Two years into the pandemic, we've all become public-health preppers. We're more keenly attuned to threats and better stocked with the tools-hand sanitizer, antigen tests-to meet them.\n\nNo matter what happens to Roe , my own freedoms seemed unlikely to change much, at least for the foreseeable future; after all, I was living at the time in Los Angeles and make my permanent home in New York City. Even so, I decided to order some pills. I went online to Plan C and scrolled through the drop-down menu to California. There was a buffet of choices: Six telehealth providers, including Aid Access and start-ups called Hey Jane and Choix, offered mifepristone and misoprostol together beginning at $150.\n\nFor preppers-people who wouldn't need the pills immediately-the best choice appeared to be ordering them from Aid Access, the only service offering advance provision. I placed my order on Saturday night, a few hours after the Autonomous Pelvic Care session wrapped up. I didn't have to speak with anyone directly. An online questionnaire took less than 15 minutes and ended by asking the reason for my order, with a litany of mostly depressing options: Stigma. Cost. Having to deal with protesters. The need to keep my treatment a secret. Legal restrictions. Risk of abuse from my partner. The next day, my order was approved and I made an online payment of $150.\n\nFour days later, a U.S. Postal Service package arrived. It came from an online pharmacy called Honeybee Health , just seven miles from where I was living. Inside, a plastic sleeve patterned with festive dots held the goods: a few leaflets, a box of mifepristone, and a teal bottle with hexagonal tablets inside. I tipped them into my palm and counted eight misoprostol pills. They looked utilitarian and chalky, nothing like M&M's.\n\nThe instructions were printed on a double-sided flyer. A cartoon showed two pills tucked inside a cheek. Another showed a woman lying on her side, barefoot, eyes closed. Her arms were wrapped around her midsection. Her knees were drawn up to her chest. The caption said, \"Expect bleeding.\" Looking at the drawing made me feel queasy, even a bit afraid. I wanted to draw a friend next to her.\n\nInstead, I rewrapped the package. Then I tucked it away, wondering if the contents would look any different in June.\n\nThis article appears in the May 2022 print edition with the headline \"The Abortion Underground.\" * This article originally misstated the level of bleeding considered excessive after a medication abortion. It has also been updated to reflect a \"trigger ban\" law passed in Wyoming last month."

      "text": "When a Right Becomes a Privilege\n\nThe main difference between the women who will make it to an abortion provider in a post- Roe world and those who won't? Money.\n\nWhen New York legalized abortion in 1970-three years before the Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade -a shrewd entrepreneur named Martin Mitchell saw an opportunity. The 31-year-old Detroit-area man chartered a tiny private plane and began advertising frequent flights from Michigan, where elective abortion was illegal, to Niagara Falls, New York, where it was not. For $400, a woman got transportation, an abortion by a licensed doctor at a clinic near the airport, and lunch, before being flown home the same day.\n\nOne of Mitchell's clients, a 22-year-old secretary with a steady job at a hospital, told a reporter at the time that she was too scared to seek out an illegal abortion in Michigan, and that if she hadn't been able to get to New York, she would have been forced to continue her pregnancy. She was only able to afford the charter service-which, adjusting for inflation, would cost about $2,900 today-because her parents lent her the money. Before the flight home, she gushed with relief. \"Gosh I feel great, fine, just great,\" she said.\n\nIt is not far-fetched to imagine that this is the future we may soon face, in which the ability to terminate a pregnancy in the United States will largely depend on where you live and what kind of financial resources you have. If the leaked Supreme Court draft opinion to overturn Roe v. Wade is adopted, roughly half of U.S. states are expected to quickly ban or severely restrict abortion. No longer a protected constitutional right, abortion will become more akin to a privilege, reserved for those with the means necessary to obtain one.\n\nTo be clear, this is already the lived experience of poor and minority women in many parts of the country. In much of the South and Midwest, state legislatures have spent decades passing regulations on abortion with the express intent of suppressing access. Patients in these states are forced to spend more money, take more time off work, and travel farther distances to get to an abortion clinic. Given that nearly half of U.S. abortion patients live below the poverty line, and about another quarter are low-income, it follows that these obstacles have proved insurmountable for some.\n\nTo call an abortion a privilege is incompatible with what going through it feels like. For women fighting to maintain bodily autonomy, trying to avoid a forced birth, it ranks as a basic human necessity. But in a post- Roe world , the women who are and aren't able to access this form of health care are likely to be starkly divided by race and class.\n\nRead: The future of abortion in a post- Roe America\n\n\"Even though abortion is a right everywhere, for a lot of people around the country, it is difficult to access,\" David Cohen, a professor at Drexel University's law school told me. \"But that's a world different from saying it is illegal. If Roe is overturned, it will drastically change the circumstances for people in almost half the states in the country.\" Some women will order abortion pills online, which may put them in a questionable legal situation, while others will cross state lines for care if they can afford it, he predicted. \"Travel is a privilege, and privilege in this country is linked to people with money and people with white skin,\" he said.\n\nWe already know the effect of making patients travel farther distances to terminate pregnancies: Some of them simply can't make the journey. After Texas enacted H.B. 2 in 2013, a restrictive abortion law that was later gutted by the Supreme Court, the abortion rate plummeted in counties where the distance to the nearest facility increased by 100 miles or more.\n\nThat's exactly what is expected to happen on a bigger scale if Roe is reversed. According to an estimate by Caitlin Knowles Myers, an economics professor at Middlebury College, about 54 percent of U.S. women of reproductive age would experience an increase in the distance to the nearest abortion provider. In counties whose nearest abortion provider is projected to close, the average distance would increase from 33 miles to 282 miles.\n\nRead: The right to move is under attack\n\nBy Myers's calculations, about three-quarters of the women seeking abortions in those counties would still make it to an abortion provider-overcoming the additional costs associated with traveling longer distances, such as gas, hotel stays, and child care. But about a quarter of the patients would not. In the first year post- Roe , she estimated, 100,000 women who want abortions would not be able to reach a clinic. Some would naturally have miscarriages, and others would seek out abortion pills to terminate their pregnancy at home. According to her model, about 75,000 women would end up giving birth against their will.\n\nThe main difference between the women who will make it to an abortion provider and those who won't? Money. \"Generally you're looking at a situation in which the poorest, most financially constrained, and most economically fragile women are not able to navigate a long trip to obtain an abortion,\" Myers told me. \"It's always been the case that the women with means will find a way to obtain an abortion. And that was true during the pre- Roe era.\"\n\nAbortion care has changed significantly since the 1970s, when Mitchell's private plane whisked women to Niagara Falls for a quick day trip. Today, abortion pills account for more than half of abortions in the U.S. Medication abortion, as the two-pill regimen is called, can be done safely at home . Surely some women will fly to other states to access legal abortion at a clinic, but the more common scenario if Roe is reversed will likely involve a woman trying to get abortion pills through the mail or in a neighboring state. Anti-abortion lawmakers in some states are already trying to crack down on these avenues .\n\n\"Who will district attorneys and police test out arresting and criminalizing people for things like that?\" said Liza Fuentes, a senior research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. \"The people who are most likely to be prosecuted are people who are already systemically seen as devalued, who experience systemic racism and discrimination.\" Black and Hispanic women have higher rates of unintended pregnancy and abortion than their white counterparts.\n\nThis is not to say that privileged women have nothing to worry about. As Rebecca Traister forcefully argued in a recent essay , the eradication of abortion rights ultimately affects everyone. \"The choices that people, even people of means, make about how to end pregnancies are going to require calculations they have rarely had to do before: about their own risks of criminal prosecution and about state-enforced systems that are there not to work on their behalf but to limit and punish their choices,\" she writes.\n\nBut the hard truth of the matter is that without Roe , many poor women will be unable to obtain an abortion that they know is in their best interest. Their lives will be irrevocably changed as a result. The most common reason women give for wanting an abortion is that they are not financially prepared to raise the child. And they're usually right.\n\nMost of what we know about what happens to a woman who wants an abortion but can't obtain one comes from the Turnaway Study , a longitudinal study that began in 2008 and followed more than 1,000 women who sought abortions in the U.S. Led by Diana Greene Foster, a UC San Francisco professor in the department of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences, the study compared women who were able to obtain abortions with women who were denied abortions to see how their lives were affected over time.\n\nThe two groups were fairly similar in terms of financial well-being before they sought an abortion, Greene Foster told me. But for four years afterward, women who were turned away from a wanted abortion had a higher chance of living in poverty compared with those who received abortions. Those who were denied an abortion went on to have higher debt , an increased number of negative public financial records (such as bankruptcies and evictions), and a greater likelihood of a subprime credit score.\n\nThe financial consequences of being denied a wanted abortion are only part of the picture. Women who were unable to terminate a pregnancy in Greene Foster's study also had reported worse health, were more likely to remain connected to an abusive partner, and raised children under less stable conditions than the women who obtained abortions. Being denied an abortion \"changed key aspects of their lives, like their ability to take care of their existing kids, their chance at having wanted kids later, the quality of their relationships, and their achievement of aspirational plans,\" Greene Foster said.\n\nAnd for two women, it killed them. Two women in the Turnaway Study who were denied an abortion died shortly after childbirth. Pregnancy \"is very risky, and it's a risk we're willing to take when we want to make a child,\" Greene Foster said.\n\nWithout Roe , many women won't be given the choice."

      "text": "THE RIGHT OF ABORTION\n\nTHE RIGHT OF ABORTION by Harriet Pilpel E XCEPT in the story of the Emperor's New Clothes, I cannot think of a more\nstartling example of mass refusal to see the obvious than is presented by\ncurrent attitudes toward the population problem on the one hand and abortion on\nthe other. For several years, we have heard warnings about the population crisis. Indeed,\nso concerned are we that there now are voices in the land calling for\n\"compulsory sterilization\" and \"compulsory birth control,\" for the withholding\nof public support for illegitimate children in excess of a certain number, for\nconditioning welfare monies or parole or whatever on coerced sterilization, and\nso on. Yet little is done to make sterilization easily available on a voluntary\nbasis, particularly to the poor and underprivileged. Despite the lack of legal\nstrictures against it, it is often withheld by doctors and hospitals from those\nwho need it and want it most. At the same time, there begins to appear on the\npart of some an alarming readiness to subordinate rights of freedom of choice\nin the area of human reproduction to governmental coercion. Notwithstanding all this, we continue to maintain strict antiabortion laws on\nthe books of at least four fifths of our states, denying freedom of choice to\nwomen and physicians and compelling the \"unwilling to bear the unwanted.\" Yet,\nas Doctor Christopher Tietze and Sarah Lewit point out in the Scientific\nAmerican for January, 1969: \"Abortion is still the most widespread...method of\nfertility control in the modern world.\" According to experts who participated\nin a United Nations Conference on World Population in Belgrade in 1965,\nabortion is indeed the chief method of birth control in the world today, and\nthey estimated that about 30 million pregnancies are purposely terminated by\nabortion each year. Of these, studies indicate that almost one million are in\nthe United States. Since, however, abortions are still so difficult to obtain,\nwe force the birth of millions more unwanted children every year. If we really\nwant to cut our population growth rate on a voluntary basis, we should make\nabortion available on a voluntary basis, at least in the early stages of\npregnancy. When Japan liberalized its abortion laws some years back, it halved\nits rate of population growth in a decade. Population dilemma I do not recommend abortion as a birth-control method of choice. I merely state\nthat it is in fact the most important single method of birth control in the\nworld today, and to cut down on population growth we should make abortion easy\nand safe while we continue to develop other and more satisfactory methods of\nfamily limitation. In addition to the 5 million women in the United States\nwithout access to birth control for whom abortion would seem a matter of right\nwhen they want it, there are the uncounted thousands who after conception\nsuffer some disease (like German measles) or discover some defect which makes\nthe birth of a live and healthy baby unlikely, and the many, too, whose\ncontraceptive methods occasionally don't work. As the New York chapter of the\nNational Organization for Women notes in a pamphlet: \"There is no perfect contraceptive. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration\nreports that the intrauterine devices, one of the most effective contraceptives\navailable today, have a failure rate of 1.5 to 3%. This means that if all\nmarried women in the United States could and did use these contraceptives,\nthere would still be about 350,000 to 700,000 unwanted pregnancies a year among\nmarried women alone. Even sterilization is not a 100% effective method of\ncontraception; some operations fail. Therefore, in order to insure a complete\nand thorough birth control program, abortion must be made available as a legal\nright to all women who request it.\" Starting in the mid-1960s, some erosion of the anti-abortion laws began to take\nplace. But these efforts have not been supported by many of the more vocal\ngroups who are trying to do something about excess population growth; to them,\ncompulsory birth control and compulsory sterilization are apparently more\npalatable than voluntary abortion. The result is legal chaos--which has been the situation with reference to\nabortion since it was first made illegal in this country. Contrary to popular\nbelief, the legal strictures against abortion are of comparatively recent\norigin. Until the early nineteenth century--at common law both in England and\nin the United States--abortion before quickening was not illegal at all. It\nbecame so only in the early 1800s. And according to Professor Cyril Means and\nothers who have studied the problem, the reason for the enactment of the laws\nwas not protection of morals or of the \"soul\" of the fetus, but rather a\nreflection of the fact that at the time all surgical procedures were highly\nrisky because of the probability of infection (this was before Lister).\nAbortions were made illegal for this reason except where they were necessary to\nsave the life of the mother; that is, where the great risk of infection which\nevery operation involved was outweighed by the risk of carrying that particular\npregnancy to term. The situation is today reversed; abortion under modern\nhospital conditions is safer than childbirth. Nor is there any evidence that abortion involves psychological health hazards.\nA poll of the American Psychiatric Association in the mid-1960s revealed\noverwhelming support for more easily available abortions and a conviction that\nadverse psychological sequelae from abortion are negligible both on an absolute\nstandard and as compared with such sequelae from childbirth and unwanted\nchildren. Though the population experts have not yet aligned themselves on the side of\nabortion-law reform, something is beginning to happen. Seven states--Arkansas,\nCalifornia, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, New Mexico, and North Carolina--have\namended their laws to permit abortion not only to save life but also to protect\nthe health, mental and physical, of the mother, in cases of rape and incest,\nand to avert the birth of defective offspring (Governor Reagan forced the\nomission of this ground in the California law). Many other states have been and\nare now considering abortion reform or repeal bills but usually without the\nsupport of the powerful groups who are backing other forms of population\ncontrol. The old laws are also beginning to face challenges in the courts and\nare being attacked on a variety of constitutional grounds. Who gets help? The relevant statistics have been widely circulated: for example, of\ntherapeutic--that is, in-hospital--abortions in New York City in the early\nsixties, the majority of them for \"psychiatric\" reasons, 93 percent were\nperformed on white patients, 91 percent in private rooms. The ratio of\nin-hospital abortions to live births in New York City was approximately one to\n360 for private patients and something like one to 10,000 in municipal\nhospitals. At the same time the women whose deaths were associated with\nabortion in New York City in a typical year were 56 percent black, 23 percent\nPuerto Rican, and 21 percent white. The 8000 to 10,000 in-hospital abortions contrast, of course, with the\nestimated one million performed outside hospitals annually. Probably not much\nmore than one half of these are performed by doctors; the rest by the \"kindly\nneighbor,\" the \"close friend,\" or the woman herself. Generally speaking, the\nlaws do not distinguish in their prohibitions of abortions between doctors and\nnondoctors. Moreover, the out-of-hospital abortions performed by doctors are\nobtained by the same group which accounts for the bulk of the in-hospital\nabortions: the middle- and upper-income white woman who can afford the hundreds\nor thousands charged for expert medical service outside the law. And these are\nthe same women who can afford to go to Japan, Sweden, England, or one of the\nIron Curtain countries where abortions are legal and where they typically cost\nsomething between $10 and $25. But most of the old laws on abortion remain unchanged on the statute books. In\na few states, like Connecticut or Missouri, the law says that the abortion may\nbe performed to save the life of the child as well as that of the mother,\nalthough no one is sure what this means. As a matter of fact, no one knows what\nthe laws which permit abortion to save the life of the mother mean. Courts in a\nnumber of states have held that the danger to life need not be either\n\"imminent\" or \"certain.\" But how \"imminent\" or \"certain\"? Is it enough that the\npregnancy if it comes to term will seriously damage the mother's health? Or\nwill result in the birth of defective offspring? Clearly, a number of doctors think the answer to these questions is yes, since\nabortions, especially on white women with good incomes, are routinely and\nopenly performed in some hospitals in most states and the prosecuting\nauthorities do nothing about it. Criminal laws like these, the meaning of which\npeople must guess at, are open to constitutional attack on this ground, as the\nUnited States Supreme Court has often held with respect to other \"vague\"\nprohibitions. There are many other grounds of constitutional challenge as well:\nthe rights of women, rich and poor, black and white, to equal protection of the\nlaw--that is, to get proper medical treatment without discrimination on the\ngrounds of race, color, or income; the rights of physicians to do their\nprofessional duty in the light of what is known and believed by medical science\ntoday; the right of privacy declared by the United States Supreme Court in the\nConnecticut birth-control case where Sir Justice Goldberg in his concurring\nopinion stated that compulsory pro- or anti-birth-control laws are equally\n\"totalitarian\" and unconstitutional; the right to be free of \"cruel and unusual\npunishment\"; and others. Also it may well be that some courts faced with the\nunconscionable dilemma posed by the abortion laws and unwilling to resort to\nconstitutional grounds, will \"interpret\" the laws out of existence eventually,\nas has happened to the federal birth-control laws. Absolutely excluded So why do the abortion laws stay on the books? One reason is the apparent\ninability or unwillingness of those who advocate population limitation to see\nthe connection. (This does not apply to Planned Parenthood-World Population,\nwhich in November, 1968, passed resolutions calling for repeal of the abortion\nlaws in support of its declared policy of voluntary parenthood.) By 1968, almost all the major religious groups in the United States except the\nRoman Catholic Church were on record in favor of abortion-law reform or repeal.\nThe American Baptist Convention and the Universalist/Unitarian Church came out\nfor total repeal. And public opinion polls demonstrated that a majority of\npeople, including a majority of the Catholics asked about the issue, favored at\nleast some liberalization of the laws. But the opposition of the Catholic\nChurch is potent and well organized. The Church holds that the fetus is\n\"ensouled\" at conception. In his encyclical Humanae Vitae in July of 1968, Pope\nPaul said, \"We must once again declare that the direct interruption of the\ngenerative process already begun and above all, directly willed and procured\nabortion, even if for therapeutic reasons, are to be absolutely excluded as\nlicit means of regulating birth.\" To this unequivocal statement--which is, of course, not the law in any American\nstate, since all states permit abortion at least to save the life of the\nmother--the Pope adds an \"Appeal to Public Authorities.\" He says, \"To Rulers,\nwho are those principally responsible for the common good, and who can do so\nmuch to safeguard moral customs, we say: Do not allow the morality of your\npeople to be degraded; do not permit that by legal means practices contrary to\nthe natural and divine law be introduced into that fundamental cell, the\nFamily....May all responsible public authorities--as some are already doing so\nlaudably--generously revive their efforts.\" I submit that insofar as this is an\nappeal to Catholic officials in this country, it must clearly be disregarded,\nbecause it is inconsistent with the laws of the land. By issuing such an \"Appeal to Public Authorities,\" the Pope has placed in a\nvery difficult position those Catholics who occupy public positions in this or\nin any country where separation of church and state is constitutionally or\notherwise basically guaranteed. They must choose, for example, when it comes to\nabortion for the therapeutic reason even of saving the life of the woman\nbetween their obligations to their church and their obligations to their state.\nThis leads to the question whether as a matter of law Catholic doctors and\nCatholic hospitals which follow the teachings of the Pope are practicing\nsectarian medicine. If I am right that they are, then they are infringing the\nAmerican Medical Association's canons of ethics, which prohibit the practice of\nsectarian medicine: \"In order that a physician may best serve his patients he is expected to exalt\nthe standards of his profession and to extend its sphere of usefulness.\" \"To the same end, he should not base his practice on an exclusive dogma, or a\nsectarian system, 'for sects are implacable despots: to accept their thralldom\nis to take away all liberty from one's action and thought.' A sectarian or\ncultist as applied to medicine is one who alleges to follow or in his practice\nfollows a dogma, tenet, or principle based on the authority of its promulgator\nto the exclusion of demonstration and scientific experience.\" Richard Cardinal Cushing said some time ago with reference to birth control:\n\"Catholics do not need the support of civil law to be faithful to their own\nreligious convictions and they do not seek to impose by law their moral views\non other members of society.\" Perhaps it is because of their awareness of the\nimpossible legal position the present stand of the Pope forces on Catholics who\nare lawmakers, law interpreters, or law enforcers, that such leading Catholic\nlegal scholars as Father Robert Drinan, dean of Boston College Law School, have\ncalled for total repeal, rather than amendment, of the abortion laws of all\nstates. They claim that since to Catholics all abortions are unacceptable, the\nstate should keep hands off the subject rather than decreeing that some\nabortions are legal and some not. Catholics should, of course, be allowed to\nfollow their own convictions in this area, but so surely should the rest of\nus. To the extent also that doctor and hospital adherents to the Pope's Encyclical\nare the recipients of public funds, they may be afoul of our First Amendment\nguarantees of religious freedom and anti-establishment of any church. And\nfinally, if for sectarian reasons they withhold a procedure which in any given\nsituation would be regarded as the proper medical response to the problem\npresented, they may be guilty of civil and criminal malpractice unless they at\nleast explain to the patient their sectarian reasons for withholding the\ntreatment so that the patient can go elsewhere if she chooses. It would seem that abortion-law reform--and better, repeal--is an idea whose\ntime has come. It is more than time that it be supported by all those who want\nto slow down our population growth rate without resorting to coercion or\ncompulsion. As Secretary-General U Thant and many of the UN agencies have\nrepeatedly said, \"The opportunity to decide the number and spacing of children\nis a basic human right.\" Until such time as we have a perfect contraceptive\nuniversally available and invariably used, voluntary abortion should be\ninfinitely preferred to compulsory sterilization or compulsory birth control,\nand that may well be the choice.

When Japan liberalized its abortion laws some years back, it halved\nits rate of population growth in a decade. Population dilemma I do not recommend abortion as a birth-control method of choice. I merely state\nthat it is in fact the most important single method of birth control in the\nworld today, and to cut down on population growth we should make abortion easy\nand safe while we continue to develop other and more satisfactory methods of\nfamily limitation. In addition to the 5 million women in the United States\nwithout access to birth control for whom abortion would seem a matter of right\nwhen they want it, there are the uncounted thousands who after conception\nsuffer some disease (like German measles) or discover some defect which makes\nthe birth of a live and healthy baby unlikely, and the many, too, whose\ncontraceptive methods occasionally don't work. As the New York chapter of the\nNational Organization for Women notes in a pamphlet: \"There is no perfect contraceptive. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration\nreports that the intrauterine devices, one of the most effective contraceptives\navailable today, have a failure rate of 1.5 to 3%. This means that if all\nmarried women in the United States could and did use these contraceptives,\nthere would still be about 350,000 to 700,000 unwanted pregnancies a year among\nmarried women alone. Even sterilization is not a 100% effective method of\ncontraception; some operations fail. Therefore, in order to insure a complete\nand thorough birth control program, abortion must be made available as a legal\nright to all women who request it.\" Starting in the mid-1960s, some erosion of the anti-abortion laws began to take\nplace. But these efforts have not been supported by many of the more vocal\ngroups who are trying to do something about excess population growth; to them,\ncompulsory birth control and compulsory sterilization are apparently more\npalatable than voluntary abortion. The result is legal chaos--which has been the situation with reference to\nabortion since it was first made illegal in this country. Contrary to popular\nbelief, the legal strictures against abortion are of comparatively recent\norigin. Until the early nineteenth century--at common law both in England and\nin the United States--abortion before quickening was not illegal at all. It\nbecame so only in the early 1800s. And according to Professor Cyril Means and\nothers who have studied the problem, the reason for the enactment of the laws\nwas not protection of morals or of the \"soul\" of the fetus, but rather a\nreflection of the fact that at the time all surgical procedures were highly\nrisky because of the probability of infection (this was before Lister).\nAbortions were made illegal for this reason except where they were necessary to\nsave the life of the mother; that is, where the great risk of infection which\nevery operation involved was outweighed by the risk of carrying that particular\npregnancy to term. The situation is today reversed; abortion under modern\nhospital conditions is safer than childbirth. Nor is there any evidence that abortion involves psychological health hazards.\nA poll of the American Psychiatric Association in the mid-1960s revealed\noverwhelming support for more easily available abortions and a conviction that\nadverse psychological sequelae from abortion are negligible both on an absolute\nstandard and as compared with such sequelae from childbirth and unwanted\nchildren. Though the population experts have not yet aligned themselves on the side of\nabortion-law reform, something is beginning to happen. Seven states--Arkansas,\nCalifornia, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, New Mexico, and North Carolina--have\namended their laws to permit abortion not only to save life but also to protect\nthe health, mental and physical, of the mother, in cases of rape and incest,\nand to avert the birth of defective offspring (Governor Reagan forced the\nomission of this ground in the California law). Many other states have been and\nare now considering abortion reform or repeal bills but usually without the\nsupport of the powerful groups who are backing other forms of population\ncontrol. The old laws are also beginning to face challenges in the courts and\nare being attacked on a variety of constitutional grounds. Who gets help? The relevant statistics have been widely circulated: for example, of\ntherapeutic--that is, in-hospital--abortions in New York City in the early\nsixties, the majority of them for \"psychiatric\" reasons, 93 percent were\nperformed on white patients, 91 percent in private rooms. The ratio of\nin-hospital abortions to live births in New York City was approximately one to\n360 for private patients and something like one to 10,000 in municipal\nhospitals. At the same time the women whose deaths were associated with\nabortion in New York City in a typical year were 56 percent black, 23 percent\nPuerto Rican, and 21 percent white. The 8000 to 10,000 in-hospital abortions contrast, of course, with the\nestimated one million performed outside hospitals annually. Probably not much\nmore than one half of these are performed by doctors; the rest by the \"kindly\nneighbor,\" the \"close friend,\" or the woman herself. Generally speaking, the\nlaws do not distinguish in their prohibitions of abortions between doctors and\nnondoctors. Moreover, the out-of-hospital abortions performed by doctors are\nobtained by the same group which accounts for the bulk of the in-hospital\nabortions: the middle- and upper-income white woman who can afford the hundreds\nor thousands charged for expert medical service outside the law. And these are\nthe same women who can afford to go to Japan, Sweden, England, or one of the\nIron Curtain countries where abortions are legal and where they typically cost\nsomething between $10 and $25. But most of the old laws on abortion remain unchanged on the statute books. In\na few states, like Connecticut or Missouri, the law says that the abortion may\nbe performed to save the life of the child as well as that of the mother,\nalthough no one is sure what this means. As a matter of fact, no one knows what\nthe laws which permit abortion to save the life of the mother mean. Courts in a\nnumber of states have held that the danger to life need not be either\n\"imminent\" or \"certain.\" But how \"imminent\" or \"certain\"? Is it enough that the\npregnancy if it comes to term will seriously damage the mother's health? Or\nwill result in the birth of defective offspring? Clearly, a number of doctors think the answer to these questions is yes, since\nabortions, especially on white women with good incomes, are routinely and\nopenly performed in some hospitals in most states and the prosecuting\nauthorities do nothing about it. Criminal laws like these, the meaning of which\npeople must guess at, are open to constitutional attack on this ground, as the\nUnited States Supreme Court has often held with respect to other \"vague\"\nprohibitions. There are many other grounds of constitutional challenge as well:\nthe rights of women, rich and poor, black and white, to equal protection of the\nlaw--that is, to get proper medical treatment without discrimination on the\ngrounds of race, color, or income; the rights of physicians to do their\nprofessional duty in the light of what is known and believed by medical science\ntoday; the right of privacy declared by the United States Supreme Court in the\nConnecticut birth-control case where Sir Justice Goldberg in his concurring\nopinion stated that compulsory pro- or anti-birth-control laws are equally\n\"totalitarian\" and unconstitutional; the right to be free of \"cruel and unusual\npunishment\"; and others. Also it may well be that some courts faced with the\nunconscionable dilemma posed by the abortion laws and unwilling to resort to\nconstitutional grounds, will \"interpret\" the laws out of existence eventually,\nas has happened to the federal birth-control laws. Absolutely excluded So why do the abortion laws stay on the books? One reason is the apparent\ninability or unwillingness of those who advocate population limitation to see\nthe connection. (This does not apply to Planned Parenthood-World Population,\nwhich in November, 1968, passed resolutions calling for repeal of the abortion\nlaws in support of its declared policy of voluntary parenthood.) By 1968, almost all the major religious groups in the United States except the\nRoman Catholic Church were on record in favor of abortion-law reform or repeal.\nThe American Baptist Convention and the Universalist/Unitarian Church came out\nfor total repeal. And public opinion polls demonstrated that a majority of\npeople, including a majority of the Catholics asked about the issue, favored at\nleast some liberalization of the laws. But the opposition of the Catholic\nChurch is potent and well organized. The Church holds that the fetus is\n\"ensouled\" at conception. In his encyclical Humanae Vitae in July of 1968, Pope\nPaul said, \"We must once again declare that the direct interruption of the\ngenerative process already begun and above all, directly willed and procured\nabortion, even if for therapeutic reasons, are to be absolutely excluded as\nlicit means of regulating birth.\" To this unequivocal statement--which is, of course, not the law in any American\nstate, since all states permit abortion at least to save the life of the\nmother--the Pope adds an \"Appeal to Public Authorities.\" He says, \"To Rulers,\nwho are those principally responsible for the common good, and who can do so\nmuch to safeguard moral customs, we say: Do not allow the morality of your\npeople to be degraded; do not permit that by legal means practices contrary to\nthe natural and divine law be introduced into that fundamental cell, the\nFamily....May all responsible public authorities--as some are already doing so\nlaudably--generously revive their efforts.\" I submit that insofar as this is an\nappeal to Catholic officials in this country, it must clearly be disregarded,\nbecause it is inconsistent with the laws of the land. By issuing such an \"Appeal to Public Authorities,\" the Pope has placed in a\nvery difficult position those Catholics who occupy public positions in this or\nin any country where separation of church and state is constitutionally or\notherwise basically guaranteed. They must choose, for example, when it comes to\nabortion for the therapeutic reason even of saving the life of the woman\nbetween their obligations to their church and their obligations to their state.\nThis leads to the question whether as a matter of law Catholic doctors and\nCatholic hospitals which follow the teachings of the Pope are practicing\nsectarian medicine. If I am right that they are, then they are infringing the\nAmerican Medical Association's canons of ethics, which prohibit the practice of\nsectarian medicine: \"In order that a physician may best serve his patients he is expected to exalt\nthe standards of his profession and to extend its sphere of usefulness.\" \"To the same end, he should not base his practice on an exclusive dogma, or a\nsectarian system, 'for sects are implacable despots: to accept their thralldom\nis to take away all liberty from one's action and thought.' A sectarian or\ncultist as applied to medicine is one who alleges to follow or in his practice\nfollows a dogma, tenet, or principle based on the authority of its promulgator\nto the exclusion of demonstration and scientific experience.\" Richard Cardinal Cushing said some time ago with reference to birth control:\n\"Catholics do not need the support of civil law to be faithful to their own\nreligious convictions and they do not seek to impose by law their moral views\non other members of society.\" Perhaps it is because of their awareness of the\nimpossible legal position the present stand of the Pope forces on Catholics who\nare lawmakers, law interpreters, or law enforcers, that such leading Catholic\nlegal scholars as Father Robert Drinan, dean of Boston College Law School, have\ncalled for total repeal, rather than amendment, of the abortion laws of all\nstates. They claim that since to Catholics all abortions are unacceptable, the\nstate should keep hands off the subject rather than decreeing that some\nabortions are legal and some not. Catholics should, of course, be allowed to\nfollow their own convictions in this area, but so surely should the rest of\nus. To the extent also that doctor and hospital adherents to the Pope's Encyclical\nare the recipients of public funds, they may be afoul of our First Amendment\nguarantees of religious freedom and anti-establishment of any church. And\nfinally, if for sectarian reasons they withhold a procedure which in any given\nsituation would be regarded as the proper medical response to the problem\npresented, they may be guilty of civil and criminal malpractice unless they at\nleast explain to the patient their sectarian reasons for withholding the\ntreatment so that the patient can go elsewhere if she chooses. It would seem that abortion-law reform--and better, repeal--is an idea whose\ntime has come. It is more than time that it be supported by all those who want\nto slow down our population growth rate without resorting to coercion or\ncompulsion. As Secretary-General U Thant and many of the UN agencies have\nrepeatedly said, \"The opportunity to decide the number and spacing of children\nis a basic human right.\" Until such time as we have a perfect contraceptive\nuniversally available and invariably used, voluntary abortion should be\ninfinitely preferred to compulsory sterilization or compulsory birth control,\nand that may well be the choice.

For several years, we have heard warnings about the population crisis. Indeed,\nso concerned are we that there now are voices in the land calling for\n\"compulsory sterilization\" and \"compulsory birth control,\" for the withholding\nof public support for illegitimate children in excess of a certain number, for\nconditioning welfare monies or parole or whatever on coerced sterilization, and\nso on. Yet little is done to make sterilization easily available on a voluntary\nbasis, particularly to the poor and underprivileged. Despite the lack of legal\nstrictures against it, it is often withheld by doctors and hospitals from those\nwho need it and want it most. At the same time, there begins to appear on the\npart of some an alarming readiness to subordinate rights of freedom of choice\nin the area of human reproduction to governmental coercion. Notwithstanding all this, we continue to maintain strict antiabortion laws on\nthe books of at least four fifths of our states, denying freedom of choice to\nwomen and physicians and compelling the \"unwilling to bear the unwanted.\" Yet,\nas Doctor Christopher Tietze and Sarah Lewit point out in the Scientific\nAmerican for January, 1969: \"Abortion is still the most widespread...method of\nfertility control in the modern world.\" According to experts who participated\nin a United Nations Conference on World Population in Belgrade in 1965,\nabortion is indeed the chief method of birth control in the world today, and\nthey estimated that about 30 million pregnancies are purposely terminated by\nabortion each year.

Seven states--Arkansas,\nCalifornia, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, New Mexico, and North Carolina--have\namended their laws to permit abortion not only to save life but also to protect\nthe health, mental and physical, of the mother, in cases of rape and incest,\nand to avert the birth of defective offspring (Governor Reagan forced the\nomission of this ground in the California law). Many other states have been and\nare now considering abortion reform or repeal bills but usually without the\nsupport of the powerful groups who are backing other forms of population\ncontrol. The old laws are also beginning to face challenges in the courts and\nare being attacked on a variety of constitutional grounds. Who gets help? The relevant statistics have been widely circulated: for example, of\ntherapeutic--that is, in-hospital--abortions in New York City in the early\nsixties, the majority of them for \"psychiatric\" reasons, 93 percent were\nperformed on white patients, 91 percent in private rooms. The ratio of\nin-hospital abortions to live births in New York City was approximately one to\n360 for private patients and something like one to 10,000 in municipal\nhospitals. At the same time the women whose deaths were associated with\nabortion in New York City in a typical year were 56 percent black, 23 percent\nPuerto Rican, and 21 percent white. The 8000 to 10,000 in-hospital abortions contrast, of course, with the\nestimated one million performed outside hospitals annually. Probably not much\nmore than one half of these are performed by doctors; the rest by the \"kindly\nneighbor,\" the \"close friend,\" or the woman herself. Generally speaking, the\nlaws do not distinguish in their prohibitions of abortions between doctors and\nnondoctors. Moreover, the out-of-hospital abortions performed by doctors are\nobtained by the same group which accounts for the bulk of the in-hospital\nabortions: the middle- and upper-income white woman who can afford the hundreds\nor thousands charged for expert medical service outside the law. And these are\nthe same women who can afford to go to Japan, Sweden, England, or one of the\nIron Curtain countries where abortions are legal and where they typically cost\nsomething between $10 and $25. But most of the old laws on abortion remain unchanged on the statute books. In\na few states, like Connecticut or Missouri, the law says that the abortion may\nbe performed to save the life of the child as well as that of the mother,\nalthough no one is sure what this means. As a matter of fact, no one knows what\nthe laws which permit abortion to save the life of the mother mean. Courts in a\nnumber of states have held that the danger to life need not be either\n\"imminent\" or \"certain.\" But how \"imminent\" or \"certain\"? Is it enough that the\npregnancy if it comes to term will seriously damage the mother's health? Or\nwill result in the birth of defective offspring? Clearly, a number of doctors think the answer to these questions is yes, since\nabortions, especially on white women with good incomes, are routinely and\nopenly performed in some hospitals in most states and the prosecuting\nauthorities do nothing about it. Criminal laws like these, the meaning of which\npeople must guess at, are open to constitutional attack on this ground, as the\nUnited States Supreme Court has often held with respect to other \"vague\"\nprohibitions. There are many other grounds of constitutional challenge as well:\nthe rights of women, rich and poor, black and white, to equal protection of the\nlaw--that is, to get proper medical treatment without discrimination on the\ngrounds of race, color, or income; the rights of physicians to do their\nprofessional duty in the light of what is known and believed by medical science\ntoday; the right of privacy declared by the United States Supreme Court in the\nConnecticut birth-control case where Sir Justice Goldberg in his concurring\nopinion stated that compulsory pro- or anti-birth-control laws are equally\n\"totalitarian\" and unconstitutional; the right to be free of \"cruel and unusual\npunishment\"; and others. Also it may well be that some courts faced with the\nunconscionable dilemma posed by the abortion laws and unwilling to resort to\nconstitutional grounds, will \"interpret\" the laws out of existence eventually,\nas has happened to the federal birth-control laws. Absolutely excluded So why do the abortion laws stay on the books? One reason is the apparent\ninability or unwillingness of those who advocate population limitation to see\nthe connection. (This does not apply to Planned Parenthood-World Population,\nwhich in November, 1968, passed resolutions calling for repeal of the abortion\nlaws in support of its declared policy of voluntary parenthood.) By 1968, almost all the major religious groups in the United States except the\nRoman Catholic Church were on record in favor of abortion-law reform or repeal.\nThe American Baptist Convention and the Universalist/Unitarian Church came out\nfor total repeal. And public opinion polls demonstrated that a majority of\npeople, including a majority of the Catholics asked about the issue, favored at\nleast some liberalization of the laws. But the opposition of the Catholic\nChurch is potent and well organized. The Church holds that the fetus is\n\"ensouled\" at conception. In his encyclical Humanae Vitae in July of 1968, Pope\nPaul said, \"We must once again declare that the direct interruption of the\ngenerative process already begun and above all, directly willed and procured\nabortion, even if for therapeutic reasons, are to be absolutely excluded as\nlicit means of regulating birth.\" To this unequivocal statement--which is, of course, not the law in any American\nstate, since all states permit abortion at least to save the life of the\nmother--the Pope adds an \"Appeal to Public Authorities.\" He says, \"To Rulers,\nwho are those principally responsible for the common good, and who can do so\nmuch to safeguard moral customs, we say: Do not allow the morality of your\npeople to be degraded; do not permit that by legal means practices contrary to\nthe natural and divine law be introduced into that fundamental cell, the\nFamily....May all responsible public authorities--as some are already doing so\nlaudably--generously revive their efforts.\" I submit that insofar as this is an\nappeal to Catholic officials in this country, it must clearly be disregarded,\nbecause it is inconsistent with the laws of the land. By issuing such an \"Appeal to Public Authorities,\" the Pope has placed in a\nvery difficult position those Catholics who occupy public positions in this or\nin any country where separation of church and state is constitutionally or\notherwise basically guaranteed. They must choose, for example, when it comes to\nabortion for the therapeutic reason even of saving the life of the woman\nbetween their obligations to their church and their obligations to their state.\nThis leads to the question whether as a matter of law Catholic doctors and\nCatholic hospitals which follow the teachings of the Pope are practicing\nsectarian medicine. If I am right that they are, then they are infringing the\nAmerican Medical Association's canons of ethics, which prohibit the practice of\nsectarian medicine: \"In order that a physician may best serve his patients he is expected to exalt\nthe standards of his profession and to extend its sphere of usefulness.\" \"To the same end, he should not base his practice on an exclusive dogma, or a\nsectarian system, 'for sects are implacable despots: to accept their thralldom\nis to take away all liberty from one's action and thought.' A sectarian or\ncultist as applied to medicine is one who alleges to follow or in his practice\nfollows a dogma, tenet, or principle based on the authority of its promulgator\nto the exclusion of demonstration and scientific experience.\" Richard Cardinal Cushing said some time ago with reference to birth control:\n\"Catholics do not need the support of civil law to be faithful to their own\nreligious convictions and they do not seek to impose by law their moral views\non other members of society.\" Perhaps it is because of their awareness of the\nimpossible legal position the present stand of the Pope forces on Catholics who\nare lawmakers, law interpreters, or law enforcers, that such leading Catholic\nlegal scholars as Father Robert Drinan, dean of Boston College Law School, have\ncalled for total repeal, rather than amendment, of the abortion laws of all\nstates. They claim that since to Catholics all abortions are unacceptable, the\nstate should keep hands off the subject rather than decreeing that some\nabortions are legal and some not. Catholics should, of course, be allowed to\nfollow their own convictions in this area, but so surely should the rest of\nus. To the extent also that doctor and hospital adherents to the Pope's Encyclical\nare the recipients of public funds, they may be afoul of our First Amendment\nguarantees of religious freedom and anti-establishment of any church. And\nfinally, if for sectarian reasons they withhold a procedure which in any given\nsituation would be regarded as the proper medical response to the problem\npresented, they may be guilty of civil and criminal malpractice unless they at\nleast explain to the patient their sectarian reasons for withholding the\ntreatment so that the patient can go elsewhere if she chooses. It would seem that abortion-law reform--and better, repeal--is an idea whose\ntime has come. It is more than time that it be supported by all those who want\nto slow down our population growth rate without resorting to coercion or\ncompulsion. As Secretary-General U Thant and many of the UN agencies have\nrepeatedly said, \"The opportunity to decide the number and spacing of children\nis a basic human right.\" Until such time as we have a perfect contraceptive\nuniversally available and invariably used, voluntary abortion should be\ninfinitely preferred to compulsory sterilization or compulsory birth control,\nand that may well be the choice.

All rights reserved.\n\nE XCEPT in the story of the Emperor's New Clothes, I cannot think of a more\nstartling example of mass refusal to see the obvious than is presented by\ncurrent attitudes toward the population problem on the one hand and abortion on\nthe other. For several years, we have heard warnings about the population crisis. Indeed,\nso concerned are we that there now are voices in the land calling for\n\"compulsory sterilization\" and \"compulsory birth control,\" for the withholding\nof public support for illegitimate children in excess of a certain number, for\nconditioning welfare monies or parole or whatever on coerced sterilization, and\nso on. Yet little is done to make sterilization easily available on a voluntary\nbasis, particularly to the poor and underprivileged. Despite the lack of legal\nstrictures against it, it is often withheld by doctors and hospitals from those\nwho need it and want it most. At the same time, there begins to appear on the\npart of some an alarming readiness to subordinate rights of freedom of choice\nin the area of human reproduction to governmental coercion. Notwithstanding all this, we continue to maintain strict antiabortion laws on\nthe books of at least four fifths of our states, denying freedom of choice to\nwomen and physicians and compelling the \"unwilling to bear the unwanted.\" Yet,\nas Doctor Christopher Tietze and Sarah Lewit point out in the Scientific\nAmerican for January, 1969: \"Abortion is still the most widespread...method of\nfertility control in the modern world.\" According to experts who participated\nin a United Nations Conference on World Population in Belgrade in 1965,\nabortion is indeed the chief method of birth control in the world today, and\nthey estimated that about 30 million pregnancies are purposely terminated by\nabortion each year. Of these, studies indicate that almost one million are in\nthe United States. Since, however, abortions are still so difficult to obtain,\nwe force the birth of millions more unwanted children every year. If we really\nwant to cut our population growth rate on a voluntary basis, we should make\nabortion available on a voluntary basis, at least in the early stages of\npregnancy. When Japan liberalized its abortion laws some years back, it halved\nits rate of population growth in a decade. Population dilemma I do not recommend abortion as a birth-control method of choice. I merely state\nthat it is in fact the most important single method of birth control in the\nworld today, and to cut down on population growth we should make abortion easy\nand safe while we continue to develop other and more satisfactory methods of\nfamily limitation. In addition to the 5 million women in the United States\nwithout access to birth control for whom abortion would seem a matter of right\nwhen they want it, there are the uncounted thousands who after conception\nsuffer some disease (like German measles) or discover some defect which makes\nthe birth of a live and healthy baby unlikely, and the many, too, whose\ncontraceptive methods occasionally don't work. As the New York chapter of the\nNational Organization for Women notes in a pamphlet: \"There is no perfect contraceptive. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration\nreports that the intrauterine devices, one of the most effective contraceptives\navailable today, have a failure rate of 1.5 to 3%. This means that if all\nmarried women in the United States could and did use these contraceptives,\nthere would still be about 350,000 to 700,000 unwanted pregnancies a year among\nmarried women alone. Even sterilization is not a 100% effective method of\ncontraception; some operations fail. Therefore, in order to insure a complete\nand thorough birth control program, abortion must be made available as a legal\nright to all women who request it.\" Starting in the mid-1960s, some erosion of the anti-abortion laws began to take\nplace. But these efforts have not been supported by many of the more vocal\ngroups who are trying to do something about excess population growth; to them,\ncompulsory birth control and compulsory sterilization are apparently more\npalatable than voluntary abortion. The result is legal chaos--which has been the situation with reference to\nabortion since it was first made illegal in this country. Contrary to popular\nbelief, the legal strictures against abortion are of comparatively recent\norigin. Until the early nineteenth century--at common law both in England and\nin the United States--abortion before quickening was not illegal at all. It\nbecame so only in the early 1800s. And according to Professor Cyril Means and\nothers who have studied the problem, the reason for the enactment of the laws\nwas not protection of morals or of the \"soul\" of the fetus, but rather a\nreflection of the fact that at the time all surgical procedures were highly\nrisky because of the probability of infection (this was before Lister).\nAbortions were made illegal for this reason except where they were necessary to\nsave the life of the mother; that is, where the great risk of infection which\nevery operation involved was outweighed by the risk of carrying that particular\npregnancy to term. The situation is today reversed; abortion under modern\nhospital conditions is safer than childbirth. Nor is there any evidence that abortion involves psychological health hazards.\nA poll of the American Psychiatric Association in the mid-1960s revealed\noverwhelming support for more easily available abortions and a conviction that\nadverse psychological sequelae from abortion are negligible both on an absolute\nstandard and as compared with such sequelae from childbirth and unwanted\nchildren.

There are many other grounds of constitutional challenge as well:\nthe rights of women, rich and poor, black and white, to equal protection of the\nlaw--that is, to get proper medical treatment without discrimination on the\ngrounds of race, color, or income; the rights of physicians to do their\nprofessional duty in the light of what is known and believed by medical science\ntoday; the right of privacy declared by the United States Supreme Court in the\nConnecticut birth-control case where Sir Justice Goldberg in his concurring\nopinion stated that compulsory pro- or anti-birth-control laws are equally\n\"totalitarian\" and unconstitutional; the right to be free of \"cruel and unusual\npunishment\"; and others. Also it may well be that some courts faced with the\nunconscionable dilemma posed by the abortion laws and unwilling to resort to\nconstitutional grounds, will \"interpret\" the laws out of existence eventually,\nas has happened to the federal birth-control laws. Absolutely excluded So why do the abortion laws stay on the books? One reason is the apparent\ninability or unwillingness of those who advocate population limitation to see\nthe connection. (This does not apply to Planned Parenthood-World Population,\nwhich in November, 1968, passed resolutions calling for repeal of the abortion\nlaws in support of its declared policy of voluntary parenthood.) By 1968, almost all the major religious groups in the United States except the\nRoman Catholic Church were on record in favor of abortion-law reform or repeal.\nThe American Baptist Convention and the Universalist/Unitarian Church came out\nfor total repeal. And public opinion polls demonstrated that a majority of\npeople, including a majority of the Catholics asked about the issue, favored at\nleast some liberalization of the laws. But the opposition of the Catholic\nChurch is potent and well organized. The Church holds that the fetus is\n\"ensouled\" at conception. In his encyclical Humanae Vitae in July of 1968, Pope\nPaul said, \"We must once again declare that the direct interruption of the\ngenerative process already begun and above all, directly willed and procured\nabortion, even if for therapeutic reasons, are to be absolutely excluded as\nlicit means of regulating birth.\" To this unequivocal statement--which is, of course, not the law in any American\nstate, since all states permit abortion at least to save the life of the\nmother--the Pope adds an \"Appeal to Public Authorities.\" He says, \"To Rulers,\nwho are those principally responsible for the common good, and who can do so\nmuch to safeguard moral customs, we say: Do not allow the morality of your\npeople to be degraded; do not permit that by legal means practices contrary to\nthe natural and divine law be introduced into that fundamental cell, the\nFamily....May all responsible public authorities--as some are already doing so\nlaudably--generously revive their efforts.\" I submit that insofar as this is an\nappeal to Catholic officials in this country, it must clearly be disregarded,\nbecause it is inconsistent with the laws of the land. By issuing such an \"Appeal to Public Authorities,\" the Pope has placed in a\nvery difficult position those Catholics who occupy public positions in this or\nin any country where separation of church and state is constitutionally or\notherwise basically guaranteed. They must choose, for example, when it comes to\nabortion for the therapeutic reason even of saving the life of the woman\nbetween their obligations to their church and their obligations to their state.\nThis leads to the question whether as a matter of law Catholic doctors and\nCatholic hospitals which follow the teachings of the Pope are practicing\nsectarian medicine. If I am right that they are, then they are infringing the\nAmerican Medical Association's canons of ethics, which prohibit the practice of\nsectarian medicine: \"In order that a physician may best serve his patients he is expected to exalt\nthe standards of his profession and to extend its sphere of usefulness.\" \"To the same end, he should not base his practice on an exclusive dogma, or a\nsectarian system, 'for sects are implacable despots: to accept their thralldom\nis to take away all liberty from one's action and thought.' A sectarian or\ncultist as applied to medicine is one who alleges to follow or in his practice\nfollows a dogma, tenet, or principle based on the authority of its promulgator\nto the exclusion of demonstration and scientific experience.\" Richard Cardinal Cushing said some time ago with reference to birth control:\n\"Catholics do not need the support of civil law to be faithful to their own\nreligious convictions and they do not seek to impose by law their moral views\non other members of society.\" Perhaps it is because of their awareness of the\nimpossible legal position the present stand of the Pope forces on Catholics who\nare lawmakers, law interpreters, or law enforcers, that such leading Catholic\nlegal scholars as Father Robert Drinan, dean of Boston College Law School, have\ncalled for total repeal, rather than amendment, of the abortion laws of all\nstates. They claim that since to Catholics all abortions are unacceptable, the\nstate should keep hands off the subject rather than decreeing that some\nabortions are legal and some not. Catholics should, of course, be allowed to\nfollow their own convictions in this area, but so surely should the rest of\nus. To the extent also that doctor and hospital adherents to the Pope's Encyclical\nare the recipients of public funds, they may be afoul of our First Amendment\nguarantees of religious freedom and anti-establishment of any church. And\nfinally, if for sectarian reasons they withhold a procedure which in any given\nsituation would be regarded as the proper medical response to the problem\npresented, they may be guilty of civil and criminal malpractice unless they at\nleast explain to the patient their sectarian reasons for withholding the\ntreatment so that the patient can go elsewhere if she chooses. It would seem that abortion-law reform--and better, repeal--is an idea whose\ntime has come. It is more than time that it be supported by all those who want\nto slow down our population growth rate without resorting to coercion or\ncompulsion. As Secretary-General U Thant and many of the UN agencies have\nrepeatedly said, \"The opportunity to decide the number and spacing of children\nis a basic human right.\" Until such time as we have a perfect contraceptive\nuniversally available and invariably used, voluntary abortion should be\ninfinitely preferred to compulsory sterilization or compulsory birth control,\nand that may well be the choice. Copyright © 1969 by Harriet Pilpel.  All rights reserved.\n\nFor several years, we have heard warnings about the population crisis. Indeed,\nso concerned are we that there now are voices in the land calling for\n\"compulsory sterilization\" and \"compulsory birth control,\" for the withholding\nof public support for illegitimate children in excess of a certain number, for\nconditioning welfare monies or parole or whatever on coerced sterilization, and\nso on. Yet little is done to make sterilization easily available on a voluntary\nbasis, particularly to the poor and underprivileged. Despite the lack of legal\nstrictures against it, it is often withheld by doctors and hospitals from those\nwho need it and want it most. At the same time, there begins to appear on the\npart of some an alarming readiness to subordinate rights of freedom of choice\nin the area of human reproduction to governmental coercion. Notwithstanding all this, we continue to maintain strict antiabortion laws on\nthe books of at least four fifths of our states, denying freedom of choice to\nwomen and physicians and compelling the \"unwilling to bear the unwanted.\" Yet,\nas Doctor Christopher Tietze and Sarah Lewit point out in the Scientific\nAmerican for January, 1969: \"Abortion is still the most widespread...method of\nfertility control in the modern world.\" According to experts who participated\nin a United Nations Conference on World Population in Belgrade in 1965,\nabortion is indeed the chief method of birth control in the world today, and\nthey estimated that about 30 million pregnancies are purposely terminated by\nabortion each year. Of these, studies indicate that almost one million are in\nthe United States. Since, however, abortions are still so difficult to obtain,\nwe force the birth of millions more unwanted children every year. If we really\nwant to cut our population growth rate on a voluntary basis, we should make\nabortion available on a voluntary basis, at least in the early stages of\npregnancy. When Japan liberalized its abortion laws some years back, it halved\nits rate of population growth in a decade. Population dilemma I do not recommend abortion as a birth-control method of choice. I merely state\nthat it is in fact the most important single method of birth control in the\nworld today, and to cut down on population growth we should make abortion easy\nand safe while we continue to develop other and more satisfactory methods of\nfamily limitation. In addition to the 5 million women in the United States\nwithout access to birth control for whom abortion would seem a matter of right\nwhen they want it, there are the uncounted thousands who after conception\nsuffer some disease (like German measles) or discover some defect which makes\nthe birth of a live and healthy baby unlikely, and the many, too, whose\ncontraceptive methods occasionally don't work. As the New York chapter of the\nNational Organization for Women notes in a pamphlet: \"There is no perfect contraceptive. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration\nreports that the intrauterine devices, one of the most effective contraceptives\navailable today, have a failure rate of 1.5 to 3%. This means that if all\nmarried women in the United States could and did use these contraceptives,\nthere would still be about 350,000 to 700,000 unwanted pregnancies a year among\nmarried women alone. Even sterilization is not a 100% effective method of\ncontraception; some operations fail. Therefore, in order to insure a complete\nand thorough birth control program, abortion must be made available as a legal\nright to all women who request it.\" Starting in the mid-1960s, some erosion of the anti-abortion laws began to take\nplace. But these efforts have not been supported by many of the more vocal\ngroups who are trying to do something about excess population growth; to them,\ncompulsory birth control and compulsory sterilization are apparently more\npalatable than voluntary abortion. The result is legal chaos--which has been the situation with reference to\nabortion since it was first made illegal in this country. Contrary to popular\nbelief, the legal strictures against abortion are of comparatively recent\norigin. Until the early nineteenth century--at common law both in England and\nin the United States--abortion before quickening was not illegal at all. It\nbecame so only in the early 1800s. And according to Professor Cyril Means and\nothers who have studied the problem, the reason for the enactment of the laws\nwas not protection of morals or of the \"soul\" of the fetus, but rather a\nreflection of the fact that at the time all surgical procedures were highly\nrisky because of the probability of infection (this was before Lister).\nAbortions were made illegal for this reason except where they were necessary to\nsave the life of the mother; that is, where the great risk of infection which\nevery operation involved was outweighed by the risk of carrying that particular\npregnancy to term. The situation is today reversed; abortion under modern\nhospital conditions is safer than childbirth. Nor is there any evidence that abortion involves psychological health hazards.\nA poll of the American Psychiatric Association in the mid-1960s revealed\noverwhelming support for more easily available abortions and a conviction that\nadverse psychological sequelae from abortion are negligible both on an absolute\nstandard and as compared with such sequelae from childbirth and unwanted\nchildren. Though the population experts have not yet aligned themselves on the side of\nabortion-law reform, something is beginning to happen. Seven states--Arkansas,\nCalifornia, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, New Mexico, and North Carolina--have\namended their laws to permit abortion not only to save life but also to protect\nthe health, mental and physical, of the mother, in cases of rape and incest,\nand to avert the birth of defective offspring (Governor Reagan forced the\nomission of this ground in the California law). Many other states have been and\nare now considering abortion reform or repeal bills but usually without the\nsupport of the powerful groups who are backing other forms of population\ncontrol. The old laws are also beginning to face challenges in the courts and\nare being attacked on a variety of constitutional grounds. Who gets help? The relevant statistics have been widely circulated: for example, of\ntherapeutic--that is, in-hospital--abortions in New York City in the early\nsixties, the majority of them for \"psychiatric\" reasons, 93 percent were\nperformed on white patients, 91 percent in private rooms. The ratio of\nin-hospital abortions to live births in New York City was approximately one to\n360 for private patients and something like one to 10,000 in municipal\nhospitals. At the same time the women whose deaths were associated with\nabortion in New York City in a typical year were 56 percent black, 23 percent\nPuerto Rican, and 21 percent white. The 8000 to 10,000 in-hospital abortions contrast, of course, with the\nestimated one million performed outside hospitals annually. Probably not much\nmore than one half of these are performed by doctors; the rest by the \"kindly\nneighbor,\" the \"close friend,\" or the woman herself. Generally speaking, the\nlaws do not distinguish in their prohibitions of abortions between doctors and\nnondoctors. Moreover, the out-of-hospital abortions performed by doctors are\nobtained by the same group which accounts for the bulk of the in-hospital\nabortions: the middle- and upper-income white woman who can afford the hundreds\nor thousands charged for expert medical service outside the law. And these are\nthe same women who can afford to go to Japan, Sweden, England, or one of the\nIron Curtain countries where abortions are legal and where they typically cost\nsomething between $10 and $25. But most of the old laws on abortion remain unchanged on the statute books. In\na few states, like Connecticut or Missouri, the law says that the abortion may\nbe performed to save the life of the child as well as that of the mother,\nalthough no one is sure what this means. As a matter of fact, no one knows what\nthe laws which permit abortion to save the life of the mother mean. Courts in a\nnumber of states have held that the danger to life need not be either\n\"imminent\" or \"certain.\" But how \"imminent\" or \"certain\"? Is it enough that the\npregnancy if it comes to term will seriously damage the mother's health? Or\nwill result in the birth of defective offspring? Clearly, a number of doctors think the answer to these questions is yes, since\nabortions, especially on white women with good incomes, are routinely and\nopenly performed in some hospitals in most states and the prosecuting\nauthorities do nothing about it.

A sectarian or\ncultist as applied to medicine is one who alleges to follow or in his practice\nfollows a dogma, tenet, or principle based on the authority of its promulgator\nto the exclusion of demonstration and scientific experience.\" Richard Cardinal Cushing said some time ago with reference to birth control:\n\"Catholics do not need the support of civil law to be faithful to their own\nreligious convictions and they do not seek to impose by law their moral views\non other members of society.\" Perhaps it is because of their awareness of the\nimpossible legal position the present stand of the Pope forces on Catholics who\nare lawmakers, law interpreters, or law enforcers, that such leading Catholic\nlegal scholars as Father Robert Drinan, dean of Boston College Law School, have\ncalled for total repeal, rather than amendment, of the abortion laws of all\nstates. They claim that since to Catholics all abortions are unacceptable, the\nstate should keep hands off the subject rather than decreeing that some\nabortions are legal and some not. Catholics should, of course, be allowed to\nfollow their own convictions in this area, but so surely should the rest of\nus. To the extent also that doctor and hospital adherents to the Pope's Encyclical\nare the recipients of public funds, they may be afoul of our First Amendment\nguarantees of religious freedom and anti-establishment of any church. And\nfinally, if for sectarian reasons they withhold a procedure which in any given\nsituation would be regarded as the proper medical response to the problem\npresented, they may be guilty of civil and criminal malpractice unless they at\nleast explain to the patient their sectarian reasons for withholding the\ntreatment so that the patient can go elsewhere if she chooses. It would seem that abortion-law reform--and better, repeal--is an idea whose\ntime has come. It is more than time that it be supported by all those who want\nto slow down our population growth rate without resorting to coercion or\ncompulsion. As Secretary-General U Thant and many of the UN agencies have\nrepeatedly said, \"The opportunity to decide the number and spacing of children\nis a basic human right.\" Until such time as we have a perfect contraceptive\nuniversally available and invariably used, voluntary abortion should be\ninfinitely preferred to compulsory sterilization or compulsory birth control,\nand that may well be the choice. Copyright © 1969 by Harriet Pilpel.  All rights reserved.\n\nFor several years, we have heard warnings about the population crisis. Indeed,\nso concerned are we that there now are voices in the land calling for\n\"compulsory sterilization\" and \"compulsory birth control,\" for the withholding\nof public support for illegitimate children in excess of a certain number, for\nconditioning welfare monies or parole or whatever on coerced sterilization, and\nso on. Yet little is done to make sterilization easily available on a voluntary\nbasis, particularly to the poor and underprivileged. Despite the lack of legal\nstrictures against it, it is often withheld by doctors and hospitals from those\nwho need it and want it most. At the same time, there begins to appear on the\npart of some an alarming readiness to subordinate rights of freedom of choice\nin the area of human reproduction to governmental coercion. Notwithstanding all this, we continue to maintain strict antiabortion laws on\nthe books of at least four fifths of our states, denying freedom of choice to\nwomen and physicians and compelling the \"unwilling to bear the unwanted.\" Yet,\nas Doctor Christopher Tietze and Sarah Lewit point out in the Scientific\nAmerican for January, 1969: \"Abortion is still the most widespread...method of\nfertility control in the modern world.\" According to experts who participated\nin a United Nations Conference on World Population in Belgrade in 1965,\nabortion is indeed the chief method of birth control in the world today, and\nthey estimated that about 30 million pregnancies are purposely terminated by\nabortion each year. Of these, studies indicate that almost one million are in\nthe United States. Since, however, abortions are still so difficult to obtain,\nwe force the birth of millions more unwanted children every year. If we really\nwant to cut our population growth rate on a voluntary basis, we should make\nabortion available on a voluntary basis, at least in the early stages of\npregnancy. When Japan liberalized its abortion laws some years back, it halved\nits rate of population growth in a decade. Population dilemma I do not recommend abortion as a birth-control method of choice. I merely state\nthat it is in fact the most important single method of birth control in the\nworld today, and to cut down on population growth we should make abortion easy\nand safe while we continue to develop other and more satisfactory methods of\nfamily limitation. In addition to the 5 million women in the United States\nwithout access to birth control for whom abortion would seem a matter of right\nwhen they want it, there are the uncounted thousands who after conception\nsuffer some disease (like German measles) or discover some defect which makes\nthe birth of a live and healthy baby unlikely, and the many, too, whose\ncontraceptive methods occasionally don't work. As the New York chapter of the\nNational Organization for Women notes in a pamphlet: \"There is no perfect contraceptive. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration\nreports that the intrauterine devices, one of the most effective contraceptives\navailable today, have a failure rate of 1.5 to 3%. This means that if all\nmarried women in the United States could and did use these contraceptives,\nthere would still be about 350,000 to 700,000 unwanted pregnancies a year among\nmarried women alone. Even sterilization is not a 100% effective method of\ncontraception; some operations fail. Therefore, in order to insure a complete\nand thorough birth control program, abortion must be made available as a legal\nright to all women who request it.\" Starting in the mid-1960s, some erosion of the anti-abortion laws began to take\nplace. But these efforts have not been supported by many of the more vocal\ngroups who are trying to do something about excess population growth; to them,\ncompulsory birth control and compulsory sterilization are apparently more\npalatable than voluntary abortion. The result is legal chaos--which has been the situation with reference to\nabortion since it was first made illegal in this country. Contrary to popular\nbelief, the legal strictures against abortion are of comparatively recent\norigin. Until the early nineteenth century--at common law both in England and\nin the United States--abortion before quickening was not illegal at all. It\nbecame so only in the early 1800s. And according to Professor Cyril Means and\nothers who have studied the problem, the reason for the enactment of the laws\nwas not protection of morals or of the \"soul\" of the fetus, but rather a\nreflection of the fact that at the time all surgical procedures were highly\nrisky because of the probability of infection (this was before Lister).\nAbortions were made illegal for this reason except where they were necessary to\nsave the life of the mother; that is, where the great risk of infection which\nevery operation involved was outweighed by the risk of carrying that particular\npregnancy to term. The situation is today reversed; abortion under modern\nhospital conditions is safer than childbirth. Nor is there any evidence that abortion involves psychological health hazards.\nA poll of the American Psychiatric Association in the mid-1960s revealed\noverwhelming support for more easily available abortions and a conviction that\nadverse psychological sequelae from abortion are negligible both on an absolute\nstandard and as compared with such sequelae from childbirth and unwanted\nchildren. Though the population experts have not yet aligned themselves on the side of\nabortion-law reform, something is beginning to happen. Seven states--Arkansas,\nCalifornia, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, New Mexico, and North Carolina--have\namended their laws to permit abortion not only to save life but also to protect\nthe health, mental and physical, of the mother, in cases of rape and incest,\nand to avert the birth of defective offspring (Governor Reagan forced the\nomission of this ground in the California law). Many other states have been and\nare now considering abortion reform or repeal bills but usually without the\nsupport of the powerful groups who are backing other forms of population\ncontrol. The old laws are also beginning to face challenges in the courts and\nare being attacked on a variety of constitutional grounds. Who gets help? The relevant statistics have been widely circulated: for example, of\ntherapeutic--that is, in-hospital--abortions in New York City in the early\nsixties, the majority of them for \"psychiatric\" reasons, 93 percent were\nperformed on white patients, 91 percent in private rooms. The ratio of\nin-hospital abortions to live births in New York City was approximately one to\n360 for private patients and something like one to 10,000 in municipal\nhospitals. At the same time the women whose deaths were associated with\nabortion in New York City in a typical year were 56 percent black, 23 percent\nPuerto Rican, and 21 percent white. The 8000 to 10,000 in-hospital abortions contrast, of course, with the\nestimated one million performed outside hospitals annually. Probably not much\nmore than one half of these are performed by doctors; the rest by the \"kindly\nneighbor,\" the \"close friend,\" or the woman herself. Generally speaking, the\nlaws do not distinguish in their prohibitions of abortions between doctors and\nnondoctors. Moreover, the out-of-hospital abortions performed by doctors are\nobtained by the same group which accounts for the bulk of the in-hospital\nabortions: the middle- and upper-income white woman who can afford the hundreds\nor thousands charged for expert medical service outside the law. And these are\nthe same women who can afford to go to Japan, Sweden, England, or one of the\nIron Curtain countries where abortions are legal and where they typically cost\nsomething between $10 and $25. But most of the old laws on abortion remain unchanged on the statute books. In\na few states, like Connecticut or Missouri, the law says that the abortion may\nbe performed to save the life of the child as well as that of the mother,\nalthough no one is sure what this means. As a matter of fact, no one knows what\nthe laws which permit abortion to save the life of the mother mean. Courts in a\nnumber of states have held that the danger to life need not be either\n\"imminent\" or \"certain.\" But how \"imminent\" or \"certain\"? Is it enough that the\npregnancy if it comes to term will seriously damage the mother's health? Or\nwill result in the birth of defective offspring? Clearly, a number of doctors think the answer to these questions is yes, since\nabortions, especially on white women with good incomes, are routinely and\nopenly performed in some hospitals in most states and the prosecuting\nauthorities do nothing about it. Criminal laws like these, the meaning of which\npeople must guess at, are open to constitutional attack on this ground, as the\nUnited States Supreme Court has often held with respect to other \"vague\"\nprohibitions. There are many other grounds of constitutional challenge as well:\nthe rights of women, rich and poor, black and white, to equal protection of the\nlaw--that is, to get proper medical treatment without discrimination on the\ngrounds of race, color, or income; the rights of physicians to do their\nprofessional duty in the light of what is known and believed by medical science\ntoday; the right of privacy declared by the United States Supreme Court in the\nConnecticut birth-control case where Sir Justice Goldberg in his concurring\nopinion stated that compulsory pro- or anti-birth-control laws are equally\n\"totalitarian\" and unconstitutional; the right to be free of \"cruel and unusual\npunishment\"; and others. Also it may well be that some courts faced with the\nunconscionable dilemma posed by the abortion laws and unwilling to resort to\nconstitutional grounds, will \"interpret\" the laws out of existence eventually,\nas has happened to the federal birth-control laws. Absolutely excluded So why do the abortion laws stay on the books? One reason is the apparent\ninability or unwillingness of those who advocate population limitation to see\nthe connection. (This does not apply to Planned Parenthood-World Population,\nwhich in November, 1968, passed resolutions calling for repeal of the abortion\nlaws in support of its declared policy of voluntary parenthood.) By 1968, almost all the major religious groups in the United States except the\nRoman Catholic Church were on record in favor of abortion-law reform or repeal.\nThe American Baptist Convention and the Universalist/Unitarian Church came out\nfor total repeal. And public opinion polls demonstrated that a majority of\npeople, including a majority of the Catholics asked about the issue, favored at\nleast some liberalization of the laws. But the opposition of the Catholic\nChurch is potent and well organized. The Church holds that the fetus is\n\"ensouled\" at conception. In his encyclical Humanae Vitae in July of 1968, Pope\nPaul said, \"We must once again declare that the direct interruption of the\ngenerative process already begun and above all, directly willed and procured\nabortion, even if for therapeutic reasons, are to be absolutely excluded as\nlicit means of regulating birth.\" To this unequivocal statement--which is, of course, not the law in any American\nstate, since all states permit abortion at least to save the life of the\nmother--the Pope adds an \"Appeal to Public Authorities.\" He says, \"To Rulers,\nwho are those principally responsible for the common good, and who can do so\nmuch to safeguard moral customs, we say: Do not allow the morality of your\npeople to be degraded; do not permit that by legal means practices contrary to\nthe natural and divine law be introduced into that fundamental cell, the\nFamily....May all responsible public authorities--as some are already doing so\nlaudably--generously revive their efforts.\" I submit that insofar as this is an\nappeal to Catholic officials in this country, it must clearly be disregarded,\nbecause it is inconsistent with the laws of the land. By issuing such an \"Appeal to Public Authorities,\" the Pope has placed in a\nvery difficult position those Catholics who occupy public positions in this or\nin any country where separation of church and state is constitutionally or\notherwise basically guaranteed. They must choose, for example, when it comes to\nabortion for the therapeutic reason even of saving the life of the woman\nbetween their obligations to their church and their obligations to their state.\nThis leads to the question whether as a matter of law Catholic doctors and\nCatholic hospitals which follow the teachings of the Pope are practicing\nsectarian medicine. If I am right that they are, then they are infringing the\nAmerican Medical Association's canons of ethics, which prohibit the practice of\nsectarian medicine: \"In order that a physician may best serve his patients he is expected to exalt\nthe standards of his profession and to extend its sphere of usefulness.\" \"To the same end, he should not base his practice on an exclusive dogma, or a\nsectarian system, 'for sects are implacable despots: to accept their thralldom\nis to take away all liberty from one's action and thought.'

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration\nreports that the intrauterine devices, one of the most effective contraceptives\navailable today, have a failure rate of 1.5 to 3%. This means that if all\nmarried women in the United States could and did use these contraceptives,\nthere would still be about 350,000 to 700,000 unwanted pregnancies a year among\nmarried women alone. Even sterilization is not a 100% effective method of\ncontraception; some operations fail. Therefore, in order to insure a complete\nand thorough birth control program, abortion must be made available as a legal\nright to all women who request it.\" Starting in the mid-1960s, some erosion of the anti-abortion laws began to take\nplace. But these efforts have not been supported by many of the more vocal\ngroups who are trying to do something about excess population growth; to them,\ncompulsory birth control and compulsory sterilization are apparently more\npalatable than voluntary abortion. The result is legal chaos--which has been the situation with reference to\nabortion since it was first made illegal in this country. Contrary to popular\nbelief, the legal strictures against abortion are of comparatively recent\norigin. Until the early nineteenth century--at common law both in England and\nin the United States--abortion before quickening was not illegal at all. It\nbecame so only in the early 1800s. And according to Professor Cyril Means and\nothers who have studied the problem, the reason for the enactment of the laws\nwas not protection of morals or of the \"soul\" of the fetus, but rather a\nreflection of the fact that at the time all surgical procedures were highly\nrisky because of the probability of infection (this was before Lister).\nAbortions were made illegal for this reason except where they were necessary to\nsave the life of the mother; that is, where the great risk of infection which\nevery operation involved was outweighed by the risk of carrying that particular\npregnancy to term. The situation is today reversed; abortion under modern\nhospital conditions is safer than childbirth. Nor is there any evidence that abortion involves psychological health hazards.\nA poll of the American Psychiatric Association in the mid-1960s revealed\noverwhelming support for more easily available abortions and a conviction that\nadverse psychological sequelae from abortion are negligible both on an absolute\nstandard and as compared with such sequelae from childbirth and unwanted\nchildren. Though the population experts have not yet aligned themselves on the side of\nabortion-law reform, something is beginning to happen. Seven states--Arkansas,\nCalifornia, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, New Mexico, and North Carolina--have\namended their laws to permit abortion not only to save life but also to protect\nthe health, mental and physical, of the mother, in cases of rape and incest,\nand to avert the birth of defective offspring (Governor Reagan forced the\nomission of this ground in the California law). Many other states have been and\nare now considering abortion reform or repeal bills but usually without the\nsupport of the powerful groups who are backing other forms of population\ncontrol. The old laws are also beginning to face challenges in the courts and\nare being attacked on a variety of constitutional grounds. Who gets help? The relevant statistics have been widely circulated: for example, of\ntherapeutic--that is, in-hospital--abortions in New York City in the early\nsixties, the majority of them for \"psychiatric\" reasons, 93 percent were\nperformed on white patients, 91 percent in private rooms. The ratio of\nin-hospital abortions to live births in New York City was approximately one to\n360 for private patients and something like one to 10,000 in municipal\nhospitals. At the same time the women whose deaths were associated with\nabortion in New York City in a typical year were 56 percent black, 23 percent\nPuerto Rican, and 21 percent white. The 8000 to 10,000 in-hospital abortions contrast, of course, with the\nestimated one million performed outside hospitals annually. Probably not much\nmore than one half of these are performed by doctors; the rest by the \"kindly\nneighbor,\" the \"close friend,\" or the woman herself. Generally speaking, the\nlaws do not distinguish in their prohibitions of abortions between doctors and\nnondoctors. Moreover, the out-of-hospital abortions performed by doctors are\nobtained by the same group which accounts for the bulk of the in-hospital\nabortions: the middle- and upper-income white woman who can afford the hundreds\nor thousands charged for expert medical service outside the law. And these are\nthe same women who can afford to go to Japan, Sweden, England, or one of the\nIron Curtain countries where abortions are legal and where they typically cost\nsomething between $10 and $25. But most of the old laws on abortion remain unchanged on the statute books. In\na few states, like Connecticut or Missouri, the law says that the abortion may\nbe performed to save the life of the child as well as that of the mother,\nalthough no one is sure what this means. As a matter of fact, no one knows what\nthe laws which permit abortion to save the life of the mother mean. Courts in a\nnumber of states have held that the danger to life need not be either\n\"imminent\" or \"certain.\" But how \"imminent\" or \"certain\"? Is it enough that the\npregnancy if it comes to term will seriously damage the mother's health? Or\nwill result in the birth of defective offspring? Clearly, a number of doctors think the answer to these questions is yes, since\nabortions, especially on white women with good incomes, are routinely and\nopenly performed in some hospitals in most states and the prosecuting\nauthorities do nothing about it. Criminal laws like these, the meaning of which\npeople must guess at, are open to constitutional attack on this ground, as the\nUnited States Supreme Court has often held with respect to other \"vague\"\nprohibitions. There are many other grounds of constitutional challenge as well:\nthe rights of women, rich and poor, black and white, to equal protection of the\nlaw--that is, to get proper medical treatment without discrimination on the\ngrounds of race, color, or income; the rights of physicians to do their\nprofessional duty in the light of what is known and believed by medical science\ntoday; the right of privacy declared by the United States Supreme Court in the\nConnecticut birth-control case where Sir Justice Goldberg in his concurring\nopinion stated that compulsory pro- or anti-birth-control laws are equally\n\"totalitarian\" and unconstitutional; the right to be free of \"cruel and unusual\npunishment\"; and others. Also it may well be that some courts faced with the\nunconscionable dilemma posed by the abortion laws and unwilling to resort to\nconstitutional grounds, will \"interpret\" the laws out of existence eventually,\nas has happened to the federal birth-control laws. Absolutely excluded So why do the abortion laws stay on the books? One reason is the apparent\ninability or unwillingness of those who advocate population limitation to see\nthe connection. (This does not apply to Planned Parenthood-World Population,\nwhich in November, 1968, passed resolutions calling for repeal of the abortion\nlaws in support of its declared policy of voluntary parenthood.) By 1968, almost all the major religious groups in the United States except the\nRoman Catholic Church were on record in favor of abortion-law reform or repeal.\nThe American Baptist Convention and the Universalist/Unitarian Church came out\nfor total repeal. And public opinion polls demonstrated that a majority of\npeople, including a majority of the Catholics asked about the issue, favored at\nleast some liberalization of the laws. But the opposition of the Catholic\nChurch is potent and well organized. The Church holds that the fetus is\n\"ensouled\" at conception. In his encyclical Humanae Vitae in July of 1968, Pope\nPaul said, \"We must once again declare that the direct interruption of the\ngenerative process already begun and above all, directly willed and procured\nabortion, even if for therapeutic reasons, are to be absolutely excluded as\nlicit means of regulating birth.\" To this unequivocal statement--which is, of course, not the law in any American\nstate, since all states permit abortion at least to save the life of the\nmother--the Pope adds an \"Appeal to Public Authorities.\" He says, \"To Rulers,\nwho are those principally responsible for the common good, and who can do so\nmuch to safeguard moral customs, we say: Do not allow the morality of your\npeople to be degraded; do not permit that by legal means practices contrary to\nthe natural and divine law be introduced into that fundamental cell, the\nFamily....May all responsible public authorities--as some are already doing so\nlaudably--generously revive their efforts.\" I submit that insofar as this is an\nappeal to Catholic officials in this country, it must clearly be disregarded,\nbecause it is inconsistent with the laws of the land. By issuing such an \"Appeal to Public Authorities,\" the Pope has placed in a\nvery difficult position those Catholics who occupy public positions in this or\nin any country where separation of church and state is constitutionally or\notherwise basically guaranteed. They must choose, for example, when it comes to\nabortion for the therapeutic reason even of saving the life of the woman\nbetween their obligations to their church and their obligations to their state.\nThis leads to the question whether as a matter of law Catholic doctors and\nCatholic hospitals which follow the teachings of the Pope are practicing\nsectarian medicine. If I am right that they are, then they are infringing the\nAmerican Medical Association's canons of ethics, which prohibit the practice of\nsectarian medicine: \"In order that a physician may best serve his patients he is expected to exalt\nthe standards of his profession and to extend its sphere of usefulness.\" \"To the same end, he should not base his practice on an exclusive dogma, or a\nsectarian system, 'for sects are implacable despots: to accept their thralldom\nis to take away all liberty from one's action and thought.' A sectarian or\ncultist as applied to medicine is one who alleges to follow or in his practice\nfollows a dogma, tenet, or principle based on the authority of its promulgator\nto the exclusion of demonstration and scientific experience.\" Richard Cardinal Cushing said some time ago with reference to birth control:\n\"Catholics do not need the support of civil law to be faithful to their own\nreligious convictions and they do not seek to impose by law their moral views\non other members of society.\" Perhaps it is because of their awareness of the\nimpossible legal position the present stand of the Pope forces on Catholics who\nare lawmakers, law interpreters, or law enforcers, that such leading Catholic\nlegal scholars as Father Robert Drinan, dean of Boston College Law School, have\ncalled for total repeal, rather than amendment, of the abortion laws of all\nstates. They claim that since to Catholics all abortions are unacceptable, the\nstate should keep hands off the subject rather than decreeing that some\nabortions are legal and some not. Catholics should, of course, be allowed to\nfollow their own convictions in this area, but so surely should the rest of\nus. To the extent also that doctor and hospital adherents to the Pope's Encyclical\nare the recipients of public funds, they may be afoul of our First Amendment\nguarantees of religious freedom and anti-establishment of any church. And\nfinally, if for sectarian reasons they withhold a procedure which in any given\nsituation would be regarded as the proper medical response to the problem\npresented, they may be guilty of civil and criminal malpractice unless they at\nleast explain to the patient their sectarian reasons for withholding the\ntreatment so that the patient can go elsewhere if she chooses. It would seem that abortion-law reform--and better, repeal--is an idea whose\ntime has come. It is more than time that it be supported by all those who want\nto slow down our population growth rate without resorting to coercion or\ncompulsion. As Secretary-General U Thant and many of the UN agencies have\nrepeatedly said, \"The opportunity to decide the number and spacing of children\nis a basic human right.\" Until such time as we have a perfect contraceptive\nuniversally available and invariably used, voluntary abortion should be\ninfinitely preferred to compulsory sterilization or compulsory birth control,\nand that may well be the choice. Copyright © 1969 by Harriet Pilpel.  All rights reserved.\n\nNotwithstanding all this, we continue to maintain strict antiabortion laws on\nthe books of at least four fifths of our states, denying freedom of choice to\nwomen and physicians and compelling the \"unwilling to bear the unwanted.\" Yet,\nas Doctor Christopher Tietze and Sarah Lewit point out in the Scientific\nAmerican for January, 1969: \"Abortion is still the most widespread...method of\nfertility control in the modern world.\" According to experts who participated\nin a United Nations Conference on World Population in Belgrade in 1965,\nabortion is indeed the chief method of birth control in the world today, and\nthey estimated that about 30 million pregnancies are purposely terminated by\nabortion each year. Of these, studies indicate that almost one million are in\nthe United States. Since, however, abortions are still so difficult to obtain,\nwe force the birth of millions more unwanted children every year. If we really\nwant to cut our population growth rate on a voluntary basis, we should make\nabortion available on a voluntary basis, at least in the early stages of\npregnancy. When Japan liberalized its abortion laws some years back, it halved\nits rate of population growth in a decade. Population dilemma I do not recommend abortion as a birth-control method of choice. I merely state\nthat it is in fact the most important single method of birth control in the\nworld today, and to cut down on population growth we should make abortion easy\nand safe while we continue to develop other and more satisfactory methods of\nfamily limitation. In addition to the 5 million women in the United States\nwithout access to birth control for whom abortion would seem a matter of right\nwhen they want it, there are the uncounted thousands who after conception\nsuffer some disease (like German measles) or discover some defect which makes\nthe birth of a live and healthy baby unlikely, and the many, too, whose\ncontraceptive methods occasionally don't work.

By issuing such an \"Appeal to Public Authorities,\" the Pope has placed in a\nvery difficult position those Catholics who occupy public positions in this or\nin any country where separation of church and state is constitutionally or\notherwise basically guaranteed. They must choose, for example, when it comes to\nabortion for the therapeutic reason even of saving the life of the woman\nbetween their obligations to their church and their obligations to their state.\nThis leads to the question whether as a matter of law Catholic doctors and\nCatholic hospitals which follow the teachings of the Pope are practicing\nsectarian medicine.

They claim that since to Catholics all abortions are unacceptable, the\nstate should keep hands off the subject rather than decreeing that some\nabortions are legal and some not.

I merely state\nthat it is in fact the most important single method of birth control in the\nworld today, and to cut down on population growth we should make abortion easy\nand safe while we continue to develop other and more satisfactory methods of\nfamily limitation. In addition to the 5 million women in the United States\nwithout access to birth control for whom abortion would seem a matter of right\nwhen they want it, there are the uncounted thousands who after conception\nsuffer some disease (like German measles) or discover some defect which makes\nthe birth of a live and healthy baby unlikely, and the many, too, whose\ncontraceptive methods occasionally don't work. As the New York chapter of the\nNational Organization for Women notes in a pamphlet: \"There is no perfect contraceptive. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration\nreports that the intrauterine devices, one of the most effective contraceptives\navailable today, have a failure rate of 1.5 to 3%. This means that if all\nmarried women in the United States could and did use these contraceptives,\nthere would still be about 350,000 to 700,000 unwanted pregnancies a year among\nmarried women alone. Even sterilization is not a 100% effective method of\ncontraception; some operations fail. Therefore, in order to insure a complete\nand thorough birth control program, abortion must be made available as a legal\nright to all women who request it.\" Starting in the mid-1960s, some erosion of the anti-abortion laws began to take\nplace. But these efforts have not been supported by many of the more vocal\ngroups who are trying to do something about excess population growth; to them,\ncompulsory birth control and compulsory sterilization are apparently more\npalatable than voluntary abortion. The result is legal chaos--which has been the situation with reference to\nabortion since it was first made illegal in this country. Contrary to popular\nbelief, the legal strictures against abortion are of comparatively recent\norigin. Until the early nineteenth century--at common law both in England and\nin the United States--abortion before quickening was not illegal at all. It\nbecame so only in the early 1800s. And according to Professor Cyril Means and\nothers who have studied the problem, the reason for the enactment of the laws\nwas not protection of morals or of the \"soul\" of the fetus, but rather a\nreflection of the fact that at the time all surgical procedures were highly\nrisky because of the probability of infection (this was before Lister).\nAbortions were made illegal for this reason except where they were necessary to\nsave the life of the mother; that is, where the great risk of infection which\nevery operation involved was outweighed by the risk of carrying that particular\npregnancy to term. The situation is today reversed; abortion under modern\nhospital conditions is safer than childbirth. Nor is there any evidence that abortion involves psychological health hazards.\nA poll of the American Psychiatric Association in the mid-1960s revealed\noverwhelming support for more easily available abortions and a conviction that\nadverse psychological sequelae from abortion are negligible both on an absolute\nstandard and as compared with such sequelae from childbirth and unwanted\nchildren. Though the population experts have not yet aligned themselves on the side of\nabortion-law reform, something is beginning to happen. Seven states--Arkansas,\nCalifornia, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, New Mexico, and North Carolina--have\namended their laws to permit abortion not only to save life but also to protect\nthe health, mental and physical, of the mother, in cases of rape and incest,\nand to avert the birth of defective offspring (Governor Reagan forced the\nomission of this ground in the California law). Many other states have been and\nare now considering abortion reform or repeal bills but usually without the\nsupport of the powerful groups who are backing other forms of population\ncontrol. The old laws are also beginning to face challenges in the courts and\nare being attacked on a variety of constitutional grounds. Who gets help? The relevant statistics have been widely circulated: for example, of\ntherapeutic--that is, in-hospital--abortions in New York City in the early\nsixties, the majority of them for \"psychiatric\" reasons, 93 percent were\nperformed on white patients, 91 percent in private rooms. The ratio of\nin-hospital abortions to live births in New York City was approximately one to\n360 for private patients and something like one to 10,000 in municipal\nhospitals. At the same time the women whose deaths were associated with\nabortion in New York City in a typical year were 56 percent black, 23 percent\nPuerto Rican, and 21 percent white. The 8000 to 10,000 in-hospital abortions contrast, of course, with the\nestimated one million performed outside hospitals annually. Probably not much\nmore than one half of these are performed by doctors; the rest by the \"kindly\nneighbor,\" the \"close friend,\" or the woman herself. Generally speaking, the\nlaws do not distinguish in their prohibitions of abortions between doctors and\nnondoctors. Moreover, the out-of-hospital abortions performed by doctors are\nobtained by the same group which accounts for the bulk of the in-hospital\nabortions: the middle- and upper-income white woman who can afford the hundreds\nor thousands charged for expert medical service outside the law. And these are\nthe same women who can afford to go to Japan, Sweden, England, or one of the\nIron Curtain countries where abortions are legal and where they typically cost\nsomething between $10 and $25. But most of the old laws on abortion remain unchanged on the statute books. In\na few states, like Connecticut or Missouri, the law says that the abortion may\nbe performed to save the life of the child as well as that of the mother,\nalthough no one is sure what this means. As a matter of fact, no one knows what\nthe laws which permit abortion to save the life of the mother mean. Courts in a\nnumber of states have held that the danger to life need not be either\n\"imminent\" or \"certain.\" But how \"imminent\" or \"certain\"? Is it enough that the\npregnancy if it comes to term will seriously damage the mother's health? Or\nwill result in the birth of defective offspring? Clearly, a number of doctors think the answer to these questions is yes, since\nabortions, especially on white women with good incomes, are routinely and\nopenly performed in some hospitals in most states and the prosecuting\nauthorities do nothing about it. Criminal laws like these, the meaning of which\npeople must guess at, are open to constitutional attack on this ground, as the\nUnited States Supreme Court has often held with respect to other \"vague\"\nprohibitions. There are many other grounds of constitutional challenge as well:\nthe rights of women, rich and poor, black and white, to equal protection of the\nlaw--that is, to get proper medical treatment without discrimination on the\ngrounds of race, color, or income; the rights of physicians to do their\nprofessional duty in the light of what is known and believed by medical science\ntoday; the right of privacy declared by the United States Supreme Court in the\nConnecticut birth-control case where Sir Justice Goldberg in his concurring\nopinion stated that compulsory pro- or anti-birth-control laws are equally\n\"totalitarian\" and unconstitutional; the right to be free of \"cruel and unusual\npunishment\"; and others.

The result is legal chaos--which has been the situation with reference to\nabortion since it was first made illegal in this country. Contrary to popular\nbelief, the legal strictures against abortion are of comparatively recent\norigin. Until the early nineteenth century--at common law both in England and\nin the United States--abortion before quickening was not illegal at all. It\nbecame so only in the early 1800s. And according to Professor Cyril Means and\nothers who have studied the problem, the reason for the enactment of the laws\nwas not protection of morals or of the \"soul\" of the fetus, but rather a\nreflection of the fact that at the time all surgical procedures were highly\nrisky because of the probability of infection (this was before Lister).\nAbortions were made illegal for this reason except where they were necessary to\nsave the life of the mother; that is, where the great risk of infection which\nevery operation involved was outweighed by the risk of carrying that particular\npregnancy to term. The situation is today reversed; abortion under modern\nhospital conditions is safer than childbirth. Nor is there any evidence that abortion involves psychological health hazards.\nA poll of the American Psychiatric Association in the mid-1960s revealed\noverwhelming support for more easily available abortions and a conviction that\nadverse psychological sequelae from abortion are negligible both on an absolute\nstandard and as compared with such sequelae from childbirth and unwanted\nchildren. Though the population experts have not yet aligned themselves on the side of\nabortion-law reform, something is beginning to happen. Seven states--Arkansas,\nCalifornia, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, New Mexico, and North Carolina--have\namended their laws to permit abortion not only to save life but also to protect\nthe health, mental and physical, of the mother, in cases of rape and incest,\nand to avert the birth of defective offspring (Governor Reagan forced the\nomission of this ground in the California law). Many other states have been and\nare now considering abortion reform or repeal bills but usually without the\nsupport of the powerful groups who are backing other forms of population\ncontrol. The old laws are also beginning to face challenges in the courts and\nare being attacked on a variety of constitutional grounds. Who gets help? The relevant statistics have been widely circulated: for example, of\ntherapeutic--that is, in-hospital--abortions in New York City in the early\nsixties, the majority of them for \"psychiatric\" reasons, 93 percent were\nperformed on white patients, 91 percent in private rooms. The ratio of\nin-hospital abortions to live births in New York City was approximately one to\n360 for private patients and something like one to 10,000 in municipal\nhospitals. At the same time the women whose deaths were associated with\nabortion in New York City in a typical year were 56 percent black, 23 percent\nPuerto Rican, and 21 percent white. The 8000 to 10,000 in-hospital abortions contrast, of course, with the\nestimated one million performed outside hospitals annually. Probably not much\nmore than one half of these are performed by doctors; the rest by the \"kindly\nneighbor,\" the \"close friend,\" or the woman herself. Generally speaking, the\nlaws do not distinguish in their prohibitions of abortions between doctors and\nnondoctors. Moreover, the out-of-hospital abortions performed by doctors are\nobtained by the same group which accounts for the bulk of the in-hospital\nabortions: the middle- and upper-income white woman who can afford the hundreds\nor thousands charged for expert medical service outside the law. And these are\nthe same women who can afford to go to Japan, Sweden, England, or one of the\nIron Curtain countries where abortions are legal and where they typically cost\nsomething between $10 and $25. But most of the old laws on abortion remain unchanged on the statute books. In\na few states, like Connecticut or Missouri, the law says that the abortion may\nbe performed to save the life of the child as well as that of the mother,\nalthough no one is sure what this means. As a matter of fact, no one knows what\nthe laws which permit abortion to save the life of the mother mean. Courts in a\nnumber of states have held that the danger to life need not be either\n\"imminent\" or \"certain.\" But how \"imminent\" or \"certain\"? Is it enough that the\npregnancy if it comes to term will seriously damage the mother's health? Or\nwill result in the birth of defective offspring? Clearly, a number of doctors think the answer to these questions is yes, since\nabortions, especially on white women with good incomes, are routinely and\nopenly performed in some hospitals in most states and the prosecuting\nauthorities do nothing about it. Criminal laws like these, the meaning of which\npeople must guess at, are open to constitutional attack on this ground, as the\nUnited States Supreme Court has often held with respect to other \"vague\"\nprohibitions. There are many other grounds of constitutional challenge as well:\nthe rights of women, rich and poor, black and white, to equal protection of the\nlaw--that is, to get proper medical treatment without discrimination on the\ngrounds of race, color, or income; the rights of physicians to do their\nprofessional duty in the light of what is known and believed by medical science\ntoday; the right of privacy declared by the United States Supreme Court in the\nConnecticut birth-control case where Sir Justice Goldberg in his concurring\nopinion stated that compulsory pro- or anti-birth-control laws are equally\n\"totalitarian\" and unconstitutional; the right to be free of \"cruel and unusual\npunishment\"; and others. Also it may well be that some courts faced with the\nunconscionable dilemma posed by the abortion laws and unwilling to resort to\nconstitutional grounds, will \"interpret\" the laws out of existence eventually,\nas has happened to the federal birth-control laws. Absolutely excluded So why do the abortion laws stay on the books? One reason is the apparent\ninability or unwillingness of those who advocate population limitation to see\nthe connection. (This does not apply to Planned Parenthood-World Population,\nwhich in November, 1968, passed resolutions calling for repeal of the abortion\nlaws in support of its declared policy of voluntary parenthood.) By 1968, almost all the major religious groups in the United States except the\nRoman Catholic Church were on record in favor of abortion-law reform or repeal.\nThe American Baptist Convention and the Universalist/Unitarian Church came out\nfor total repeal. And public opinion polls demonstrated that a majority of\npeople, including a majority of the Catholics asked about the issue, favored at\nleast some liberalization of the laws. But the opposition of the Catholic\nChurch is potent and well organized. The Church holds that the fetus is\n\"ensouled\" at conception. In his encyclical Humanae Vitae in July of 1968, Pope\nPaul said, \"We must once again declare that the direct interruption of the\ngenerative process already begun and above all, directly willed and procured\nabortion, even if for therapeutic reasons, are to be absolutely excluded as\nlicit means of regulating birth.\" To this unequivocal statement--which is, of course, not the law in any American\nstate, since all states permit abortion at least to save the life of the\nmother--the Pope adds an \"Appeal to Public Authorities.\" He says, \"To Rulers,\nwho are those principally responsible for the common good, and who can do so\nmuch to safeguard moral customs, we say: Do not allow the morality of your\npeople to be degraded; do not permit that by legal means practices contrary to\nthe natural and divine law be introduced into that fundamental cell, the\nFamily....May all responsible public authorities--as some are already doing so\nlaudably--generously revive their efforts.\" I submit that insofar as this is an\nappeal to Catholic officials in this country, it must clearly be disregarded,\nbecause it is inconsistent with the laws of the land. By issuing such an \"Appeal to Public Authorities,\" the Pope has placed in a\nvery difficult position those Catholics who occupy public positions in this or\nin any country where separation of church and state is constitutionally or\notherwise basically guaranteed. They must choose, for example, when it comes to\nabortion for the therapeutic reason even of saving the life of the woman\nbetween their obligations to their church and their obligations to their state.\nThis leads to the question whether as a matter of law Catholic doctors and\nCatholic hospitals which follow the teachings of the Pope are practicing\nsectarian medicine. If I am right that they are, then they are infringing the\nAmerican Medical Association's canons of ethics, which prohibit the practice of\nsectarian medicine: \"In order that a physician may best serve his patients he is expected to exalt\nthe standards of his profession and to extend its sphere of usefulness.\" \"To the same end, he should not base his practice on an exclusive dogma, or a\nsectarian system, 'for sects are implacable despots: to accept their thralldom\nis to take away all liberty from one's action and thought.' A sectarian or\ncultist as applied to medicine is one who alleges to follow or in his practice\nfollows a dogma, tenet, or principle based on the authority of its promulgator\nto the exclusion of demonstration and scientific experience.\" Richard Cardinal Cushing said some time ago with reference to birth control:\n\"Catholics do not need the support of civil law to be faithful to their own\nreligious convictions and they do not seek to impose by law their moral views\non other members of society.\" Perhaps it is because of their awareness of the\nimpossible legal position the present stand of the Pope forces on Catholics who\nare lawmakers, law interpreters, or law enforcers, that such leading Catholic\nlegal scholars as Father Robert Drinan, dean of Boston College Law School, have\ncalled for total repeal, rather than amendment, of the abortion laws of all\nstates. They claim that since to Catholics all abortions are unacceptable, the\nstate should keep hands off the subject rather than decreeing that some\nabortions are legal and some not. Catholics should, of course, be allowed to\nfollow their own convictions in this area, but so surely should the rest of\nus. To the extent also that doctor and hospital adherents to the Pope's Encyclical\nare the recipients of public funds, they may be afoul of our First Amendment\nguarantees of religious freedom and anti-establishment of any church. And\nfinally, if for sectarian reasons they withhold a procedure which in any given\nsituation would be regarded as the proper medical response to the problem\npresented, they may be guilty of civil and criminal malpractice unless they at\nleast explain to the patient their sectarian reasons for withholding the\ntreatment so that the patient can go elsewhere if she chooses. It would seem that abortion-law reform--and better, repeal--is an idea whose\ntime has come. It is more than time that it be supported by all those who want\nto slow down our population growth rate without resorting to coercion or\ncompulsion. As Secretary-General U Thant and many of the UN agencies have\nrepeatedly said, \"The opportunity to decide the number and spacing of children\nis a basic human right.\" Until such time as we have a perfect contraceptive\nuniversally available and invariably used, voluntary abortion should be\ninfinitely preferred to compulsory sterilization or compulsory birth control,\nand that may well be the choice.

I merely state\nthat it is in fact the most important single method of birth control in the\nworld today, and to cut down on population growth we should make abortion easy\nand safe while we continue to develop other and more satisfactory methods of\nfamily limitation. In addition to the 5 million women in the United States\nwithout access to birth control for whom abortion would seem a matter of right\nwhen they want it, there are the uncounted thousands who after conception\nsuffer some disease (like German measles) or discover some defect which makes\nthe birth of a live and healthy baby unlikely, and the many, too, whose\ncontraceptive methods occasionally don't work. As the New York chapter of the\nNational Organization for Women notes in a pamphlet: \"There is no perfect contraceptive. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration\nreports that the intrauterine devices, one of the most effective contraceptives\navailable today, have a failure rate of 1.5 to 3%. This means that if all\nmarried women in the United States could and did use these contraceptives,\nthere would still be about 350,000 to 700,000 unwanted pregnancies a year among\nmarried women alone. Even sterilization is not a 100% effective method of\ncontraception; some operations fail. Therefore, in order to insure a complete\nand thorough birth control program, abortion must be made available as a legal\nright to all women who request it.\" Starting in the mid-1960s, some erosion of the anti-abortion laws began to take\nplace.

By issuing such an \"Appeal to Public Authorities,\" the Pope has placed in a\nvery difficult position those Catholics who occupy public positions in this or\nin any country where separation of church and state is constitutionally or\notherwise basically guaranteed. They must choose, for example, when it comes to\nabortion for the therapeutic reason even of saving the life of the woman\nbetween their obligations to their church and their obligations to their state.\nThis leads to the question whether as a matter of law Catholic doctors and\nCatholic hospitals which follow the teachings of the Pope are practicing\nsectarian medicine. If I am right that they are, then they are infringing the\nAmerican Medical Association's canons of ethics, which prohibit the practice of\nsectarian medicine: \"In order that a physician may best serve his patients he is expected to exalt\nthe standards of his profession and to extend its sphere of usefulness.\" \"To the same end, he should not base his practice on an exclusive dogma, or a\nsectarian system, 'for sects are implacable despots: to accept their thralldom\nis to take away all liberty from one's action and thought.' A sectarian or\ncultist as applied to medicine is one who alleges to follow or in his practice\nfollows a dogma, tenet, or principle based on the authority of its promulgator\nto the exclusion of demonstration and scientific experience.\" Richard Cardinal Cushing said some time ago with reference to birth control:\n\"Catholics do not need the support of civil law to be faithful to their own\nreligious convictions and they do not seek to impose by law their moral views\non other members of society.\" Perhaps it is because of their awareness of the\nimpossible legal position the present stand of the Pope forces on Catholics who\nare lawmakers, law interpreters, or law enforcers, that such leading Catholic\nlegal scholars as Father Robert Drinan, dean of Boston College Law School, have\ncalled for total repeal, rather than amendment, of the abortion laws of all\nstates. They claim that since to Catholics all abortions are unacceptable, the\nstate should keep hands off the subject rather than decreeing that some\nabortions are legal and some not. Catholics should, of course, be allowed to\nfollow their own convictions in this area, but so surely should the rest of\nus. To the extent also that doctor and hospital adherents to the Pope's Encyclical\nare the recipients of public funds, they may be afoul of our First Amendment\nguarantees of religious freedom and anti-establishment of any church. And\nfinally, if for sectarian reasons they withhold a procedure which in any given\nsituation would be regarded as the proper medical response to the problem\npresented, they may be guilty of civil and criminal malpractice unless they at\nleast explain to the patient their sectarian reasons for withholding the\ntreatment so that the patient can go elsewhere if she chooses. It would seem that abortion-law reform--and better, repeal--is an idea whose\ntime has come. It is more than time that it be supported by all those who want\nto slow down our population growth rate without resorting to coercion or\ncompulsion. As Secretary-General U Thant and many of the UN agencies have\nrepeatedly said, \"The opportunity to decide the number and spacing of children\nis a basic human right.\" Until such time as we have a perfect contraceptive\nuniversally available and invariably used, voluntary abortion should be\ninfinitely preferred to compulsory sterilization or compulsory birth control,\nand that may well be the choice. Copyright © 1969 by Harriet Pilpel.  All rights reserved.\n\nI do not recommend abortion as a birth-control method of choice. I merely state\nthat it is in fact the most important single method of birth control in the\nworld today, and to cut down on population growth we should make abortion easy\nand safe while we continue to develop other and more satisfactory methods of\nfamily limitation. In addition to the 5 million women in the United States\nwithout access to birth control for whom abortion would seem a matter of right\nwhen they want it, there are the uncounted thousands who after conception\nsuffer some disease (like German measles) or discover some defect which makes\nthe birth of a live and healthy baby unlikely, and the many, too, whose\ncontraceptive methods occasionally don't work. As the New York chapter of the\nNational Organization for Women notes in a pamphlet: \"There is no perfect contraceptive. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration\nreports that the intrauterine devices, one of the most effective contraceptives\navailable today, have a failure rate of 1.5 to 3%. This means that if all\nmarried women in the United States could and did use these contraceptives,\nthere would still be about 350,000 to 700,000 unwanted pregnancies a year among\nmarried women alone. Even sterilization is not a 100% effective method of\ncontraception; some operations fail. Therefore, in order to insure a complete\nand thorough birth control program, abortion must be made available as a legal\nright to all women who request it.\" Starting in the mid-1960s, some erosion of the anti-abortion laws began to take\nplace. But these efforts have not been supported by many of the more vocal\ngroups who are trying to do something about excess population growth; to them,\ncompulsory birth control and compulsory sterilization are apparently more\npalatable than voluntary abortion. The result is legal chaos--which has been the situation with reference to\nabortion since it was first made illegal in this country. Contrary to popular\nbelief, the legal strictures against abortion are of comparatively recent\norigin. Until the early nineteenth century--at common law both in England and\nin the United States--abortion before quickening was not illegal at all. It\nbecame so only in the early 1800s. And according to Professor Cyril Means and\nothers who have studied the problem, the reason for the enactment of the laws\nwas not protection of morals or of the \"soul\" of the fetus, but rather a\nreflection of the fact that at the time all surgical procedures were highly\nrisky because of the probability of infection (this was before Lister).\nAbortions were made illegal for this reason except where they were necessary to\nsave the life of the mother; that is, where the great risk of infection which\nevery operation involved was outweighed by the risk of carrying that particular\npregnancy to term. The situation is today reversed; abortion under modern\nhospital conditions is safer than childbirth. Nor is there any evidence that abortion involves psychological health hazards.\nA poll of the American Psychiatric Association in the mid-1960s revealed\noverwhelming support for more easily available abortions and a conviction that\nadverse psychological sequelae from abortion are negligible both on an absolute\nstandard and as compared with such sequelae from childbirth and unwanted\nchildren. Though the population experts have not yet aligned themselves on the side of\nabortion-law reform, something is beginning to happen. Seven states--Arkansas,\nCalifornia, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, New Mexico, and North Carolina--have\namended their laws to permit abortion not only to save life but also to protect\nthe health, mental and physical, of the mother, in cases of rape and incest,\nand to avert the birth of defective offspring (Governor Reagan forced the\nomission of this ground in the California law). Many other states have been and\nare now considering abortion reform or repeal bills but usually without the\nsupport of the powerful groups who are backing other forms of population\ncontrol. The old laws are also beginning to face challenges in the courts and\nare being attacked on a variety of constitutional grounds. Who gets help? The relevant statistics have been widely circulated: for example, of\ntherapeutic--that is, in-hospital--abortions in New York City in the early\nsixties, the majority of them for \"psychiatric\" reasons, 93 percent were\nperformed on white patients, 91 percent in private rooms. The ratio of\nin-hospital abortions to live births in New York City was approximately one to\n360 for private patients and something like one to 10,000 in municipal\nhospitals. At the same time the women whose deaths were associated with\nabortion in New York City in a typical year were 56 percent black, 23 percent\nPuerto Rican, and 21 percent white. The 8000 to 10,000 in-hospital abortions contrast, of course, with the\nestimated one million performed outside hospitals annually. Probably not much\nmore than one half of these are performed by doctors; the rest by the \"kindly\nneighbor,\" the \"close friend,\" or the woman herself. Generally speaking, the\nlaws do not distinguish in their prohibitions of abortions between doctors and\nnondoctors. Moreover, the out-of-hospital abortions performed by doctors are\nobtained by the same group which accounts for the bulk of the in-hospital\nabortions: the middle- and upper-income white woman who can afford the hundreds\nor thousands charged for expert medical service outside the law. And these are\nthe same women who can afford to go to Japan, Sweden, England, or one of the\nIron Curtain countries where abortions are legal and where they typically cost\nsomething between $10 and $25. But most of the old laws on abortion remain unchanged on the statute books. In\na few states, like Connecticut or Missouri, the law says that the abortion may\nbe performed to save the life of the child as well as that of the mother,\nalthough no one is sure what this means. As a matter of fact, no one knows what\nthe laws which permit abortion to save the life of the mother mean. Courts in a\nnumber of states have held that the danger to life need not be either\n\"imminent\" or \"certain.\" But how \"imminent\" or \"certain\"? Is it enough that the\npregnancy if it comes to term will seriously damage the mother's health? Or\nwill result in the birth of defective offspring? Clearly, a number of doctors think the answer to these questions is yes, since\nabortions, especially on white women with good incomes, are routinely and\nopenly performed in some hospitals in most states and the prosecuting\nauthorities do nothing about it. Criminal laws like these, the meaning of which\npeople must guess at, are open to constitutional attack on this ground, as the\nUnited States Supreme Court has often held with respect to other \"vague\"\nprohibitions. There are many other grounds of constitutional challenge as well:\nthe rights of women, rich and poor, black and white, to equal protection of the\nlaw--that is, to get proper medical treatment without discrimination on the\ngrounds of race, color, or income; the rights of physicians to do their\nprofessional duty in the light of what is known and believed by medical science\ntoday; the right of privacy declared by the United States Supreme Court in the\nConnecticut birth-control case where Sir Justice Goldberg in his concurring\nopinion stated that compulsory pro- or anti-birth-control laws are equally\n\"totalitarian\" and unconstitutional; the right to be free of \"cruel and unusual\npunishment\"; and others. Also it may well be that some courts faced with the\nunconscionable dilemma posed by the abortion laws and unwilling to resort to\nconstitutional grounds, will \"interpret\" the laws out of existence eventually,\nas has happened to the federal birth-control laws. Absolutely excluded So why do the abortion laws stay on the books? One reason is the apparent\ninability or unwillingness of those who advocate population limitation to see\nthe connection. (This does not apply to Planned Parenthood-World Population,\nwhich in November, 1968, passed resolutions calling for repeal of the abortion\nlaws in support of its declared policy of voluntary parenthood.) By 1968, almost all the major religious groups in the United States except the\nRoman Catholic Church were on record in favor of abortion-law reform or repeal.\nThe American Baptist Convention and the Universalist/Unitarian Church came out\nfor total repeal. And public opinion polls demonstrated that a majority of\npeople, including a majority of the Catholics asked about the issue, favored at\nleast some liberalization of the laws. But the opposition of the Catholic\nChurch is potent and well organized. The Church holds that the fetus is\n\"ensouled\" at conception.

At the same time the women whose deaths were associated with\nabortion in New York City in a typical year were 56 percent black, 23 percent\nPuerto Rican, and 21 percent white. The 8000 to 10,000 in-hospital abortions contrast, of course, with the\nestimated one million performed outside hospitals annually. Probably not much\nmore than one half of these are performed by doctors; the rest by the \"kindly\nneighbor,\" the \"close friend,\" or the woman herself. Generally speaking, the\nlaws do not distinguish in their prohibitions of abortions between doctors and\nnondoctors. Moreover, the out-of-hospital abortions performed by doctors are\nobtained by the same group which accounts for the bulk of the in-hospital\nabortions: the middle- and upper-income white woman who can afford the hundreds\nor thousands charged for expert medical service outside the law. And these are\nthe same women who can afford to go to Japan, Sweden, England, or one of the\nIron Curtain countries where abortions are legal and where they typically cost\nsomething between $10 and $25. But most of the old laws on abortion remain unchanged on the statute books. In\na few states, like Connecticut or Missouri, the law says that the abortion may\nbe performed to save the life of the child as well as that of the mother,\nalthough no one is sure what this means. As a matter of fact, no one knows what\nthe laws which permit abortion to save the life of the mother mean. Courts in a\nnumber of states have held that the danger to life need not be either\n\"imminent\" or \"certain.\" But how \"imminent\" or \"certain\"? Is it enough that the\npregnancy if it comes to term will seriously damage the mother's health? Or\nwill result in the birth of defective offspring? Clearly, a number of doctors think the answer to these questions is yes, since\nabortions, especially on white women with good incomes, are routinely and\nopenly performed in some hospitals in most states and the prosecuting\nauthorities do nothing about it. Criminal laws like these, the meaning of which\npeople must guess at, are open to constitutional attack on this ground, as the\nUnited States Supreme Court has often held with respect to other \"vague\"\nprohibitions. There are many other grounds of constitutional challenge as well:\nthe rights of women, rich and poor, black and white, to equal protection of the\nlaw--that is, to get proper medical treatment without discrimination on the\ngrounds of race, color, or income; the rights of physicians to do their\nprofessional duty in the light of what is known and believed by medical science\ntoday; the right of privacy declared by the United States Supreme Court in the\nConnecticut birth-control case where Sir Justice Goldberg in his concurring\nopinion stated that compulsory pro- or anti-birth-control laws are equally\n\"totalitarian\" and unconstitutional; the right to be free of \"cruel and unusual\npunishment\"; and others. Also it may well be that some courts faced with the\nunconscionable dilemma posed by the abortion laws and unwilling to resort to\nconstitutional grounds, will \"interpret\" the laws out of existence eventually,\nas has happened to the federal birth-control laws. Absolutely excluded So why do the abortion laws stay on the books? One reason is the apparent\ninability or unwillingness of those who advocate population limitation to see\nthe connection. (This does not apply to Planned Parenthood-World Population,\nwhich in November, 1968, passed resolutions calling for repeal of the abortion\nlaws in support of its declared policy of voluntary parenthood.) By 1968, almost all the major religious groups in the United States except the\nRoman Catholic Church were on record in favor of abortion-law reform or repeal.\nThe American Baptist Convention and the Universalist/Unitarian Church came out\nfor total repeal. And public opinion polls demonstrated that a majority of\npeople, including a majority of the Catholics asked about the issue, favored at\nleast some liberalization of the laws. But the opposition of the Catholic\nChurch is potent and well organized. The Church holds that the fetus is\n\"ensouled\" at conception. In his encyclical Humanae Vitae in July of 1968, Pope\nPaul said, \"We must once again declare that the direct interruption of the\ngenerative process already begun and above all, directly willed and procured\nabortion, even if for therapeutic reasons, are to be absolutely excluded as\nlicit means of regulating birth.\" To this unequivocal statement--which is, of course, not the law in any American\nstate, since all states permit abortion at least to save the life of the\nmother--the Pope adds an \"Appeal to Public Authorities.\" He says, \"To Rulers,\nwho are those principally responsible for the common good, and who can do so\nmuch to safeguard moral customs, we say: Do not allow the morality of your\npeople to be degraded; do not permit that by legal means practices contrary to\nthe natural and divine law be introduced into that fundamental cell, the\nFamily....May all responsible public authorities--as some are already doing so\nlaudably--generously revive their efforts.\" I submit that insofar as this is an\nappeal to Catholic officials in this country, it must clearly be disregarded,\nbecause it is inconsistent with the laws of the land. By issuing such an \"Appeal to Public Authorities,\" the Pope has placed in a\nvery difficult position those Catholics who occupy public positions in this or\nin any country where separation of church and state is constitutionally or\notherwise basically guaranteed. They must choose, for example, when it comes to\nabortion for the therapeutic reason even of saving the life of the woman\nbetween their obligations to their church and their obligations to their state.\nThis leads to the question whether as a matter of law Catholic doctors and\nCatholic hospitals which follow the teachings of the Pope are practicing\nsectarian medicine. If I am right that they are, then they are infringing the\nAmerican Medical Association's canons of ethics, which prohibit the practice of\nsectarian medicine: \"In order that a physician may best serve his patients he is expected to exalt\nthe standards of his profession and to extend its sphere of usefulness.\" \"To the same end, he should not base his practice on an exclusive dogma, or a\nsectarian system, 'for sects are implacable despots: to accept their thralldom\nis to take away all liberty from one's action and thought.' A sectarian or\ncultist as applied to medicine is one who alleges to follow or in his practice\nfollows a dogma, tenet, or principle based on the authority of its promulgator\nto the exclusion of demonstration and scientific experience.\" Richard Cardinal Cushing said some time ago with reference to birth control:\n\"Catholics do not need the support of civil law to be faithful to their own\nreligious convictions and they do not seek to impose by law their moral views\non other members of society.\" Perhaps it is because of their awareness of the\nimpossible legal position the present stand of the Pope forces on Catholics who\nare lawmakers, law interpreters, or law enforcers, that such leading Catholic\nlegal scholars as Father Robert Drinan, dean of Boston College Law School, have\ncalled for total repeal, rather than amendment, of the abortion laws of all\nstates. They claim that since to Catholics all abortions are unacceptable, the\nstate should keep hands off the subject rather than decreeing that some\nabortions are legal and some not. Catholics should, of course, be allowed to\nfollow their own convictions in this area, but so surely should the rest of\nus. To the extent also that doctor and hospital adherents to the Pope's Encyclical\nare the recipients of public funds, they may be afoul of our First Amendment\nguarantees of religious freedom and anti-establishment of any church. And\nfinally, if for sectarian reasons they withhold a procedure which in any given\nsituation would be regarded as the proper medical response to the problem\npresented, they may be guilty of civil and criminal malpractice unless they at\nleast explain to the patient their sectarian reasons for withholding the\ntreatment so that the patient can go elsewhere if she chooses. It would seem that abortion-law reform--and better, repeal--is an idea whose\ntime has come. It is more than time that it be supported by all those who want\nto slow down our population growth rate without resorting to coercion or\ncompulsion. As Secretary-General U Thant and many of the UN agencies have\nrepeatedly said, \"The opportunity to decide the number and spacing of children\nis a basic human right.\" Until such time as we have a perfect contraceptive\nuniversally available and invariably used, voluntary abortion should be\ninfinitely preferred to compulsory sterilization or compulsory birth control,\nand that may well be the choice.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration\nreports that the intrauterine devices, one of the most effective contraceptives\navailable today, have a failure rate of 1.5 to 3%. This means that if all\nmarried women in the United States could and did use these contraceptives,\nthere would still be about 350,000 to 700,000 unwanted pregnancies a year among\nmarried women alone. Even sterilization is not a 100% effective method of\ncontraception; some operations fail. Therefore, in order to insure a complete\nand thorough birth control program, abortion must be made available as a legal\nright to all women who request it.\" Starting in the mid-1960s, some erosion of the anti-abortion laws began to take\nplace. But these efforts have not been supported by many of the more vocal\ngroups who are trying to do something about excess population growth; to them,\ncompulsory birth control and compulsory sterilization are apparently more\npalatable than voluntary abortion. The result is legal chaos--which has been the situation with reference to\nabortion since it was first made illegal in this country. Contrary to popular\nbelief, the legal strictures against abortion are of comparatively recent\norigin. Until the early nineteenth century--at common law both in England and\nin the United States--abortion before quickening was not illegal at all. It\nbecame so only in the early 1800s. And according to Professor Cyril Means and\nothers who have studied the problem, the reason for the enactment of the laws\nwas not protection of morals or of the \"soul\" of the fetus, but rather a\nreflection of the fact that at the time all surgical procedures were highly\nrisky because of the probability of infection (this was before Lister).\nAbortions were made illegal for this reason except where they were necessary to\nsave the life of the mother; that is, where the great risk of infection which\nevery operation involved was outweighed by the risk of carrying that particular\npregnancy to term. The situation is today reversed; abortion under modern\nhospital conditions is safer than childbirth. Nor is there any evidence that abortion involves psychological health hazards.\nA poll of the American Psychiatric Association in the mid-1960s revealed\noverwhelming support for more easily available abortions and a conviction that\nadverse psychological sequelae from abortion are negligible both on an absolute\nstandard and as compared with such sequelae from childbirth and unwanted\nchildren. Though the population experts have not yet aligned themselves on the side of\nabortion-law reform, something is beginning to happen. Seven states--Arkansas,\nCalifornia, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, New Mexico, and North Carolina--have\namended their laws to permit abortion not only to save life but also to protect\nthe health, mental and physical, of the mother, in cases of rape and incest,\nand to avert the birth of defective offspring (Governor Reagan forced the\nomission of this ground in the California law). Many other states have been and\nare now considering abortion reform or repeal bills but usually without the\nsupport of the powerful groups who are backing other forms of population\ncontrol. The old laws are also beginning to face challenges in the courts and\nare being attacked on a variety of constitutional grounds. Who gets help?

And according to Professor Cyril Means and\nothers who have studied the problem, the reason for the enactment of the laws\nwas not protection of morals or of the \"soul\" of the fetus, but rather a\nreflection of the fact that at the time all surgical procedures were highly\nrisky because of the probability of infection (this was before Lister).\nAbortions were made illegal for this reason except where they were necessary to\nsave the life of the mother; that is, where the great risk of infection which\nevery operation involved was outweighed by the risk of carrying that particular\npregnancy to term. The situation is today reversed; abortion under modern\nhospital conditions is safer than childbirth. Nor is there any evidence that abortion involves psychological health hazards.\nA poll of the American Psychiatric Association in the mid-1960s revealed\noverwhelming support for more easily available abortions and a conviction that\nadverse psychological sequelae from abortion are negligible both on an absolute\nstandard and as compared with such sequelae from childbirth and unwanted\nchildren. Though the population experts have not yet aligned themselves on the side of\nabortion-law reform, something is beginning to happen. Seven states--Arkansas,\nCalifornia, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, New Mexico, and North Carolina--have\namended their laws to permit abortion not only to save life but also to protect\nthe health, mental and physical, of the mother, in cases of rape and incest,\nand to avert the birth of defective offspring (Governor Reagan forced the\nomission of this ground in the California law). Many other states have been and\nare now considering abortion reform or repeal bills but usually without the\nsupport of the powerful groups who are backing other forms of population\ncontrol. The old laws are also beginning to face challenges in the courts and\nare being attacked on a variety of constitutional grounds. Who gets help? The relevant statistics have been widely circulated: for example, of\ntherapeutic--that is, in-hospital--abortions in New York City in the early\nsixties, the majority of them for \"psychiatric\" reasons, 93 percent were\nperformed on white patients, 91 percent in private rooms. The ratio of\nin-hospital abortions to live births in New York City was approximately one to\n360 for private patients and something like one to 10,000 in municipal\nhospitals. At the same time the women whose deaths were associated with\nabortion in New York City in a typical year were 56 percent black, 23 percent\nPuerto Rican, and 21 percent white. The 8000 to 10,000 in-hospital abortions contrast, of course, with the\nestimated one million performed outside hospitals annually. Probably not much\nmore than one half of these are performed by doctors; the rest by the \"kindly\nneighbor,\" the \"close friend,\" or the woman herself. Generally speaking, the\nlaws do not distinguish in their prohibitions of abortions between doctors and\nnondoctors. Moreover, the out-of-hospital abortions performed by doctors are\nobtained by the same group which accounts for the bulk of the in-hospital\nabortions: the middle- and upper-income white woman who can afford the hundreds\nor thousands charged for expert medical service outside the law. And these are\nthe same women who can afford to go to Japan, Sweden, England, or one of the\nIron Curtain countries where abortions are legal and where they typically cost\nsomething between $10 and $25. But most of the old laws on abortion remain unchanged on the statute books. In\na few states, like Connecticut or Missouri, the law says that the abortion may\nbe performed to save the life of the child as well as that of the mother,\nalthough no one is sure what this means. As a matter of fact, no one knows what\nthe laws which permit abortion to save the life of the mother mean. Courts in a\nnumber of states have held that the danger to life need not be either\n\"imminent\" or \"certain.\" But how \"imminent\" or \"certain\"? Is it enough that the\npregnancy if it comes to term will seriously damage the mother's health? Or\nwill result in the birth of defective offspring? Clearly, a number of doctors think the answer to these questions is yes, since\nabortions, especially on white women with good incomes, are routinely and\nopenly performed in some hospitals in most states and the prosecuting\nauthorities do nothing about it. Criminal laws like these, the meaning of which\npeople must guess at, are open to constitutional attack on this ground, as the\nUnited States Supreme Court has often held with respect to other \"vague\"\nprohibitions. There are many other grounds of constitutional challenge as well:\nthe rights of women, rich and poor, black and white, to equal protection of the\nlaw--that is, to get proper medical treatment without discrimination on the\ngrounds of race, color, or income; the rights of physicians to do their\nprofessional duty in the light of what is known and believed by medical science\ntoday; the right of privacy declared by the United States Supreme Court in the\nConnecticut birth-control case where Sir Justice Goldberg in his concurring\nopinion stated that compulsory pro- or anti-birth-control laws are equally\n\"totalitarian\" and unconstitutional; the right to be free of \"cruel and unusual\npunishment\"; and others. Also it may well be that some courts faced with the\nunconscionable dilemma posed by the abortion laws and unwilling to resort to\nconstitutional grounds, will \"interpret\" the laws out of existence eventually,\nas has happened to the federal birth-control laws. Absolutely excluded So why do the abortion laws stay on the books? One reason is the apparent\ninability or unwillingness of those who advocate population limitation to see\nthe connection. (This does not apply to Planned Parenthood-World Population,\nwhich in November, 1968, passed resolutions calling for repeal of the abortion\nlaws in support of its declared policy of voluntary parenthood.) By 1968, almost all the major religious groups in the United States except the\nRoman Catholic Church were on record in favor of abortion-law reform or repeal.\nThe American Baptist Convention and the Universalist/Unitarian Church came out\nfor total repeal. And public opinion polls demonstrated that a majority of\npeople, including a majority of the Catholics asked about the issue, favored at\nleast some liberalization of the laws. But the opposition of the Catholic\nChurch is potent and well organized. The Church holds that the fetus is\n\"ensouled\" at conception. In his encyclical Humanae Vitae in July of 1968, Pope\nPaul said, \"We must once again declare that the direct interruption of the\ngenerative process already begun and above all, directly willed and procured\nabortion, even if for therapeutic reasons, are to be absolutely excluded as\nlicit means of regulating birth.\" To this unequivocal statement--which is, of course, not the law in any American\nstate, since all states permit abortion at least to save the life of the\nmother--the Pope adds an \"Appeal to Public Authorities.\" He says, \"To Rulers,\nwho are those principally responsible for the common good, and who can do so\nmuch to safeguard moral customs, we say: Do not allow the morality of your\npeople to be degraded; do not permit that by legal means practices contrary to\nthe natural and divine law be introduced into that fundamental cell, the\nFamily....May all responsible public authorities--as some are already doing so\nlaudably--generously revive their efforts.\" I submit that insofar as this is an\nappeal to Catholic officials in this country, it must clearly be disregarded,\nbecause it is inconsistent with the laws of the land. By issuing such an \"Appeal to Public Authorities,\" the Pope has placed in a\nvery difficult position those Catholics who occupy public positions in this or\nin any country where separation of church and state is constitutionally or\notherwise basically guaranteed. They must choose, for example, when it comes to\nabortion for the therapeutic reason even of saving the life of the woman\nbetween their obligations to their church and their obligations to their state.\nThis leads to the question whether as a matter of law Catholic doctors and\nCatholic hospitals which follow the teachings of the Pope are practicing\nsectarian medicine. If I am right that they are, then they are infringing the\nAmerican Medical Association's canons of ethics, which prohibit the practice of\nsectarian medicine: \"In order that a physician may best serve his patients he is expected to exalt\nthe standards of his profession and to extend its sphere of usefulness.\" \"To the same end, he should not base his practice on an exclusive dogma, or a\nsectarian system, 'for sects are implacable despots: to accept their thralldom\nis to take away all liberty from one's action and thought.' A sectarian or\ncultist as applied to medicine is one who alleges to follow or in his practice\nfollows a dogma, tenet, or principle based on the authority of its promulgator\nto the exclusion of demonstration and scientific experience.\" Richard Cardinal Cushing said some time ago with reference to birth control:\n\"Catholics do not need the support of civil law to be faithful to their own\nreligious convictions and they do not seek to impose by law their moral views\non other members of society.\" Perhaps it is because of their awareness of the\nimpossible legal position the present stand of the Pope forces on Catholics who\nare lawmakers, law interpreters, or law enforcers, that such leading Catholic\nlegal scholars as Father Robert Drinan, dean of Boston College Law School, have\ncalled for total repeal, rather than amendment, of the abortion laws of all\nstates. They claim that since to Catholics all abortions are unacceptable, the\nstate should keep hands off the subject rather than decreeing that some\nabortions are legal and some not. Catholics should, of course, be allowed to\nfollow their own convictions in this area, but so surely should the rest of\nus. To the extent also that doctor and hospital adherents to the Pope's Encyclical\nare the recipients of public funds, they may be afoul of our First Amendment\nguarantees of religious freedom and anti-establishment of any church. And\nfinally, if for sectarian reasons they withhold a procedure which in any given\nsituation would be regarded as the proper medical response to the problem\npresented, they may be guilty of civil and criminal malpractice unless they at\nleast explain to the patient their sectarian reasons for withholding the\ntreatment so that the patient can go elsewhere if she chooses. It would seem that abortion-law reform--and better, repeal--is an idea whose\ntime has come. It is more than time that it be supported by all those who want\nto slow down our population growth rate without resorting to coercion or\ncompulsion. As Secretary-General U Thant and many of the UN agencies have\nrepeatedly said, \"The opportunity to decide the number and spacing of children\nis a basic human right.\" Until such time as we have a perfect contraceptive\nuniversally available and invariably used, voluntary abortion should be\ninfinitely preferred to compulsory sterilization or compulsory birth control,\nand that may well be the choice.

Until the early nineteenth century--at common law both in England and\nin the United States--abortion before quickening was not illegal at all. It\nbecame so only in the early 1800s. And according to Professor Cyril Means and\nothers who have studied the problem, the reason for the enactment of the laws\nwas not protection of morals or of the \"soul\" of the fetus, but rather a\nreflection of the fact that at the time all surgical procedures were highly\nrisky because of the probability of infection (this was before Lister).\nAbortions were made illegal for this reason except where they were necessary to\nsave the life of the mother; that is, where the great risk of infection which\nevery operation involved was outweighed by the risk of carrying that particular\npregnancy to term. The situation is today reversed; abortion under modern\nhospital conditions is safer than childbirth. Nor is there any evidence that abortion involves psychological health hazards.\nA poll of the American Psychiatric Association in the mid-1960s revealed\noverwhelming support for more easily available abortions and a conviction that\nadverse psychological sequelae from abortion are negligible both on an absolute\nstandard and as compared with such sequelae from childbirth and unwanted\nchildren. Though the population experts have not yet aligned themselves on the side of\nabortion-law reform, something is beginning to happen. Seven states--Arkansas,\nCalifornia, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, New Mexico, and North Carolina--have\namended their laws to permit abortion not only to save life but also to protect\nthe health, mental and physical, of the mother, in cases of rape and incest,\nand to avert the birth of defective offspring (Governor Reagan forced the\nomission of this ground in the California law). Many other states have been and\nare now considering abortion reform or repeal bills but usually without the\nsupport of the powerful groups who are backing other forms of population\ncontrol. The old laws are also beginning to face challenges in the courts and\nare being attacked on a variety of constitutional grounds. Who gets help? The relevant statistics have been widely circulated: for example, of\ntherapeutic--that is, in-hospital--abortions in New York City in the early\nsixties, the majority of them for \"psychiatric\" reasons, 93 percent were\nperformed on white patients, 91 percent in private rooms. The ratio of\nin-hospital abortions to live births in New York City was approximately one to\n360 for private patients and something like one to 10,000 in municipal\nhospitals. At the same time the women whose deaths were associated with\nabortion in New York City in a typical year were 56 percent black, 23 percent\nPuerto Rican, and 21 percent white. The 8000 to 10,000 in-hospital abortions contrast, of course, with the\nestimated one million performed outside hospitals annually. Probably not much\nmore than one half of these are performed by doctors; the rest by the \"kindly\nneighbor,\" the \"close friend,\" or the woman herself. Generally speaking, the\nlaws do not distinguish in their prohibitions of abortions between doctors and\nnondoctors. Moreover, the out-of-hospital abortions performed by doctors are\nobtained by the same group which accounts for the bulk of the in-hospital\nabortions: the middle- and upper-income white woman who can afford the hundreds\nor thousands charged for expert medical service outside the law. And these are\nthe same women who can afford to go to Japan, Sweden, England, or one of the\nIron Curtain countries where abortions are legal and where they typically cost\nsomething between $10 and $25. But most of the old laws on abortion remain unchanged on the statute books. In\na few states, like Connecticut or Missouri, the law says that the abortion may\nbe performed to save the life of the child as well as that of the mother,\nalthough no one is sure what this means. As a matter of fact, no one knows what\nthe laws which permit abortion to save the life of the mother mean. Courts in a\nnumber of states have held that the danger to life need not be either\n\"imminent\" or \"certain.\" But how \"imminent\" or \"certain\"? Is it enough that the\npregnancy if it comes to term will seriously damage the mother's health? Or\nwill result in the birth of defective offspring? Clearly, a number of doctors think the answer to these questions is yes, since\nabortions, especially on white women with good incomes, are routinely and\nopenly performed in some hospitals in most states and the prosecuting\nauthorities do nothing about it. Criminal laws like these, the meaning of which\npeople must guess at, are open to constitutional attack on this ground, as the\nUnited States Supreme Court has often held with respect to other \"vague\"\nprohibitions. There are many other grounds of constitutional challenge as well:\nthe rights of women, rich and poor, black and white, to equal protection of the\nlaw--that is, to get proper medical treatment without discrimination on the\ngrounds of race, color, or income; the rights of physicians to do their\nprofessional duty in the light of what is known and believed by medical science\ntoday; the right of privacy declared by the United States Supreme Court in the\nConnecticut birth-control case where Sir Justice Goldberg in his concurring\nopinion stated that compulsory pro- or anti-birth-control laws are equally\n\"totalitarian\" and unconstitutional; the right to be free of \"cruel and unusual\npunishment\"; and others. Also it may well be that some courts faced with the\nunconscionable dilemma posed by the abortion laws and unwilling to resort to\nconstitutional grounds, will \"interpret\" the laws out of existence eventually,\nas has happened to the federal birth-control laws. Absolutely excluded So why do the abortion laws stay on the books? One reason is the apparent\ninability or unwillingness of those who advocate population limitation to see\nthe connection. (This does not apply to Planned Parenthood-World Population,\nwhich in November, 1968, passed resolutions calling for repeal of the abortion\nlaws in support of its declared policy of voluntary parenthood.) By 1968, almost all the major religious groups in the United States except the\nRoman Catholic Church were on record in favor of abortion-law reform or repeal.\nThe American Baptist Convention and the Universalist/Unitarian Church came out\nfor total repeal. And public opinion polls demonstrated that a majority of\npeople, including a majority of the Catholics asked about the issue, favored at\nleast some liberalization of the laws. But the opposition of the Catholic\nChurch is potent and well organized. The Church holds that the fetus is\n\"ensouled\" at conception. In his encyclical Humanae Vitae in July of 1968, Pope\nPaul said, \"We must once again declare that the direct interruption of the\ngenerative process already begun and above all, directly willed and procured\nabortion, even if for therapeutic reasons, are to be absolutely excluded as\nlicit means of regulating birth.\" To this unequivocal statement--which is, of course, not the law in any American\nstate, since all states permit abortion at least to save the life of the\nmother--the Pope adds an \"Appeal to Public Authorities.\" He says, \"To Rulers,\nwho are those principally responsible for the common good, and who can do so\nmuch to safeguard moral customs, we say: Do not allow the morality of your\npeople to be degraded; do not permit that by legal means practices contrary to\nthe natural and divine law be introduced into that fundamental cell, the\nFamily....May all responsible public authorities--as some are already doing so\nlaudably--generously revive their efforts.\" I submit that insofar as this is an\nappeal to Catholic officials in this country, it must clearly be disregarded,\nbecause it is inconsistent with the laws of the land. By issuing such an \"Appeal to Public Authorities,\" the Pope has placed in a\nvery difficult position those Catholics who occupy public positions in this or\nin any country where separation of church and state is constitutionally or\notherwise basically guaranteed. They must choose, for example, when it comes to\nabortion for the therapeutic reason even of saving the life of the woman\nbetween their obligations to their church and their obligations to their state.\nThis leads to the question whether as a matter of law Catholic doctors and\nCatholic hospitals which follow the teachings of the Pope are practicing\nsectarian medicine. If I am right that they are, then they are infringing the\nAmerican Medical Association's canons of ethics, which prohibit the practice of\nsectarian medicine: \"In order that a physician may best serve his patients he is expected to exalt\nthe standards of his profession and to extend its sphere of usefulness.\" \"To the same end, he should not base his practice on an exclusive dogma, or a\nsectarian system, 'for sects are implacable despots: to accept their thralldom\nis to take away all liberty from one's action and thought.' A sectarian or\ncultist as applied to medicine is one who alleges to follow or in his practice\nfollows a dogma, tenet, or principle based on the authority of its promulgator\nto the exclusion of demonstration and scientific experience.\" Richard Cardinal Cushing said some time ago with reference to birth control:\n\"Catholics do not need the support of civil law to be faithful to their own\nreligious convictions and they do not seek to impose by law their moral views\non other members of society.\" Perhaps it is because of their awareness of the\nimpossible legal position the present stand of the Pope forces on Catholics who\nare lawmakers, law interpreters, or law enforcers, that such leading Catholic\nlegal scholars as Father Robert Drinan, dean of Boston College Law School, have\ncalled for total repeal, rather than amendment, of the abortion laws of all\nstates. They claim that since to Catholics all abortions are unacceptable, the\nstate should keep hands off the subject rather than decreeing that some\nabortions are legal and some not. Catholics should, of course, be allowed to\nfollow their own convictions in this area, but so surely should the rest of\nus. To the extent also that doctor and hospital adherents to the Pope's Encyclical\nare the recipients of public funds, they may be afoul of our First Amendment\nguarantees of religious freedom and anti-establishment of any church. And\nfinally, if for sectarian reasons they withhold a procedure which in any given\nsituation would be regarded as the proper medical response to the problem\npresented, they may be guilty of civil and criminal malpractice unless they at\nleast explain to the patient their sectarian reasons for withholding the\ntreatment so that the patient can go elsewhere if she chooses. It would seem that abortion-law reform--and better, repeal--is an idea whose\ntime has come. It is more than time that it be supported by all those who want\nto slow down our population growth rate without resorting to coercion or\ncompulsion. As Secretary-General U Thant and many of the UN agencies have\nrepeatedly said, \"The opportunity to decide the number and spacing of children\nis a basic human right.\" Until such time as we have a perfect contraceptive\nuniversally available and invariably used, voluntary abortion should be\ninfinitely preferred to compulsory sterilization or compulsory birth control,\nand that may well be the choice.

Seven states--Arkansas,\nCalifornia, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, New Mexico, and North Carolina--have\namended their laws to permit abortion not only to save life but also to protect\nthe health, mental and physical, of the mother, in cases of rape and incest,\nand to avert the birth of defective offspring (Governor Reagan forced the\nomission of this ground in the California law). Many other states have been and\nare now considering abortion reform or repeal bills but usually without the\nsupport of the powerful groups who are backing other forms of population\ncontrol. The old laws are also beginning to face challenges in the courts and\nare being attacked on a variety of constitutional grounds. Who gets help? The relevant statistics have been widely circulated: for example, of\ntherapeutic--that is, in-hospital--abortions in New York City in the early\nsixties, the majority of them for \"psychiatric\" reasons, 93 percent were\nperformed on white patients, 91 percent in private rooms. The ratio of\nin-hospital abortions to live births in New York City was approximately one to\n360 for private patients and something like one to 10,000 in municipal\nhospitals. At the same time the women whose deaths were associated with\nabortion in New York City in a typical year were 56 percent black, 23 percent\nPuerto Rican, and 21 percent white. The 8000 to 10,000 in-hospital abortions contrast, of course, with the\nestimated one million performed outside hospitals annually. Probably not much\nmore than one half of these are performed by doctors; the rest by the \"kindly\nneighbor,\" the \"close friend,\" or the woman herself. Generally speaking, the\nlaws do not distinguish in their prohibitions of abortions between doctors and\nnondoctors. Moreover, the out-of-hospital abortions performed by doctors are\nobtained by the same group which accounts for the bulk of the in-hospital\nabortions: the middle- and upper-income white woman who can afford the hundreds\nor thousands charged for expert medical service outside the law. And these are\nthe same women who can afford to go to Japan, Sweden, England, or one of the\nIron Curtain countries where abortions are legal and where they typically cost\nsomething between $10 and $25. But most of the old laws on abortion remain unchanged on the statute books. In\na few states, like Connecticut or Missouri, the law says that the abortion may\nbe performed to save the life of the child as well as that of the mother,\nalthough no one is sure what this means. As a matter of fact, no one knows what\nthe laws which permit abortion to save the life of the mother mean. Courts in a\nnumber of states have held that the danger to life need not be either\n\"imminent\" or \"certain.\" But how \"imminent\" or \"certain\"? Is it enough that the\npregnancy if it comes to term will seriously damage the mother's health? Or\nwill result in the birth of defective offspring? Clearly, a number of doctors think the answer to these questions is yes, since\nabortions, especially on white women with good incomes, are routinely and\nopenly performed in some hospitals in most states and the prosecuting\nauthorities do nothing about it. Criminal laws like these, the meaning of which\npeople must guess at, are open to constitutional attack on this ground, as the\nUnited States Supreme Court has often held with respect to other \"vague\"\nprohibitions. There are many other grounds of constitutional challenge as well:\nthe rights of women, rich and poor, black and white, to equal protection of the\nlaw--that is, to get proper medical treatment without discrimination on the\ngrounds of race, color, or income; the rights of physicians to do their\nprofessional duty in the light of what is known and believed by medical science\ntoday; the right of privacy declared by the United States Supreme Court in the\nConnecticut birth-control case where Sir Justice Goldberg in his concurring\nopinion stated that compulsory pro- or anti-birth-control laws are equally\n\"totalitarian\" and unconstitutional; the right to be free of \"cruel and unusual\npunishment\"; and others. Also it may well be that some courts faced with the\nunconscionable dilemma posed by the abortion laws and unwilling to resort to\nconstitutional grounds, will \"interpret\" the laws out of existence eventually,\nas has happened to the federal birth-control laws. Absolutely excluded So why do the abortion laws stay on the books? One reason is the apparent\ninability or unwillingness of those who advocate population limitation to see\nthe connection. (This does not apply to Planned Parenthood-World Population,\nwhich in November, 1968, passed resolutions calling for repeal of the abortion\nlaws in support of its declared policy of voluntary parenthood.) By 1968, almost all the major religious groups in the United States except the\nRoman Catholic Church were on record in favor of abortion-law reform or repeal.\nThe American Baptist Convention and the Universalist/Unitarian Church came out\nfor total repeal. And public opinion polls demonstrated that a majority of\npeople, including a majority of the Catholics asked about the issue, favored at\nleast some liberalization of the laws. But the opposition of the Catholic\nChurch is potent and well organized. The Church holds that the fetus is\n\"ensouled\" at conception. In his encyclical Humanae Vitae in July of 1968, Pope\nPaul said, \"We must once again declare that the direct interruption of the\ngenerative process already begun and above all, directly willed and procured\nabortion, even if for therapeutic reasons, are to be absolutely excluded as\nlicit means of regulating birth.\" To this unequivocal statement--which is, of course, not the law in any American\nstate, since all states permit abortion at least to save the life of the\nmother--the Pope adds an \"Appeal to Public Authorities.\" He says, \"To Rulers,\nwho are those principally responsible for the common good, and who can do so\nmuch to safeguard moral customs, we say: Do not allow the morality of your\npeople to be degraded; do not permit that by legal means practices contrary to\nthe natural and divine law be introduced into that fundamental cell, the\nFamily....May all responsible public authorities--as some are already doing so\nlaudably--generously revive their efforts.\" I submit that insofar as this is an\nappeal to Catholic officials in this country, it must clearly be disregarded,\nbecause it is inconsistent with the laws of the land. By issuing such an \"Appeal to Public Authorities,\" the Pope has placed in a\nvery difficult position those Catholics who occupy public positions in this or\nin any country where separation of church and state is constitutionally or\notherwise basically guaranteed. They must choose, for example, when it comes to\nabortion for the therapeutic reason even of saving the life of the woman\nbetween their obligations to their church and their obligations to their state.\nThis leads to the question whether as a matter of law Catholic doctors and\nCatholic hospitals which follow the teachings of the Pope are practicing\nsectarian medicine. If I am right that they are, then they are infringing the\nAmerican Medical Association's canons of ethics, which prohibit the practice of\nsectarian medicine: \"In order that a physician may best serve his patients he is expected to exalt\nthe standards of his profession and to extend its sphere of usefulness.\" \"To the same end, he should not base his practice on an exclusive dogma, or a\nsectarian system, 'for sects are implacable despots: to accept their thralldom\nis to take away all liberty from one's action and thought.' A sectarian or\ncultist as applied to medicine is one who alleges to follow or in his practice\nfollows a dogma, tenet, or principle based on the authority of its promulgator\nto the exclusion of demonstration and scientific experience.\" Richard Cardinal Cushing said some time ago with reference to birth control:\n\"Catholics do not need the support of civil law to be faithful to their own\nreligious convictions and they do not seek to impose by law their moral views\non other members of society.\" Perhaps it is because of their awareness of the\nimpossible legal position the present stand of the Pope forces on Catholics who\nare lawmakers, law interpreters, or law enforcers, that such leading Catholic\nlegal scholars as Father Robert Drinan, dean of Boston College Law School, have\ncalled for total repeal, rather than amendment, of the abortion laws of all\nstates. They claim that since to Catholics all abortions are unacceptable, the\nstate should keep hands off the subject rather than decreeing that some\nabortions are legal and some not. Catholics should, of course, be allowed to\nfollow their own convictions in this area, but so surely should the rest of\nus. To the extent also that doctor and hospital adherents to the Pope's Encyclical\nare the recipients of public funds, they may be afoul of our First Amendment\nguarantees of religious freedom and anti-establishment of any church. And\nfinally, if for sectarian reasons they withhold a procedure which in any given\nsituation would be regarded as the proper medical response to the problem\npresented, they may be guilty of civil and criminal malpractice unless they at\nleast explain to the patient their sectarian reasons for withholding the\ntreatment so that the patient can go elsewhere if she chooses. It would seem that abortion-law reform--and better, repeal--is an idea whose\ntime has come. It is more than time that it be supported by all those who want\nto slow down our population growth rate without resorting to coercion or\ncompulsion. As Secretary-General U Thant and many of the UN agencies have\nrepeatedly said, \"The opportunity to decide the number and spacing of children\nis a basic human right.\" Until such time as we have a perfect contraceptive\nuniversally available and invariably used, voluntary abortion should be\ninfinitely preferred to compulsory sterilization or compulsory birth control,\nand that may well be the choice.

There are many other grounds of constitutional challenge as well:\nthe rights of women, rich and poor, black and white, to equal protection of the\nlaw--that is, to get proper medical treatment without discrimination on the\ngrounds of race, color, or income; the rights of physicians to do their\nprofessional duty in the light of what is known and believed by medical science\ntoday; the right of privacy declared by the United States Supreme Court in the\nConnecticut birth-control case where Sir Justice Goldberg in his concurring\nopinion stated that compulsory pro- or anti-birth-control laws are equally\n\"totalitarian\" and unconstitutional; the right to be free of \"cruel and unusual\npunishment\"; and others. Also it may well be that some courts faced with the\nunconscionable dilemma posed by the abortion laws and unwilling to resort to\nconstitutional grounds, will \"interpret\" the laws out of existence eventually,\nas has happened to the federal birth-control laws. Absolutely excluded So why do the abortion laws stay on the books? One reason is the apparent\ninability or unwillingness of those who advocate population limitation to see\nthe connection. (This does not apply to Planned Parenthood-World Population,\nwhich in November, 1968, passed resolutions calling for repeal of the abortion\nlaws in support of its declared policy of voluntary parenthood.) By 1968, almost all the major religious groups in the United States except the\nRoman Catholic Church were on record in favor of abortion-law reform or repeal.\nThe American Baptist Convention and the Universalist/Unitarian Church came out\nfor total repeal. And public opinion polls demonstrated that a majority of\npeople, including a majority of the Catholics asked about the issue, favored at\nleast some liberalization of the laws. But the opposition of the Catholic\nChurch is potent and well organized. The Church holds that the fetus is\n\"ensouled\" at conception. In his encyclical Humanae Vitae in July of 1968, Pope\nPaul said, \"We must once again declare that the direct interruption of the\ngenerative process already begun and above all, directly willed and procured\nabortion, even if for therapeutic reasons, are to be absolutely excluded as\nlicit means of regulating birth.\" To this unequivocal statement--which is, of course, not the law in any American\nstate, since all states permit abortion at least to save the life of the\nmother--the Pope adds an \"Appeal to Public Authorities.\" He says, \"To Rulers,\nwho are those principally responsible for the common good, and who can do so\nmuch to safeguard moral customs, we say: Do not allow the morality of your\npeople to be degraded; do not permit that by legal means practices contrary to\nthe natural and divine law be introduced into that fundamental cell, the\nFamily....May all responsible public authorities--as some are already doing so\nlaudably--generously revive their efforts.\" I submit that insofar as this is an\nappeal to Catholic officials in this country, it must clearly be disregarded,\nbecause it is inconsistent with the laws of the land. By issuing such an \"Appeal to Public Authorities,\" the Pope has placed in a\nvery difficult position those Catholics who occupy public positions in this or\nin any country where separation of church and state is constitutionally or\notherwise basically guaranteed. They must choose, for example, when it comes to\nabortion for the therapeutic reason even of saving the life of the woman\nbetween their obligations to their church and their obligations to their state.\nThis leads to the question whether as a matter of law Catholic doctors and\nCatholic hospitals which follow the teachings of the Pope are practicing\nsectarian medicine. If I am right that they are, then they are infringing the\nAmerican Medical Association's canons of ethics, which prohibit the practice of\nsectarian medicine: \"In order that a physician may best serve his patients he is expected to exalt\nthe standards of his profession and to extend its sphere of usefulness.\" \"To the same end, he should not base his practice on an exclusive dogma, or a\nsectarian system, 'for sects are implacable despots: to accept their thralldom\nis to take away all liberty from one's action and thought.' A sectarian or\ncultist as applied to medicine is one who alleges to follow or in his practice\nfollows a dogma, tenet, or principle based on the authority of its promulgator\nto the exclusion of demonstration and scientific experience.\" Richard Cardinal Cushing said some time ago with reference to birth control:\n\"Catholics do not need the support of civil law to be faithful to their own\nreligious convictions and they do not seek to impose by law their moral views\non other members of society.\" Perhaps it is because of their awareness of the\nimpossible legal position the present stand of the Pope forces on Catholics who\nare lawmakers, law interpreters, or law enforcers, that such leading Catholic\nlegal scholars as Father Robert Drinan, dean of Boston College Law School, have\ncalled for total repeal, rather than amendment, of the abortion laws of all\nstates. They claim that since to Catholics all abortions are unacceptable, the\nstate should keep hands off the subject rather than decreeing that some\nabortions are legal and some not. Catholics should, of course, be allowed to\nfollow their own convictions in this area, but so surely should the rest of\nus. To the extent also that doctor and hospital adherents to the Pope's Encyclical\nare the recipients of public funds, they may be afoul of our First Amendment\nguarantees of religious freedom and anti-establishment of any church. And\nfinally, if for sectarian reasons they withhold a procedure which in any given\nsituation would be regarded as the proper medical response to the problem\npresented, they may be guilty of civil and criminal malpractice unless they at\nleast explain to the patient their sectarian reasons for withholding the\ntreatment so that the patient can go elsewhere if she chooses. It would seem that abortion-law reform--and better, repeal--is an idea whose\ntime has come. It is more than time that it be supported by all those who want\nto slow down our population growth rate without resorting to coercion or\ncompulsion. As Secretary-General U Thant and many of the UN agencies have\nrepeatedly said, \"The opportunity to decide the number and spacing of children\nis a basic human right.\" Until such time as we have a perfect contraceptive\nuniversally available and invariably used, voluntary abortion should be\ninfinitely preferred to compulsory sterilization or compulsory birth control,\nand that may well be the choice.

Seven states--Arkansas,\nCalifornia, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, New Mexico, and North Carolina--have\namended their laws to permit abortion not only to save life but also to protect\nthe health, mental and physical, of the mother, in cases of rape and incest,\nand to avert the birth of defective offspring (Governor Reagan forced the\nomission of this ground in the California law). Many other states have been and\nare now considering abortion reform or repeal bills but usually without the\nsupport of the powerful groups who are backing other forms of population\ncontrol. The old laws are also beginning to face challenges in the courts and\nare being attacked on a variety of constitutional grounds. Who gets help? The relevant statistics have been widely circulated: for example, of\ntherapeutic--that is, in-hospital--abortions in New York City in the early\nsixties, the majority of them for \"psychiatric\" reasons, 93 percent were\nperformed on white patients, 91 percent in private rooms. The ratio of\nin-hospital abortions to live births in New York City was approximately one to\n360 for private patients and something like one to 10,000 in municipal\nhospitals. At the same time the women whose deaths were associated with\nabortion in New York City in a typical year were 56 percent black, 23 percent\nPuerto Rican, and 21 percent white. The 8000 to 10,000 in-hospital abortions contrast, of course, with the\nestimated one million performed outside hospitals annually. Probably not much\nmore than one half of these are performed by doctors; the rest by the \"kindly\nneighbor,\" the \"close friend,\" or the woman herself. Generally speaking, the\nlaws do not distinguish in their prohibitions of abortions between doctors and\nnondoctors. Moreover, the out-of-hospital abortions performed by doctors are\nobtained by the same group which accounts for the bulk of the in-hospital\nabortions: the middle- and upper-income white woman who can afford the hundreds\nor thousands charged for expert medical service outside the law. And these are\nthe same women who can afford to go to Japan, Sweden, England, or one of the\nIron Curtain countries where abortions are legal and where they typically cost\nsomething between $10 and $25. But most of the old laws on abortion remain unchanged on the statute books. In\na few states, like Connecticut or Missouri, the law says that the abortion may\nbe performed to save the life of the child as well as that of the mother,\nalthough no one is sure what this means. As a matter of fact, no one knows what\nthe laws which permit abortion to save the life of the mother mean. Courts in a\nnumber of states have held that the danger to life need not be either\n\"imminent\" or \"certain.\" But how \"imminent\" or \"certain\"? Is it enough that the\npregnancy if it comes to term will seriously damage the mother's health? Or\nwill result in the birth of defective offspring? Clearly, a number of doctors think the answer to these questions is yes, since\nabortions, especially on white women with good incomes, are routinely and\nopenly performed in some hospitals in most states and the prosecuting\nauthorities do nothing about it.

In his encyclical Humanae Vitae in July of 1968, Pope\nPaul said, \"We must once again declare that the direct interruption of the\ngenerative process already begun and above all, directly willed and procured\nabortion, even if for therapeutic reasons, are to be absolutely excluded as\nlicit means of regulating birth.\" To this unequivocal statement--which is, of course, not the law in any American\nstate, since all states permit abortion at least to save the life of the\nmother--the Pope adds an \"Appeal to Public Authorities.\" He says, \"To Rulers,\nwho are those principally responsible for the common good, and who can do so\nmuch to safeguard moral customs, we say: Do not allow the morality of your\npeople to be degraded; do not permit that by legal means practices contrary to\nthe natural and divine law be introduced into that fundamental cell, the\nFamily....May all responsible public authorities--as some are already doing so\nlaudably--generously revive their efforts.\" I submit that insofar as this is an\nappeal to Catholic officials in this country, it must clearly be disregarded,\nbecause it is inconsistent with the laws of the land. By issuing such an \"Appeal to Public Authorities,\" the Pope has placed in a\nvery difficult position those Catholics who occupy public positions in this or\nin any country where separation of church and state is constitutionally or\notherwise basically guaranteed. They must choose, for example, when it comes to\nabortion for the therapeutic reason even of saving the life of the woman\nbetween their obligations to their church and their obligations to their state.\nThis leads to the question whether as a matter of law Catholic doctors and\nCatholic hospitals which follow the teachings of the Pope are practicing\nsectarian medicine. If I am right that they are, then they are infringing the\nAmerican Medical Association's canons of ethics, which prohibit the practice of\nsectarian medicine: \"In order that a physician may best serve his patients he is expected to exalt\nthe standards of his profession and to extend its sphere of usefulness.\" \"To the same end, he should not base his practice on an exclusive dogma, or a\nsectarian system, 'for sects are implacable despots: to accept their thralldom\nis to take away all liberty from one's action and thought.' A sectarian or\ncultist as applied to medicine is one who alleges to follow or in his practice\nfollows a dogma, tenet, or principle based on the authority of its promulgator\nto the exclusion of demonstration and scientific experience.\" Richard Cardinal Cushing said some time ago with reference to birth control:\n\"Catholics do not need the support of civil law to be faithful to their own\nreligious convictions and they do not seek to impose by law their moral views\non other members of society.\" Perhaps it is because of their awareness of the\nimpossible legal position the present stand of the Pope forces on Catholics who\nare lawmakers, law interpreters, or law enforcers, that such leading Catholic\nlegal scholars as Father Robert Drinan, dean of Boston College Law School, have\ncalled for total repeal, rather than amendment, of the abortion laws of all\nstates.

And public opinion polls demonstrated that a majority of\npeople, including a majority of the Catholics asked about the issue, favored at\nleast some liberalization of the laws. But the opposition of the Catholic\nChurch is potent and well organized. The Church holds that the fetus is\n\"ensouled\" at conception. In his encyclical Humanae Vitae in July of 1968, Pope\nPaul said, \"We must once again declare that the direct interruption of the\ngenerative process already begun and above all, directly willed and procured\nabortion, even if for therapeutic reasons, are to be absolutely excluded as\nlicit means of regulating birth.\" To this unequivocal statement--which is, of course, not the law in any American\nstate, since all states permit abortion at least to save the life of the\nmother--the Pope adds an \"Appeal to Public Authorities.\" He says, \"To Rulers,\nwho are those principally responsible for the common good, and who can do so\nmuch to safeguard moral customs, we say: Do not allow the morality of your\npeople to be degraded; do not permit that by legal means practices contrary to\nthe natural and divine law be introduced into that fundamental cell, the\nFamily....May all responsible public authorities--as some are already doing so\nlaudably--generously revive their efforts.\" I submit that insofar as this is an\nappeal to Catholic officials in this country, it must clearly be disregarded,\nbecause it is inconsistent with the laws of the land. By issuing such an \"Appeal to Public Authorities,\" the Pope has placed in a\nvery difficult position those Catholics who occupy public positions in this or\nin any country where separation of church and state is constitutionally or\notherwise basically guaranteed. They must choose, for example, when it comes to\nabortion for the therapeutic reason even of saving the life of the woman\nbetween their obligations to their church and their obligations to their state.\nThis leads to the question whether as a matter of law Catholic doctors and\nCatholic hospitals which follow the teachings of the Pope are practicing\nsectarian medicine. If I am right that they are, then they are infringing the\nAmerican Medical Association's canons of ethics, which prohibit the practice of\nsectarian medicine: \"In order that a physician may best serve his patients he is expected to exalt\nthe standards of his profession and to extend its sphere of usefulness.\" \"To the same end, he should not base his practice on an exclusive dogma, or a\nsectarian system, 'for sects are implacable despots: to accept their thralldom\nis to take away all liberty from one's action and thought.' A sectarian or\ncultist as applied to medicine is one who alleges to follow or in his practice\nfollows a dogma, tenet, or principle based on the authority of its promulgator\nto the exclusion of demonstration and scientific experience.\" Richard Cardinal Cushing said some time ago with reference to birth control:\n\"Catholics do not need the support of civil law to be faithful to their own\nreligious convictions and they do not seek to impose by law their moral views\non other members of society.\" Perhaps it is because of their awareness of the\nimpossible legal position the present stand of the Pope forces on Catholics who\nare lawmakers, law interpreters, or law enforcers, that such leading Catholic\nlegal scholars as Father Robert Drinan, dean of Boston College Law School, have\ncalled for total repeal, rather than amendment, of the abortion laws of all\nstates. They claim that since to Catholics all abortions are unacceptable, the\nstate should keep hands off the subject rather than decreeing that some\nabortions are legal and some not. Catholics should, of course, be allowed to\nfollow their own convictions in this area, but so surely should the rest of\nus.

And\nfinally, if for sectarian reasons they withhold a procedure which in any given\nsituation would be regarded as the proper medical response to the problem\npresented, they may be guilty of civil and criminal malpractice unless they at\nleast explain to the patient their sectarian reasons for withholding the\ntreatment so that the patient can go elsewhere if she chooses. It would seem that abortion-law reform--and better, repeal--is an idea whose\ntime has come. It is more than time that it be supported by all those who want\nto slow down our population growth rate without resorting to coercion or\ncompulsion. As Secretary-General U Thant and many of the UN agencies have\nrepeatedly said, \"The opportunity to decide the number and spacing of children\nis a basic human right.\" Until such time as we have a perfect contraceptive\nuniversally available and invariably used, voluntary abortion should be\ninfinitely preferred to compulsory sterilization or compulsory birth control,\nand that may well be the choice.

In his encyclical Humanae Vitae in July of 1968, Pope\nPaul said, \"We must once again declare that the direct interruption of the\ngenerative process already begun and above all, directly willed and procured\nabortion, even if for therapeutic reasons, are to be absolutely excluded as\nlicit means of regulating birth.\" To this unequivocal statement--which is, of course, not the law in any American\nstate, since all states permit abortion at least to save the life of the\nmother--the Pope adds an \"Appeal to Public Authorities.\" He says, \"To Rulers,\nwho are those principally responsible for the common good, and who can do so\nmuch to safeguard moral customs, we say: Do not allow the morality of your\npeople to be degraded; do not permit that by legal means practices contrary to\nthe natural and divine law be introduced into that fundamental cell, the\nFamily....May all responsible public authorities--as some are already doing so\nlaudably--generously revive their efforts.\" I submit that insofar as this is an\nappeal to Catholic officials in this country, it must clearly be disregarded,\nbecause it is inconsistent with the laws of the land. By issuing such an \"Appeal to Public Authorities,\" the Pope has placed in a\nvery difficult position those Catholics who occupy public positions in this or\nin any country where separation of church and state is constitutionally or\notherwise basically guaranteed. They must choose, for example, when it comes to\nabortion for the therapeutic reason even of saving the life of the woman\nbetween their obligations to their church and their obligations to their state.\nThis leads to the question whether as a matter of law Catholic doctors and\nCatholic hospitals which follow the teachings of the Pope are practicing\nsectarian medicine. If I am right that they are, then they are infringing the\nAmerican Medical Association's canons of ethics, which prohibit the practice of\nsectarian medicine: \"In order that a physician may best serve his patients he is expected to exalt\nthe standards of his profession and to extend its sphere of usefulness.\" \"To the same end, he should not base his practice on an exclusive dogma, or a\nsectarian system, 'for sects are implacable despots: to accept their thralldom\nis to take away all liberty from one's action and thought.' A sectarian or\ncultist as applied to medicine is one who alleges to follow or in his practice\nfollows a dogma, tenet, or principle based on the authority of its promulgator\nto the exclusion of demonstration and scientific experience.\" Richard Cardinal Cushing said some time ago with reference to birth control:\n\"Catholics do not need the support of civil law to be faithful to their own\nreligious convictions and they do not seek to impose by law their moral views\non other members of society.\" Perhaps it is because of their awareness of the\nimpossible legal position the present stand of the Pope forces on Catholics who\nare lawmakers, law interpreters, or law enforcers, that such leading Catholic\nlegal scholars as Father Robert Drinan, dean of Boston College Law School, have\ncalled for total repeal, rather than amendment, of the abortion laws of all\nstates. They claim that since to Catholics all abortions are unacceptable, the\nstate should keep hands off the subject rather than decreeing that some\nabortions are legal and some not. Catholics should, of course, be allowed to\nfollow their own convictions in this area, but so surely should the rest of\nus. To the extent also that doctor and hospital adherents to the Pope's Encyclical\nare the recipients of public funds, they may be afoul of our First Amendment\nguarantees of religious freedom and anti-establishment of any church. And\nfinally, if for sectarian reasons they withhold a procedure which in any given\nsituation would be regarded as the proper medical response to the problem\npresented, they may be guilty of civil and criminal malpractice unless they at\nleast explain to the patient their sectarian reasons for withholding the\ntreatment so that the patient can go elsewhere if she chooses. It would seem that abortion-law reform--and better, repeal--is an idea whose\ntime has come. It is more than time that it be supported by all those who want\nto slow down our population growth rate without resorting to coercion or\ncompulsion. As Secretary-General U Thant and many of the UN agencies have\nrepeatedly said, \"The opportunity to decide the number and spacing of children\nis a basic human right.\" Until such time as we have a perfect contraceptive\nuniversally available and invariably used, voluntary abortion should be\ninfinitely preferred to compulsory sterilization or compulsory birth control,\nand that may well be the choice.

In\na few states, like Connecticut or Missouri, the law says that the abortion may\nbe performed to save the life of the child as well as that of the mother,\nalthough no one is sure what this means. As a matter of fact, no one knows what\nthe laws which permit abortion to save the life of the mother mean. Courts in a\nnumber of states have held that the danger to life need not be either\n\"imminent\" or \"certain.\" But how \"imminent\" or \"certain\"? Is it enough that the\npregnancy if it comes to term will seriously damage the mother's health? Or\nwill result in the birth of defective offspring? Clearly, a number of doctors think the answer to these questions is yes, since\nabortions, especially on white women with good incomes, are routinely and\nopenly performed in some hospitals in most states and the prosecuting\nauthorities do nothing about it. Criminal laws like these, the meaning of which\npeople must guess at, are open to constitutional attack on this ground, as the\nUnited States Supreme Court has often held with respect to other \"vague\"\nprohibitions. There are many other grounds of constitutional challenge as well:\nthe rights of women, rich and poor, black and white, to equal protection of the\nlaw--that is, to get proper medical treatment without discrimination on the\ngrounds of race, color, or income; the rights of physicians to do their\nprofessional duty in the light of what is known and believed by medical science\ntoday; the right of privacy declared by the United States Supreme Court in the\nConnecticut birth-control case where Sir Justice Goldberg in his concurring\nopinion stated that compulsory pro- or anti-birth-control laws are equally\n\"totalitarian\" and unconstitutional; the right to be free of \"cruel and unusual\npunishment\"; and others. Also it may well be that some courts faced with the\nunconscionable dilemma posed by the abortion laws and unwilling to resort to\nconstitutional grounds, will \"interpret\" the laws out of existence eventually,\nas has happened to the federal birth-control laws. Absolutely excluded So why do the abortion laws stay on the books? One reason is the apparent\ninability or unwillingness of those who advocate population limitation to see\nthe connection. (This does not apply to Planned Parenthood-World Population,\nwhich in November, 1968, passed resolutions calling for repeal of the abortion\nlaws in support of its declared policy of voluntary parenthood.) By 1968, almost all the major religious groups in the United States except the\nRoman Catholic Church were on record in favor of abortion-law reform or repeal.\nThe American Baptist Convention and the Universalist/Unitarian Church came out\nfor total repeal.

In his encyclical Humanae Vitae in July of 1968, Pope\nPaul said, \"We must once again declare that the direct interruption of the\ngenerative process already begun and above all, directly willed and procured\nabortion, even if for therapeutic reasons, are to be absolutely excluded as\nlicit means of regulating birth.\" To this unequivocal statement--which is, of course, not the law in any American\nstate, since all states permit abortion at least to save the life of the\nmother--the Pope adds an \"Appeal to Public Authorities.\" He says, \"To Rulers,\nwho are those principally responsible for the common good, and who can do so\nmuch to safeguard moral customs, we say: Do not allow the morality of your\npeople to be degraded; do not permit that by legal means practices contrary to\nthe natural and divine law be introduced into that fundamental cell, the\nFamily....May all responsible public authorities--as some are already doing so\nlaudably--generously revive their efforts.\" I submit that insofar as this is an\nappeal to Catholic officials in this country, it must clearly be disregarded,\nbecause it is inconsistent with the laws of the land. By issuing such an \"Appeal to Public Authorities,\" the Pope has placed in a\nvery difficult position those Catholics who occupy public positions in this or\nin any country where separation of church and state is constitutionally or\notherwise basically guaranteed. They must choose, for example, when it comes to\nabortion for the therapeutic reason even of saving the life of the woman\nbetween their obligations to their church and their obligations to their state.\nThis leads to the question whether as a matter of law Catholic doctors and\nCatholic hospitals which follow the teachings of the Pope are practicing\nsectarian medicine. If I am right that they are, then they are infringing the\nAmerican Medical Association's canons of ethics, which prohibit the practice of\nsectarian medicine: \"In order that a physician may best serve his patients he is expected to exalt\nthe standards of his profession and to extend its sphere of usefulness.\" \"To the same end, he should not base his practice on an exclusive dogma, or a\nsectarian system, 'for sects are implacable despots: to accept their thralldom\nis to take away all liberty from one's action and thought.' A sectarian or\ncultist as applied to medicine is one who alleges to follow or in his practice\nfollows a dogma, tenet, or principle based on the authority of its promulgator\nto the exclusion of demonstration and scientific experience.\" Richard Cardinal Cushing said some time ago with reference to birth control:\n\"Catholics do not need the support of civil law to be faithful to their own\nreligious convictions and they do not seek to impose by law their moral views\non other members of society.\" Perhaps it is because of their awareness of the\nimpossible legal position the present stand of the Pope forces on Catholics who\nare lawmakers, law interpreters, or law enforcers, that such leading Catholic\nlegal scholars as Father Robert Drinan, dean of Boston College Law School, have\ncalled for total repeal, rather than amendment, of the abortion laws of all\nstates. They claim that since to Catholics all abortions are unacceptable, the\nstate should keep hands off the subject rather than decreeing that some\nabortions are legal and some not. Catholics should, of course, be allowed to\nfollow their own convictions in this area, but so surely should the rest of\nus. To the extent also that doctor and hospital adherents to the Pope's Encyclical\nare the recipients of public funds, they may be afoul of our First Amendment\nguarantees of religious freedom and anti-establishment of any church. And\nfinally, if for sectarian reasons they withhold a procedure which in any given\nsituation would be regarded as the proper medical response to the problem\npresented, they may be guilty of civil and criminal malpractice unless they at\nleast explain to the patient their sectarian reasons for withholding the\ntreatment so that the patient can go elsewhere if she chooses. It would seem that abortion-law reform--and better, repeal--is an idea whose\ntime has come. It is more than time that it be supported by all those who want\nto slow down our population growth rate without resorting to coercion or\ncompulsion. As Secretary-General U Thant and many of the UN agencies have\nrepeatedly said, \"The opportunity to decide the number and spacing of children\nis a basic human right.\" Until such time as we have a perfect contraceptive\nuniversally available and invariably used, voluntary abortion should be\ninfinitely preferred to compulsory sterilization or compulsory birth control,\nand that may well be the choice.

If I am right that they are, then they are infringing the\nAmerican Medical Association's canons of ethics, which prohibit the practice of\nsectarian medicine: \"In order that a physician may best serve his patients he is expected to exalt\nthe standards of his profession and to extend its sphere of usefulness.\" \"To the same end, he should not base his practice on an exclusive dogma, or a\nsectarian system, 'for sects are implacable despots: to accept their thralldom\nis to take away all liberty from one's action and thought.' A sectarian or\ncultist as applied to medicine is one who alleges to follow or in his practice\nfollows a dogma, tenet, or principle based on the authority of its promulgator\nto the exclusion of demonstration and scientific experience.\" Richard Cardinal Cushing said some time ago with reference to birth control:\n\"Catholics do not need the support of civil law to be faithful to their own\nreligious convictions and they do not seek to impose by law their moral views\non other members of society.\" Perhaps it is because of their awareness of the\nimpossible legal position the present stand of the Pope forces on Catholics who\nare lawmakers, law interpreters, or law enforcers, that such leading Catholic\nlegal scholars as Father Robert Drinan, dean of Boston College Law School, have\ncalled for total repeal, rather than amendment, of the abortion laws of all\nstates. They claim that since to Catholics all abortions are unacceptable, the\nstate should keep hands off the subject rather than decreeing that some\nabortions are legal and some not. Catholics should, of course, be allowed to\nfollow their own convictions in this area, but so surely should the rest of\nus. To the extent also that doctor and hospital adherents to the Pope's Encyclical\nare the recipients of public funds, they may be afoul of our First Amendment\nguarantees of religious freedom and anti-establishment of any church. And\nfinally, if for sectarian reasons they withhold a procedure which in any given\nsituation would be regarded as the proper medical response to the problem\npresented, they may be guilty of civil and criminal malpractice unless they at\nleast explain to the patient their sectarian reasons for withholding the\ntreatment so that the patient can go elsewhere if she chooses. It would seem that abortion-law reform--and better, repeal--is an idea whose\ntime has come. It is more than time that it be supported by all those who want\nto slow down our population growth rate without resorting to coercion or\ncompulsion. As Secretary-General U Thant and many of the UN agencies have\nrepeatedly said, \"The opportunity to decide the number and spacing of children\nis a basic human right.\" Until such time as we have a perfect contraceptive\nuniversally available and invariably used, voluntary abortion should be\ninfinitely preferred to compulsory sterilization or compulsory birth control,\nand that may well be the choice.

One reason is the apparent\ninability or unwillingness of those who advocate population limitation to see\nthe connection. (This does not apply to Planned Parenthood-World Population,\nwhich in November, 1968, passed resolutions calling for repeal of the abortion\nlaws in support of its declared policy of voluntary parenthood.) By 1968, almost all the major religious groups in the United States except the\nRoman Catholic Church were on record in favor of abortion-law reform or repeal.\nThe American Baptist Convention and the Universalist/Unitarian Church came out\nfor total repeal. And public opinion polls demonstrated that a majority of\npeople, including a majority of the Catholics asked about the issue, favored at\nleast some liberalization of the laws. But the opposition of the Catholic\nChurch is potent and well organized. The Church holds that the fetus is\n\"ensouled\" at conception. In his encyclical Humanae Vitae in July of 1968, Pope\nPaul said, \"We must once again declare that the direct interruption of the\ngenerative process already begun and above all, directly willed and procured\nabortion, even if for therapeutic reasons, are to be absolutely excluded as\nlicit means of regulating birth.\" To this unequivocal statement--which is, of course, not the law in any American\nstate, since all states permit abortion at least to save the life of the\nmother--the Pope adds an \"Appeal to Public Authorities.\" He says, \"To Rulers,\nwho are those principally responsible for the common good, and who can do so\nmuch to safeguard moral customs, we say: Do not allow the morality of your\npeople to be degraded; do not permit that by legal means practices contrary to\nthe natural and divine law be introduced into that fundamental cell, the\nFamily....May all responsible public authorities--as some are already doing so\nlaudably--generously revive their efforts.\" I submit that insofar as this is an\nappeal to Catholic officials in this country, it must clearly be disregarded,\nbecause it is inconsistent with the laws of the land.

      "text": "Why I'm Talking About My Abortion\n\nI've never regretted it, and other women need the choice that I had.\n\nI had an abortion when I was 26 years old. I was not raped. I wasn't the victim of incest. I was not in the midst of a life-threatening medical emergency. I simply had no desire to give birth to a child.\n\nI've never shared my abortion story publicly until now. I describe this time in my life in detail in my forthcoming memoir, Uphill , which will be released in October . I know that I'm likely to be attacked for being candid about my decision. But I'm choosing to share some of my experience now because, like so many women in this country, I am angry, appalled, and disgusted about the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade , the landmark ruling that previously guaranteed federal constitutional protections for abortion rights.\n\nMore than ever before, women who want an abortion or have had an abortion need to know that they aren't alone; a large number of women have been in the same position. So much of the conversation about this issue is entirely too fixated on who deserves the right to have an abortion. But every woman should have a right to an abortion-not just those who are facing grim and horrific circumstances. Women should not have to justify why they want the power over whether and when they give birth. The government shouldn't force them to have a child, any more than it should force them to be sterilized. They just need access to safe care.\n\nRead: When a right becomes a privilege\n\nWhen I had my abortion, I was a sports journalist at the Detroit Free Press , in Michigan. I was financially able to support a child. I have no doubt that my family would have been present for me. The man I was involved with at the time would have provided support. His family would have been there for us too. However, I didn't see a long-term future with him. And given that my mother and father never married-and I knew their tumultuous history very well-I didn't want to bring a child into an unstable relationship.\n\nBesides, my career meant everything to me. I was pursuing my dream of being a sports journalist. I understood clearly that having a child would have drastically limited the future I saw for myself. Parenting would be difficult to fit into my lifestyle because, as a college beat reporter, I was on the road for nearly eight months a year covering Michigan State football and basketball. The Spartans men's basketball program was turning into a powerhouse and had won the NCAA championship in 2000. That gave me the chance to cover a team that was nationally prominent. That experience, I hoped, might get me that much closer to my goal, which at the time was to become a senior writer for Sports Illustrated . I didn't want to sacrifice my body or devote my time to raising a child. I wanted to travel the world. I wanted the freedom to live wherever I wanted and to navigate my career without having to factor a child into my plans.\n\nI'm aware that some people will read this and think that I was selfish. Women are judged harshly for pursuing their goals as ambitiously as men do. Some people will probably call me irresponsible. But mistakes happen. Just because an unwanted pregnancy occurs-and it doesn't matter if it's within the context of a relationship, a one-night stand, or a \" situationship \"-that doesn't mean a woman should be punished by being forced to have a child she doesn't want to raise.\n\nFor years, I battled a secret guilt about my abortion. It wasn't because I wondered whether I had made the right decision. I felt guilty because I never had any regrets and worried that this somehow made me inhumane. It took me some time to realize that I shouldn't have to apologize for wanting control of my body and life. Women consider and choose abortion for a variety of reasons, and sometimes one of those reasons is that childbirth simply isn't something they wish to do. That's the meaningful thing about choice: You have the right to make a decision based purely on what you think is best for yourself.\n\nAlthough I'm married, in my late 40s, and still childless, I have never thought that I missed an important window of opportunity. I have not wondered what my life would be like now if I had carried a child. I did not agonize over the decision. I actually made it, with the full support of my then-boyfriend, mere hours after discovering I was pregnant. That was not because I took the decision lightly. I simply knew what was right for me. I understand the moral complexities of the abortion debate and respect the people who would make a decision different from mine. But above all, I would defend their right to choose.\n\nI went to an abortion clinic in Southfield, which is a suburb just outside of Detroit. At the clinic, I received a vacuum aspiration, also commonly known as a suction abortion. The entire process took about an hour, from the time I walked into the examination room. I had some spotting and mild cramping after the procedure, but I was otherwise fine in a few days.\n\nJanice Wolly: My first pregnancy\n\nI am relieved and grateful that this service was available to me, but had Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , the Supreme Court's latest abortion ruling, been in place at the time, I would have been absolutely terrified. Michigan is one of nine states that had anti-abortion laws preced ing Roe v. Wade . A 1931 law in the state banned abortion with no exceptions for rape or incest. A court injunction has temporarily barred enforcement of that law . Although Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer has vowed to protect abortion rights and filed a motion with the state's Supreme Court that, I hope, will allow her to keep her promise, the state legislature's Republican majority wants to reinstate the archaic 1931 law.\n\nFuture generations of women will not have the same right to an abortion as I had. That I have fewer rights as a woman today than I did when I had an abortion more than 20 years ago is a pitiful commentary on the direction of this country. When I had my abortion, I was operating from a position of privilege because I had stable employment and no children to care for. The loss of abortion rights will devastate other women and their families. According to the CDC, the abortion rate is higher for Black and Hispanic women than it is for white women, and most abortion seekers have other children.\n\nI wish I could offer more comforting words to girls and women in this moment, especially to those in the two dozen or so states where abortion will soon be, or has already been, largely banned. The Supreme Court's Dobbs ruling was regressive and political , and those states that have trigger laws banning abortions should know that these laws will not stop abortions. Women will always try to decide what is best for their bodies, whether it's legal or not.\n\nThe pain so many women are feeling right now is unshakable. Our status in America-our very freedom-has been irrevocably diminished. Yet sharing our abortion stories carries enormous power. No woman needs to think of herself as immoral because she had an abortion or wants an abortion. What's immoral is telling women that they don't deserve bodily autonomy.\n\nWhen you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

      "text": "Abortion Takes Center Stage\n\nThe most emotional moment of the DNC so far has not been Joe Biden's goodbye.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nSign up for The Decision , a newsletter featuring our 2024 election coverage.\n\nThe most emotional moment of last night's Democratic National Convention was supposed to be Joe Biden's farewell, after his party's power brokers made clear he could not run again. And true, his address showed a graciousness in defeat that Donald Trump could never hope to understand. But the most moving speech of the evening was only a few minutes long, and it was given by a young woman from Kentucky.\n\nHer name was Hadley Duvall, and she spoke in a section devoted to the effects of abortion bans on regular people. She introduced herself as an \"all-American girl,\" a cheerleading captain, a homecoming queen-and a \"survivor.\" A decade ago, Duvall became pregnant at 12 after being raped by her stepfather, and she wanted to draw attention to Donald Trump's description of abortion bans as a \"beautiful thing.\"\n\nDuvall asked: \"What is so beautiful about a child having to carry her parent's child?\"\n\nThe awfulness of what had happened to this young woman, and the dignity with which she recounted it, silenced the audience. Some delegates had tears in their eyes. Here in prime time, the Democrats were confronting their opponents with their support for laws that force 12-year-old girls to bear their rapists' babies. Never mind weird ; that's obscene.\n\nFrom the January/February 2024 issue: A plan to outlaw abortion everywhere\n\nPeople want to know how this convention is different from the one that would have happened with Biden as the presidential nominee-and this feels like an obvious example. Kamala Harris is much more comfortable campaigning on abortion than Biden, who is an observant Catholic. Her team has grabbed back the word freedom to question why the government wants to dictate health-care decisions and interfere with women's lives. \"I can't imagine not having a choice,\" Duvall said.\n\nDuvall, who is now in her 20s, miscarried naturally. Today, under Kentucky's post- Roe laws, which are being challenged in court, she would not have been entitled to an abortion. (The state has no exception for rape or incest.) She was the star of a viral ad during Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear's successful reelection campaign last year, and he followed her onto the convention stage, calling her \"one of the bravest people I've ever met.\" He then devoted much of his speech to reproductive rights.\n\nDuvall appeared alongside three other speakers with similarly heart-wrenching stories. Amanda and Josh Zurawski were first shown in a recorded video, looking at the baby clothes they had bought for their daughter, Willow. But Amanda started to miscarry at 18 weeks, and Josh watched as doctors in Texas refused to use abortion drugs to induce labor until Amanda's temperature spiked enough to turn the situation into a medical emergency-and thus make the use of abortifacients permissible under the state's new, post- Roe laws. Next up was Kaitlyn Joshua, who had been turned away by two emergency rooms in Louisiana when she began to miscarry her second baby at 11 weeks. She also blamed the post- Roe landscape for her difficulty in getting medical attention.\n\nThe segment reflected the Democratic belief that Republican leaders have lost touch with the median American opinion on abortion. Almost two-thirds of Americans say abortion should be legal in most cases, but almost zero percent of people at the Heritage Foundation seem to believe the same. The much-publicized Project 2025-a governmental blueprint drawn up by the powerful think tank that got regular name-checks yesterday- asserts that abortion is \"not health care.\" (The document mentions abortion 143 times in its 54-page chapter on health care, which seems like a contradiction.) Project 2025 calls for more stringent regulation of the manufacturers of abortion pills; research on the \"harms\" of abortion to women and girls; restrictions on the mailing of pills; a ban on the use of government money to fund abortion travel; and defunding Planned Parenthood.\n\nOverall, the message is: Overturning Roe v. Wade was just the beginning . The trouble is that, for many voters, overturning Roe was already too much.\n\nProject 2025 was published last year, but it has entered public consciousness in the past few months as Democrats have begun to use it as placeholder text for \"bad stuff the Republicans want to do.\" Here at the convention, it crept into speeches across the first night, and Michigan State Senator Mallory McMorrow even brought along her own bound copy, asserting that Republicans \"went ahead and wrote down all of the extreme things that Donald Trump wants to do in the next four years.\"\n\nAs my colleague David Graham wrote recently , Trump has tried to distance himself from Project 2025, presumably because it polls about as well as halitosis. \"I disagree with some of the things they're saying and some of the things they're saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal,\" Trump posted on Truth Social. The Heritage Foundation's document even gestures to how unpopular full abortion bans are in practice, noting: \"Miscarriage management or standard ectopic pregnancy treatments should never be conflated with abortion.\" Yet this is exactly what happens: The drugs are the same, and doctors in Louisiana and elsewhere have said that the threat of prosecution for providing such medical care has a chilling effect.\n\nTrump has toned down the party's platform on abortion-but in today's media environment, voters are highly attuned to the idea of secret plans and what they're not telling you. The same conspiracism that Trump has tried to inculcate in his voters might now backfire on him. After all, his Supreme Court appointments allowed Roe v. Wade to be overturned, and red states have enthusiastically pursued federal abortion restrictions since. The existence of Project 2025 gives voters permission to believe that a second Trump presidency would create far more restrictions on abortion, whatever he claims now.\n\nWhen the Dobbs decision leaked in 2022, I wrote about Ireland's referendum on abortion four years earlier. Then, a deeply religious country had voted by a decent margin to permit terminations up to 12 weeks , with no restrictions. Why? Because the country's ban on abortion was held responsible for the 2012 death of Savita Halappanavar, a 31-year-old dentist who started to miscarry at 17 weeks. Afraid of being prosecuted, Irish doctors administered the necessary drugs only when they no longer detected a fetal heartbeat. It was too late to save Halappanavar. She died of blood poisoning-the same fate Amanda Zurawski so narrowly avoided. An inquiry into the case found that if Halappanavar had been given abortion drugs when she first presented at the hospital, \"we would never have heard of her, and she would be alive today.\"\n\nRead: What winning did to the anti-abortion movement\n\nThe success of Ireland's abortion-rights campaign showed that activists had found a way to talk about the issue that appealed to conservatives and older people, the two groups most likely to have qualms about the practice. Some feminists grumbled about foregrounding \" good abortions \" and medical cases, rather than defending the principle more widely, but the campaigners' strategy worked. (Contrast this with Planned Parenthood's stunt of offering pill-based abortions near the convention center this week, which was seized upon by the right as evidence that the left treats the procedure with undue casualness.) The Democrats have made a similar decision to talk about wanted babies and unintended consequences.\n\nAnother successful part of the Irish strategy was encouraging men to talk about the effect of abortion restrictions on them . (The campaign even included a group called \" Grandfathers for Yes .\") That might raise feminist hackles, but the emotional impact of hearing someone like Josh Zurawski describe watching a loved one suffer unnecessarily-and his fears about losing his wife, as well as their baby-is undeniable. \"I'm here because the fight for reproductive rights isn't just a woman's fight,\" Zurawski told the convention, prompting cheers. \"This is about fighting for our families.\" Hearing him and Beshear-and the vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz on the campaign trail-talk about abortion shows the power of using an unexpected messenger. Notably, Beshear and others also spoke about girls and women, rather than the progressive , gender-neutral formulation of pregnant people -again demonstrating how this message is designed to appeal to voters beyond the Democratic base.\n\nThe Dobbs decision gave the right what it had demanded for half a century. But the ruling also made abortion an electoral liability for the Republicans. Even the most avowed pro-life campaigners struggle to articulate why women like Halappanavar and Zurawski should be left to die, and girls like Hadley Duvall should have their stepfather's baby.\n\nAbortion is on the ballot in November, and in a measure of how much the landscape has changed since the last election, it is also on the program here in Chicago."

      "text": "'That's Something That You Won't Recover From as a Doctor'\n\nIn Idaho and other states, draconian laws are forcing physicians to ignore their training and put patients' lives at risk.\n\nListen to more stories on curio\n\nThis article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here .\n\nK ylie Cooper has seen all the ways a pregnancy can go terrifyingly, perilously wrong. She is an obstetrician who manages high-risk patients, also known as a maternal-fetal-medicine specialist, or MFM. The awkward hyphenation highlights the duality of the role. Cooper must care for two patients at once: mother and fetus, mom and baby. On good days, she helps women with complicated pregnancies bring home healthy babies. On bad days, she has to tell families that this will not be possible. Sometimes, they ask her to end the pregnancy; prior to the summer of 2022, she was able to do so.\n\nCheck out more from this issue and find your next story to read.\n\nThat summer, Cooper felt a growing sense of dread. Thirteen states-including Idaho, where she practiced-had passed \"trigger laws\" meant to ban abortion if Roe v. Wade were overturned. When this happened, in June 2022, some of the bans proved so draconian that doctors feared they could be prosecuted for providing medical care once considered standard. Soon enough, stories began to emerge around the country of women denied abortions, even as their health deteriorated.\n\nIn Texas, a woman whose water broke at 18 weeks-far too early for her baby to survive outside the womb-was unable to get an abortion until she became septic. She spent three days in the ICU, and one of her fallopian tubes permanently closed from scarring. In Tennessee, a woman lost four pints of blood delivering her dead fetus in a hospital's holding area. In Oklahoma, a bleeding woman with a nonviable pregnancy was turned away from three separate hospitals. One said she could wait in the parking lot until her condition became life-threatening.\n\nIdaho's ban was as strict as they came, and Cooper worried about her high-risk patients who would soon be forced to continue pregnancies that were dangerous, nonviable, or both.\n\nShe was confronted with this reality just two days after the ban went into effect, when a woman named Kayla Smith walked into Cooper's office at St. Luke's Boise Medical Center. (St. Luke's was founded by an Episcopal bishop but is no longer religiously affiliated.) Smith was just over four months pregnant with her second baby-a boy she and her husband had already decided to name Brooks.\n\nHer first pregnancy had been complicated. At 19 weeks, she'd developed severe preeclampsia, a condition associated with pregnancy that can cause life-threatening high blood pressure. She started seeing spots in her vision, and doctors worried that she would have a stroke. The only cure for preeclampsia is ending the pregnancy-with a delivery or an abortion. But Smith had chosen to stay pregnant, despite the risks, and she was able to eke it out just long enough on IV blood-pressure drugs for her daughter to be born as a preemie, at 33 weeks. The baby ultimately did well after a NICU stay, one of those success stories that MFMs say is the reason they do what they do.\n\nThis time, however, Smith's ultrasound had picked up some worrying fetal anomalies, raising the possibility of Down syndrome. \"Okay, that's fine,\" Smith remembers saying. \"But is our son going to survive?\" The answer, Cooper realized as she peered at his tiny heart on the ultrasound, was almost certainly no. The left half of the heart had barely formed; a pediatric cardiologist later confirmed that the anomaly was too severe to fix with surgery. Meanwhile, Smith's early-onset preeclampsia in her first pregnancy put her at high risk of developing preeclampsia again. In short, her son would not survive, and staying pregnant would pose a danger to her own health. In the ultrasound room that day, Smith started to cry.\n\nCooper started to cry too. She was used to conversations like this-delivering what might be the worst news of someone's life was a regular part of her job-but she was not used to telling her patients that they then had no choice about what to do next. Idaho's new ban made performing an abortion for any reason a felony. It contained no true exceptions, allowing doctors only to mount an \"affirmative defense\" in court in cases involving rape or incest, or to prevent the death of the mother. This put the burden on physicians to prove that their illegal actions were justifiable. The punishment for violating the law was at least two years in prison, and up to five. The state also had a Texas-style vigilante law that allowed a family member of a \"preborn child\" to sue an abortion provider in civil court for at least $20,000.\n\nFrom the May 2022 issue: Jessica Bruder on the future of abortion in a post- Roe America\n\nBecause Smith had not yet developed preeclampsia, her own life was not technically in danger, and she could not have an abortion in Idaho. Merely protecting her health was not enough. Lawmakers had made that clear: When asked about the health of the mother, Todd Lakey, one of the legislators who introduced the trigger ban in 2020, had said , \"I would say it weighs less, yes, than the life of the child.\" The fact that Smith's baby could not survive didn't matter; Idaho's ban had no exception for lethal fetal anomalies.\n\nIf she did get preeclampsia, Smith remembers asking, when could her doctors intervene? Cooper wasn't sure. Idaho's abortion law was restrictive; it was also vague. All Cooper would say was When you are sick enough . Sick enough that she was actually in danger of dying? That seemed awfully risky; Smith had a two-and-a-half-year-old daughter who needed her mom. She also worried that if she continued her pregnancy, her unborn son would suffer. Would he feel pain, she asked, if he died after birth, as his underdeveloped heart tried in vain to pump blood? Cooper did not have a certain answer for this either.\n\nSmith decided that getting an abortion as soon as possible, before her health was imperiled, would be best, even if that meant traveling to another state. She knew she wanted her abortion to be an early induction of labor-rather than a dilation and evacuation that removed the fetus with medical instruments-because she wanted to hold her son, to say goodbye. She found a hospital in Seattle that could perform an induction abortion and drove with her husband almost eight hours to get there. Unsure how much their insurance would cover, they took out a $16,000 personal loan. Two weeks later, Smith again drove to Seattle and back, this time to pick up her son's ashes. The logistics kept her so busy, she told me, that \"I wasn't even allowed the space to grieve the loss of my son.\"\n\nIf Smith had walked into Cooper's office just a week earlier, none of this would have been necessary. She would have been able to get the abortion right there in Boise. But at least she had not yet been in immediate danger, and she'd made it to Seattle safely. Cooper worried about the next patient, and the next. What if someone came in tomorrow with, say, her water broken at 19 weeks, at risk of bleeding and infection? This happened regularly at her hospital.\n\nAs summer turned to fall, Cooper started to feel anxious whenever she was on call. \"Every time the phone rang, or my pager went off, just this feeling of impending doom,\" she told me. Would this call be the call? The one in which a woman would die on her watch? She began telling patients at risk for certain complications to consider staying with family outside Idaho, if they could, for part of their pregnancy-just in case they needed an emergency abortion.\n\nCooper described her feelings as a form of \"moral distress,\" a phrase I heard again and again in interviews with nearly three dozen doctors who are currently practicing or have practiced under post- Roe abortion restrictions. The term was coined in the 1980s to describe the psychological toll on nurses who felt powerless to do the right thing-unable to challenge, for example, doctors ordering painful procedures on patients with no chance of living. The concept gained traction among doctors during the coronavirus pandemic, when overwhelmed hospitals had to ration care, essentially leaving some patients to die.\n\nFrom the December 2019 issue: Caitlin Flanagan on the dishonesty of the abortion debate\n\nIn the two-plus years since Roe was overturned, a handful of studies have cataloged the moral distress of doctors across the country. In one, 96 percent of providers who care for pregnant women in states with restrictive laws reported feelings of moral distress that ranged from \"uncomfortable\" to \"intense\" to \"worst possible.\" In a survey of ob-gyns who mostly were not abortion providers, more than 90 percent said the laws had prevented them or their colleagues from providing standard medical care. They described feeling \"muzzled,\" \"handcuffed,\" and \"straitjacketed.\" In another study, ob‐gyn residents reported feeling like \"puppets,\" a \"hypocrite,\" or a \"robot of the State\" under the abortion bans.\n\nThe doctors I spoke with had a wide range of personal views on abortion, but they uniformly agreed that the current restrictions are unworkable as medical care. They have watched patients grow incredulous, even angry, upon learning of their limited options. But mostly, their patients are devastated. The bans have added heartbreak on top of heartbreak, forcing women grieving the loss of an unborn child to endure delayed care and unnecessary injury. For some doctors, this has been too much to bear. They have fled to states without bans, leaving behind even fewer doctors to care for patients in places like Idaho.\n\nCooper had moved to Idaho with her husband and kids in 2018, drawn to the natural beauty and to the idea of practicing in a state underserved by doctors: It ranked 47th in the nation in ob-gyns per capita then, and she was one of just nine MFMs in the state. But in that summer of 2022, she began to fear that she could no longer do right by her patients. What she knew to be medically and ethically correct was now legally wrong. \"I could not live with myself if something bad happened to somebody,\" she told me. \"But I also couldn't live with myself if I went to prison and left my family and my small children behind.\"\n\nAt first, Cooper and other doctors distressed by Idaho's ban hoped that it could be amended. If only lawmakers knew what doctors knew, they figured, surely they would see how the rule was harming women who needed an abortion for medical reasons. Indeed, as doctors began speaking up, publicly in the media and privately with lawmakers, several Idaho legislators admitted that they had not understood the impact of the trigger ban . Some had never thought that Roe would be overturned. The ban wasn't really meant to become law-except now it had.\n\nFrankly, doctors had been unprepared too. None had shown up to testify before the trigger ban quietly passed in 2020; they just weren't paying attention. (Almost all public opposition at the time came from anti-abortion activists, who thought the ban was still too lax because it had carve-outs for rape and incest.) Now doctors found themselves taking a crash course in state politics. Lauren Miller, another MFM at St. Luke's, helped form a coalition to get the Idaho Medical Association to put its full lobbying power in the state legislature behind medical exceptions, both for lethal fetal anomalies and for a mother's health. Cooper and a fellow ob-gyn, Amelia Huntsberger, met with the governor's office in their roles as vice chair and chair, respectively, of the Idaho section of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\n\nThe results of these efforts were disappointing. The lobbying culminated in a bill passed in March 2023 that offered doctors only marginally more breathing room than before. It changed the affirmative-defense statute into an actual exception to \"prevent the death of the pregnant woman,\" and it clarified that procedures to end ectopic and molar pregnancies-two types of nonviable abnormal pregnancies-were not to be considered abortions. But an exception for lethal fetal anomalies was a nonstarter. And an exception to prevent a life-threatening condition, rather than just preventing the death of the mother, was quashed after the chair of the Idaho Republican Party, Dorothy Moon, lambasted it in a public letter . The previous year, the Idaho GOP had adopted a platform declaring that \"abortion is murder from the moment of fertilization\" and rejected an exception for the life of the mother; it would reiterate that position in 2024.\n\nRead: Dobbs 's confounding effect on abortion rates\n\nCooper and Huntsberger felt that their meeting with two of the governor's staffers, in December 2022, had been futile as well. It had taken months to schedule a 20-minute conversation, and one of the staffers left in a hurry partway through. \"There was a lot of acknowledgment of Yeah, this is really bad. The laws may not be written ideally ,\" Huntsberger told me. \"There was also no action.\"\n\nAfter the meeting, the two women sat, dejected, in a rental car across from the state capitol, Huntsberger having traveled more than 400 miles from Sandpoint, Idaho, where she was a general ob-gyn in a rural hospital. That was when Cooper turned to her colleague and said she had something to confess: She had just been offered a job in Minnesota, a state where abortion is legal. And she was going to take it. She had reached a point where she just couldn't do it anymore; she couldn't keep turning away patients whom she had the skills to help, who needed her help. \"There were so many drives home where I would cry,\" she later told me.\n\nHuntsberger was heartbroken to lose a colleague in the fight to change Idaho's law. But she understood. She and her husband, an ER doctor, had also been talking about leaving. \"It was once a month, and then once a week, and then every day,\" she told me, \"and then we weren't sleeping.\" They worried what might happen at work; they worried what it might mean for their three children. Was it time to give up on Idaho? She told Cooper that day, \"Do what you need to do to care for yourself.\" Cooper and her family moved to Minnesota that spring.\n\nHuntsberger soon found a new job in Oregon, where abortion is also legal. A week later, her rural hospital announced the shutdown of its labor-and-delivery unit , citing Idaho's \"legal and political climate\" as one reason. Staffing a 24/7 unit is expensive, and the ban had made recruiting ob-gyns to rural Idaho more difficult than ever. Even jobs in Boise that used to attract 15 or 20 applicants now had only a handful; some jobs have stayed vacant for two years. The three other ob-gyns at Huntsberger's hospital all ended up finding new positions in states with fewer abortion restrictions.\n\nDuring Huntsberger's last month in Idaho, many of her patients scheduled their annual checkups early, so they could see her one last time to say goodbye. Over the years, she had gotten to know all about their children and puppies and gardens. These relationships were why she had become a small-town ob-gyn. She'd never thought she would leave.\n\nTwo other labor-and-delivery units have since closed in Idaho . The state lost more than 50 ob-gyns practicing obstetrics, about one-fifth of the total, in the first 15 months of the ban, according to an analysis by the Idaho Physician Well-Being Action Collaborative . Among MFMs, who deal with the most complicated pregnancies, the exodus has been even more dramatic. Of the nine practicing in 2022, Cooper was the first to leave, followed by Lauren Miller. A third MFM also left because of the ban. Then a fourth took a new job in Nevada and a fifth tried to retire, but their hospital was so short-staffed by then that they were both persuaded to stay at least part-time. That left only four other MFMs for the entire state.\n\nThe departure of so many physicians has strained Idaho's medical system. After Cooper and others moved away, St. Luke's had to rely on traveling doctors to fill the gaps; the hospital was eventually able to hire a few new MFMs, but the process took a long time. Meanwhile, ob-gyns-and family doctors, who deliver many of the babies in rural Idaho-had to manage more pregnancies, including high-risk ones, on their own. The overall lack of ob-gyns has also had implications for women who aren't pregnant, and won't be: Idaho is an attractive place to retire, and the state's growing population of older women need gynecological care as they age into menopause and beyond.\n\nAnne Feighner, an ob-gyn at St. Luke's who has stayed in Boise for now, thinks all the time about her colleagues who have left. Every day, she told me in June, she drove by the house of her neighbor and fellow ob-gyn, Harmony Schroeder, who at the moment was packing up her home of 20 years for a job in Washington State. She, too, was leaving because of the abortion ban. Across the street is the pink house where Cooper used to live and where her daughters used to ride scooters out front.\n\n\"I still have a lot of guilt over leaving,\" Cooper told me. She had made the decision in order to protect herself and her family. But what about her patients in Idaho, and her colleagues? By leaving, she had made a terrible situation for them even worse.\n\nSara Thomson works 12-hour shifts as an obstetrician at a Catholic hospital in Idaho; she is Catholic herself. Even before the abortion ban, her hospital terminated pregnancies only for medical reasons, per religious directive. \"I had never considered myself a quote-unquote abortion provider, \" Thomson told me-at least not until certain kinds of care provided at her hospital became illegal under Idaho's ban. It started to change how she thought of, as she put it, \"the A-word.\"\n\nShe told me about women who showed up at her hospital after their water had broken too early-well before the line of viability, around 22 weeks. Before then, a baby has no chance of survival outside the womb. This condition is known as previable PPROM, an acronym for \"preterm premature rupture of membranes.\"\n\nIn the very best scenario, a woman whose water breaks too early is able to stay pregnant for weeks or even months with enough amniotic fluid-the proverbial \"water\"-for her baby to develop normally. One doctor, Kim Cox, told me about a patient of his whose water broke at 16 weeks; she was able to stay pregnant until 34 weeks, and gave birth to a baby who fared well. Far more likely, though, a woman will naturally go into labor within a week of her water breaking, delivering a fetus that cannot survive. In the worst case, she could develop an infection before delivery. The infection might tip quickly into sepsis, which can cause the loss of limbs, fertility, and organ function-all on top of the tragedy of losing a baby.\n\nIn the very worst case, neither mother nor baby survives. In 2012, a 31-year-old woman in Ireland named Savita Halappanavar died after her water broke at 17 weeks. Doctors had refused to end her pregnancy, waiting for the fetus's heartbeat to stop on its own. When it did, she went into labor, but by then, she had become infected. She died from sepsis three days later. Her death galvanized the abortion-rights movement in Ireland , and the country legalized the procedure in 2018.\n\nRead: Abortion isn't about feminism\n\nDoctors in the United States now worry that abortion bans will cause entirely preventable deaths like Halappanavar's; the possibility haunts Thomson. \"We shouldn't have to wait for a case like Savita's in Idaho,\" she said.\n\nPreviable PPROM is the complication that most troubles doctors practicing under strict abortion bans. These cases fall into the gap between what Idaho law currently allows (averting a mother's death) and what many doctors want to be able to do (treat complications that could become deadly). The condition is not life-threatening right away, doctors told me, but they offered very different interpretations of when it becomes so-anywhere from the first signs of infection all the way to sepsis.\n\nNo surprise, then, that the trigger ban provoked immediate confusion among doctors over how and when to intervene in these cases. Initially, at least, they had more legal leeway to act quickly: The Biden administration had sued Idaho before the trigger ban went into effect, on the grounds that it conflicted with a Reagan-era federal law: the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) , which requires ERs to provide stabilizing treatment when a mother's health, not just her life, is at risk. The Department of Health and Human Services interpreted \"stabilizing treatment\" to include emergency abortions, and a federal judge issued a partial injunction on Idaho's ban, temporarily allowing such abortions to take place. But Idaho appealed the decision, and when the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case in January 2024, it stayed the injunction . With that, any protection that the federal law had granted Idaho doctors evaporated.\n\nThomson was still working under these severe restrictions when I met her in Boise this past June. She missed the days when her biggest problem at work was persuading her hospital to get a new ultrasound machine. A former military doctor, she struck me as soft-spoken but steely, like the most quietly formidable mom in your PTA. At one point, she pulled out a Trapper Keeper pocket folder of handwritten notes that she had taken after our first phone call.\n\nThe cases that most distressed her were ones of previable PPROM where the umbilical cord had prolapsed into the vagina, compressing the cord and exposing the baby and mother to infection. When this happens, Thomson said, a developing fetus cannot survive long: \"The loss of the baby is sadly inevitable.\"\n\nPreviously at her Catholic hospital, she would have offered to do what was best for the mother's health: terminate the pregnancy before she became infected, so she could go home to recover. Now she told patients that they had no choice but to wait until they went into labor or became infected, or until the fetus's heart stopped beating, slowly deprived of oxygen from its compressed umbilical cord, sometimes over the course of several days. Thomson did not know that a fetus could take so long to die this way-she was used to intervening much sooner. She found forcing her patients to wait like this \"morally disgusting.\"\n\n\"Every time I take care of a patient in this scenario, it makes me question why I'm staying here,\" she told me. It ate at her to put her own legal interests before her patients' health. She knew that if a zealous prosecutor decided she had acted too hastily, she could lose years of her career and her life defending herself, even if she were ultimately vindicated. But if she made a \"self-protective\" decision to delay care and a patient died, she wasn't sure how she could go on. \"From a moral perspective, that's something that you won't recover from as a doctor.\"\n\nAt St. Luke's, the largest hospital in Idaho, doctors started airlifting some patients with complications like previable PPROM out of state after the trigger ban took effect. Rather than delay care to comply with the law, they felt that the better-or, really, less bad-option was to get women care sooner by transferring them to Oregon, Washington, or Utah.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court stayed the injunction allowing emergency abortions for a mother's health, in January 2024, Idaho doctors became even more cautious about performing abortions, and the transfers picked up. Over the next three and a half months alone, St. Luke's airlifted six pregnant women out of state . Smaller hospitals, too, transferred patients they would have previously treated.\n\nOne woman described fearing for her life as she was sent away from St. Luke's last year, after losing a liter of blood when her placenta began detaching inside her. \"I couldn't comprehend,\" she later told The New York Times . \"I'm standing in front of doctors who know exactly what to do and how to help and they're refusing to do it.\" Another woman whose water broke early went into labor en route to Portland, her doctor told me, and delivered her fetus hundreds of miles from home. Her baby did not survive, and she was left to figure out how to get back to Idaho by herself-a medical transport is only a one-way ride. Another became infected and turned septic in the hours it took her to get to Salt Lake City. She had to go to the ICU, says Lauren Theilen, an MFM at the Utah hospital where she was taken. Other patients were sick when they left Idaho and even sicker when they arrived somewhere else.\n\nWhere exactly was that line between a patient who could be transferred versus one who needed care immediately, then and there? \"I have sometimes wondered if I'm being selfish,\" says Stacy Seyb, a longtime MFM at St. Luke's, by putting patients through medical transfer to avoid legal sanction. But no doctor works alone in today's hospitals. When one of the first legally ambiguous cases came up, Seyb saw the unease in the eyes of his team: the nurses, the techs, the anesthesiologists, the residents-all the people who normally assist in an emergency abortion. If he did something legally risky, they would also be exposed. Idaho's law threatens to revoke the license of any health-care professional who assists in an abortion. He came to feel that there was no good option to protect both his team and his patients, but that an out-of-state transfer was often the least terrible one. In Portland or Seattle or Salt Lake City, health-care providers do not have to weigh their own interests against their patients'.\n\nIn April, when the Supreme Court heard the Idaho case, the media seized upon the dramatic image of women being airlifted out of state for emergency abortions. Justice Elena Kagan made a point of asking about it in oral arguments. In a press conference afterward, Idaho's attorney general, Raúl Labrador, pushed back on the idea that airlifts were happening, citing unnamed doctors who said they didn't know of any such instances. If women were being airlifted, he said, it was unnecessary, because emergency abortions were already allowed to save the life of the mother. \"I would hate to think,\" he added, \"that St. Luke's or any other hospital is trying to do something like this just to make a political statement.\" (St. Luke's had filed an amicus brief with the Court in support of the federal government.)\n\nLabrador's comments echoed accusations from national anti-abortion groups that doctors and others who support abortion rights are sowing confusion in order to \"sabotage\" the laws. When Moon, the chair of the Idaho Republican Party, had rallied lawmakers against any health exceptions back in 2023, she'd also evoked the specter of \"doctors educated in some of the farthest Left academic institutions in our country.\" (Neither Labrador nor Moon responded to my requests for an interview.)\n\nIt is true that doctors tend to support abortion access. But in Idaho, many of the ob-gyns critical of the ban are not at all pro-abortion. Maria Palmquist grew up speaking at Right to Life rallies, as the eldest of eight in a Catholic family. She still doesn't believe in \"abortion for birth control,\" she told me, but medical school had opened her eyes to the tragic ways a pregnancy can go wrong. Lately, she's been sending articles to family members, to show that some women with dangerous pregnancies need abortions \"so they can have future children.\"\n\nKim Cox, the doctor who told me about a patient who had a relatively healthy child after PPROM at 16 weeks, practices in heavily Mormon eastern Idaho. Cox said that \"electively terminating\" at any point in a pregnancy is \"offensive to me and offensive to God.\" But he also told me about a recent patient whose water had broken at 19 weeks and who wanted a termination that he was prepared to provide-until he realized it was legally dicey. He thought the dangers of such cases were serious enough that women should be able to decide how much risk they wanted to tolerate. Because, I ventured, they might already have a kid at home? \"Or 10 kids at home.\"\n\nMegan Kasper, an ob-gyn in Nampa, Idaho, who considers herself pro-life, told me she \"never dreamed\" that she would live to see Roe v. Wade overturned. But Idaho's law went too far even for her. If doctors are forced to wait until death is a real possibility for an expecting mother, she said, \"there's going to be a certain number of those that you don't pull back from the brink.\" She thought the law needed an exception for the health of the mother.\n\nIn the two-plus years since the end of Roe , no doctor has yet been prosecuted in Idaho or any other state for performing an abortion-but who wants to test the law by being the first? Doctors are risk-averse. They're rule followers, Kasper told me, a sentiment I heard over and over again: \"I want to follow the rules.\" \"We tend to be rule followers.\" \"Very good rule followers.\" Kasper said she thought that, in some cases, doctors have been more hesitant to treat patients or more willing to transfer them than was necessary. But if the law is not meant to be as restrictive as it reads to doctors, she said, then legislators should simply change it. \"Put it in writing.\" Make it clear.\n\nShe does wonder what it would mean to test the law. Kasper has a somewhat unusual background for a doctor. She was homeschooled, back when it was still illegal in some states, and her parents routinely sent money to legal-defense funds for other homeschoolers. \"I grew up in a family whose values were It's okay to take risks to do the right thing ,\" she told me. She still believes that. \"There's a little bit of my rebel side that's like, Cool, Raúl Labrador, you want to throw me in jail? You have at it .\" Prosecuting \"one of the most pro-life OBs\" would prove, wouldn't it, just how extreme Idaho had become on abortion.\n\nWhen I visited Boise in June, doctors were on edge; the Supreme Court's decision on emergency abortions was expected at any moment. On my last day in town, the Court accidentally published the decision early: The case was going to be dismissed, meaning it would return to the lower court. The injunction allowing emergency abortions would, in the meantime, be reinstated.\n\nAs the details trickled out, I caught up with Thomson, who was, for the moment, relieved. She had an overnight shift that evening, and the tight coil of tension that had been lodged inside her loosened with the knowledge that EMTALA would soon be back in place, once the Court formally issued its decision. Doctors at St. Luke's also felt they could stop airlifting patients out of state for emergency abortions.\n\nBut Thomson grew frustrated when she realized that this was far from the definitive ruling she had hoped for. The decision was really a nondecision . In dismissing the case, the Court did not actually resolve the conflict between federal and state law, though the Court signaled openness to hearing the case again after another lower-court decision. The dismissal also left in place a separate injunction, from a federal appeals court, that had blocked enforcement of EMTALA in Texas , meaning that women in a far larger and more populous state would still be denied emergency abortions. This case, too, has been appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\nMoreover, the federal emergency-treatment law has teeth only if an administration chooses to enforce it, by fining hospitals or excluding them from Medicare and Medicaid when they fail to comply. The Biden administration has issued guidance that says it may sanction hospitals and doctors refusing to provide emergency abortion care, and as vice president, Kamala Harris has been a particularly vocal advocate for abortion access. A Trump administration could simply decide not to enforce the rule-a proposal that is outlined explicitly in Project 2025 , the Heritage Foundation's blueprint for a second Trump term. If the emergency-treatment law is a mere \"Band-Aid,\" as multiple doctors put it to me, it is one that can be easily torn off. ﻿\n\nEMTALA is also limited in scope. It covers only patients who show up at an ER, and only those with emergency pregnancy complications. It would not apply to women in Idaho whose pregnancies are made more dangerous by a range of serious but not yet urgent conditions (to say nothing of the women who might want to end a pregnancy for any number of nonmedical reasons). It would not apply to the woman carrying triplets who, as an MFM recounted to me, wanted a reduction to twins because the third fetus had no skull and thus could not live. She had to go out of state to have the procedure-tantamount to an abortion for just one fetus-which made the pregnancy safer for her and the remaining babies. And it did not apply when Kayla Smith, already grieving for her unborn son, worried about preeclampsia. Her family ultimately left Idaho for Washington, so she could have another child in a safer state; her younger daughter was born in late 2023.\n\nFrom the June 1969 issue: The right of abortion\n\nSmith has joined a lawsuit filed by the Center for Reproductive Rights challenging the limited scope of exceptions under Idaho's ban. A group in Idaho is also planning a ballot initiative that will put the question of abortion to voters-but not until 2026. In the meantime, doctors still want Idaho to add medical exceptions to the law. After the disappointingly narrow exceptions the state legislature passed in 2023, it did nothing more in its 2024 session. A hearing that Thomson was slated to speak at this spring got canceled, last minute, by Republicans, who control the legislature.\n\nStill, Thomson told me she was set on staying in Idaho. She and her husband had moved their family here 11 years ago because they wanted their four kids to \"feel like they're from somewhere.\" Having grown up in a Navy family, she'd moved every few years during her own childhood before joining the military for medical school and continuing to move every few years as a military doctor. When her son was just 14 months old, she deployed to Iraq. She got her job in Idaho after that. When she and her husband bought their house, she told him this was the house she planned to live in for the rest of her life.\n\nIn the past two years, she'd seriously wavered on that decision for the first time. The moral distress of practicing under the ban had sent her to see a counselor. \"I was in a war zone,\" she told me, \"and I didn't see a counselor.\" This past fall, she came up with a backup plan: If she had to, she could stop practicing in Idaho and become a traveling doctor, seeing patients in other states.\n\nBut then she thought about all the women in Idaho who couldn't afford to leave the state for care. And she thought of her kids, especially her three girls, who would soon no longer be girls. The eldest is 20, the same age as a patient whose baby she had recently delivered. \"This could be my daughter,\" Thomson thought. If everyone like her left, she wondered, who would take care of her daughters?\n\nThis article appears in the October 2024 print edition with the headline \"What Abortion Bans Do to Doctors.\""

      "text": "One Woman's Abortion\n\nIn 1965, eight years before Roe v. Wade , an anonymous woman described the steps she took to terminate an unwanted pregnancy.\n\nNearly everywhere in the world families now have the right to limit the number of children they will conceive, according to their ability to love and cherish, feed, house, clothe, and educate them. The need for similar adult freedom of action to terminate accidental and unwanted pregnancies, for personal and social reasons as well as therapeutic ones, is being discussed covertly and sometimes openly by church, lay, and medical groups.\n\nWhat are the facts about abortion in the United States today? How widely is it resorted to and by whom? What percentage is legal (therapeutic) and what illegal? Are its illegal practitioners sinister moneygrubbers without skill, knowledge, or proper instruments, or are they licensed physicians? Is the operation as potentially dangerous as generations of women have been led to believe?\n\nReliable statistics are, naturally enough, hard to get in the United States, though they are readily available from such countries as Sweden, Denmark, Russia, and Japan, where abortion is, in varying cases, legal. Nobody who places a bet with a bookmaker has any particular hesitation about admitting it, but few women, gossips or not, discuss their abortions at the bridge table. Lack of discussion probably has nothing to do with shame or reticence but is simply a loyal conspiracy of silence on the part of women to protect abortionists. Any woman of childbearing age who knows a reliable man in this field has a stake in keeping him in business. She may need him herself, or have a close friend who will.\n\nI set out recently to find an abortionist in the large Eastern city where I live. My husband and I are in our mid-forties and have three children. When I discovered that I was pregnant for the fourth time, my husband and I considered the situation as honestly as we could. We both admitted that we lacked the physical resources to face 2 A.M . feedings, diapers, and the seemingly endless cycle of measles, mumps, and concussions of another child. Years of keeping a wary eye on expenditures (a new suit for my husband every two years and one for me every five) had allowed us to set up a fund which we felt would enable the children to attend reasonably good colleges away from home if some financial assistance in the form of grants or scholarships could be obtained. Since my husband's income has reached its zenith, it was plain that one of the four would have to forgo all or part of a chance at higher education. The part-time secretarial work which I had been doing for some years to augment our income would have to stop since the revenue it produces would not cover baby-sitting fees. We have no rich uncles likely to make our children their beneficiaries. We have also had sufficient experience living to acknowledge that while the Lord will sometimes provide, He may be busy looking after somebody else when you need Him most.\n\nA brief foray for information in medical circles indicated that in the state where we live, legal grounds for abortion are limited to patients known to have cancer, ectopic (tubal or peritoneal) pregnancies, and in some rare instances, acute heart conditions or advanced psychoses.\n\nI spent a brief moment of reflective gratitude for a clean bill of health on these counts, and then pushed my glasses up on my nose to read a book called Pregnancy, Birth and Abortion , written by four members of the Institute for Sex Research, founded by the late renowned Dr. Kinsey. It turned out to be most reassuring, though it probably wasn't intended to be. I discovered that abortion is an operation that all med students learn, even if they don't get much chance to perfect techniques; that of the institute's sample, only a minute percentage of women had suffered either physical or psychic aftereffects; and that while the authors made no attempt to estimate the number of abortions performed every year in the United States, it was plain that even without the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, I had lots of company.\n\nCalmed by authoritative word and two tranquilizers, I settled down to see what could be done. First step was a visit to my obstetrician. (The boys from the institute indicated that probably every doctor in the country had been asked at least once to perform an abortion, and there was some evidence that out of compassion many had obliged.) Mine had run out of compassion by the time I saw him at 6 P.M. , or else was too worried about getting his snowbound car out of the parking lot to pay much attention to me. He verified by pelvic examination the positive rabbit-test result which had previously very nearly guaranteed that I was pregnant, and refused to interfere with nature. When I asked him whether he would perform an abortion on me, he said, \"No, thanks,\" in an absent way, as if I had offered him a cigarette he didn't want, and I left.\n\nWith the only legal avenue I knew closed, I began my search for illegal ones. I started out by going through my personal address and telephone book and selecting from it five close friends who had the following in common: all were intelligent, well educated, sympathetic, and discreet. Otherwise, they were a mixed lot. Some were married, some divorced or widowed; some were young, some middle-aged; two were Protestant, one was Jewish, one Catholic, and the fifth a scoffer. Of the five, one had, to my knowledge, herself had an abortion, but that was too long ago to lead me to suppose her operator was still at the same old stand.\n\nI called each and stated bluntly that I needed an abortion and asked whether she knew anybody reasonably reliable who might do the job. Two (in addition to the one I have already mentioned) said that they themselves had obtained abortions within the last two years. Each gave me without hesitation the name, address, and telephone number of her physician. The fourth friend did a little detective work and in twenty-four hours came up with another physician, chiefly remarkable for the fact that his office was directly across the street from one of the city's police precinct stations. Fees, I was told, ranged from $300 to $750. My fifth contact got A for effort but was able to glean information only on a sort of disassembly-line procedure in a neighboring state, reputed to be supervised by a doctor. I discarded this as too shady for a middle-aged woman with obligations to a family and sat down to call the physicians.\n\nMy first call was made to the doctor whose credentials seemed to me best. When I asked for an appointment at his early convenience, he replied-somewhat nervously, I thought-that he was considering taking a trip and asked that I call back next week. Number two on my list proved able to see me the following day. My visit did a good deal to quell the panic which had been building steadily in spite of my efforts at self-control. The office seemed orderly, the tools of the trade were neatly arrayed in the glass cases dear to the hearts of the medical fraternity; the doctor's examination was brief and businesslike, and as far as I could tell identical with those performed on me over the years by obstetricians and gynecologists under different circumstances. He explained in simple and understandable terms exactly how he would perform the operation, how long it would take, that it would be painful, but not intolerably so, for a few minutes. (I gather that except for abortions done in hospitals, anesthetics are almost never used. For obvious reasons, these physicians work without assistance of any kind. They are thus not equipped to deal with the possible ill effects of anesthesia; nor can they keep patients in their offices for any great length of time without arousing suspicion about their practices.) The doctor I was consulting described precisely the minimal aftereffects I might expect. We fixed a date at mutual convenience a couple of days off for the operation.\n\nThis particular M.D. was able to strike a nice balance between willingness to help and lack of overeagerness to collect his $500, payable in advance. He stated frankly that he felt the element of physical risk was negligible but that the myths and exaggerations about abortion and the hard fact that it was an illegal procedure created prior apprehensions of sometimes damaging proportions. He urged me to call him and cancel the appointment if my husband and I felt there was any reason to reconsider our decision. Short of physical and fiscal miracles we had no right to expect, I didn't see what could alter our circumstances and told him so, but I agreed wholeheartedly about the apprehensions.\n\nThe operation was successfully concluded as scheduled. Forty-five minutes after I entered the doctor's office for the second time, I walked out, flagged a passing cab, and went home. Admirably relaxed for the first time in two weeks, I dozed over dinner, left the children to wash the dishes, and dove into bed to sleep for twelve hours. The operation and its aftereffects were exactly as described by the physician. For some five minutes I suffered \"discomfort\" closely approximating the contractions of advanced labor. Within ten minutes this pain subsided, and returned in the next four or five days only as the sort of mild twinge which sometimes accompanies a normal menstrual period. Bleeding was minimal.\n\nPost hoc, my conclusions are these:\n\n1. If five people, of my limited acquaintance, knew five different abortionists in active practice within a few square miles of each other, I find myself wondering if the abortion rate must not parallel the live birth rate in the United States.\n\n2. Four of the five abortionists recommended to me were duly licensed physicians. Is this extraordinary, or are the dark tales about all abortions being performed in filthy surroundings by unskilled practitioners using knitting needles exaggerated?\n\n3. My operation at least was performed with what seemed to me incredible proficiency, speed, and deftness, with sterile instruments designed for the purpose for which they were used. The Kinsey Institute is welcome to add me to its conclusions, which are that though they have been able to interview few abortionists, they are much impressed with the skill, humanity, and understanding these few showed for their patients.\n\nI am sure that my experience is not unique. There must be hundreds like me from coast to coast who for sober and considered reasons daily undergo the same fears, search for the same kinds of operative sources, and find the money necessary to terminate unwanted pregnancy.\n\nSome states are less rigid in enforcing antiabortion statutes than others. The low nationwide rate of convictions obtained against abortionists perhaps points not only to the difficulty of obtaining evidence against them but also to the acknowledgment by law enforcement agencies of the real necessity of such practices. As the Kinsey group says, \"In our own sample we find that the great percentage of the women who had an illegal abortion stated that it had been the best solution to their immediate problem. This widespread difference between our overt culture as expressed in our laws and public pronouncements and our covert culture as expressed in what people actually do and secretly think is as true with abortion as with most types of sexual behavior.\"\n\nIs the time coming when we can rid ourselves of one more hypocrisy, closing the gap between what we do and what we say we do? Therapeutic abortion practices will have to lead the way. There is some evidence that the first steps have been taken. Grounds for therapeutic abortion vary widely from state to state and from city to city. Unfavorable Rh factors, for instance, are considered reason to terminate pregnancy by some physicians in some areas, as is a case of German measles suffered in the early stages of pregnancy. Social grounds for abortion could follow, under the surveillance of abortion boards composed of M.D.'s and psychiatrists. (Such boards exist in many areas but are generally rubber-stamp groups who are notified by a physician that he will be performing a therapeutic abortion on date fixed by him in the hospital of his choice.)\n\nI believe that dilation and curettage is the only method of abortion used, legally or illegally by most physicians in this country. Though the operation is a relatively simple one, it remains an operative procedure with some attendant risk of infection, however small, whether performed without anesthesia, in a hospital or in a doctor's office. Again citing the Kinsey group: \"It is already evident that it would not be difficult to develop effective and safe abortifacients, including some to be taken orally. The fact that such a development has not been made is largely a moral matter. \"\n\nThe italics are mine. Is it moral to inflict anguish, fear of fine or imprisonment, and terror about illicit practices on families who have sound social reasons for terminating an unwanted pregnancy? If it is moral to prevent conception, is it immoral to interrupt an ill-advised one?"

      "text": "Arizona State Senator Shares Own Emotional Abortion Story in Floor Speech\n\nBreaking News Intern\n\nPart of Eva Burch's job is to make policy decisions as an elected senator in the Arizona State Legislature. But earlier this month, she found herself on the receiving end of her colleagues' strict laws on abortion .\n\nBurch rose at the end of a floor session on Monday to share her personal experience with an unwanted pregnancy and call for better legislation in Arizona, where abortion is outlawed after 15 weeks.\n\nThe senator recently learned that she was pregnant, but that there was no chance for her to carry the pregnancy to term. Because of Arizona's restrictive health care laws, Burch experienced firsthand the reproductive realities that the Legislature had created.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"My experiences-both as a provider and as a patient-have led me to believe that this Legislature has failed the people of Arizona,\" Burch, who is a nurse practitioner by training, said on the floor.\n\n\"Pregnancy is not a health-neutral condition,\" she told the chamber. \"We have to be honest about the balance of risk and reward, and why abortion can often be the right health care choice.\"\n\nBurch went on to describe the unnecessary procedures she was forced to undergo, including a trans-vaginal ultrasound neither she nor her doctor wanted, and a round of what she described as \"absolute disinformation\" about other options.\n\n\"I was told that there were alternatives to abortion, parenting or adoption among them-as though delivering a healthy baby were an option for me. It is not,\" Burch said.\n\nShe added that Arizona's strict abortion laws made it difficult for doctors and medical providers to make complex decisions with patients who needed them.\n\n\"All that the Legislature has done is to nurture distrust and confusion in the relationship between patients and providers and people who are vulnerable enough,\" she said on the floor.\n\nBurch's career as a health care provider has helped her understand just how delicate those cases can be.\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Beast, she mentioned her current work in the opioid use disorder space, which has \"its own set of complexities\" when patients are pregnant.\n\n\"I see so many of the hardships and of the really difficult decision-making processes that people have to go through, and I want them to be supported in their decision making,\" she said. \"I want us operating in the reality of the situations people are experiencing.\"\n\nOn the floor, the senator said that because of her privileges-a supportive family, a stable job, the ability to pay for doctor's visits and take time away from work if needed-she could navigate, however painfully, the restrictive and confusing health care system as she sought to terminate her pregnancy. But many other women, including survivors of sexual violence, don't have those same privileges-and to have no further say in their pregnancies could seriously traumatize them.\n\n\"Arizonans deserve freedom and liberty to make those decisions for themselves,\" she said. \"I will never try to force anyone to have an abortion; nobody should ever try to prevent me from having mine.\"\n\nBreaking News Intern\n\namanda.yen@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

Bush and Donald Trump did to her when they appointed those Supreme Court justices,\" O'Donnell said, before reading from the story, which notes that the woman needed a procedure called a dilation and curettage (D&C ), which removes tissue from the inside of the uterus.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGeorgia's Republican legislators decided that performing the routine procedure should be a felony.\n\nThe anchor of The Last Word , who called out Trump for \"pretending that he has no blood on his hands,\" then informed his viewers that his mother required that same procedure when he was 6 years old.\n\n\"My mother had given birth to five healthy children, but she kept going. She was trying, trying to have a sister for her only daughter. Trying for one more. And she suffered a miscarriage, and she routinely had a D&C at a local hospital in Boston years before abortion was legal because a D&C has absolutely nothing to do with abortion,\" O'Donnell said.\n\n\"None of the Catholic nuns teaching me at my elementary school then thought my mother should not have that procedure. Our beloved Monsignor Brandley knew that when mothers in St. Brendan's Parish had miscarriages, doctors should give them whatever treatment they needed,\" O'Donnell explained.\n\n\"Anti-abortion Catholic doctors performed the procedure routinely. There wasn't a single Irish Catholic politician in Boston-including the mayor and district attorney-who ever tried to interfere with that medical procedure,\" he went on. \"Their sisters were having that procedure, their daughters were having that procedure routinely in anti-abortion Boston because it has nothing to do with abortion. Nothing.\"\n\nO'Donnell then imagined a scenario in which what is playing out right now had happened to his mother back then.\n\n\"If a politician interfered with that procedure and killed-,\" O'Donnell began, catching his breath. \"-Killed my mother when I was 6 years old, who is going to tell that boy? Who is going to tell that 6-year-old how his mother died and who is really responsible?\"\n\nTo do what Republicans in Georgia have done is \"sheer madness, criminal madness, murderous madness,\" he stated.\n\nO'Donnell compared their actions to outlawing IVF (in vitro fertilization), noting that Republican senators on Tuesday blocked legislation establishing a national right to IVF. Only two of the chamber's 49 Republicans joined Democrats in favor of the bill.\n\nTrump recently declared the Republican Party to be a \"leader on IVF.\" But his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance , chose to campaign rather than cast a vote.\n\nwilliam.vaillancourt@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "Trump Punts on Abortion in Announcement Sure to Anger Conservatives\n\nFormer President Donald Trump , whose position on abortion has been unclear for the better part of his campaign, said Monday that abortion access should be decided on a state-to-state basis and punted on what he believes the cutoff should be.\n\nIn a much-anticipated video posted to Truth Social on Monday morning, Trump boasted about getting Roe v. Wade overturned and said that because of the ruling, abortion is a state's issue and that each state should decide its own law \"by vote or legislation or perhaps both.\"\n\n\"Whatever they decide must be the law of the land,\" Trump said. \"In this case, the law of the state. Many states will be different. Many will have a different number of weeks, or some will have more conservative than others and that's what they will be. At the end of the day, this is all about the will of the people.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLeaving the issue up to the states and not taking a position on any weekly cutoff for a federal abortion ban is sure to anger conservatives who want a federal abortion ban, and it will likely upset those who support abortion rights but are living in a state where it is banned.\n\nHowever, Trump made clear that he supported exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother-an exception many states do not have enshrined into law.\n\n\"I am strongly in favor of exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother. You must follow your heart on this issue,\" he said.\n\nAt times, the former president has teased the possibility of supporting a federal abortion ban, saying in a March radio interview that a lot of \"people are agreeing on 15 [weeks] and I'm thinking in terms of that.\" Still, he refused to give a firm position.\n\nBut after Florida's six-week abortion ban was implemented last week and abortion rights were put on the state's November ballot, Trump told reporters he would be making a statement on it in the coming weeks. President Joe Biden responded by posting a picture of Trump bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade saying, \"You already made your statement, Donald.\"\n\nNow Trump's position is to punt it to the states and leave it to them to decide how abortion is handled on a state-by-state basis.\n\n\"This 50 year battle over Roe v. Wade took it out of the federal hands and brought it into the hearts, minds and votes of the people of each state, was really something. Now it's up to the states to do the right thing,\" Trump said.\n\nSoon after the former president's announcement Monday morning, the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List released a statement saying it is \"deeply disappointed\" in Trump's position. However, it said it will continue to work to defeat Biden in November.\n\n\"Saying the issue is 'back to the states' cedes the national debate to the Democrats who are working relentlessly to enact legislation mandating abortion throughout all nine months of pregnancy. If successful, they will wipe out states' rights,\" the group said.\n\nAfter Trump's announcement, Biden released a scathing assessment of the former president's position on abortion, reiterating that he alone is responsible for Roe v. Wade being overturned and \"for creating the cruelty and the chaos that has enveloped America since the Dobbs decision.\"\n\nTrump's belief that abortion is solely a state's issue is nonsense, Biden added, and if Trump is re-elected, a national abortion ban will follow.\n\n\"Let there be no illusion. If Donald Trump is elected and the MAGA Republicans in Congress put a national abortion ban on the Resolute Desk, Trump will sign it into law,\" Biden said.\n\nreese.gorman@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Hannity Backs Trump's Call to Reverse Arizona Abortion Ban\n\nHours after Republicans in the Arizona legislature declined to repeal the state's extremely restrictive abortion ban, Fox News host Sean Hannity assured viewers Wednesday that the new law will be \"fixed in the next week or two\"-and then echoed Donald Trump by calling on the state's Democratic governor and attorney general to \"get rid of it.\"\n\n\"The people on the left are so desperate attacking Trump, now for an Arizona Supreme Court ruling that upholds what is a Civil War-era law banning abortion. This will be fixed in the next week or two. Let not your heart be troubled. I can pretty much assure that that will happen,\" said Hannity, who prior to the end of Roe v. Wade claimed there would be no \"loss of abortion access.\"\n\nThe Fox host told viewers that Trump has said he opposes the Arizona Supreme Court's decision to overturn a 15-week ban in favor of a 1864 law banning abortions in all cases except to save the mother's life. Yet in his comments Wednesday, Trump tried to have it both ways by claiming that the issue is still \"all about states' rights.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"It'll be straightened out and as you know, it's all about states' rights,\" the former president said. \"It'll be straightened out, and I'm sure that the governor and everybody else are going to bring it back into reason and that'll be taken care of, I think, very quickly.\"\n\nHannity then suggested that Democrats bear some responsibility.\n\n\"And you know what? Arizona's governor is a Democrat. The state's attorney general is a Democrat. The state legislature is almost evenly divided,\" Hannity said opaquely, not bothering to admit that Republicans hold a slim majority in both the House and Senate.\n\n\"If Democrats-you want to get rid of the law? Well, you have a chance right now to get rid of it, and I would advise you: Get rid of it,\" he said.\n\nEarlier in the day, Arizona Republicans in the House instead opted to table a motion to do just that.\n\nNevertheless, Hannity insisted that Democrats \"would rather use it as a political tool ahead of November.\"\n\nThe Arizona high court's ruling has compounded Republicans' abortion quagmire that set in after the Supreme Court's conservative majority overturned Roe v. Wade two summers ago. Arizona Senate candidate Kari Lake, for instance, has spoken out against the ruling despite having praised what it would entail earlier this month.\n\nwilliam.vaillancourt@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "The Fight Over the Abortion Pill Is Only Just Beginning\n\nSenior Reporter\n\nAbortion rights advocates celebrated the Supreme Court's decision to toss out a challenge to the abortion pill Thursday, calling it a \"unanimous win\" and \"incredibly good news\" for reproductive freedoms.\n\nBut the fight over the abortion pill-the two-drug regimen that makes up more than 60 percent of abortions in the US-is far from over.\n\n\"This case really represents the kind of opening shot on the anti-abortion movements' attack on abortion pills,\" Greer Donley, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh, told The Daily Beast. \"The very beginning, not even close to the end.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled unanimously Thursday that the group of conservative doctors who sued to roll back the FDA's approval of mifepristone-one of the drugs most commonly used in medication abortions-did not have standing to bring the case because they did not prescribe or use the medication themselves.\n\nThe case was first brought by the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine (AHM), an umbrella organization of anti-abortion doctors who argued that the FDA had not adequately considered safety concerns  when it expanded access to mifepristone in 2016. (Studies have shown the drug is safer than penicillin and Viagra.)\n\nThe medication is a prime target for conservatives because of how often it is used to perform abortions and how relatively easy it is to dispense. Doctors in states where abortion is legal have been prescribing abortion pills to patients in states where it was banned since the fall of Roe v Wade in 2022, much to the chagrin of Republican politicians.\n\nThe Supreme Court did not rule on the merits of the AHM suit, simply on the doctors' ability to bring it. While that decision allows mifepristone to continue being used in medication abortions for now, experts said, it leaves the door open for other attacks on the drug.\n\nThree states-Idaho, Missouri, and Kansas-joined the dispute in a lower court in Texas earlier this year. The Supreme Court did not allow them to join at the federal level, but they are now free to proceed in the state court-the same one that sided with the AHM and blocked mifepristone access nationwide before higher courts stepped in.\n\nThe AHM specifically mentioned those states in a defiant statement it issued after the ruling, saying it was \"disappointed with the court's decision\" but would \"continue to advocate for women and work to restore commonsense safeguards for abortion drugs.\"\n\n\"We are grateful that three states stand ready to hold the FDA accountable for jeopardizing the health and safety of women and girls across this country,\" the Alliance said.\n\nIn a briefing with reporters, Erin Hawley-the lawyer who argued the AHM's case and the wife of Republican Sen. Josh Hawley -said the fact that the court did not rule on the merits of the case left her \"encouraged and hopeful that the FDA will be held to account,\" according to NPR .\n\nA general view of the U.S. Supreme Court building, with members of a student group in the foreground, in Washington, U.S., June 1, 2024.\n\nMary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, told The Daily Beast there were plenty of other groups looking to mount their own court battle if the states failed.\n\n\"Some of the cities and counties that define themselves as 'sanctuary cities for the unborn' have suggested they want to do that,\" she said. \"So we're not limiting it to just the people who have already proceeded, but the people who could.\"\n\nAnd the fact that the AHM case made it to the Supreme Court at all can be seen as a victory for the right, Greer added-as well as a sign of how partisain the courts have become. She said the plaintiff's case for standing was shaky at best, and should have been dismissed by the first judge on the case, the Trump-appointed Texas district court judge Matthew Kacsmaryk.\n\n\"Matthew Kacsmaryk, is an ideologue, essentially,\" Greer said. \"He basically rubber stamps whatever the anti-abortion movement throws at him. So you're left with the Supreme Court being the only place that you can attempt to have a fair hearing.\"\n\n\"And of course, we're talking about the Supreme Court that overturned Roe v Wade ,\" she added. \"So we're not talking about a moderate Supreme Court.\"\n\nThere are also risks to the abortion pill outside the courts, especially if Donald Trump is elected president in November. According to Greer, Trump could appoint his own head of the FDA and direct them to overturn the agency's approval of mifepristone, arriving at much the same outcome as if the Alliance had won at the Supreme Court.\n\nTrump's allies are also pushing for him to enforce the Comstock Act, a long-defunct law that bans anything used in an abortion from being sent by mail. If he is successful in enforcing it, the law would threaten anyone who sent abortion drugs by mail with jail time.\n\nThe Biden-Harris campaign hosted a press call shortly after the verdict to impress upon voters the effects a Trump presidency could have on access to the pill.\n\n\"This case brought on by Donald Trump's allies was only one tactic in a broader, relentless strategy to strip away access to reproductive freedom everywhere in this country,\" campaign manager Julie Chávez Rodríguez told reporters, adding that a Trump presidency would threaten access to the medication \"in every single state-even where abortion remains legal.\"\n\nAnd other abortion advocates acknowledged Thursday that the case was only the opening salvo in the war against medication abortion. Brittany Fonteno, President and CEO of National Abortion Federation, said in a statement that the group was \"outraged that this case got as far as it did in the first place,\" adding that it was \"part of anti-abortion extremists' wider, politically-motivated agenda to ban abortion nationwide.\"\n\nCecile Richards, former president of Planned Parenthood, told The New York Times that other states were already attempting to make abortion pills harder to get, noting how Louisiana recently made the medication a controlled substance.\n\n\"I know from years of experience that women will do anything to end a pregnancy that they don't want, and I fear that what the Supreme Court is doing, and anti-abortion politicians, they're just making it more difficult, more costly, and threatening women's health and their lives,\" she said.\n\nSenior Reporter\n\nGot a tip?

They ruled the law can be enforced in 14 days, and until then the parties can raise additional constitutional questions with a lower court.\n\nThe decision follows a ruling from the Florida Supreme Court last week allowing a six-week abortion ban to take effect there, bringing the number of states with near-total abortion bans to 16.\n\nAn umbrella group called Arizona for Abortion Access announced last week it has gathered enough signatures to place a measure on the November ballot asking voters to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution.\n\nMuch like in Florida, where advocates lined up a similar ballot measure, experts believe it could bring more Democratic voters to the Arizona polls in November.\n\nIn a statement after the decision was released, Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee President Heather Williams called Arizona \"one of the most important battlegrounds in 2024,\" adding that Democrats are \"just a handful of seats away from flipping each chamber of the Arizona state legislature.\"\n\nMeanwhile, avowedly anti-abortion Republicans like Lake, who is running against U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego (D) for an Arizona Senate seat, attempted to distance themselves from the decision.\n\nLake, who previously called the 1864 ban a \"great law,\" said she opposes Tuesday's ruling and called on the state legislature to come up with an \"immediate common sense solution that Arizonans can support.\"\n\n\"I am the only woman and mother in this race,\" Lake said in a statement. \"I wholeheartedly agree with President Trump-this is a very personal issue that should be determined by each individual state and her people.\"\n\nLake previously attempted to walk back her statements on the law-which she told a conservative radio host she would be \"thrilled\" to see take effect-in an interview with NBC News earlier this month.\n\nDespite reiterating her support of the territorial ban as recently as November 2023, Lake told NBC she no longer supports it, and said she \"trust[s] the people of Arizona to vote on this, if that's what happens, and get this right.\"\n\nGallego, meanwhile, called Tuesday's decision \"devastating\" and said politicians like Lake \"are forcing themselves into doctor's offices and ripping away the right for women to make their own healthcare decisions.\"\n\nLake was not the only anti-abortion lawmaker seeking distance. U.S. Rep. Juan Ciscomani, a Republican running for re-election in a vulnerable district in November, previously said abortion should be a left to the states but called the Arizona Supreme Court ruling a \"disaster\" on Tuesday.\n\n\"The territorial law is archaic,\" he said in a statement. \"We must do better and I call on our state policymakers to immediately address this in a bipartisan manner.\"\n\nCiscomani previously voted to ban the sale of abortion medication at retail pharmacies, to prohibit the Defense Department from paying for military members' abortions, and to prohibit the use of federal funds from paying for the procedure as part of larger spending and defense bills.\n\nRep. David Schweikert, another Republican running in a vulnerable district, said the issue should \"decided by Arizonans, not legislated from the bench\" and encouraged the state legislature to address the issue \"immediately.\"\n\nSchweikert previously sponsored the Life At Conception Act, a federal ban on abortion from the moment of conception.\n\nDemocrats and abortion rights supporters also denounced the decision, with Attorney General Kris Mayes calling the ban \"unconscionable\" and reiterating her vow not to prosecute anyone for violating it.\n\nAthena Salman, director of Arizona campaigns for Reproductive Freedom for All, said the law will \"put people in life-threatening situations and force many to flee the state for the care that they need.\"\n\n\"We won't stop fighting back alongside our partners to restore abortion access in Arizona,\" she said in a statement.\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Arizona said in a statement that  it would continue providing abortions through 15 weeks for \"a short period of time\" before the decision takes effect.\n\n\"Let me be clear, this is not the end of our fight,' said Planned Parenthood Arizona President Angela Florez. \"While today we feel frustrated and dismayed with the Court for stripping our legal right to essential health care, we must harness our anger and take action. We must spread the word and urge our lawmakers to support reproductive freedom and bodily autonomy.\"\n\nSenior Reporter\n\nPolitics Reporter\n\nriley.rogerson@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Dems Are Counting on Abortion Literally Being on the Ballot\n\nDeputy Politics Editor\n\nBefore the Arizona Supreme Court ruled last week to let the state's Civil War-era abortion ban stand, the campaign to put abortion rights directly on the state's ballot this November was coasting along.\n\nBut with a stroke of a pen, the court enacted what could be the harshest abortion ban in the country -and also unleashed a tsunami of energy behind a ballot initiative that could reverse that ban by allowing Arizonans to vote to secure the right to abortion in the state constitution.\n\nIt also could sway a Senate election and be decisive in the presidential contest.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDawn Penich, spokesperson for Arizonans For Abortion Access-the group that proposed the voter initiative and led the campaign to gather signatures required to qualify for the ballot since last year-told The Daily Beast that, since the ruling, there's been \"a tremendous surge of support and interest, both in people signing the petition, as well as wanting to become volunteers who circulate the petition.\"\n\nPenich added that the signatures \"are coming in so quickly, and in such high numbers all over the state, I don't even have my own internal number for today.\"\n\nRep. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), the Democratic candidate for Arizona's contested U.S. Senate seat, has instructed his volunteers to also carry petitions and literature for the abortion ballot initiative. After the court's decision, \"people are literally breaking down the door trying to get in there to sign the abortion initiative,\" Gallego told The Daily Beast.\n\nIn Arizona, one of the nation's top 2024 battlegrounds, the broader implications of the push are enormous. Democrats and organizers believe the ballot initiative could drive historic voter turnout, simultaneously lifting up President Joe Biden , Gallego, and other Democrats running in the state's key congressional and state legislative races.\n\n\"Women are scared. Of course they're going to turn out. There's zero doubt in my mind,\" Gallego told The Daily Beast.\n\nVoters, he predicted, are going to look at the politicians who said the 1864 ban was a great law, like his opponent Kari Lake , and \"they're going to punish them.\"\n\nClose observers in Arizona also feel a sea change coming. \"As it looks today, I can't imagine a better environment for the Democrats,\" said Chuck Coughlin, a longtime Arizona GOP pollster and strategist.\n\nBut this dynamic isn't unique to Arizona. Similar abortion ballot initiatives are reshaping the political landscape in a number of states that could decide control of the White House and Congress.\n\nDemocrats believe Republican candidates in these states will face stiff headwinds if they're on the ballot next to a proposed amendment to codify abortion rights at the highest levels.\n\n\"The choice and the contrast is very clear,\" said Sen. Tina Smith (D-MN), a former Planned Parenthood executive and a vice chair of the campaign arm for Senate Democrats. \"The fact that you have these initiatives on the ballot makes this issue even more salient to voters who are going to be turning out to vote.\"\n\nIn three states-Florida, Maryland, and New York-voters are guaranteed to see initiatives that would codify abortion rights. And in six others, campaigns are underway to gather the requisite number of signatures to get on the ballot: Nevada, Montana, Nebraska, Colorado, Arizona, and Missouri. (In two, South Dakota and Arkansas, ballot initiatives to secure some abortion access are proceeding, but they contain proposed limits that have alienated some activists.)\n\nWith a combined 17 electoral votes, Arizona and Nevada could be decisive in another tight Trump-Biden rematch. Those states, plus Montana, Maryland, and Florida, will host some of the most competitive Senate races of the year, and Democrats are already hammering GOP candidates in these states about their abortion records. Among the states that could see abortion ballot initiatives, Democrats have identified 18 competitive U.S. House races-several times the number needed to flip the chamber. The official campaign arm for House Democrats is tracking the push closely.\n\n\"When people head to the voting booth in November to defend their reproductive rights, these Republicans will be on the same ballot, and their unpopular anti-freedom records will cost them the election,\" said DCCC spokesman Viet Shelton.\n\nThe presence of those ballot questions will at least make it harder for Republicans to skirt questions about where they stand on abortion access.\n\nWhen asked about his stance on the possible Nebraska initiative, swing district Rep. Don Bacon (R-NE) didn't commit to a position. \"I just go with the voters, if that's where the voters are at,\" said Bacon, who expressed the sentiment multiple times when pressed.\n\nBacon told The Daily Beast he was an \"advocate for life\"-his record is strongly approved by anti-abortion groups -and argued most Nebraskans support abortion up until three months of pregnancy.\n\nThe potentially seismic impact of these ballot initiatives on the 2024 election was only made possible by the initial shock of the Supreme Court's Dobbs ruling in 2022 that overturned the national right to abortion.\n\nThe decision instantly turned every state into a battleground for abortion rights, with legislators imposing new restrictions or protections depending on the state. But abortion rights advocates have identified ballot initiatives as the most direct and effective way to give voters the ultimate say.\n\nWhen voters get that chance, they almost always vote to uphold abortion rights in large numbers-even in red states like Ohio and Kansas.\n\nIn 2024, the clearest impact of the ballot initiatives could be that it generates serious voter enthusiasm to head to the polls, addressing what has been the most persistent problem for Democrats with an unpopular Biden leading the ticket, said Coughlin.\n\n\"What you can say about this unequivocally is that it helps to resolve the enthusiasm problem on the Democratic side of the ticket,\" he said, adding that Arizona's initiative could make it much harder for the state's two swing-district Republicans, Reps. David Schweikert and Juan Ciscomani, to retain their seats.\n\nThe breadth of states where ballot initiative pushes are underway speaks to that groundswell of voter enthusiasm, say close observers.\n\n\"If you had talked to me a year ago, I would have been very surprised there were 11 measures moving at this juncture,\" said Sarah Standiford, the national campaigns director for ballot measures at Planned Parenthood Action Fund.\n\nIt's not guaranteed that all measures, or even most of them, will get enough signatures to successfully make the ballot. But Standiford expressed confidence in where many state efforts sit currently.\n\n\"I'm not going to make bets, but I do think we've done everything, they've done everything they can, collectively, to overcome the first set of obstacles,\" she said.\n\nThere's high enthusiasm for ballot initiatives even in states without as harsh of a ban as Arizona-or any ban at all.\n\nIn Nevada, for instance, abortion is legal up until 24 weeks of pregnancy under state law, which was codified in a 1990 referendum vote.\n\n\"People are coming up to our petition circulators-when they learn this initiative is about protecting abortion access, they want to sign it right away,\" said Tova Yampolsky, spokesperson for Nevadans For Reproductive Freedom, the group working to put an initiative before voters to make abortion a fundamental right under the state constitution.\n\nFrom the state-level branches of the Biden campaign to local campaigns, operatives are closely tracking these pushes and the impact they could have on their own races. In some states, Democratic campaigns cannot specifically communicate or coordinate with outside groups that are organizing the ballot initiatives, but the natural overlap between their constituencies means that\n\nWhen Vice President Kamala Harris visited Nevada last week for a campaign event focused on protecting abortion rights, for instance, canvassers for Nevadans For Reproductive Freedom were on site collecting signatures.\n\nWhat organizers stress, however, is a unique dynamic that shows the political power of abortion access. Many supporters of these ballot initiatives are not Democrats. When Ohio's Issue One abortion constitutional amendment was approved last year, the measure won majorities of voters in several counties Trump carried in 2020.\n\nWhen Nevada's campaign talks to voters about the issue, Yampolsky said, it's a different kind of political discussion. \"It's not a conversation about partisanship in any way,\" she said. \"It's about protecting our fundamental rights.\"\n\nOf course, there will be plenty of pushback to these initiatives from staunch conservatives, fueled by the well-organized and committed anti-abortion movement that has existed for decades.\n\nAsked to comment on the abortion ballot initiatives, a spokesperson for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, one of the leading national anti-abortion groups, referred The Daily Beast to their statement on the developments in Florida and Arizona.\n\nMarjorie Dannenfelser, the group's president, alleged the initiatives were \"written by the far Left\" and are fueled by \"hundreds of millions of dollars of left-wing money designed to deceive voters about their true intent.\"\n\n\"Pro-life candidates and officials must oppose them,\" said Dannenfelser, a highly influential figure in GOP politics.\n\nIn reality, a split will likely emerge among Republicans-those who try to avoid the ballot initiatives, and those who oppose them outright in order to keep their conservative base on board.\n\nAs Bacon's answer demonstrated, keeping a noncommittal distance is awkward. But the alternative might be even more awkward, as Kari Lake has shown in recent weeks.\n\nWhen Arizona's Supreme Court ruling came down, Lake joined other Arizona Republicans in condemning the return to a centuries-old law that predated the state joining the Union and calling on the legislature to find a solution. The legislature almost certainly won't. The ballot initiative is the clearest path to overturning Arizona's harsh ban, and Lake predicted that voters would. But at an event last week, she claimed the proposal, which would allow abortion up to 24 weeks of pregnancy, \"will eventually lead to abortion up to nine months.\"\n\nSmith, the Minnesota Democrat, told The Daily Beast that if ballot initiatives proceed in other states-like Montana, where Republican Tim Sheehy is trying to unseat Democratic Sen. Jon Tester-\"it will make it extremely difficult for him to fuzz up his position.\"\n\n\"He has to state clearly where he stands,\" Smith said of Sheehy.\n\nCoughlin, the GOP strategist and pollster in Arizona, said Republican candidates won't be able to have it both ways on the issue. \"Our consistent advice to all candidates is, do what you believe, do not get stuck in the middle of the road-and if you do, you're going to get hit by traffic in both directions.\"\n\nOrganizers of the ballot initiative pushes, while nonpartisan, appreciate how their efforts may not only secure abortion rights but have a clarifying effect on the entire political environment around the issue.\n\n\"In a post- Dobbs world, we also expect that every elected official will be making clear where they stand on our initiative,\" said Yampolsky, the Nevada organizer. \"We are expecting everyone running for office this year to be talking about this, whether they want to be or not.\"\n\nDeputy Politics Editor\n\nSam.Brodey@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

He allegedly told his inner circle that his reasoning is partially motivated by the appealing roundness of the number 16. \"It's even. It's exactly four months,\" he said. The comments shed new light on the presidential candidate 's stance toward abortion post- Roe : In the past, Trump avoided taking a clear position on the divisive issue, and has privately said he wants to wait until he has his party's nomination to avoid alienating those who want a stricter abortion ban. Yet, the sources said, Trump often asks for potential running mates' stances on abortion and is adamant that they support \"the three exceptions.\" The former president allegedly believes that the Supreme Court 's 2022 overturn of Roe v. Wade is directly responsible for Republican electoral losses since then-even though his appointment of three justices to a conservative court majority enabled that decision.\n\nBreaking News Intern\n\namanda.yen@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

Anti-abortion groups have sued the FDA attempting to ban a safe, effective drug used in medication abortion-a move that could inflame our abortion access crisis.\n\nThe groups suing in Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. FDA want the agency to withdraw their approval of mifepristone, one of the drugs used in the most common medication abortion protocol in the U.S.\n\nMifepristone has been on the market for more than 20 years, with a stellar record of safety and effectiveness and countless studies to back it up. This challenge to mifepristone has no sound scientific or legal rationale. This is a transparent effort to make abortion difficult or impossible for people to access, hand-delivered to Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a conservative federal judge in northern Texas with a record of disdain toward reproductive rights. Within a matter of days, this judge could block access to a drug used in more than half of abortions )\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://s.bl-1.com/h/dsKR4dq8?url=https:**Awww.guttmacher.org*article*2022*02*medication-abortion-now-accounts-more-half-all-us-abortions__;Ly8vLy8v!!LsXw!XMVh2uJgyNUaT6ON1bFbDNMGvG83kbKSUpDfpFjjzJpuLMCV-GBDr-C-lzI3cl-BRptkryZ4l5uwWlm8C7WOq5eXG7BLYsLJUWk-WQ$\">more than half of abortions in the U.S., even in states committed to supporting abortion access.\n\nOne patient recently came to my clinic seeking a medication abortion. She finished her work shift in eastern Texas at 6pm and drove 11 hours through the night to reach the clinic in Wichita, Kansas, by the morning. After receiving the medications-mifepristone and misoprostol-she drove back that day-all to minimize the costs of being out of work, staying away from home, and paying for childcare.\n\nIf mifepristone were banned, she still could have had a medication abortion using only misoprostol. Though it's safe and commonly used in other countries, this regimen punishes people seeking abortion with even more burdens-burdens that may be impossible for people to overcome. Using misoprostol only (without mifepristone) results in cramping and bleeding shortly after. People traveling out of state would either have to endure the process while driving or flying back home-or more likely, would have to stay longer in a state where they sought care, racking up bills for food, lodging, childcare, and losing wages for time they're not working.\n\nThere are reliable sources for getting mifepristone online, and people can safely take the medication and manage their own abortions. While only three states explicitly ban self-managed abortion, law enforcement has abused other laws in attempts to prosecute people, and health care providers have reported patients who seek follow-up care.\n\nCan't get enough from The Daily Beast? Subscribe to the twice-daily Beast Digest newsletter here .\n\nThe other option would be to have an in-clinic abortion. But clinics are already overwhelmed with demand and have long waitlists for people seeking procedures. Adding all the patients who otherwise would have chosen medication abortion will cripple these clinics. Abortion is a time-sensitive service. Taking mifepristone off the market would put it out of reach for even more people who need it.\n\nPeople with low incomes, and people of color who face structural barriers, are most likely to suffer as a result. They will have a harder time navigating the growing number of obstacles to care. They're more likely to be targeted by the criminal legal system if they manage their own abortions.

We get response from The Nation 's abortion access correspondent Amy Littlefield and talk about 10 states with abortion rights on the ballot, including Arizona, Nevada, Florida, South Dakota and Missouri. Trump's remarks are a \"succinct and clear definition of patriarchy,\" says Littlefield. She argues the 2024 election will be decided in large part by white women and whether they will vote for abortion rights. Trump is \"laying out the bargain that white patriarchy has offered for white women in this country,\" says Littlefield. \"He is saying, 'White women, we will protect you from Brown and Black men.'\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Just days away from Election Day, Kamala Harris campaigned in Arizona Thursday and blasted Donald Trump for saying he's going to protect women, quote, \"whether the women like it or not.\" Harris spoke from Phoenix just hours before Trump also made an appearance in Arizona as both candidates make a final push in battleground states.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS : And Donald Trump's not done. Did everyone hear what he just said yesterday? That he will do what he wants, quote - and here's where I'm going to quote - \"whether the women like it or not.\" And - and we must vote, because this is the thing. You know, there's a saying that you got to listen to people when they tell you who you are - who they are. And this is not the first time he has told us who he is. He does not believe women should have the agency and authority to make decisions about their own bodies. This is the same man who said women should be punished for their choices. He simply does not respect the freedom of women or the intelligence of women to know what's in their own best interests and make decisions accordingly.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Donald Trump was also in Arizona Thursday, where he campaigned with Tucker Carlson. Trump suggested former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney should face a firing squad. Cheney and her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, have both backed Harris in the race.\n\nDONALD TRUMP : And I don't blame him for sticking with his daughter, but his daughter is a very dumb individual, very dumb. She's a radical war hawk. Let's put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, OK? Let's see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This comes as voters in at least 10 states will decide on historic ballot measures that would enshrine abortion rights in their state constitutions, including in Arizona, Nevada, Florida, South Dakota, Nebraska and Missouri, which has one of the nation's strictest abortion bans that went into effect after the conservative-majority Supreme Court gutted Roe v. Wade in 2022. The Associated Press reports proponents of the abortion rights ballot measures have raised over $160 million, nearly six times more than what anti-abortion groups have fundraised to fight the initiatives.\n\nFor more, we go to Boston, where we're joined by Amy Littlefield, independent journalist who covers reproductive health and abortion access at The Nation , where her latest piece is headlined \"Peering Into the Minds of the Moderate White Women Who Might Just Save Us From Trump.\"\n\nAmy, welcome back to Democracy Now! Why don't we start off by talking about the violence? Let's start off by talking about what President Trump said about protecting women whether they want it or not, and then in this interview with Tucker Carlson said that Liz Cheney should be shot, with barrels trained on her face.\n\nAMY LITTLEFIELD : I mean, Amy, I think I actually have a more generous interpretation of Trump's comments about, you know, protecting women whether they like it or not than many critics. I have to say, I think what Trump said from the stage is actually a very succinct and clear definition of patriarchy. I mean, feminist theorists couldn't have dreamed of putting it so succinctly and so clearly, right? He is laying out the bargain that white patriarchy has offered to white women in this country since the colonization of this country, right? It is so clear. He is saying, \"White women, we will protect you from Brown and Black men.\" Right? That was the context of that quote. It was about we're going to protect women at the border, we're going to protect women in suburbs and cities and farms from this imagined threat of Black and Brown men who are coming to get them, right? And all we demand in exchange for that protection is your submission. That's been the bargain of patriarchy, right?\n\nAnd it's coming at a time, of course, when women's rights have been vaporized, and the Supreme Court, thanks to Donald Trump, has overturned Roe v. Wade . And so, you know, to me, again, I think gender theorists should be studying this quote, because it is such a distilled expression of exactly what patriarchy is and exactly what the racist bargain that it has offered to white women throughout our country's history is, right? And so, I think, for me, the defining question of this election is whether white women, who are the largest voting bloc in this country - 38% of voters in this country are white women, and they have gone for Donald Trump over the Democratic candidate in the last two presidential elections. And to me, the defining question of this election, which is the first since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade , is whether white women are going to punish the man who took away their rights and say no to this racist bargain that the Republican Party is offering them. And that's what I'll be watching on Election Day.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And we're going to talk about those abortion initiatives around the country and how they got on the - how they got there to begin with, the grassroots movements. But I wanted to stick for a moment with this issue of Trump calling for Liz Cheney to be shot, with guns trained on her face. This week also, Fox News commentator Jesse Watters threatened to divorce his wife Emma if he found out she voted for Kamala Harris.\n\nJESSE WATTERS : And if I found out Emma was going into the voting booth and pulling the lever for Harris, that's the same thing as having an affair. That, to me -\n\nJEANINE PIRRO : Oh my god.\n\nHAROLD FORD JR.: Oh my gosh.\n\nTYRUS : Let him finish! You're - go, Jesse. It's our day.\n\nHAROLD FORD JR.: Oh god.\n\nTYRUS : It's our day, Judge.\n\nJESSE WATTERS : That violates this sanctity of our marriage.\n\nTYRUS : Preach on! Yes!\n\nJESSE WATTERS : What else is she keeping from me?\n\nTYRUS : Exactly.\n\nJESSE WATTERS : What else has she been lying about?\n\nJEANINE PIRRO : Why would she have to lie to you? Why would she lie to you?\n\nTYRUS : Roll the credits. Jesse has -\n\nJEANINE PIRRO : Have you threatened her? Why would she lie to you?\n\nDANA PERINO : Oh, they want me to tease.\n\nJESSE WATTERS : Why would she do that and then vote Harris? Why would she say she was voting Trump -\n\nTYRUS : He's not the problem.\n\nJESSE WATTERS : - and then voting Harris? And I caught her, and then she said, \"I lied to you for the last four years.\"\n\nJEANINE PIRRO : So, you admit you intimidate people.\n\nJESSE WATTERS : It's over, Emma! That would be D-Day.\n\nJEANINE PIRRO : Oh my god.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, that's Jesse Watters on Fox. In fact, it was Liz Cheney who told women across the country, \"Don't tell your husbands that you're going to vote for Kamala Harris, but, you know, you've got the privacy of the polling booth.\"\n\nAMY LITTLEFIELD : Amy, I'm a little mad at you for playing those two clips at me back to back when I don't have a bucket here to vomit in. And I just want to say off the bat, I mean, this is the same Jesse Watters who in fact did have an affair and cheat on his wife, and she divorced him over that. So, I don't know, there's something deeply psychological going on here.\n\nBut on a more serious note, Amy, I mean, this is something Kylie Cheung  talks about in her book Survivor Injustice . There is a phenomenon in this country that we don't know the scope of, which is people who are in abusive relationships, whose husbands or abusive partners control the way that they vote. That is a thing. Now, I don't mean to imply that Jesse Watters is in that situation. I don't know the details of his marriage, nor do I want to. But I do think that, on a more serious note, this is a real phenomenon, that there are women out there who we know are hiding the way that they're voting from their husbands, right? And we've seen ads about this. We've seen clear statements about it. We've seen women putting stickers in bathroom stalls saying \"your vote is private.\" You know, you can vote for Harris, no matter what your husband says. And I think what this taps into is a very real phenomenon, which is there is domestic violence-induced voter suppression in this country. You know, Kylie talked to women who said their abusive partners were controlling the way that they voted. And so, this is a very real and serious thing.\n\nAnd, you know, I can remember being out knocking - or, observing while canvassers were knocking doors in Kansas, when abortion was on the ballot there, and women answering the door, talking about - you know, who are registered Republican, talking about their experiences with IVF and their experiences with reproductive freedom. And so, these experiences, especially in the wake of the overturn of Roe v. Wade , might cause women to break with their husbands and to vote for the first Black woman president.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Amy Littlefield, let's talk about the abortion ballot initiatives that are in 10 states right now. Begin with Florida and DeSantis on Amendment 4 trying to prevent those who support this ballot initiative from running ads.\n\nAMY LITTLEFIELD : I mean, Florida is by far the most high-stakes state where abortion is on the ballot this year. We have abortion on the ballot in 10 states. That's a record for a U.S. election. Florida is a haven state for abortion access in the South, or was, until the six-week ban went into effect there, 84,000 abortions in that state before these restrictions. And so it's crucial to restore abortion access there. We've seen over $100 million raised in the state, with this huge momentum behind this campaign to restore abortion access in Florida.\n\nAnd it's obviously terrifying Ron DeSantis, because he's been threatening criminal charges against TV stations for airing ads in favor of the pro-choice amendment, prompting a judge to say, \"It's the First Amendment, stupid.\" And he's deployed election police to question people who signed the signature - you know, signed the petition to get this amendment on the ballot. So, he's used state resources to fight this. We're really seeing Ron DeSantis pulling out all the stops there.\n\nAt the same time, we're seeing this campaign that knows Republican voters outnumber Democrats in the state by a million, and this is a state that has a very high threshold, 60%, to get an initiative passed. And so, there's a huge amount of effort that has to go into persuading Republican and independent voters if this is going to pass. And so, what we've seen - you know, I got a hold of some of the internal guidance that the campaign is using. They talk about, you know, \"Don't emphasize DeSantis and Trump. Don't talk about the Republican politicians. Talk about extremist politicians behind this ban.\" Right? They talk about not emphasizing travel stories, but instead emphasizing cases where people's lives were at risk or where there was sexual abuse that caused a pregnancy. And so, we're seeing a real attempt to sort of modulate the campaigns in states like Florida to sort of tone it to a moderate frequency to hit voters who are Republican or independent and who may very well be voting for Trump and also voting in favor of abortion rights.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : An investigation by ProPublica finds at least two people in Texas died after they were denied reproductive healthcare due to Texas's abortion ban, which bars doctors from ending the heartbeat of a fetus even when a pregnancy is nonviable and the life of a pregnant person is at risk. In one case, 28-year-old Josseli Barnica was admitted to a Houston hospital as she began to suffer a miscarriage 17 weeks into her pregnancy. For 40 hours, doctors denied her a simple and urgently needed medical procedure to empty her uterus, which would have prevented the infection that ultimately killed her. She died three days after her miscarriage. Can you talk about that report?\n\nAMY LITTLEFIELD : Amy, these are just tragic stories, and they keep on coming. This story about Josseli Barnica, who was in a hospital, you know, in pain, suffering for 40 hours, praying that she be able to return home to her young daughter, and she died. Right? And ProPublica has done such a good job laying out how the anti-abortion laws in Texas have led to such confusion and fear among medical providers.\n\nThe story that they published this morning on Nevaeh Crain, this was an 18-year-old girl who suffers a miscarriage starting on the day of her baby shower. Her mother brings her in to the hospital. She visits three different times and is denied care, delayed, turned away, and eventually dies, after the final hospital that she goes to makes her undergo two sonograms to confirm fetal demise.\n\nNow, I want to say something that I think ProPublica missed in the story that published today that is hugely important. The hospital where Nevaeh Crain died was a Catholic hospital. It was a Christus facility, which is a Catholic healthcare chain. And, Amy, we've spoken before on the show about how Catholic hospitals operate under Catholic religious rules issued by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops that prohibit doctors from performing abortions. This was true before the Dobbs decision. And unfortunately, ProPublica neglected to mention that in their article. And so, while I think it's very important to highlight the anti-abortion laws in Texas, which are some of the strictest in the country, and the chilling effect that those laws have on people in lifesaving emergencies, it's also important to note that this was far from a perfect system before the Dobbs decision and before these laws went into effect in Texas, and that we had religious hospitals, including Catholic facilities, like Texas, that were turning women away in these life-threatening emergencies. And, in fact, I and others were doing that reporting before the Dobbs decision. And so, we really need to look at the sort of compounding levels in our healthcare system that have all failed women.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And finally, if you can talk about Arizona, how activists got this again on the ballot and how critical this is, because if people perhaps are not going to the polls to vote for president, but they go to the polls because they want to ensure reproductive healthcare and access - since they're there, they're going to vote for president? And the question is: Will they vote for the one who's against abortion or for abortion? President Trump says if he's president, women will stop thinking about abortion.\n\nAMY LITTLEFIELD : Oh, right, another beautiful, patriarchal fantasy foisted upon us.\n\nI mean, Arizona, I remember sitting here, Amy, talking to you about Arizona and how they were sending us back to the 19th century - right? - with their Civil War-era abortion ban. And, of course, you know, while that's not in effect anymore, it galvanized the state over the issue of abortion there. And so there's been tremendous momentum in states like Arizona, activist groups, organizers, people who have mobilized over this issue getting this on the ballot. Arizona and Nevada, both swing states, both places where abortion is directly on the ballot.\n\nAnd I think another defining question of this election is whether these ballot initiatives - and again, we know ballot initiatives on abortion are popular. All seven times abortion has been on the ballot since Dobbs , it has won. And so, I think the question is really whether that popularity of abortion rights extends to Democratic politicians up and down the ballot in these swing states.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Amy Littlefield, I want to thank you for being with us, abortion access correspondent at The Nation , independent journalist who covers reproductive health. Ten states - Montana, Maryland, Colorado, New York, Nebraska, Florida, Missouri, South Dakota, Nevada and Arizona - will have abortion on the ballot. And for many, they've already voted, because so many people have voted so far. We'll link to your latest piece , Amy, \"Peering Into the Minds of the Moderate White Women Who Might Just Save Us From Trump.\"\n\nNext up, we look at House and Senate races across the country with journalist John Nichols in Wisconsin. Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Vice President Kamala Harris has promised to restore reproductive rights after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. Law professor Michele Goodwin describes the fight for reproductive rights as \"a tipping point for our democracy\" and says Republicans cannot simply walk away from their record on the issue.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, \"War, Peace and the Presidency: Breaking with Convention.\" I'm Amy Goodman, here with Juan González.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: On Tuesday night, the Democratic Party held a ceremonial roll call to nominate Kamala Harris as president. During the roll call, Texas was represented by Kate Cox, who was introduced by former Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards.\n\nCECILE RICHARDS : Proud to be here tonight representing a tradition in Texas of progressivism and my late mother Ann Richards, the governor of Texas, and passing it on to another great Texas heroine, Kate Cox.\n\nKATE COX : I'm Kate Cox, and I love being a mom. I have two beautiful children, and my husband and I have always wanted a third. But when I got pregnant, doctors told us our baby would never survive, and if I didn't get an abortion, it would put a future pregnancy at risk. But Trump didn't care, and because of his abortion bans, I had to flee my home. There's nothing pro-family about abortion bans. There's nothing pro-life about letting women suffer and even die.\n\nToday, because I found a way to access abortion care, I am pregnant again. Woo! Thank you. And my baby is due in January, just in time to see Kamala Harris sworn in as president of the United States!\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was Kate Cox, speaking for Texas during the DNC's ceremonial roll call to nominate Kamala Harris as president. She was introduced by Cecile Richards in the Texas delegation, Cecile, former head of Planned Parenthood, now suffering from brain cancer.\n\nOn Monday night, three other women who have been impacted by abortion bans addressed the convention: Hadley Duvall of Kentucky, Kaitlyn Joshua of Louisiana and Amanda Zurawski of Texas, who was joined by her husband Joshua.\n\nJOSHUA ZURAWSKI : When you're expecting a baby, packing for the hospital should be a joyful moment. For us, it was different. We were told with 100% certainty we would lose our baby girl Willow, and we were sent home. For three days, we waited until Amanda was sick enough to receive standard abortion care. Eventually, Amanda's temperature spiked. She was shaking, disoriented and crashing. I don't remember what I threw into our bag that day, only that instead of welcoming Willow, I was hoping Amanda's life could be saved.\n\nI'm here tonight because the fight for reproductive rights isn't just a woman's fight. This is about fighting - this is about fighting for our families and, as Kamala Harris says, our future.\n\nAMANDA ZURAWSKI : Every time I share our story, my heart breaks, for the baby girl we wanted desperately, for the doctors and nurses who couldn't help me deliver her safely, for Josh, who feared he would lose me, too. But I was lucky. I lived. So I'll continue sharing our story, standing with women and families across the country.\n\nToday, because of Donald Trump, more than one in three women of reproductive age in America lives under an abortion ban. A second Trump term would rip away even more of our rights, passing a national abortion ban, letting states monitor pregnancies and prosecute doctors, restricting birth control and fertility treatments. We cannot let that happen. We need to vote as if lives depend on it, because they do.\n\nKAITLYN JOSHUA : Two years ago, my husband and I were expecting our second child. Our daughter Lauryn couldn't wait to be a big sister. I was getting ready for her fourth birthday party, when something didn't feel right. Two emergency rooms sent me away. Because of Louisiana's abortion ban, no one would confirm that I was miscarrying. I was in pain, bleeding so much my husband feared for my life.\n\nNo woman should experience what I endured, but too many have. They write to me saying, \"What happened to you happened to me.\" Sometimes they're miscarrying, scared to tell anyone, even their doctors. Our daughters deserve better. America deserves better. Kamala Harris and Tim Walz will fight for reproductive rights and our freedom and our shared future.\n\nHADLEY DUVALL : Growing up, I was an all-American girl, varsity soccer captain, cheerleading captain, homecoming queen and survivor. I was raped by my stepfather after years of sexual abuse. At age 12, I took my first pregnancy test, and it was positive. That was the first time I was ever told, \"You have options.\"\n\nI can't imagine not having a choice. But today, that's the reality for many women and girls across the country because of Donald Trump's abortion bans. He calls it a beautiful thing. What is so beautiful about a child having to carry her parent's child? There are other survivors out there who have no options, and I want you to know that we see you, we hear you. Kamala Harris will sign a national law to restore the right to an abortion.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was Hadley Duvall of Kentucky, Kaitlyn Joshua of Louisiana and Amanda Zurawski of Texas, joined by her husband Joshua, speaking at the Democratic National Convention Monday night.\n\nWe're joined now by Michele Goodwin, professor of constitutional law and global health policy at Georgetown University, host of the Ms. magazine podcast , On the Issues with Michele Goodwin and author of Policing the Womb: Invisible Women and the Criminalization of Motherhood .\n\nThanks so much for being with us. So, we just listened to these horrific stories, how women are affected by abortion bans. And yet you have President Trump just recently saying that abortion is no longer a factor in elections, saying he believes it will end up being, quote, \"a very small issue\" in this year's election.\n\nMICHELE GOODWIN : Well, he's not paying attention to what's taken place since the Dobbs decision, which is something that he set in motion by the nominations that led to Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, these justices, being on the United States Supreme Court and their overturn of Roe v. Wade and also Planned Parenthood v. Casey , because in the wake of this, what we saw immediately was a 10-year-old girl needing to flee one state to get to another in order to terminate a pregnancy that was due to rape. And there were lawmakers, right after, that immediately said - these were anti-abortion lawmakers that said, \"It's a hoax. She doesn't exist. This can't be.\" And then, when it was revealed by a very crafty reporter who was in the courtroom when the person was being charged, then they said, \"Well, there are protections in the state. There are protections for rape and incest.\" And they did not exist. Lawmakers very specifically crafted abortion bans that made no exceptions for rape or incest, a bridge that five years ago would have seemed too far. But with Donald Trump in office and what he put forward - \"I want women criminalized who have abortions. I'm going to put judges on the Supreme Court and the lower federal courts that are going to get rid of abortion\" - all of that was something that we could see coming forward.\n\nAnd if I could just add to that, what lawmakers have done, who have been part of an anti-abortion movement, they have actually heard from doctors that have come forward and said, \"I've had an 8-year-old patient who was pregnant. I've had a patient who has a fetus with no skull. I have a patient who has a fetus with no brain development. I have patients that are about to die,\" and lawmakers turning a cold blind eye to that. That's the reality post the Dobbs decision.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Yet, at the Republican convention, abortion hardly came up, and it was scrubbed from the party - any mention was scrubbed from the party platform. Even in the face of public support for abortion rights continuing to grow, how do you think this is going to play out in this coming election?\n\nMICHELE GOODWIN : Well, there have been political strategies that are now taken up by some on the right, including Donald Trump. He's very interested in winning this election, and so he has publicly said, \"Look, let's tone down what's our rhetoric on abortion. Let's get through this election. We have to count votes.\"\n\nAnd the reason that he's taken that posture is because in 2022, in that midterm year, there were these predictions that there was going to be the red tsunami, the big red wave. People were ignoring reproductive freedom. And yet, I kept saying, \"What mother wants to look across the table at her 10-year-old daughter and say, 'You will not have an option for the future that you deserve, because of a rape from a neighbor up the street or in this family'? No.\" And what we saw is ballot initiative after ballot initiative, whether in red states or blue states, that reproductive freedom was prevailing. And we've seen that since this time. So, that's why, in part, on the Republican platform, there is not much mention with regard to abortion or even \"pro-life\" stance, very different from the Democratic platform.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: But there will be ballot measures in this election. I think Montana became the eighth state, on Tuesday, to put the issue on the ballot, Arizona. The impact of these ballot measures on turnout?\n\nMICHELE GOODWIN : Well, on one hand, what these abortion ballot initiatives have meant is that they've all won. They've all been towards reproductive freedom. The same time, I think what's really important for us to understand is that there have been efforts to thwart what has done. I mean, there are collections of 500-, 600-, 700,000 signatures, 800,000 signatures, to get these ballot initiatives in front of voters. And yet, there have been tremendous efforts to try to undermine that. And we have to keep that in mind, that voter suppression still exists in the United States. This is not voting where everyone just gets to cast their vote. And that has to be understood. Just as there are more ballot initiatives, there have been more and more efforts to suppress votes and to gerrymander certain communities out of being able to vote.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Clearly, the conservative anti-abortion forces are running scared. Arizona, the court just ruled, yes, this constitutional amendment can be on the ballot. But I feel like it's like more than a decade ago when all over the country conservatives put anti-gay marriage, anti- - what we call -\n\nMICHELE GOODWIN : Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : - now marriage equality amendments on to vote in states, because it would get people to come out and then, because they felt impassioned about that, to vote for conservative candidates.\n\nMICHELE GOODWIN : Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Now, because these are pro-abortion ballots on the states in like eight states, it will get people to come out who will then also vote for Democratic candidates in some of the most conservative states.\n\nMICHELE GOODWIN : Well, here's what's interesting, is that, yes, that's going to take place, and there are people who are part of the Republican Party - we've seen this - that are coming forward, who are men, because they understand that this is a tipping point for our democracy. What we've seen with the suffering of women and girls, near-death experiences, people being helicoptered out of Idaho in order to save their lives during pregnancy, is that they are the tip of the arrow. Their blood is on the tip of the arrow about our democracy. And that, we have to understand. And so, yes, folks are going to come out for these ballot initiatives, and they're just going to come out because they actually see that the platform that's been put forward by Democrats in this instance are ones that support democracy.\n\nAnd just for our clarity to understand just what this path has been, Roe v. Wade was a 7-to-2 decision. Five of those seven justices were Republican-appointed. Justice Blackmun, who wrote the opinion in Roe , was put on the court by Richard Nixon. Prescott Bush, the father of George H.W. Bush, was the treasurer of Planned Parenthood, the national treasurer. And George H.W. Bush himself shepherded Title X through Congress. What was that? Providing reproductive healthcare for the poorest of Americans. And Richard Nixon then said, \"This is just basic public healthcare.\" So, the Republican Party itself has come a long way from its origin story supporting reproductive freedom.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We just have a minute to go. What do you think are the most important issues right now to talk about in Chicago at the Democratic National Convention, what you want to hear?\n\nMICHELE GOODWIN : Well, I think what we want to hear is that we want to save and preserve our democracy, that civil liberties and civil rights matter, that these issues are interconnected. And, Amy, I said it on your show two years ago, and I've been saying it: When the Dobbs decision came down, that was a decision that was a punch in the gut to American democracy itself. When Justice Alito said, \"Just go vote,\" Justice Alito was not paying attention to the fact that this case - or he was - that this was a case that came out of Mississippi. Sixty years ago, it was Fannie Lou Hamer, before the National Democratic Convention, that talked about the Mississippi appendectomy, being dragged off a bus, she and other Black women, all because they wanted to vote, being beaten, taken to a jail and being beaten by the inmates at that jail, men, and then a guard taking a baton and beating her in the head. And Fannie Lou Hamer said, \"All of this just because we refuse to be second-class citizens. All of this because we just want to be able to vote.\" And so, these issues are interconnected, and I think her story is a beacon for understanding the trajectory of what we need for American democracy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Michelle Goodwin, professor of constitutional law and global health policy at Georgetown University, host of the Ms. magazine podcast , On the Issues with Michele Goodwin , and author of the book Policing the Womb: Invisible Women and the Criminalization of Motherhood .\n\nComing up, we'll hear from an American doctor just back from Gaza. And we'll talk to former Democratic Congressmember Andy Levin, a former synagogue president, defeated two years ago after AIPAC , the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, spent millions against him. We're in Chicago at the DNC . Back in a minute.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "You turn to us for voices you won't hear anywhere else.\n\nSign up for Democracy Now!'s Daily Digest to get our latest headlines and stories delivered to your inbox every day.\n\nAt least two women in Georgia have died since the state's six-week abortion ban went into effect after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade . Candi Miller and Amber Thurman, both Black women and mothers to young children, died after they were unable to access care for rare but typically treatable complications caused by medication abortion. We hear more from ProPublica editor Ziva Branstetter, whose publication reported on the preventable deaths of Miller and Thurman, and from reproductive justice advocate Monica Simpson. \"We are in a maternal healthcare crisis in our state,\" says Simpson, the executive director of SisterSong, an organization that works throughout the southern United States on behalf of communities of color, which disproportionately suffer the impacts of restrictions on abortion care.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nWe look now at reproductive rights in the United States, which are a key issue in this presidential election, now less than 50 days away. On Tuesday, Republican senators once again blocked legislation to protect access to IVF , in vitro fertilization, and require health insurers to cover the fertility treatment, after Democrats forced a vote.\n\nMeanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris slammed Donald Trump, her Republican rival, for his role in abolishing national abortion rights after he appointed three of the Supreme Court justices who issued the Dobbs ruling overturning Roe v. Wade . In an interview yesterday with the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia, Vice President Harris cited the case, reported by ProPublica, of Amber Thurman, a 28-year-old Black woman in Georgia who died from a fatal infection after doctors refused to treat a rare complication from a medication abortion.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS : I don't know if anyone here has heard most recently the stories out of Georgia, tragic story, about a young woman who died because, it appears, the people who should have given her healthcare were afraid they'd be criminalized, after the Dobbs decision came down, laws that make no exception even for rape or incest, which means that you're telling a survivor of a crime of a violation to their body that they have no right to make a decision about what happens to their body next, which is immoral, an approach that doesn't take into account that - most people, I think, agree you don't have to abandon your faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do with her body.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Georgia's Maternal Mortality Review Committee found Amber Thurman's death was preventable and largely due to delays in care. This comes as Project 2025 staffer, former Trump White House personnel chief John McEntee doubted the danger of abortion bans in a TikTok post last Thursday.\n\nJOHN McENTEE: Can someone track down the women Kamala Harris says are bleeding out in parking lots because Roe v. Wade was overturned? Don't hold your breath.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : McEntee was widely ridiculed as women posted responses about their experiences being denied care.\n\nWell, today, ProPublica published a new report on a second woman in Georgia who died from medical abortion complications. Candi Miller's family said she didn't visit a doctor, quote, \"due to the current legislation on pregnancies and abortions,\" unquote. Overall, deaths due to complications from abortion pills are extremely rare.\n\nFor more, we're joined by two guests. Monica Simpson is with us. She's executive director of SisterSong, the national women of color reproductive justice collective based in Georgia. And Ziva Branstetter is also joining us, from Walnut Creek, California, senior editor at ProPublica, who helped edit two new reports by Kavitha Surana.\n\nWe welcome you both back to Democracy Now! I want to begin with Ziva. Actually, Vice President Harris cited your investigation in her answers to questions from the National Association of Black Journalists yesterday. Can you lay out the stories of [Amber] Thurman and also today you've just broke a new story on a second death?\n\nZIVA BRANSTETTER : Correct. Well, thank you, first of all, Democracy Now! , for having me on to talk about reporting by ProPublica and reporter Kavitha Surana. We have reported two stories. Both deaths of these women occurred in the months following the overturn of Roe v. Wade by the Supreme Court. Both were in Georgia. Both were African American women.\n\nThe first case, Amber Thurman, 28-year-old single mother with a 3-year-old son, she died after doctors did not provide care over about a 20-hour period in the emergency room. She had taken abortion medication to end her pregnancy, and fetal tissue remained, which is a rare - a very rare complication of taking abortion medication, very simply solved with a procedure called a D&C, that doctors did not provide over 20 hours in the emergency room. That procedure, in almost all cases in Georgia now and in other abortion ban states, is a felony. Doctors could face criminal prosecution for performing it. We don't know what was going through their minds, but they did not operate over 20 hours. And she died in August of 2022.\n\nThe story that we just published today on ProPublica's website is about Candi Miller, a 41-year-old woman, also from Georgia, a mother of three, who also self-managed her abortion at home, which is becoming far more regular under abortion bans. She took abortion medication. Again, rare complication. Instead of going to the hospital, she was afraid to seek care, and did not and died at home with a mixture of drugs that her family believes was trying to manage the pain. And she died, as well, in November of 2022. That death has been ruled by the state preventable and, not only that, directly related to the state's abortion ban, which is the first time we've seen this reported.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And explain the abortion ban in Georgia.\n\nZIVA BRANSTETTER : Correct. It's a six-week ban. You know, we classify that almost the same as a complete ban, because many people can become pregnant and don't know at that point that they are even pregnant. And experts say a six-week ban is tantamount to a complete ban. And there are no health exceptions in Georgia's ban. Well, Candi Miller had lupus. She had hypertension. She had diabetes. She's 41 years old. She already has three children. She found herself pregnant. Doctors had told her, \"You can't. Your body cannot survive another pregnancy. It will kill you.\" So, she had, literally, no good options under Georgia's abortion ban.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Now, can you talk about how rare medication abortion complications are, Ziva?\n\nZIVA BRANSTETTER : About 6 million people, since the FDA approved abortion medication, have used it, and there have been 31 deaths of any kind, only 11 of those from sepsis. It is 0.0005% of cases that are fatal, which is a lower complication rate than penicillin and Viagra. And so, it's extremely safe. All medications have risk. There is a simple solution to a complication with abortion medication, and that is a D&C. And abortion ban states, for the vast majority of cases, criminalize that procedure.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to turn to Monica Simpson. You're executive director of the Georgia organization SisterSong. Can you talk about the levels of Black maternal mortality in Georgia?\n\nMONICA SIMPSON : Absolutely. Thank you so much for having me this morning.\n\nWe are devastated to hear this news and to see that Black women are still not being treated in the ways that they need to by our healthcare system in Georgia. What is real in the state of Georgia is that we are in a maternal healthcare crisis in our state. We are a state that has yet to expand Medicaid, which means that thousands upon thousands of people are already falling under the radar and not getting access to the care that they need. And on top of that, we are dealing with the fact that we are in this country seeing Black women die at a rate three to four times higher than white women in childbirth, right?\n\nSo, we look at that, and coupled with the fact that Georgia has a desert of OB- GYN availability in our state. There are over half of our states that do not - excuse me, half of our counties that do not have access to an OB- GYN , so people are having to travel miles upon miles just to get care. So, when you bring all of that together in this context of a state that is also dealing with a six-week abortion ban - SisterSong is the lead plaintiff in that case against our state; we have been fighting that for many years now, trying to get this ban removed - we are seeing a really dire picture for Black women and for people in general in the state of Georgia.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : In this case that ProPublica talked about today, the story of Candi Miller, Monica, Candi Miller's health was so fragile - I'm reading the first sentences. \"Candi Miller's health was so fragile, doctors warned having another baby could kill her.\" So she was already at high risk. Her previous pregnancy was high-risk. But she was terrified to go to the doctor. Talk about that, what this means. And the number of women who may be suffering or have died that we don't know, it's because of their fear of going to the doctor, that they would be criminalized.\n\nMONICA SIMPSON : Absolutely. We hear this story far too often, that we know too many Black women, in particular - right? - are saying that they do not feel safe when they go to their doctor. They don't feel as if they're listened to. They don't feel as if they're trusted. We have seen this show up in the lives of people who are celebrities, like Serena Williams, right? So, if we have people who have the amount of privilege and resources that a Serena Williams has and they are still not listened to and trusted by healthcare providers, imagine what that looks like on the ground for everyday people who are trying to get access to care. In our membership, we get these stories all the time, that we don't feel like we're trusted, we don't feel like we're going to get access to the information that we want. And so it silences people. And we know that that silence then drives people inward, and it does not allow them to be able to move towards the solutions that they need for themselves and their families.\n\nSo, this is a really sad day in the state of Georgia. Our elected officials need to be on top of this more than ever. And we have to take this very seriously, because we knew and we have been saying, since the Dobbs decision and even before then, that when you remove access, restrict access, ban access to lifesaving care, healthcare that people need, then those who have historically been pushed to the margins will be the ones most affected. And we are seeing that in the state of Georgia, where these Black women have lost their lives to a preventable - preventable - issue that could have been taken care of in real time.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : At the Democratic convention, a ceremonial roll call to nominate Kamala Harris as president included Kate Cox speaking for Texas. She had spoken out after she was forced to flee Texas to get abortion care after learning her pregnancy was not viable. She was introduced by former Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards, who had an op-ed in The New York Times this weekend headlined \"Harris Is Good on Abortion Rights. Now She Needs to Take It to 11.\" Other featured speakers included three other women impacted by abortion bans: Hadley Duvall of Kentucky, Amanda Zurawski of Texas, Kaitlyn Joshua of Louisiana. This is Kaitlyn Joshua.\n\nKAITLYN JOSHUA : Two years ago, my husband and I were expecting our second child. Our daughter Lauryn couldn't wait to be a big sister. I was getting ready for her fourth birthday party when something didn't feel right. Two emergency rooms sent me away. Because of Louisiana's abortion ban, no one would confirm that I was miscarrying. I was in pain, bleeding so much, my husband feared for my life. No woman should experience what I endured, but too many have. They write to me saying, \"What happened to you happened to me.\" Sometimes they're miscarrying, scared to tell anyone, even their doctors. Our daughters deserve better. America deserves better.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Kaitlyn Joshua is an African American woman. Ziva, you mention her case in both your ProPublica articles.\n\nZIVA BRANSTETTER : Yes. Well, obviously, as has been noted by your other guest, the burden of this issue falls heaviest on Black women, on women of color. I think it's very interesting to note that there have been literally dozens of cases like hers across the country, where women have had to rush across state lines, have been denied care. There are now two confirmed deaths in an abortion ban state that have been ruled preventable by an official committee including 10 doctors. Both are Black women. I don't think it's an accident that we're seeing this pattern. I think there are more cases out there. ProPublica is certainly interested in hearing from people whose loved ones may have died, who have questions about how they died. And we are going to keep looking into them.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to give Monica Simpson the last word. Cecile Richards had spoken at the DNC . She actually is suffering from brain cancer right now. And in this op-ed piece she just wrote for the Times , her headline, \"Harris Is Good on Abortion Rights. Now She Needs to Take It to 11.\" Do you agree with this?\n\nMONICA SIMPSON : I do think that we are in a time where we have to not just look at where we are. We have to think about where we want to go, right? And what we have been saying for many, many years is that we know that a federal right to abortion is necessary, but access is even more imperative. And so, when we think about the state of where we are in this country, knowing that we don't have the federal right, and we were already suffering from lack of access to abortion care, we have to think about this at the next level. How do we make sure that we're not only creating the opportunities for legislation that creates a federal right to be achieved, but that we are expanding access in all the ways [inaudible] -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We have to leave it there. Monica Simpson, executive director of SisterSong, and Ziva Branstetter, editor at ProPublica. We'll link to both your pieces. I'm Amy Goodman.

However, advocates warn the far-right-dominated court's ruling on the FDA's authority to regulate the pill was purely on procedural grounds, and could even offer a \"roadmap\" for future challenges. Mifepristone is used in roughly two-thirds of all U.S. abortions, including in some states that have severely limited or banned abortions. \"This is just one of the strikes - not the first strike, not the second or third, but one of the strikes - in an artillery that is aimed at reproductive freedom,\" says our guest, legal scholar Michele Goodwin. We discuss the ruling and the anti-abortion movement's \"playbook\" of attacks on reproductive healthcare with Goodwin.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : In a closely watched case Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled to preserve access to the abortion pill mifepristone, which is used in roughly two-thirds of all U.S. abortions. The court did not address the safety of the pill and focused instead on the lack of standing by the anti-choice medical associations who filed the lawsuit in order to limit access to the drug approved more than 20 years ago by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nAdvocates warn the court's ruling could offer a \"roadmap\" for future challenges. Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote the majority opinion. He said, quote, \"The plaintiffs have sincere legal, moral, ideological, and policy objections,\" unquote, suggesting the proper venue for their case could be with the president, lawmakers or federal regulators.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris spoke from the White House after the ruling.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS : This is not a cause for celebration, because the reality is certain things are still not going to change. We are looking at the fact that two-thirds of women of reproductive age in America live in a state with a Trump abortion ban. This ruling is not going to change that. This ruling is not going to change the fact that Trump's allies have a plan, that if all else fails, to eliminate medication abortion through executive action.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The Supreme Court will soon rule in another case that aims to strip pregnant people of their right to abortion care in order to stabilize an emergency medical condition. Meanwhile, Senate Republicans blocked a bill Thursday to protect access to in vitro fertilization and voted last week against the Right to Contraception Act.\n\nFor more, we're joined by Michele Goodwin, professor of constitutional law and global health policy at Georgetown University, founding director of the Center for Biotechnology and Global Health Policy. She hosts the Ms. magazine podcast On the Issues with Michele Goodwin and is the author of Policing the Womb: Invisible Women and the Criminalization of Motherhood . In 2021, her guest essay for The New York Times was headlined \"I Was Raped by My Father. An Abortion Saved My Life.\"\n\nProfessor Goodwin, welcome back to Democracy Now! Can you respond to the Supreme Court's unanimous decision, what it means and what it doesn't mean?\n\nMICHELE GOODWIN : What it means is that mifepristone, which is used as part of a two-drug regimen in order to terminate pregnancy - the majority of pregnancy terminations, abortions, in the country take place with mifepristone. What this means is that it continues to be available nationwide. It means that people may not be criminally punished for using this to help a patient terminate a pregnancy. But, as the vice president said, it should not be overstated what this ruling means. This was a ruling on procedural grounds, not substantive grounds.\n\nAnd it's worth noting how far this group of litigants got. They framed themselves as doctors who would be affected by patients who had some distress, medical distress, after abortion. That itself was something of a tremendous falsehood. Mifepristone is safer than using aspirin and Tylenol. The Supreme Court has acknowledged, in 2016, that a woman is 14 times more likely to die carrying a pregnancy to term than by having an abortion. So, the underlying premise that the drug is unsafe, that abortions are unsafe, was factually not true. It was also an incredible reach that somehow - this claim that the FDA had rushed this drug to the marketplace, when, in the year that it was approved, the FDA had spent three times the length of time reviewing this drug compared to other drugs that came into the marketplace that year. So, the drug was efficacious, and the drug was safe. And yet these plaintiffs were able to get as far as the Supreme Court in bringing this case. And that says so much.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What role does telemedicine play in providing access to abortion pills? And how will it be affected?\n\nMICHELE GOODWIN : Well, what this also means is that telemedicine can continue to be used in order to help people be able to terminate a pregnancy.\n\nPart of the challenge to this case by these people who brought it - and this is also important, Amy - these are people who claim to be doctors. Amongst them was a person who has a master's degree in theology, who would never get medical admitting privileges at any hospital; another one, a dentist, who's not a person that one would seek to have help in a gynecological ward. But that said, they claim to be doctors who would be put in a difficult position helping someone to be relieved after complications with an abortion.\n\nWhat this case does do with telemedicine is that it keeps it alive. And it's important to understand the playbook behind all of this. Part of the playbook is to find any kinds of opportunities, holes, etc., and to pierce them, to try to use the United States Supreme Court, district courts, courts of appeals in any kind of way to further limit and diminish the ability to be able to access reproductive freedom. And so, it's not even just about abortion. You'll find that this case and others like it are open doors to also diminishing the right to access contraception, the ability to be able to get things in the mail that help you with your reproductive health. This is just one of the strikes - not the first strike, not the second or third, but one of the strikes - in an artillery that is aimed at reproductive freedom.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you explain judge shopping, who the Trump-appointed Judge Matthew Kaczmarek is in Amarillo, Texas, and what he has to do with this case?\n\nMICHELE GOODWIN : This is a great question, because what's come open in the wake of so many of the appointments that the former president was able to make, Donald Trump was able to nominate and get through the confirmation process more federal judges than any other president, save George Washington. And many of the people that were part of that nomination process were people who showed a coolness towards cases like Brown v. Board of Education , Roe v. Wade , etc.\n\nSo, Judge Kaczmarek is one of them. He was an activist - is an activist, an anti-abortion activist. He has written about his anti-abortion views. He has been quite outspoken about his anti-abortion views, save for a publication that he had sort of - he had his name removed from when he was going through the confirmation process, which was going to be published by a Texas - University of Texas law review. He had his name taken off of that. But it was an article that was about abortion and his opposition. So, this group of litigants brought their case before Judge Kaczmarek, who's the only sitting judge in Amarillo, Texas, a person with known anti-abortion views. And what they had hoped to do was to play off of his anti-abortion views by bringing this case before him.\n\nNow, what this also says is a lot about how the U.S. judiciary has been functioning in recent years. There's supposed to be objectivity, arm's-length distancing, such that if one has personal views that may be oppositional in matters of race and sex and LGBTQ equality, that is not supposed to infect the process of judging. Many have said that that's exactly what happened in this case, that there was an infection that was here with Judge Matthew Kaczmarek, that he allowed his personal views, which have been widely expressed, to influence how he handled this case, including on the matter of standing. The fact that the United States Supreme Court unanimously threw out this case saying that these plaintiffs have no standing, it should not have gotten that far. And Judge Kaczmarek was the one who opened the door to it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Professor Goodwin, what does the next move of anti-abortion crusaders look like, based on this Supreme Court result? And if you can talk about EMTALA and what it means?\n\nMICHELE GOODWIN : Yes. Well, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act says it all - doesn't it? - in its name. When Congress enacted this law, it was intended to protect all Americans, and quite specifically women who would be in distress during pregnancy. At the time in which this federal law was passed, there were poor pregnant women who were literally, Amy, being dumped on the side of roads. These were women who had no health insurance. Of course, there's not universal healthcare in the United States. Since EMTALA's enactment, there's been the federal protections of healthcare, the Obamacare, but it's not universal healthcare. But at the time, women were being dumped on the side of roads. Poor women were showing up at American hospitals in labor, sometimes in very stressful conditions, women who needed miscarriage being managed, and they were literally being turned away because they didn't have insurance, or the right insurance. Because of deaths and tragedies that were associated with this, Congress passed this law, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, otherwise known as EMTALA , that grants all Americans the privilege, the right, to be stabilized when they are in a healthcare crisis. You can imagine what this might mean if someone is suffering a heart attack, a stroke, needing to manage a miscarriage, going to a hospital, and the hospital saying, \"Sorry, we can't stabilize you. We can't treat you.\"\n\nWell, there's another case that is being seen by the court, that the court will be ruling on soon, that involves Idaho's challenge to EMTALA's application to women who need their pregnancies managed, their miscarriages managed. Idaho claims that EMTALA should not apply to the state. This raises very serious questions in American constitutionalism, American rule of law, because federal law always supersedes and trumps states' laws. But in the wake of the anti-abortion movement and the forcefulness of it, you hear these kinds of claims coming from governors and states' attorneys general that federal law doesn't matter; federal law cannot supersede or trump what the state is seeking to do, specifically on matters of reproductive health. We saw that before the Dobbs decision when the state of Texas passed its S.B. 8 law, which banned abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. That was a showdown against Roe v. Wade that the United States Supreme Court turned a blind eye to and let stand. Well, now Idaho is doing the same. We'll see how the Supreme Court comes out on this.\n\nBut let me also say this, Amy. This issue of the Comstock Act, this Comstock law, dating back to 1873, it's another weapon in the arsenal of the anti-abortion movement. This is a playbook, turning to the playbooks of times in which slavery existed or just after slavery, a time in which women couldn't vote, had very limited representation within law at all, times in which marital rape was permissible, marital domestic violence permissible. So, part of the anti-abortion movement is to look back at a time in which women barely had citizenship, by law, in the United States, and to pull from that past in order to inform the present and the future.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Michele Goodwin, I want to thank you so much for being with us, professor of constitutional law and global health policy at Georgetown University, founding director of the Center for Biotechnology and Global Health Policy, author of Policing the Womb: Invisible Women and the Criminalization of Motherhood .\n\nComing up, New York City's chapter of the Audubon Society changes its name.

To respond, we host a trio of reproductive justice advocates in Arizona. Dr. DeShawn Taylor, an OB- GYN physician, abortion provider and the CEO of the only Black woman-operated abortion clinic in Arizona, emphasizes that her practice \"will continue to provide abortions until we are made to stop,\" but warns that in the future \"abortions likely will not happen in Arizona because of those criminal penalties.\" Meanwhile, organizers like Chris Love and Alejandra Pablos are fighting back. Love is a spokesperson for Arizona for Abortion Access, a coalition of reproductive rights organizations working to put a constitutional amendment on abortion on the state's upcoming November ballot. The petition for the proposed ballot measure is still collecting signatures. \"We know what we want, and we want people to have the care that they need,\" concludes Pablos, who organizes for reproductive, racial and immigrant rights.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : We turn now to the swing state of Arizona, where Republican lawmakers have blocked efforts by Democrats to repeal an 1864 law that bans nearly all abortions in the state. The move came a day after Arizona's Supreme Court revived the 160-year-old law, approved before Arizona was a state and before women could even vote.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is on a \"Fight for Reproductive Freedoms\" tour that will visit Tucson on Friday. The court issued its decision a day after Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump said abortion should be decided by the states. Trump said Wednesday the Arizona ruling went too far.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're joined now by Chris Love, spokesperson for Arizona for Abortion Access, a coalition working to put a state constitutional amendment on abortion on Arizona's November ballot. In Tucson, Alejandra Pablos is with us, reproductive justice community organizer who was targeted by ICE for her activism and faced deportation proceedings for over a decade. And in Phoenix, Arizona, we're joined by Dr. DeShawn Taylor, OB- GYN physician, abortion provider, CEO of the nonprofit Desert Star Institute for Family Planning in Phoenix, Arizona, the only Black woman-operated abortion clinic in Arizona.\n\nWe welcome you all to Democracy Now! Dr. Deshawn Taylor, let's begin with you. You're a physician. The Arizona state Supreme Court, five of its seven justices chosen by the previous Republican governor, Ducey, have just reverted Arizona to this 160-year-old law that was put in place before women could vote, before Arizona was a state. And it says not rape, not incest, only the life of a mother or the death of a mother, the imminent death of a mother, could lead to - or woman, could lead to the possibility of doing an abortion. What does this mean for you practically today? It hasn't been put into effect for, what, 14 days, and we'll see what happens. But yesterday we saw what happened in the state Legislature. They simply adjourned before doing anything.\n\nDR. DESHAWN TAYLOR : Practically, what this means is that people will not get their needed abortions in the state of Arizona. These laws carry prison time. And I, as an abortion provider, appreciate the words of our governor and our attorney general, but at the end of the day, someone has to test whether what they say they're going to do is true. So, these lawmakers understand that the threatening us with prison time is very compelling and has a chilling effect. And so, essentially, abortions likely will not happen in Arizona because of those criminal penalties assigned to them, as we see going on across the country.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : And, Dr. Taylor, just to clarify, according to a survey for the Society of Family Planning, about 1,100 abortions take place every month in Arizona. Where will women go now to seek abortions?\n\nDR. DESHAWN TAYLOR : What I want your viewers to understand is it was challenging for people to get abortions even prior to Roe v. Wade being overturned, due to the web of restrictions, nearly 40 restrictions on the books in this state. And so people were already increasingly self-managing their abortions. People were already leaving our state who had the resources to do so. But the overwhelming majority of people who don't get their abortions have babies or become ill and potentially lose their lives. So, what we see is these escalating things happening to our population which are forcing people to take matters into their own hands, number one, or stay pregnant, because most people don't have the resources to leave the state for an abortion.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to bring Chris Love into this conversation. Even before the Supreme Court ruled, the state Supreme Court ruled, this coalition had formed and has been gathering signatures for a November referendum, a constitutional amendment that would guarantee the right to abortion. Arizona for Abortion Access, it's called. You have what? Half a million signatures? Isn't that ready to go? What are you waiting for at this point? Are you concerned that it still wouldn't get on the ballot?\n\nCHRIS LOVE : So, at this point, we're three months out from having to turn in all of our qualifying signatures. We have to turn in 384,000 valid signatures by July 3rd of this year. In Arizona, we collect far more signatures than we need, because those signatures are easily challenged in our courts and sometimes thrown out. So we're aiming to collect more than double the amount to ensure that we are on the ballot in November.\n\nAnd, you know, I am very confident that we will be - we've seen a groundswell of, you know, Arizona voters who really understand that decisions about abortion should remain between a pregnant person and their medical provider, and their family members if they so choose. But politicians, and especially now activist judges, have no role in that decision.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to ask Alejandra Pablos, an Arizona reproductive justice activist: Does this ruling affect communities of color differently? If you can explain that? You yourself have been targeted for deportation as a reproductive justice activist for a decade. But what does this particularly mean?\n\nALEJANDRA PABLOS : Thank you, Amy. Really good to be back amongst comrades that are doing great work in Arizona.\n\nLike you said, as an organizer, as somebody who's been sharing their story of being incarcerated, being placed in deportation, of having an abortion, as a form of resistance, because we know where we are living and where we have been living way before Roe , the fact is that it was never enough for me and the organizing that we do, as a person who's been criminalized, surveilled - right? - for how I look, how I speak. We live in a country where the president doesn't - can't even say the word \"abortion,\" right? So, really, the people that are still making decisions for us don't look like us, right? But people like myself have been organizing for reproductive rights, fighting stigma, right?\n\nWe know what we want, and we want people to have the care that they need. We know that there are so many reasons why people do not want to parent. And reproductive justice is about supporting folks who want to parent, who do not want to bear children - right? - and when we do want to parent, to do it in safe and sustainable communities. Like you said, I've been facing deportation, and sometimes I feel like that's already a choice that's been taken from me, right? Because who wants to parent under this stress? And the truth is that most people of color, migrant people, young people, trans, nonbinary people who have abortion and need this reproductive healthcare have been - right? - taken this choice away from them. We don't have the resources. We've been crying out to defund the police, because it is a cry to fund our communities.\n\nWe are creating constantly. Lawmakers are creating desperate communities, right? We're going to be forcing people to have abortions, and then blaming it on us, right? And fighting stigma right now for myself is where I want to focus my energy. I think as an - I created a project called Abortion Showers project, where it is led by trans people, nonbinary people, people from the Americas - right? - that we understand it's our responsibility to fight and to talk about abortion care in a loving way, because we've been taking care of each other for so long. So, I think that's kind of some of the work I'm focusing on right now, because, again, talking about this issue in Spanish - right? The United States is made up of nonwhite, non-English-speaking people, right? So I think that's one way that I'm really fighting to really, like, love on our people in this moment where there's so much violence in Arizona.\n\nSo, our work right now really is to keep fighting stigma - right? - to keep on sharing and fighting for education that's real, that's centered in real stories. And the plain and simple matter is that there's so much racism. It is a racial justice issue - right? - who we're trying to force have abortions. DeShawn talked about prison. We already have the highest incarceration rates in the world in Arizona. And are we going to be filling it up with pregnant people? Or is that the only place we're going to force people to have abortions? Right? It's just a really, really scary moment right now.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, Dr. Taylor, just to put this antediluvian ruling in context, in France just earlier this year, on International Women's Day, they actually enshrined abortion rights in their constitution. So, if you could say what steps now are doctors going to take, abortion providers like yourself, to reassure women who come to you, and also, in the future, how are you organizing? What are you planning to do?\n\nDR. DESHAWN TAYLOR : Right now we are going to continue to provide abortions until we are made to stop. So, that's the first thing.\n\nThe second piece of this is, Desert Star is an independent abortion clinic. And independent abortion clinics are closing at alarming rates across the country. And we know that when an independent abortion clinic closes, then it's gone. We don't have resources and infrastructure to sustain and withstand these political attacks on abortion. Thankfully, Desert Star in Arizona is now a nonprofit, and so I am confident our board of directors are committed to keeping the doors open so that once the pendulum swings back and we would be able to provide abortion again, that we will be able to do so because we still have all of the licenses, all of the protocols and all of the things required to provide.\n\nBut in the interim, we are also a provider of gender-affirming hormone therapy for transgender adults. We provide well exams, Pap smears. We provide birth control and all of those other things. So, we have the opportunity to continue to provide services and then pivot into community resource to assist abortion seekers in some way to get the needed abortions. And that is something that we're in progress with. And each individual provider will need to seek legal counsel and determine what level of risk that they are willing to assume to continue to help people in Arizona who need abortions.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Very quickly, Dr. Taylor, the attorney general of Arizona, Kris Mayes, said she will not enforce this 160-year-old law, saying, quote, \"No woman or doctor will be prosecuted under this draconian law. No woman or doctor will be prosecuted,\" she said, and also is appealing to attorney generals of the surrounding states to get women over the border, people who are pregnant over the border, to places where they will be safe, like in Colorado. Do you think you're going to have to, if this remains, close down your clinic? And are you willing to go to jail? Like, what does it mean to say only in the case of the life of the mother? In Texas, a woman is suing because she kept going to the doctor, wanted to have a baby desperately. The fetus died in her, and they said she wasn't septic enough, and now probably can never have a child again, because of what she experienced.\n\nDR. DESHAWN TAYLOR : So, I've said this before, and I will say it again. I did not go to medical school to go to prison. Therefore, I am not interested in being martyred in this scenario. I should not be in this scenario. We should not have these lawmakers making these types of laws that put my freedom in jeopardy just for providing the services and using the skills that I have honed over 23 years of my adult life. So, I am, with my sleeves rolled up, deeply involved in community organizing and strategizing with people like Alejandra, where we will make sure that people get what they need. Otherwise, I have to go on the record, because what we do know is that people who are criminalized look like me. So, if anybody is going to challenge this law, it is not a physician that looks like me.\n\nAnd I think that because I am 2% of the physician workforce in the United States as a Black woman, Black people need me to stay free, and the other people that I care for, who are people of color and people who speak different languages, need the caring care that I provide and what I am committed to provide in the community that I serve, which is medically underserved, ethnically diverse, socioeconomically depressed. And they deserve just, dignified and qualified care by a provider who looks like them, speaks their language and cares for them in a way that makes them feel seen, heard and well cared for. I will say that -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I'm going to interrupt for one second, because I want to give Chris Love the last word, and we just have 30 seconds. You want to get to a million signatures. How are you going to do that at this point? What has the response been since yesterday?\n\nCHRIS LOVE : Well, we've obviously had a groundswell of support from Arizona voters who are mad as hell that this has happened. So, obviously, our signature numbers are up. We'll be collecting signatures through the weekend. Our fundraising efforts are up. I think Arizona voters truly believe that our judges have gone too far. And they need to have  the say at the ballot box.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to thank you all for being with us, Chris Love of Arizona for Abortion Access, Alejandra Pablos, Arizona reproductive justice activist, and Dr. Deshawn Taylor, OB- GYN physician. She is head of Desert Star Institute for Family Planning in Phoenix. I'm Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.

Reporter Amy Littlefield, abortion access correspondent at The Nation , says the silence from Trump and others at this week's RNC in Milwaukee does not reflect a change in attitude from the Republican Party, which is still fiercely opposed to reproductive rights. \"Republicans can read the polls. They know that abortion has triumphed in all seven instances where it's been on the ballot since the Dobbs decision.

One word he never mentioned was \"abortion\" or the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade thanks to three conservative judges he appointed. Republican vice president candidate JD Vance also did not mention the word \"abortion\" once. In fact, according to The Washington Post , the word \"abortion\" wasn't mentioned a single time from the stage during at least the first three days of the convention. However, this week, CNN did unearth a 2022 comment by Vance where he said he supports a national abortion ban.\n\nINTERVIEWER : Do you think it will be resolved nationally?\n\nJD VANCE : Yeah, I mean, I certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : To talk more about what was not talked about at the RNC , we're joined by Amy Littlefield, abortion access correspondent at The Nation .\n\nAmy, welcome back to Democracy Now! So, we're talking a lot about what the president and other Republican speakers spoke of this week - the main theme, vilification of immigrants. They didn't talk about abortion, but certainly that is a major theme of what President Trump wants to do in this next term. Can you talk about what was and hasn't been talked about?\n\nAMY LITTLEFIELD : I mean, not one single word about abortion from Donald Trump last night in all 92-plus minutes of that speech. Not one single word from JD Vance, who we know is a die-hard abortion opponent. I mean, this is stunning, Amy. Even though I knew to expect it, to see Donald Trump talk more about crime rates in Venezuela and El Salvador than he did about what is arguably the crowning conservative achievement of his entire presidency, which is handing conservatives this 50-year-long dream, you know, the culmination of this 50-year-long dream they've had of overturning Roe v. Wade - I mean, this is arguably his most unequivocal victory, and he doesn't mention it once? Again, I knew to expect it, because I know that Republicans can read the polls. They know that abortion has triumphed in all seven instances where it's been on the ballot since the Dobbs decision. They know that a rising number of people support abortion rights. They know that 79% of people oppose the idea of a nationwide abortion ban. And so, it's no surprise.\n\nAnd yet, it really felt like the end of an era to me. I mean, I felt like I was watching the end of 40-plus years where Republicans have opportunistically used the issue of abortion to win elections, and now they're suddenly taking abortion by the shoulder and shuffling her off the stage and saying, you know, \"Well done. You served your purpose. You helped us consolidate power over the last 40-odd years. And we're not going to talk about you anymore.\"\n\nThere's several really important caveats here that I want to highlight. I mean, one is that the fact that Republicans aren't talking about abortion does not in any way mean that they're not going to continue to act on it. Right? I mean, if you read the Republican Party platform, it's clear they're endorsing the idea that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution protects fetal personhood, protects the due process and equal rights of embryos. If you read Project 2025, it's clear they believe that the Comstock Act from 1873 - right? - another instance of a Victorian-era law coming back to life potentially from the history books - is a de facto nationwide ban on the mailing of abortion pills. And so, they're using these ways that don't actually require any public buy-in, potentially. We can see their plan is to go for a nationwide ban on abortion that doesn't require the approval of Congress, that doesn't require the democratic process, because they're going to go back into the history books and, you know, revive this law, potentially, from an era when it was used to go after obscene books and pornographic drawings.\n\nSo, the other really important caveat, Amy, as you've covered on this show, I mean, it seems clear that the newfound target that's been tapped to replace abortion is transgender people, and in particular transgender children, some of the most vulnerable people in this country. The punchline about women's sports, about, like, \"Well, at least our side knows the difference between men and women,\" I mean, that was a drumbeat as much as \"drill, baby, drill,\" as much as the anti-immigrant rhetoric at this convention. Six hundred and twenty-five anti-trans bills introduced this year, a record. I mean, I used to sit here and say that same - you know, similar numbers when we were talking about anti-abortion legislation years ago. So, we're really talking about that same anti-abortion playbook now being trained on transgender people, because Republicans think that's going to be more popular.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, Amy Littlefield, I mean, it may be because of the silence from the stage on the question of abortion that many media reports seem to conclude that the Republican Party is now softening its stance on abortion. Do you believe that's true?\n\nAMY LITTLEFIELD : Far from it, Nermeen. I'm so glad you asked that question. I mean, it was widely reported, when the Republican Party platform came out, that they were softening their stance on abortion. And that's because it mentions, you know, states getting to have a say in abortion. First of all, I want to push back on this idea that allowing states to decide on abortion is in any way a moderate stance. Right? We have now total bans in at least 14 states in the country. We're witnessing nightmare scenarios where hemorrhaging women are being airlifted to neighboring states by helicopter, where people in the process of miscarrying are coming close to death, where people in states like Texas experiencing pregnancy complications are dying, where people are being consigned to pregnancy against their will. OK, that's under the scenario now, which is states deciding - right? - which is a deeply unequal system.\n\nBut, secondly, they're not giving up on the idea of a nationwide ban. And that's very clear when you read the text of the Republican platform itself, which endorses the idea that the 14th Amendment protects the constitutional rights of embryos and fetuses. And if that is the case that the 14th Amendment already protects embryos and fetuses, then we don't need a new constitutional amendment or a bill passed by Congress to ban abortion nationwide, because they can make the argument that fetuses are already people: \"Look, it's right here in the Constitution.\" And that argument, of course, would have ramifications for in vitro fertilization. It would have ramifications for contraception. And so, far from being a softening of the stance, I think we have to be really concerned about this effort to, again, go back to existing texts. You know, understanding that abortion is more popular than any candidate in this election and she'd win today if you put her on the top of the ticket, you know, they're looking for ways to do this through anti-democratic backdoor channels. And the platform has it right there in plain text. And I think much of the media really missed the mark when they accepted the idea that this was a softening.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, Amy, as we begin to wrap up right now, if you can talk about the map right here - you know, something about the Republican and Democratic conventions, you know, every state has a post, and it says its state - but the map of abortion access in this country right now, and the significance of who is president, who gets to appoint judges, not just Supreme Court justices, but federal judges on down, and why that matters so much to when it comes to the issue of reproductive rights and abortion?\n\nAMY LITTLEFIELD : It matters so much, Amy. And we've seen what Trump's three appointees to the Supreme Court have done, wreaking havoc not just on abortion rights, but on a host of other issues underpinning our democracy.\n\nI mean, the map of abortion access right now, you know, I was recently in Florida, which is one of at least six states that's going to have a ballot initiative on abortion this election. These ballot initiatives are what I'm going to be watching very closely. Florida has a six-week ban in place now. Florida used to be the destination state. It was like a funnel into which, you know, patients from all across the South would travel. Eighty-four thousand abortions, I believe, last year. And now they can only do abortions up until six weeks.\n\nAnd so, I sat in the waiting room of a clinic in Florida and watched people being sorted into groups based on the difference of a few millimeters of growth on an embryo the size of a pea - right? - whether they were six weeks, one day, and they were too late, or whether they were five weeks, three days or five weeks, four days, and they could get an abortion still in the state of Florida.\n\nSo, people in Florida are going to be voting directly on this issue. That's also the case in Nevada and a number of other states. It could be the case in several other states, including the swing state of Arizona. So, I think abortion is going to have a huge impact on this election.\n\nBut I also want to say, you know, it's kind of incredible that we have, you know, the two top-of-the-ticket candidates, at least right now as we're speaking in this moment, are Donald Trump, who declared himself \"very pro-choice\" many years back, in 1999 - right? - and Joe Biden, Joe \"Not So Big on Abortion\" Biden, or \"Not Big on Abortion\" Biden, who, you know, in the '70s and '80s went so far as to vote against race exceptions and incest exceptions in the federal funding ban, the Hyde Amendment, the ban on Medicaid federal funding of abortion. And where, you know, these are kind of the two people to choose between in an election where abortion is going to be one of the primary issues, I think the Democratic Party really needs to articulate a strong pro-abortion stance that doesn't just involve abortion up until viability and for rape and incest victims, right? And I think the point of what your previous guest was saying, we need a Reproductive Justice New Deal. We need a platform for 2024 that is about economic justice, as well as abortion, and that ties those two issues together, if the Democrats are going to win.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Amy Littlefield, I want to thank you for being with us, abortion access correspondent at The Nation magazine.\n\nNext up, we look at the recent killings of two Black men here in Milwaukee. Samuel Sharpe was a homeless veteran, and D'Vontaye Mitchell was killed by security guards outside the Hyatt, where delegates are swarming through right now, where journalists are getting their press credentials. More in a minute.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

In the wake of tightening federal and state restrictions on abortion, historic ballot measures enshrining the right to an abortion passed in seven states, while other initiatives to raise the minimum wage and codify marriage equality also won by wide majorities. We're joined by Chris Melody Fields Figueredo of the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center to examine the role of ballot measures, a form of direct democracy, in elections, and why this \"powerful tool\" may be at risk as conservatives flood elected office. \"Because we are resisting, we are winning on these progressive issues, they are trying to take that power away from us.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org. I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\n\nHistoric ballot measures enshrining the right to an abortion passed in seven states: Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, Montana, Maryland, New York and Missouri, where voters backed a measure in Missouri that will overturn one of the strictest abortion bans in the country that prohibits the procedure even in cases of rape and incest. Missouri was the first state to enact an abortion ban after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. In Arizona, voters approved Prop 139 by a landslide, establishing a fundamental right to abortion and prohibiting state officials from restricting or banning abortion before 24 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nSimilar ballot proposals failed in three states: South Dakota, Nebraska and Florida, where a measure that would have rolled back the state's six-week abortion ban fell just short of the 60% needed to pass. They changed the rules to have to require a supermajority. It got something like 57 to 58% of the vote.\n\nIn other ballot initiative news, Arizona voters passed a contested measure that would allow state and local law enforcement to arrest immigrants suspected of crossing the U.S.-Mexico border outside of ports of entry, while empowering state judges to order deportations. The measure, which creates a series of new state crimes targeting immigrants, is modeled after a Texas law, known as S.B. 4, currently under review by the Supreme Court.\n\nThree ballot measures that would have legalized recreational use of marijuana in Florida, North Dakota and South Dakota failed.\n\nIn labor rights, Alaska and Missouri approved measures increasing the minimum wage. Both measures would require employers to provide sick leave, while establishing a minimum wage of $15 per hour. In California, voters have passed a so-called tough-on-crime ballot initiative that rolls back parts of a progressive law approved by voters in 2014, which downgraded several nonviolent crimes to misdemeanors. Prop 36 will make shoplifting a felony for repeat offenders and increase penalties for drug charges.\n\nWe go now to Chris Melody Fields Figueredo. She is executive director of the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center in D.C.\n\nCan you talk about what passed, what didn't, and what issues voters care about, Chris?\n\nCHRIS MELODY FIELDS FIGUEREDO : Yeah. I mean, I think you gave a really great summary, Amy. And I think, really, it's important for folks to know that the majority of Americans do support abortion rights and reproductive freedom, and that is some glimmer of hope for us to hold onto. Even in Florida, 57% of the vote, that's the majority of Floridians who said no to the extreme abortion ban. And there was so much hard work and organizing by incredible organizations in that state, that has been doing that work for two years against all the odds, against the state, the governor, trying every single thing in their power to stop Amendment 4 in Florida.\n\nAnd I think what we're seeing across the country is similar, sort of these mixed results. But I think what we really have to focus on is the state work that lies ahead of us. You know, we did protect abortion rights. We did do really important things for workers with paid sick and raising the minimum wage in Massachusetts. It looks like the measure to allow unionization of workers from Uber and Lyft is going to be successful in Arizona. They actually stopped the state legislatively referred measure that would have made tip workers make less. And then it looks like we're also good to be able - it's looking good that we're going to win these three marriage equality measures in California, Hawaii and Colorado. Still a little too early in some of the Western states.\n\nSo, you know, I think there is a lot of hope for us, and I think the deep work that is going to be really necessary is to look at the issues, look how people voted for those issues. Maybe they voted at a higher rate to support reproductive freedom than maybe some of the Senate candidates or even the president. So I think those numbers in the next couple of days, as we do deeper analysis, is really getting give us a path and a way forward and really thinking about what are the critical issues that people care about, what were the results, what worked, what didn't work. And that's going to build our path forward.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Chris, would you say that there's been an increase in recent years in the use of ballot initiatives? And to what degree is it underappreciated in terms of a democratic check and balance by the people on the gridlock of government?\n\nCHRIS MELODY FIELDS FIGUEREDO : Listen, we are living in a gerrymandered country, in many states. You think about Ohio, Florida, many states. You know, we have gerrymandered districts. People, grassroots organizations have turned, especially in Republican trifecta states, have turned to ballot measures to show that there is a different vision for their states, for their communities. We have been successful over the last several election cycles to pass progressive policy, from Medicaid expansion to redistricting, even though it did fail in Ohio this year. That is because of the Republican-controlled ballot title board that gave really confusing language. Voters were confused. They thought they were voting to end gerrymandering, and then they turned around and, because of the mis- and disinformation, realized that they should have voted yes for Issue 1.\n\nSo, it is an underappreciated tool, and we get - you know, obviously, I've been listening to the show today, and there's so much focus on the federal election and federal offices and candidates. But I actually think these issues are showing us what people care about. And that is so important for us to think about of what we need to be talking to everyday people, going into communities, understanding them, because they are telling us a different path forward. And because we are resisting, we are winning on these progressive issues, they are trying to take that power away from us.\n\nI think one of the highlights from last night is the fact that in Arizona and North Dakota, the state Legislatures referred ballot measures that would have made it harder for citizens to put issues on the ballot. Voters rejected that. And we've seen that time and time again, is voters like to take this power and this agency. They actually understand their communities sometimes better than, you know, the pundits and folks that, you know, do this for a living. They do. They understand their communities so well. And I think the work forward is also going to be defending direct democracy, making sure that the voter-approved measures around abortion and raising the minimum wage and sick leave - right? - that those are moving forward and implemented. And then we are going to look at a really tough state legislative cycle in states like Missouri, in states like Florida, in states like Ohio, where they are going to try to undermine the will of the people and try to take this powerful tool away from us, when we know this is actually how we stand up and fight back for our communities.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Could you talk about Proposition 131 in Colorado that failed? And this was considered a stealth ranked-choice voting initiative backed by dark money?\n\nCHRIS MELODY FIELDS FIGUEREDO : You know, I think there is a lot of - you know, people are still trying to understand ranked-choice voting, open primaries, top two, top four. There's still a lot of education that needs to be done. I mean, here in Washington, D.C., Initiative 83 looks at - passed, for ranked-choice voting and open primaries. I think there's a lot of information that people don't quite understand. I know that was true also in states like Nevada. But then you have a state like Missouri, you know, that voted yes to stop some of the ramifications of Citizens United .\n\nAnd so, I think, ultimately, what we are going to have to do in the next couple of days is try to do this deeper analysis, not just the hot takes right now, not just looking at exit polls, but really looking at the city level, the county level, who turned out, why they turned out on these different issues and see what influenced them, to understand how we are going to organize moving forward and fight back.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Finally, we just have 10 seconds, but do you think the whole ballot initiative movement will change under the second Trump presidency, with increasing number of judges that he might appoint that would stop this kind of movement?\n\nCHRIS MELODY FIELDS FIGUEREDO : Listen, we've always at BISC believed that this is a fight for our democracy. Every one of these issues are - like, one of the things I have said is the fight for reproductive freedom is the fight for democracy. And so, yes, we are going to have to look at the courts. We are going to have to look at the state legislatures. And that is now us, the people, that will go into state legislatures to fight back, to make sure that this tool is not taken away from us.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Chris, we're going to have to leave it there, Chris Melody Fields Figueredo, executive director of the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center. And that does it for today's two-hour election special. If you missed any hour, go to democracynow.org. Democracy Now! accepting applications for video news production .
